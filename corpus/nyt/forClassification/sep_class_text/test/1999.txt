anglomania a european love affair by ian buruma 304 pp new york random house 2595 in anglomania ian buruma presents the history of an idea the idea of britain which has loomed so large and meant so many different things in the european imagination in recent centuries to some , britain is a land of freedom and tolerance , of magna carta , parliamentary democracy and refuge to political dissidents from voltaire to salman rushdie to others , it is a place of genteel tradition , stable institutions , aristocratic privilege , capitalism , industrial revolution and empire there is the england of karl marx and the england of queen victoria , which , of course , overlapped buruma s meditation is prompted by the process of european unification , which represents the extension of many british ideals stable democratic institutions and free trade and yet , also , potentially the end of british uniqueness the history of anglomania is of more than academic interest for buruma his greatgrandparents were continental european jews who left behind the closed , antisemitic world of bismarck s germany and settled happily in england buruma himself grew up in the netherlands , but has chosen to reside in england after many years living in and writing about asia thus for buruma , the question of england is also a question of personal identity his own and his family s story is artfully woven through the various tales of anglomania , making this both a memoir and a work of intellectual history buruma s history begins with the 18th century and voltaire , who left france for england after spending time in the bastille for his anticlerical and freethinking views and went on to write his letters concerning the english nation , which buruma calls a bible of anglomania for voltaire , england represented a model for the rest of europe combining freedom of speech , religious tolerance , the rational thinking of john locke and isaac newton and political moderation the essence of british freedom for voltaire was the stock exchange a place more venerable than many courts of justice , where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind there the jew , the mahometan and the christian transact together as tho' they all profess 'd the same religion , and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts yet while admiring british political institutions , voltaire regarded british culture as crude and vulgar , preferring the formal elegance of corneille to the raw power of shakespeare many of the very english qualities that voltaire rejected were ones that goethe and the german writers of the late 18th and early 19th century embraced the world of shakespeare s plays was , in goethe s words , a huge , animated fair , and buruma describes how germany adopted shakespeare as virtually its national poet , the great saxon bard unshackled by the aristotelian rules of classical theater , writing with extraordinary power about the human condition for the germans , searching for national unity through language and culture , shakespeare was , as buruma puts it , the nordic genius germans had been waiting for one of the larger themes that emerge in buruma s book is the tension between the voltairean universalist version of anglomania and a nativist form of anglomania , which tended to see england as a kind of fortress island , set apart from the continent , a holdout of celtic and saxon culture , a place where people drive on the wrong side of the road , with customs and traditions that resist the rationalizing tendencies of continental politics after the french revolution , which offered a radical , egalitarian form of democracy , britain s appeal shifted for many europeans , england became both the land of liberty and the bastion of tradition , the one country whose ancien regime consistently survived the upheavals and revolutions that were rocking the monarchies of europe perhaps the strongest single chapter of anglomania is graveyard of the revolution , which describes the lives and attitudes of the many political exiles who settled in england during the 19th century the italians giuseppe mazzini and giuseppe garibaldi , germany s karl marx , the hungarian lajos kossuth and the russian aleksandr herzen ironically , even as london crawled with communists , anarchists and utopian socialists , england remained impervious to revolution buruma writes all radicals in exile wondered why this should be how had britain managed to achieve its peculiar equilibrium , based on a combination of social stability and inequality , of freedom and dull conformity , tolerance and provincial smugness , civility and greed \? in britain , as marx concluded , even the workers were bourgeois britain s respect for tradition guaranteed liberty \( for bombthrowing anarchists as well as for ordinary citizens \) but also blunted the force of revolutionary theories the country s voracious capitalism kept england open to new ideas but made it shy away from ones that would disrupt the economic order gradually , thinkers began to perceive a clear link , rather than a contradiction , between british freedom and stability as herzen , perhaps buruma s favorite exile , observed , the only countries in europe that are tranquil are those in which personal liberty and freedom of speech are the least restricted
the newest addition to the times square neighborhood is a 300foottall steel supporting column for the illuminated signs characteristic of the area , with a 550room hotel added almost as an afterthought the shell of the building , at broadway and 47th street , has been completed and the hotel is expected to go into operation in may it was originally planned as the first planet hollywood hotel , but the bankruptcy filing by the restaurant company in october stopped that plan , although planet hollywood still owns retail condominium space in the building the developers of the project are negotiating with hotel companies to find an operator some temporary signs , including advertisements for sealy mattresses , banana republic and metrocard , are now attached to the tower eventually , they are to be replaced with the animated displays and moving mechanical elements that the industry calls spectaculars i have been thinking of doing a sign tower since 1987 , said robert gladstone of madison equities , one of the principal investors in the project the tower , he said , will provide additional income from sign rentals while still letting him build the hotel as large as allowed by zoning regulations the 340 , 000squarefoot building , which runs 45 feet along broadway and 145 feet along 47th street , consists of four full floors at the base , which is to be used for stores , restaurants and meeting rooms the sign tower starts on top of the fourth floor on a platform facing broadway at about 60 feet above the street and extends upward an additional 240 feet the tower is an internally braced steel truss that is not connected vertically to the reinforcedconcrete hotel the guestroom section of the hotel is shaped like an l on two sides of the tower and is to have signs on the roof whose tops are to be almost 500 feet over street level because of the layout of the hotel , mr gladstone said , none of the windows of the guest rooms will face directly onto signs he said there were 12 guest rooms per floor , with 6 facing north and 6 facing south the unusual design of the building underscores the economic value of the signs that are required by city regulations in the times square area in 1997 , a german investment company , the jamestown group , paid 1 , 000 a square foot for the largely vacant building at 1 times square when fully occupied , highquality office buildings were selling for 300 to 500 a square foot that is because the real value of the building is as a base for the signs that are seen by thousands of tourists each day and by millions worldwide on new year s eve , when the ball signaling the end of the old year is lowered from the building s roof the signs on 1 times square , which is between 42nd and 43rd streets , have been reported to generate 7 million in net income annually mr gladstone said his tower at 47th street was specifically designed for the installation and servicing of the largest heaviest spectaculars made he said the tower was anchored to bedrock 50 feet below the street surface to prevent it from swaying as winds caught the saillike surfaces of the signs excavating the 14 , 000 cubic yards of rock from the site was one of the most difficult parts of the project , which is being managed by j a jonesgmo , a construction company because of performances at the luntfontanne theater on 46th street , drilling and blasting often had to be halted and the landmarked theater carefully monitored for damage the air rights over the theater were added to the hotel site to increase the size of the building inside the sign tower , an elevator system capable of lifting workers and equipment has been permanently installed , and catwalks are being placed every 8 feet vertically so that workers will have a foothold for repairs in addition , a crane is being installed at the top to lift the signs into place the positioning of the tower on the east side of the property means that signs attached to its north face will be visible to anyone traveling south on broadway , because of the setbacks on the building to the north of 47th street housing the morgan stanley dean witter financial services company with the tower and building combined , mr gladstone said , the project will be able to support 70 , 000 to 75 , 000 square feet of signs , the largest such installation in the times square area photo signs on the shell of a new building at broadway and 47th street \( jack manning the new york times \)

los angeles , july 21 a little over a year ago , matt groening had a tough decision to make should his robot s head be square or rounded \? that would not normally be considered a major creative decision in television , but for someone as detailoriented as mr groening he said he spent hours contemplating the question it was one of several crucial choices he had to make to help define his latest animated primetime series , the wellreceived 'futurama adultoriented animated series have become big , in large part because of the success of mr groening s first show , the simpsons , which began in 1990 when mr groening sat down years later to create his next show , a sort of futuristic science fiction sendup , he used much of what he had learned about what works and what does not in this realm of television the veteran took his hardwon experience and created an ensemble of bunglers living in the year 3000 , hoping that such a show would stand out in a crowded animation field futurama is off to a reasonably good start by midseason it was pulling in about 10 million viewers , and most of them were the young men so coveted by advertisers its season ratings \( it is being shown in reruns until the fall \) were well behind the simpsons but ahead of such animated shows as king of the hill , family guy , dilbert , south park and the pj s the journey from conception to animation took a few years , with decisions looming large on issues like whether to give the robot , bender , antennae , how much of a slacker to make his pal , fry , and what kind of nose should grace the lead female character , the strongwilled and sexy alien leela in a wideranging interview , mr groening discussed this delicate decisionmaking process futurama began as a sort of dream project , mr groening said , one in which he could capitalize on his success and build the comedy as he liked still , he had to get fox executives excited , and he said he did so with a sly strategem the way i sold the show was by saying , 'this is the simpsons in the future , ' and dollar signs danced in front of their eyes , mr groening said when they finally saw it , they said , 'this is n't anything like the simpsons' and i said 'yes it is it s new and original' what futurama shares with the simpsons is a slightly twisted sensibility , a pointed but goodnatured satirical approach and a focus on losers but futurama is more of an adventure series there is no domesticity to speak of and it examines the life of a teenager rather than parents and younger children in the same way the simpsons upends the formula of traditional family sitcoms , futurama mocks many of the conventions of science fiction life in the future has often been depicted as militaristic or at least heavily regimented under some sort of strong authority futurama presents a civilian society dominated by commercial interests with plenty of winners and losers a major ambition in assembling futurama , mr groening said , was to create a sort of dream show , to get it all right without anxieties or compromises 'futurama' was an attempt to see if we could duplicate some of the fun and have none of the headaches of 'the simpsons , ' mr groening said that did not happen for starters , there was bender s head the harddrinking and nihilistic robot started out with a squarish one , on the assumption that most robot heads would look that way in the year 3000 but then , mr groening said , bender s was rounded to underscore the fact that he is a misfit , a round peg in a square hole we initially gave him antennas where he would have ears , but we decided it was more effective to make him more streamlined , mr groening said he s not streamlined as a personality , and that s part of what makes him funny it is also what helps make bender believable as a machine who can still be a companion of sorts he knows no guilt , constantly feels sorry for himself and can bend metal some of bender s qualities have yet to be displayed in the series or have not received much attention , although they have been on the writers' minds as they determine how he acts in various situations as a robot with soul , he plays the piano when he is blue , for example according to mr groening s computer file from december 1997 , bender is also a poor chef , proud of his being nonlethal , useful in the kitchen because he wo n't burn he loves to cook but was built without a sense of taste as much as mr groening brooded over the character of bender , the show is essentially about the trials of being a young adult , as seen through the character of fry , the robot s buddy fry is a 20thcentury pizza delivery boy accidentally catapulted into the future after literally stumbling into a time machine amazed by what he finds , he remains , as he was in the 20th century , something of a loser but not too much of a loser in fact , mr groening said , fry has developed into a slightly less farcical character , making a transition from hopeless bungler to bungler with a modest glimmer of hope he has become an exaggerated version of a certain kind of teenager easily distracted , stubborn , a slob , and at times blatantly exuberant about things he loves , like bad television shows bumbling through the future seemed like a nifty alternative to fry s old life back home he was a dropout from coney island junior college , whose cheer at sporting events was , go whitefish !
worldly goods the arts of early pennsylvania , 16801758 , a pathbreaking exhibition at the philadelphia museum of art through jan 2 , is an ambitious show , with more than 350 examples of furniture , textiles , silver , metalwork , ceramics and paintings that were either made in or imported to the colony the diverse objects are arranged in handsome room settings , to show how the furnishings would have been assembled at the time , as well as in displays where similar products made in different places can be compared studying the relationship between the decorative arts and society is perhaps the best way to understand the significance of these works of art , because they reveal the aspirations and habits of the people who produced them the show attempts to correct some misconceptions about the early philadelphia quakers and how they lived the quaker leaders , at least , did not live modestly but in splendor if they wore gray , it was gray silk if they used porringers , they were often silver instead of pewter from 1681 , when charles ii of england granted william penn the charter for pennsylvania , to the mid18th century , the region grew from a sparsely populated dutch and swedish settlement into a large , sophisticated mercantile community led by english quakers penn lured tens of thousands of english and european immigrants to the colony with his promises of religious freedom and personal liberty pennsylvania was a very distinctive place , the scholar richard s dunn writes in the exhibition catalog , because it was the only british colony in america founded on truly visionary principles it was the only pacifist colony , with no armed forces or military defenses , and it was the only colony committed to peace with the indians jack l lindsey , curator of american decorative arts at the philadelphia museum , explained why he organized the worldly goods show most of what has been written is about the 1760 s , the revolutionary war period and after , he said i wanted to examine the tradition of early patronage in philadelphia mr lindsey traces the development of the arts in philadelphia and the surrounding colony of pennsylvania \( which included part of what is today delaware and new jersey \) first he tracked the colony s phenomenal growth in 1681 four ships arrived with 1 , 200 people by 1690 there were 3 , 000 people by 1705 the population was 8 , 000 by 1720 , 45 , 000 by the 1720 s philadelphia was the second biggest city in the colonies penn did not stay in the colony for long , but it thrived without him philadelphia had everything it needed to be a mercantile community , mr lindsey said good land , a tidal river and a deep port it had oak to build ships , excess wheat and livestock , and an industrious populace the quakers were conservative , savvy business people who saw the colony as an investment philadelphia s first major wharf , which was 300 feet long , was built in 1681 by 1690 there were 30 such wharves , mr lindsey noted the city s merchants would go to jamaica and barbados and sell grain , flour and preserved pork there they bought rum , sugar and mahogany and sailed to england , where they bought textiles , fine furniture , silver and porcelains to sell in the colonies it was an enormously lucrative system ships could sell their contents and realize a seventoone profit , mr lindsay said many objects in the show embroidered textiles , silver services , fancy case goods are from private collections and have never been exhibited before other objects have been borrowed from local house museums , each of which has been making a special effort on its tours to point out what has been has lent to the museum and why it is important these house museums include wyck , which is considered philadelphia s oldest standing house \( from 1690 \) cliveden , the chew family s stone summer retreat and the site of the revolutionary war battle of germantown in 1777 and stenton , an early georgian brick house built in 1723 by james logan , william penn s personal secretary in 1699 all are just a short drive north of the museum , in the germantown section of philadelphia the catalog says that by 1690 philadelphia already had a reputation as a good place for artisans to find work most emigrated from europe , some from colonial ports like boston or new york mr lindsey found records of 172 woodworkers active between 1730 and 1761 he said there were 60 silversmiths there by 1740 pennsylvania was the fastest growing colony in 18thcentury north america , mr dunn writes the scotchirish came from northern ireland , the catholic irish from southern ireland and the germans from the rhine region more than 40 , 000 germans and 30 , 000 irish sailed to philadelphia between 1726 and 1755 there seemed to be plenty of work all the immigrant groups farmed and worked in shipbuilding the germans wove linen and wool and became ironsmiths the highly trained french huguenots , who fled france after the revocation of the edict of nantes in 1685 , fashioned baroqueinspired silver services prosperity and expansion set the stage for widespread support of the arts at almost every level of society , mr lindsey writes in the catalog the desire for stylish luxuries fueled the demand for imported goods and inspired both urban and rural artisans to develop the skills to rival foreign craftsmanship the settlers' ingenuity was impressive caspar wister , a german immigrant who was friendly with benjamin franklin , opened a brass button factory in 1717 , then created a glassworks in 1739 in 1730 william branson established a furnace to make castiron stoves and firebacks furniture makers apprenticed with englishtrained cabinetmakers from boston or london they learned how to combine fancy mahogany from the west indies with local , humbler woods like poplar , cedar or pine they made document boxes , spice boxes , chests for textiles , high chests , dressing tables , tea tables and , eventually , tall case clocks there were few makers of ceramics potters made red ware for cooking and storage vessels , as well as some stoneware but as mr lindsey put it , none of the local productions threatened england s supremacy in the american market he added that dutch , english and chinese ceramics probably made up the majority of the early imports the exhibition shows how families combined homemade goods with prized imports , like books , globes , charts and measuring instruments an even better way to appreciate the complexity of their lifestyle is to see the exhibition in the morning , then visit wyck , cliveden and stenton in the afternoon then you , too , will be tempted to say , on the whole , i 'd rather be in philadelphia photo a secretary desk and bookcase , circa 1740 , in the worldly goods show at the philadelphia museum \( philadelphia museum of art \)
buffeted by criticism from some of her own supporters , hillary rodham clinton acknowledged yesterday that she had mishandled her effort to distance herself from president clinton s offer of clemency to members of a puerto rican terrorist group the first lady said she should have consulted hispanic leaders in new york before suddenly calling for the white house to withdraw the clemency offer i have to admit that the consultation was not what it should have been , mrs clinton , who is likely to run for the united states senate next year , said yesterday during a conference of hispanic , asian and black women in manhattan and that will never happen again the first lady s acknowledgment of error was narrowly drawn , suggesting she believed that the mistake was not her position on the issue itself , but rather how she handled the political preparation that often precedes such an announcement even so , it is unusual for a candidate to admit such a misstep , and her comments came as she faced a third straight day of questions about an issue that has emerged as the first major challenge to her probable candidacy several democrats said her trouble served as a reminder that whatever strengths mrs clinton brings to next year s senate race , she is a novice candidate a more experienced candidate , several democrats said yesterday , would have made certain to forewarn supporters who might be angered by the decision , in hope of at least blunting any criticism they might offer so far , at least , mrs clinton s handling of the issue seems to have satisfied no one her opposition to the clemency has been denounced by puerto rican leaders , who described her gesture as a betrayal and opponents of mr clinton s clemency offer , who had orchestrated a rising chorus that apparently convinced mrs clinton that she had to act , have dismissed her statement as an insincere maneuver mr clinton offered last month to commute the sentences of 16 members of the puerto rican independence group known as faln , provided that the prisoners renounced violence eleven of them accepted the conditions and were released yesterday the faln has been linked to about 130 bombings in the 1970 s and 80 s , which resulted in six deaths and scores of injuries none of the prisoners offered commutation were charged in any crimes that led to injury or death at first , mrs clinton , who has said she knew little about the case until after her husband made his announcement , said she supported the prisoners' release provided that they met the condition of renouncing violence a week ago , with criticism of mr clinton and the first lady rising among republicans and democrats , the first lady issued a statement saying that the prisoners had been given ample time to respond and calling on the white house to rescind the offer as it turned out , though , the white house had sent a letter to a lawyer for the prisoners the night before mrs clinton made her statement , setting a oneweek deadline , which ended yesterday , for accepting the terms and renouncing violence if mrs clinton was hoping to mend relations with some new york hispanic leaders with her expression of regret yesterday , she did not appear to have done so representative jose e serrano , the bronx democrat who is the senior puerto rican member of congress , said he had not talked to the first lady since before she announced her position and that he first learned about her latest statement from a reporter mr serrano , who last week said he was no longer encouraging mrs clinton to enter the race for senate , said he was not moved it was not just an issue of consultation , he said i did not want her to come out and rescind the order as he spoke , mr serrano said he was watching on television as the first of the puerto rican prisoners who had met mr clinton s demand walked out of prison what did she really say \? he said she did n't say , 'i'm glad they are going home' mrs clinton spoke at the third annual world of women leaders conference in new york , appearing before a collection of organizations representing hispanic , black and asian women she received an enthusiastic reception and addressed a number of issues of concern to women that are likely to be central to the campaign ahead but afterward , state senator olga a mendez , a democrat from the bronx who is puerto rican , said she remained distressed it was a horrible blunder , she said she is an intelligent woman she has to learn the rules we are very hurt we puerto ricans are very hurt nonetheless , ms mendez , who supported mayor rudolph w giuliani when he ran for reelection in 1997 , said she was still undecided on whom she might support in a contest between mrs clinton and mr giuliani the rev al sharpton aligned himself yesterday with mr serrano , and said mrs clinton s public statement was insufficient she needs to call joe serrano , he said and she needs to say to joe serrano what she said today that she would never do that again she needs to make repairs with him mr sharpton said that mrs clinton s handling of the issue suggested that she and her campaign advisers were not prepared to deal with the complicated world of ethnic politics in new york it s ineptness on the part of her advisers , he said it shows again her advisers do not know how to deal with new york and the leadership in new york photo hillary rodham clinton conceded yesterday in manhattan that she should have alerted hispanic leaders in new york before taking a stand against clemency for members of a puerto rican terrorist group \( marilynn k yee the new york times \) \( pg b4 \)
moscow , oct 17 the american who brought consumer capitalism to russia 40 years ago came back for a visit last week to the reports of bribery and money laundering , to the mercedesful of impeccably suited thugs , to the political wars among the lapdog newspapers and television networks of toowealthy tycoons , to the throngs of street urchins and dumpsterminers trampled in the stampede to wealth all in all , he said , it could have been worse the changes are unbelievable , said donald m kendall people keep talking about crime and corruption and not about the amazing things that have happened here you ca n't believe the merchandise in the stores and the shopping centers go out on the street and look at the traffic jams , at the cars they 're not just mercedes the changes here go deeper than that even to dream about such things a decade ago , he said , would have been absolutely impossible it is tempting to many to write off russia s experiment with capitalism thus far as a waste of a decade , or even a net loss mr kendall is that rarest of americans , not to mention native muscovites someone who still believes that the russian glass is half full more specifically , he believes it is half full of pepsicola for mr kendall will forever be known for making pepsi the first american consumer product on soviet restaurant menus and store shelves as a rising executive at the pepsicola corporation in 1959 , mr kendall bucked his elders and set up fountain dispensers at sokolniki park in moscow , where the soviet leader nikita s khrushchev and vice president richard m nixon were about to christen the first american trade exhibition ever held in the soviet union i went to nixon the night before , at the embassy , and told him i was in a lot of trouble at home because people thought i was wasting pepsi s money coming to a communist country , mr kendall said the other night at a moscow reception sponsored by the company i told him that somehow , i had to get a pepsi in khrushchev s hand mr kendall got far more than he could have imagined the next day , sokolniki was the scene of the famous fingerwagging kitchen debate between mr khrushchev and mr nixon mr kendall now recalls watching , transfixed , as the two men verbally slugged it out over the merits of capitalism and communism in midlefthook , mr nixon steered mr khrushchev to the pepsi pavilion for sips of cola , some made with american water and some with russian mr khrushchev declared the moscow version clearly superior and ordered everyone around him to partake pepsi reaped a publicity windfall the company s elders never expected mr kendall became ceo in 1965 a decade after that he negotiated a monopoly for pepsi on cola sales with mr khrushchev s successors that stood until the soviet union fell eight years ago and mr kendall , who was merely seeking a toehold on a market his archnemesis , cocacola , had not penetrated , discovered something more an affinity for russia that has become a personal cause , and a conviction that however bad things seem now , they will get better in that sense , his presence in moscow last week for a slightly belated celebration of the july anniversary of the sokolniki event , may have been a tonic although the occasion was marked by a banquet in the kremlin palace and speeches by ambassador james collins and others , it is safe to say that neither side feels a lot like celebrating americans , burned by russia s 1998 economic crash and intimidated by the scale of corruption , have reined in their business dealings here russians feel humiliated by privation and are seething over the american brouhaha about corruption a problem they say americans ignored as long as it benefited them one of those russians , georgi arbatov , dined last week with mr kendall , the former russian ambassador to the united states anatoly dobrynin , and other veterans of the pepsi era of good feeling mr arbatov , a familiar face to cold war americans as director of the institute for uscanada studies , takes a more dyspeptic view of things mr kendall is a friend and a smart businessman , he said in a long interview last week , but his analysis of russia s future is distinctly rosecolored shock therapy was a complete disaster for russia , mr arbatov said , using the shorthand for the effort to convert russia overnight to a capitalist system there is tremendous polarization on one side people have luxury cars and overseas bank accounts on the other living standards have dropped tremendously we were tremendously ideological ideology was like a religion and suddenly , we lost the ideology , and the only god that exists is the greenback mr kendall allowed that it is important to acknowledge the failures , and just as important to remember that the united states also has had its share of robberbaron tycoons , mafias , economic panics and corruption scandals now retired for 13 years as the head of pepsico inc , mr kendall is

east meadow , ny , june 7 faced with an order from a federal judge and a growing number of class action suits , the nassau county jail has ended its practice of stripsearching people who are charged with misdemeanors and minor crimes , lawyers and jail officials have said the change in policy was disclosed late friday , three days after a ruling in federal district court in hauppauge by judge leonard d wexler the judge found that the nassau county correctional center s blanket practice of stripsearching everyone admitted to the jail , whether their arrests were on felony or nonfelony charges , was unconstitutional , unless there was reasonable suspicion that they might be carrying a concealed weapon or drugs the county , which had 60 days to comply , said it would adhere to the judge s ruling but would appeal we 're doing everything possible to make sure our policy fully complies with the judge s decision , the nassau county sheriff , joseph jablonsky , said yesterday as of now , we are no longer stripsearching nonfelons , unless there is a reasonable suspicion that they are carrying concealed weapons or contraband i'm very disappointed with the judge s ruling , sheriff jablonsky added i feel it jeopardizes the security of the institution but we will abide by his decision we are working on the wording of the jail s new policy , and it will soon be distributed to every member on staff so there will be no loose ends the nassau jail handles 14 , 000 inmates a year about 10 to 20 percent of the approximately 1 , 800 inmates housed on any given day are there on nonfelony charges , officials said in a 13page decision , judge wexler found that the stripsearch of ray e shain of williston park , after his arrest in july 1995 on charges of harassing his wife , was illegal on learning that the jail had adopted the judge s ruling , mr shain , a 43yearold lawyer , said it s been a long battle , but well worth it encouraged by the ruling , mr shain s lawyer , robert l herbst , filed a class action suit on thursday the lead plaintiff is gardy augustin , 24 , of uniondale , who was arrested by the nassau county police on april 27 , 1997 , for driving with a suspended license , a nonfelony offense mr augustin was subsequently admitted to the county jail , where he was stripsearched without inquiry into the nature of the charges and the circumstances of his arrest and without any reasonable suspicion that he was concealing weapons or contraband of any kind on his person , mr herbst said , in papers filed last week in federal district court in brooklyn the case was assigned to judge denis hurley of the eastern district court in hauppauge another class action suit had been filed in the same court several days earlier by matthew d brinckerhoff , a lawyer for francis o 'day , 40 , who was arrested on dec 3 , 1998 , at the home of his estranged wife in glen head on charges of violating an order of protection mr o 'day was stripsearched at the jail before and after his arraignment , even though a judge ordered him released on his own recognizance when it was found that the order of protection had expired , mr brinckerhoff said both suits , which mr brinckerhoff and mr herbst said would probably be merged into one single civil rights class action suit , were expected in light of judge wexler s ruling , according to paul f millus , the lawyer representing the county we 're preparing a response to the first suit , and we 're prepared to defend against all of them , he said meanwhile , he said , the county was acting as quickly as possible to satisfy judge wexler we are moving along in good faith to resolve these matters , pending our appeal we are treating this as a law enforcement and crime issue , not just a safety issue this is another incident where civil rights are being extended to people who have committed crimes or alleged crimes , and we are doing our best to try to keep things in order and safe at the jail the class action suits could be joined by any of the estimated 4 , 200 people admitted to the jail for nonfelony offenses and stripsearched during the last three years , said mr brinckerhoff , whose law firm , emery , cuti , brinckerhoff abady , of manhattan , has also filed a class action lawsuit against new york city , where , he claims , about 63 , 000 people were illegally stripsearched during 10 months in 1996 and 1997 none of the nassau lawsuits cite a specific figure for damages , which will be decided by a jury last month , a federal jury ordered new york city to pay 5 million to a woman who was stripsearched by jail guards it marked the first decision against the city during the 10month period of its blanket stripsearch policy the city is planning an appeal photo ray e shain sued for being stripsearched after he was arrested in 1995 on a charge of harassing his wife a judge has said the search was illegal \( rebecca cooney for the new york times \)
tokyo , sept 6 in recent weeks , north korea has watched attentively as pulses in the region quickened over its threat to test fire a longrange missile just as suddenly , the government in pyongyang has made conciliatory noises , lowering the temperature and leading many in washington , tokyo and seoul to feel that their fears of imminent trouble had perhaps been misplaced so when talks between the united states and north korea get under way in berlin on tuesday , the first thing american diplomats will want to determine is which north korea shows up will it be the one that threatens to mete out merciless retaliation upon its enemies \? or will it be the nation of starving millions that has grudgingly accepted the extended hand of international aid \? the united states says the berlin talks are intended to emphasize the advantages to north korea of toning down its threatening behavior , and in particular of shelving its plan to test its newest longrange rocket , the taepodong 2 the rocket may have a range up to 6 , 000 miles , enabling it to hit hawaii and parts of alaska the united states treated the missile test as a foregone conclusion as recently as a month ago but the unrelenting international pressure , together with inducements offered to north korea , have led washington to sound a far more optimistic tone last week , for example , a state department spokesman , james foley , said , some of the public statements by the north koreans have given us hope that north korea is taking seriously the path to better relations with the us and the international community the trouble is that given north korea s extreme isolation , it is difficult to know what drives its leaders toward more conciliatory postures and history indicates that such postures never last long in the specific case of north korea s seeming turnaround on the missile testing , the ledger of inducements for cooperation and penalties for provocation are both piled high american officials will not discuss their offers to the north , but it is widely thought that the united states is ready to increase food and perhaps other agricultural aid and to raise the level of american representation at talks with the north there has also been talk of easing the american trade embargo on north korea south korea , meanwhile , has indicated that it would speed up the much delayed construction of a nuclear power plant in the north , part of an agreement from previous talks with north korea that were aimed at preventing the country from developing nuclear weapons japan , too , has made noises about improving relations , presumably through increased aid , if north korea does not test fire a new missile none of those factors loom as large , however , as the penalties that north korea would be likely to suffer by testing its new missile japan has discussed ending financial backing for the nuclear power plant , and political pressure has risen sharply in japan to suspend lucrative remittances by koreans living in japan estimates of the value of the remittances range from 250 million to 600 million a year likewise the south korean president , kim dae jung , could be forced to suspend tourist visits from his country such tourism could earn north korea 942 million by 2004 the most imponderable source of pressure , but possibly the most important , may come from north korea s last ideologically sympathetic patron china keeping north korea afloat with fuel and grain shipments and other aid is already expensive for china watching north korea launch missiles that would spur japan to increase its military spending and to work with washington on a theater missile defense might be more than china is willing to bear on the one hand the japanese have really decided to do something about the remittances if there is a launch , and the north korean leadership is able to live quite well because of these remittances , said james kelley , president of the pacific forum of the center for strategic and international studies on the other hand , the chinese must know that there is no chance of putting off the theater missile defense if the north koreans launch other regional analysts , however , dismiss the notion that foreign pressure has had much effect and describe the missile threat and apparent pullback as part of a deliberate north korean game of provocation and brief detente those analysts say that whatever concessions north korea wins at the talks this week will surely be followed by disturbing new incidents to press a new round of demands if north korea decides not to launch the missile , it is because it has decided it has additional leverage to gain from not launching , said chuck downs , author of a recent book called over the line north korea s negotiating strategy but we cannot be at all assured that there will not be some kind of additional new tensionbuilding incidents , he said the goal for them is to keep a threering circus going
washington , sept 8 attorney general janet reno has selected john c danforth , a former republican senator from missouri , to lead an independent reexamination of the teargas assault on the branch davidian compound by the federal bureau of investigation in 1993 , officials said today after a hurried sevenday search , ms reno met with mr danforth today to discuss the scope of his inquiry she is to announce his appointment on thursday earlier today , when mr danforth was interviewed by fox news after his arrival in washington , he said the inquiry would be very daunting of his negotiations with the justice department , he said , we 've got to tie up some loose ends , but he did not discuss any details mr danforth , who in his three terms in the senate established a reputation for rectitude and independence , is said by officials to have sought and received a broad authority to look into any aspect of the final assault on the compound near waco , tex , on april 19 , 1993 mr danforth , a former attorney general of missouri , will also have full prosecutorial powers to compel testimony , demand documents and convene a federal grand jury if necessary ms reno turned to mr danforth after recent disclosures badly undercut her credibility by showing , despite the fbi s denials , that bureau agents had fired teargas rounds capable of starting a fire into a concrete bunker near the sect s compound ms reno s choice of mr danforth is an effort to quell bitter republican criticism , which grew louder today when senator trent lott of mississippi , the majority leader , called on ms reno to resign mr lott and other republicans have sharply criticized ms reno in the past for her refusal to have an independent counsel investigate democratic fundraising in the 1996 campaign and other issues but never before had mr lott called on her to step down today mr lott noted those controversies and president clinton s decision to offer clemency to 16 imprisoned puerto rican nationalists based on the pattern now that has developed over six and a half years , he said , and the events involving not only the appointment of independent counsels but refusals to provide information on questions by the congress , the problems with the waco investigation , the situation with the puerto rican pardons , all of that leads me to conclude that the attorney general should resign but democrats rallied to her side senator tom daschle of south dakota , the democratic leader , said i think janet reno deserves commendation , not criticism she has done an extraordinary job under very , very difficult circumstances seven days ago , it was disclosed that for more than six years the fbi failed to say that it had infrared videotapes that clearly showed that agents had obtained approval to fire the tear gas rounds when ms reno learned of the tapes , she had united states marshals retrieve them from the fbi the use of the canisters had been revealed several days earlier for six years , ms reno had said in news conferences and congressional testimony that the government had done nothing in the 51day davidian siege that could have ignited the deadly fire ms reno , who took responsibility for the government s actions , has steadfastly blamed the branch davidian leader , david koresh , and his followers for starting the blaze , which killed about 80 people , including many children none of the new evidence indicates that ms reno withheld information from congress or that the fbi intentionally misled anyone , although the bureau has yet to explain how the evidence remained unnoticed in the files of the hostage rescue team , which carried out the assault the new information has prompted republican lawmakers to plan hearings that could conflict with mr danforth s review by focusing on the same witnesses and evidence but today , representative henry j hyde , the illinois republican who heads the house judiciary committee , said that if the justice department cooperated with the danforth inquiry , he would withhold his bill to establish a fivemember commission to study the assault the house government reform committee , headed by representative dan burton , republican of indiana , has , however , issued subpoenas for hearings senator orrin g hatch , the utah republican who is chairman of the senate judiciary committee , has said he also plans to hold hearings photo to senate colleagues , admiring or annoyed , john danforth was saint jack man in the news , page a23 \( associated press \)
it was tragic , recalled mary beth heying , a principal at edward jones company , the brokerage firm in st louis in april , an employee had complained to the human resources department after receiving an email containing inappropriate material , meaning offcolor jokes , pornography and so on we investigated and found that a large number of associates were involved in distributing such messages , ms heying said depending on the egregiousness of their involvement , she said , the company dismissed 19 , warned 41 and allowed 1 to resign the company has a very clear written policy on email , ms heying said some 2 , 700 of its 17 , 000 employees have email or internet access at work \( none of the brokers do , because written communication is heavily regulated in the brokerage industry \) , and each of the 2 , 700 was given a copy of the policy when receiving email access , ms heying said an american management association survey this year found that 27 percent of companies do what edward jones does monitor internal email up from 202 percent in 1998 in the vast majority of cases , employees are informed of the surveillance there is little dispute that companies have both the power and the legal right to monitor email sent on the company network on company time but there are conflicting ethical imperatives at work when managers consider a monitoring policy on the one hand , to avoid unwarranted intrusions into employees' privacy on the other , to keep unchecked circulation of offcolor jokes and other inappropriate material from creating a hostile atmosphere allan a kennedy , a management consultant and coauthor of the new corporate cultures \( perseus , 1999 \) , starts from the premise that companies that monitor email traffic or use the power of modern technology to act as big brother to the employees are dehumanizing the work environment still , he sees a need for policing email , given how it can expose a company to litigation he says the best approach is to let workers frame the policy an employeebased email monitoring system would not be as disrespectful , he said it would be from one employee to another , saying 'we do n't want to work in an environment where this kind of thing goes on' it 'd be equivalent to the kind of natural monitoring that would have gone on around the water cooler in reality , though , monitoring is rarely continuous far more often it is used only when a company has someone or something to investigate when , as at edward jones , an employee complains about a particular message indeed , laura p hartman , a professor of business ethics at the university of wisconsin , thinks the threat of monitoring may be seen as a strongenough deterrent that companies can spare themselves from much actual monitoring employers are naturally uneasy about unmasking inappropriate email and dismissing offenders but invasion of privacy is n't the root of the unease the distress of firing is most managers dread having to do something so painful to the person across the desk we have a zero tolerance policy with regard to inappropriate email , and people know that , ms heying said does that mean we did n't feel badly about 20 associates \? oh , by all means , we do email takes companies into new ethical territory , as they struggle with controlling a technology so utterly different from other communications tools unlike a phone call or hallway conversation , email leaves an audit trail that can pinpoint the abuser but unlike a paper memo , email moves at lightning speed , both in delivery and in composition , often with little reflection or second thought it will probably be awhile before there is corporate consensus on the fairest balance between privacy and protection until then , the responsibility to do the right thing falls upon employees , who can use common sense as a guide if an employee s passion for email privacy is born of a desire not to have the boss find out he s been placing bids all day for vintage comic books in an online auction , chances are he already knows he should n't be doing that at work in this new hightechnology world , a remarkably oldfashioned rule of thumb applies do n't do what you would n't want to be caught doing drawing \( rose cassano \)
washington , nov 15 congressional republicans agreed tonight to eliminate or change a series of probusiness amendments in the year s last spending bills , even though the measures had been sponsored by their own senators , effectively sweeping away the nexttolast barrier to a final budget deal the amendments , or riders , on the interior department spending bill were fiercely opposed by environmental groups , and tonight the riders were altered or abolished to the satisfaction of the white house , said senior administration officials and a top house republican president clinton said last month that he would veto the bill over the amendments , which he called stealth attacks on the environment a senior white house official said the riders had fallen to public pressure and the sense that the president was n't going to live with them representative c w bill young , the florida republican who is chairman of the house appropriations committee , said , we think the interior issue is settled but he warned , until it is signed , sealed and filed in the house , you ca n't be sure of anything republican leaders in congress and the white house worked tonight on one last multibilliondollar bargain they needed to complete a deal a package of budget cuts and accounting devices , known collectively as offsets , totaling about 7 billion that would cover the costs of new programs the republicans want , along with the spending compromises they struck with the white house in budget negotiations it would also give the republicans political cover by allowing them to say their spending bills did not dip into social security reserves the agreement on the interior department riders was reached during a threeway conference call among the white house budget director , jack lew senator slade gorton , republican of washington , and representative ralph regula , republican of ohio senator gorton , speaking longdistance from his home state , was frustrated by the outcome , said his spokeswoman , cynthia bergman the conversation closed up the things we thought were a huge problem , a senior administration official said among them was a rider allowing mining companies to dump tons of waste on federal land it would have effectively erased a 1997 interior department ruling limiting dump sites to five acres per mine the republicans agreed to let the ruling apply to all applications for mining permits filed after the 1997 ruling , meaning it would cover more than 300 applications so far other mining regulations , which would have been nullified by the riders , will take effect in april they impose new environmental restrictions and financial requirements on mining operations to prevent companies from walking away from playedout mines without cleaning up the surrounding sites tonight s agreement also appears to end a long and hardfought effort by senate republicans on behalf of energy companies the lawmakers sought to block the interior department from making companies pumping oil and gas from federal lands pay royalties based on the market price of the oil some companies set an artificially low price themselves , saving a total of about 5 million a month in fees owed the government the new pricing scheme will go into effect march 15 and republicans said senator robert c byrd of west virginia , the ranking democrat on the senate appropriations committee , had lifted his threat to hold up a budget deal until congress passed a law allowing his state s coal miners to keep dumping waste in valley streams tonight s agreement also eliminated another rider that would have blocked a rule barring new roads in 40 million acres of national forest until 2001 , when the next administration takes power a few republican riders remain one stops the interior department from prohibiting lead mining along the ozark national scenic riverways in missouri another automatically renews grazing permits on federal lands for 10 years while environmental reviews are conducted the final deal also doubled to about 400 million the money that will go to one of president clinton s favorite projects , the lands legacy program , which buys scenic or environmentally sensitive land threatened by development seeking a compromise on foreign aid , senator phil gramm , the texas republican who heads the banking committee , and treasury secretary lawrence h summers have built a framework for providing hundreds of millions of dollars in debt relief for 41 of the world s poorest countries under the deal , the international monetary fund would revalue its gold reserves , increasing their worth and generating a fund to provide aid that congress had denied in earlier budget talks separately , the white house and the republicans also agreed to spend 550 million for those who had heavy losses from flooding after hurricane floyd the money would go directly to north carolina , new jersey and other hardhit states now the republicans and the white house turn to the offsets they renewed their argument tonight in the chambers of the senate appropriations committee republicans want the offsets to include an acrosstheboard cut of less than one percent in all of the 13 spending bills president clinton has already vetoed a 097 percent cut , calling it blind and mindless to sign even a small cut would require considerable backpedaling the white house and the republicans need to agree on the offsets before the budget is finished but they might have to agree to disagree on a key point whether the budget uses social security surpluses the speaker of the house , j dennis hastert , asked the white house for a letter saying the bills do not dip into the retirement funds , but none arrived and he cannot get the congressional budget office to say so contrary to republicans' contention that their bills do not spend a dime of the social security surplus , the budget office says that the republicanwritten bills require 18 billion or more from the retirement fund , a sum that grows with almost every compromise the republicans strike with the white house both sides have all but agreed on how much money the four stillunsettled bills will contain about 314 billion for labor , health and education programs 39 billion for the commerce , justice and state departments and 15 billion each for foreign aid and the interior department despite the debate over offsets tonight , the senate majority leader , trent lott of mississippi , said he thought the spending bills could be passed into law this week i hope so , he said what s the alternative \? photo representative c w bill young , republican of florida , said yesterday that negotiators had agreed on interior department spending \( paul hosefros the new

frankfurt , jan 4 the euro , europe s new single currency , had a nearly flawless debut in world markets today as european financial institutions opened for business without a hitch and the euro climbed in value against other major currencies from london to paris to frankfurt and beyond , stock exchanges and banks opened serenely despite a grueling weekend in which millions of computers had to be reprogrammed to handle euros what we are observing today is the natural and happy birth of the euro , said jeanclaude trichet , the president of the bank of france in its first full day of trading , the euro opened at 117 , climbed to nearly 1186 and by afternoon in new york was trading at 118060 far from being unsettled by the uncertainty or technical glitches , the stock markets in frankfurt , paris , milan and madrid all jumped 5 percent or more britain , which has thus far refused to adopt the euro , had a less euphoric day the ftse stock index ended up roughly even while the pound slipped against the euro on european streets , there was little sign that anything had changed even in downtown frankfurt , which is home to the european central bank , few stores were posting prices in euros at kaufhof , an upscale department store in the city s financial center , signs boasted , we will make you ready for the euro , but none of the prices were listed in euros and plenty of people were befuddled because euros will be usable only for electronic payments until jan 1 , 2002 , some german bank customers did not understand why their banks would not give them euros in cash others were annoyed that banks were suddenly ordering them to identify the currency they were using when writing checks even bank employees were perplexed about how , exactly , to open a bank account denominated in euros this will be a sort of experiment , said monique pouzet , a teller at credit commercial de france in paris , as she opened a binder marked memento euro after a moment s study and a few key strokes , ms pouzet reported with a smile that the experiment was a success you can pick up your euro checkbook in about one week , apparently , she told a customer traders , bankers and government officials warned that it would take several more days to know for sure whether the huge technical conversion was successful but the evidence today pointed toward a remarkably smooth start for the euro and toward its acceptance as a serious competitor to the dollar as an international currency technically , there is absolutely no problem at all , said michael bartmann , a securities dealer on the floor of the frankfurt stock exchange the only problem is that people have to get used to the new numbers trading volumes are very low right now , probably because people need time to get adjusted none of the elaborate dress rehearsals for the euro involved the full range of financial institutions at one time so , although individual institutions seemed to function well today , the real test will come when all of them banks , brokerage firms and settlement systems have had a chance to thoroughly interact with one another in settling accounts , or processing their transactions , after the markets close bank executives said that would take several days of trading before we declare this a complete triumph , let s just wait until the settlement is done of the first few trades , said graham bishop , an economist at salomon smith barney once we have pushed through to the endoftheweek settlements , then people will feel a lot happier peter wolfkoppen , head of euro projects at commerzbank in frankfurt , said there are still two important milestones in front of us one of them comes today when we have to post all the day s transactions to all the accounts the other will be in settling transactions with other institutions one trader in frankfurt commented there is definitely potential for problems what could happen is that you get orders in euros and in marks , and in that case you would see complete chaos we will have to wait and see whether the banks have fully implemented the conversion all in all , both industry executives and european central bankers said the conversion seemed a success most central banks , including the german bundesbank and the bank of italy , said they had received no distress reports during the weekend conversion or today and both big and small financial institutions said the conversion had been easier and faster than they had expected deutsche bank , which had more than 3 , 000 workers on duty over the weekend , said today that it had reprogrammed all its computers by 10 am on sunday in london , merrill lynch , j p morgan and salomon smith barney had wrapped up their work by sunday evening it went absolutely perfectly , much faster than in our dress rehearsals , said detlev rahmsdorf , a spokesman for deutsche bank mitchell shivers , head of merrill lynch s euro conversion project , was equally optimistic it went tremendously and far exceeded our expectations , he said this afternoon in london it s been unprecedented very unusual to see an industry pull together and accomplish something like this
if russia is ever to break free of the heritage that stunts its development , it must overcome its reflexive allegiance to bloodyminded tyrants like slobodan milosevic and saddam hussein as hard as it may be for boris yeltsin , he should use this critical moment in europe to push russia toward an enduring partnership with the west only then can russia hope to build the modern economy and democracy that its people want and deserve there are many reasons that moscow is still dancing with mr milosevic as his forces brutally assault the people of kosovo , but none promise to benefit russia as it struggles to rebuild its dysfunctional economy slavic solidarity , a common antipathy to nato and fervent nationalism may play well in moscow and belgrade , but they are deadend policies for russia making common cause with serbia and belarus is not going to revive the russian economy the preservation of slavic culture , language and identity is an honorable aim , but it is not a productive foreign policy the kremlin s embrace of dictators had a certain ruthless logic during the cold war , when russia was prepared to use whatever repression was required at home and abroad to protect and export its ideology the united states , in the name of advancing democracy , closed ranks with anticommunist tyrants in asia and latin america but seven years after the disintegration of the soviet union , at a time when democracy and economic integration are reshaping the world , mr milosevic and mr hussein are political anachronisms alliance with them brings estrangement from the rest of the world , the last thing russia needs in the case of kosovo , moscow no doubt fears that nato intervention in yugoslavia could lead someday to outside interference in russia s own ethnic conflicts mr yeltsin s brutish attack on chechnya comes to mind but that is a false fear nato well knows that it cannot intervene in russia without igniting a new continental war in europe russia , for all the cruelty of its assault on chechnya , did not conduct a genocidal campaign in the breakaway territory with antiamerican sentiment rising in russia , and parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled over the next 14 months , mr yeltsin may feel he cannot afford to lean away from mr milosevic , even though the russian leader is not seeking reelection himself but the paramount domestic issue in russia is the ailing economy , not kosovo there is little need for moscow to align itself so ardently with belgrade indeed , russia s role as a potential peacemaker would be enhanced if viktor chernomyrdin , mr yeltsin s special envoy for the balkans , were free to tell mr milosevic that the serbian offensive in kosovo is intolerable mr milosevic might listen more closely to diplomatic proposals if moscow declared that he must allow ethnic albanians to return home under the protection of an international force of armed peacekeepers mr chernomyrdin said yesterday that mr milosevic had agreed to such a force when they talked in belgrade this week , but the yugoslav government insisted that only unarmed peacekeepers had been discussed russia s future development has little to do with kosovo and a great deal to do with how moscow manages relations with the united states and europe in the near term , russia desperately needs 45 billion in loans from the international monetary fund , assistance that is likely to be approved soon if the fund is satisfied that the government budget is responsible but that is just a fraction of the foreign capital and commerce that russia will need to attract over the next decade if it is to build a new and prosperous economy slobodan milosevic is not going to be a big contributor

paramus , nj , june 27 as theater 1 at the loews cineplex filled for an afternoon showing of star wars episode i the phantom menace , peter melnyk , a movie projectionist for 28 years , repeated the timeworn ritual of his trade , spraying air into the innards of a 1960 s vintage movie projector to clear dust before lacing the film through its spools but this time , he and the bakedenamel and chrome century projector were just there as a backup in this theater , the loews meadows 6 in secaucus , and two theaters in suburbs of los angeles , george lucas s hightech hit was projected from a computer hard drive by a technician wielding a mouse on june 18 , mr lucas and 20th century fox began these special fourweek runs of the movie to test two new competing types of digital projectors , which use banks of hard drives , microchips , prisms and liquid crystal arrays to beam a film onto a standard screen without the seven heavy reels of film and the unavoidable accumulation of dust flecks , scratches , and pops that come with using a centuryold medium as the audience from the 1 pm show filtered out of the theater , viewers most of whom had already seen the standard version of the film gushed over what they had just seen you 're making no friends at kodak , john rybacki , a viewer , said during a tour of the projection booth led by kevin romano , a cofounder of cinecomm digital cinema , the company that made the digital copies of the film i saw it the oldfashioned way , and this just blows it away , said mr rybacki , who is a video technician from norwood , nj another film , an ideal husband , produced by miramax films , is being shown until july 15 using the digital projection method at the clearview chelsea 9 in manhattan and at the laemmle sunset 5 in los angeles in 5 to 10 years , many film industry experts say , digital cinema is likely to begin replacing film reels the technology will allow the industry to distribute movies from studios to theaters via coded satellite links , avoiding the high cost and delay of making thousands of prints of a new movie and shipping them across the country carl goodman , the curator for digital media at the american museum of the moving image in queens , said that a digital screening for directors and cinematographers there in may aroused admiration he said the shift to digital technology at both ends of the movie business making them and showing them is an inevitable part of a larger shift in all electronic entertainment , similar to the move from scratchprone lp s to cd s gordon radley , the president of lucasfilm ltd , said the decision to unveil digital projection to the public came after mr lucas decided the digital projectors were as good as existing film projectors in many ways and far superior in others at a sidebyside screening of film and digital versions of the phantom menace for movie business executives and journalists in los angeles in midjune , he said , half of the audience could not guess which was which miramax , which is also eager to shift to digital pictures , decided to hold its own screenings , said mark gill , president of miramax s los angeles division mr gill said the company chose a traditional film , a period piece with many subtle cinematographic touches , so that audiences would understand that the method can be used with any movie 'an ideal husband' is the antithesis of a digital movie , he said the industry has already realized the business benefits of the new projection method when a movie is an unexpected hit , like the full monty , cinemas in small towns will no longer have to wait for one of the few remaining copies to be shipped to them and when a movie is a boxoffice bomb , like godzilla , there will be no wasted cost in making piles of prints , at up to 2 , 000 apiece , with no cinemas interested in showing them , said michael targoff , the chairman and chief executive officer of cinecomm , which is jointly owned by qualcomm inc and hughesjvc his company made the digital copies of the star wars film that are being shown in paramus and winnetka , calif , using projectors made by hughesjvc technology a competing digital projection system , made by texas instruments , is being tested in secaucus , nj , and burbank , calif the systems will not immediately show up in the largest theaters , like manhattan s ziegfeld , industry experts said , because of limitations on how far digital images can be projected but , they added , there will probably be no limit to where they can be used in the near future engineers are also still working on matching the quality of 70 millimeter movies , which have negatives twice as wide as those in a conventional 35 millimeter print the buzz has already been spreading the digital showing of the phantom menace in paramus attracted amateur technofiles from as far away as maryland , said the staff at the theater studio executives from sony and disney , as well as owners of other theater chains , also visited to gauge audience interest and assess the quality of the picture , said mr romano of cinecomm it will be shown at the theater until july 15
they said they never really meant it , just kidding , or something like that so they think they deserve a doover except not only is there no crying in baseball but there are also no doovers the umpires' mass resignation , which could go down as one of the most illconceived labor strategies , was merely a symbolic gesture the umpires were not actually seeking to or threatening to terminate their employment that is what the union s lawyers told the national labor relations board in asking the board to extricate the union from this fine mess alluding to the resignations of more than 50 umpires of the 66member union , the lawyers said it was a stretch to conclude that seveneighths of the bargaining unit , actually intended to sever their employment with the leagues unfortunately for the umpires , the leagues did n't get the joke twentytwo umpires , a third of the membership , will lose their jobs at midnight wednesday therein lies another misstep by the umpires in their july 14 letters , the umpires said their resignations were effective sept 2 , which is thursday but they did n't specify that they were resigning after the games of sept 2 , so their employers have determined that unemployment for the terminated 22 will begin at the start of that day , depriving them of an extra payday it would all seem like a leslie nielsen farce if the consequences were n't so terrible for the umpires who are losing their jobs after laboring 17 years in the minor leagues , ed hickox was finally added to the american league staff this season , and he wo n't even finish it paul nauert spent 11 years working his way up to a fulltime position with the national league , which he gained this year he wo n't have a full first season either among the 22 umpires are men with young children and men who are presumably too old to start new careers there are men who have spent most of their adult lives as major league umpires jim evans , 52 years old , 28 years in the al greg kosc , 50 , 24 years in the al joe west , 46 , 22 years in the nl eric gregg , 48 , 23 years in the nl and there are some of the highestrated umpires richie garcia in the al , frank pulli in the nl and some of the lowestrated ken kaiser and dale ford in the al , gregg and west in the nl then there is the truly saddest case of all drew coble , a highly rated al umpire , who is losing his job and his wife , who is dying of cancer the nlrb , which saved the 1995 baseball season and perhaps the sport as well , is not expected to take any action this week to try to save the umpires' jobs labor experts believe the board will find no merit in the union s charges , at least none for it to act on the terminated 22 will become a subject for negotiation in bargaining for a new labor agreement , although the union has become so split the umpires may find it difficult , if not impossible , to adopt a unified bargaining position but the departing umpires ca n't count on any act of compassion by major league baseball if there was one thing officials wanted to gain in the coming negotiations , it was control but they do n't have to fight for it on that fateful day in philadelphia , the umpires handed it to them relationships among the umpires will never be the same a man not involved in this crisis recently related a conversation he had with an umpiring crew if those four umpires are typical , they have no idea how they got to where they are , their visitor said they 're mystified they do n't know who to believe , who to trust from out of nowhere in his first season as a starting pitcher with the houston astros last season , jose lima gained a careerhigh 16 victories with a month of starts remaining in his second season , lima has 17 victories , not only the most in his career but also the most in the national league to think any of us are smart enough to take a player who has been picked over by many clubs and see him become an allstar the next year , gerry hunsicker , the astros' general manager , said without finishing the sentence but also without taking credit for the discovery of lima the righthander came to the astros from detroit in a 10player trade in december 1996 after having spent the second half of each of the preceding two seasons with the tigers as a starter in 1995 , lima had a 39 record and 611 earned run average primarily a reliever in '96 , he had a 56 record and 570 era in hunsicker s opinion , lima was a kid who was initially rushed to the big leagues before he was ready , put in a negative environment , put on a bad club in a hitters' ball park he had a good arm and a good changeup , hunsicker added , but the environment he was in was n't conducive to his development the trade , the general manager said , put lima in a pitchers' park and gave him a manager and a pitching coach who are good teachers lima obviously was a good student , though the astros almost did n't find out how good we almost released him last spring , hunsicker said , speaking of march 1998 he was horrible last spring he made our rotation by default the week before the season started we called him into the office and told him we were taking him out of the rotation to start the season and outlined a list of things he had to do to get better two days before the season began , pete schourek went down with an elbow injury we had to put schourek on the disabled list and lima took his place in the rotation by default , hunsicker said that s how smart we are winning by avoiding slumps
the best american short stories of the century edited by john updike and katrina kenison 775 pp boston houghton mifflin company 28 even in american cities , which seem so much alike , where people seem all to be living the same lives , striving for the same things , thinking the same thoughts , there are still individuals a little out of tune with the times so begins willa cather s marvelous double birthday , a story about a man who has spent his inheritance on opera tickets and travel , and in consequence has become one of those people whom one is a little embarrassed to meet , because they have not got on as they should it s a prohibition story that turns on the gift of some longcellared wine , and it went uncollected in its author s lifetime none of the cather fans i talked to had ever heard of it now it can be found in the best american short stories of the century , edited by john updike and katrina kenison a millenniumend s celebration not only of the short story but of the series called best american short stories , in whose annual volumes each of the present anthology s choices once appeared finding wonderful stories that you do n't already know is one of this collection s great pleasures add to double birthday martha gellhorn s miaminew york and alice elliott dark s in the gloaming but much of the book s interest lies in seeing how little has changed since the series began in 1915 naturally , there are shifts in subject , but generalizations about changes in form seem harder to sustain either the sample from any one period is too small or at this level of achievement all fashion and formula fade away that opening quotation from cather could serve to describe more than half of the 55 stories here it also stands as a letterperfect precis of the theory of the short story developed by frank o'connor in the lonely voice for o'connor , the short story is defined not by its length but by its concern with those on the margins of society its interest depends on what he called the little man , on noting the strangeness of behavior of those who find themselves astray in an unfamiliar society , even if that society happens to be their own cather s protagonist seems content enough with his small job and his piano , but many of the collection s other pieces suggest the truth of o'connor s claim that the short story offers something we do not often find in the novel an intense awareness of human loneliness so the farmcountry isolation of susan glaspell s story a jury of her peers finds an echo at the end of the century in e annie proulx s halfskinned steer , and the deathbed reveries of mary lerner s little selves are matched by the cancerdriven rage of thom jones s i want to live ! dramatic monologues appear throughout the century , and sometimes monologue shades over into case study , an exploration of experience s outer limits , as in raymond carver s where i'm calling from or jean stafford s thirdperson narrative the interior castle , in which a woman s sense of self is maintained by lying helplessly on the operating table , alone in the fortress of her mind yet the lonely voice is n't a condition of american life so much as it is of the genre itself short stories speak to those aspects of experience in which that loneliness seems most acutely felt their frame of reference can never , in o'connor s words , be that of society as a whole , or even the totality of a human life , and so their tendency is to depend instead on a single moment of peculiar significance this is a moment of isolation that is also in itself an isolated one , a selfcontained 10 or 20 pages and not some unit of a larger whole and though such moments can sometimes appear capriciously chosen or curtailed , that concentration suggests some of the reasons for the short story s endurance the novel remains defined by its encyclopedic ambition yet in a century that begins with the ambassadors and ends with underworld , that may be the only thing about it to have stayed constant the short story seems a more conservative medium , the only literary form , in john banville s words , to have remained largely untouched by modernism but surely that s wrong the story has always been modern , in that it has always been capable of dealing with the symbolic and the extreme , the fragmentary and the inconclusive the very absence of an encyclopedic urge has allowed it to embrace the displaced and the unrepresentative , to deal with the particular and not the typical the little man is not necessarily everyman nevertheless , banville is in one sense right the story s openness has been accompanied by a formal conservatism , a continuing commitment to realism so raymond carver , in introducing the 1986 best american short stories , described himself as drawn toward the traditional \( some would call it oldfashioned \) methods of storytelling not many novelists of similar stature would care to make the same claim and , accordingly , few stories in this book have a form that calls attention to itself the killers , by ernest hemingway , does , though maybe one now needs to read it in historical context to see its startling newness , that story out of which whole libraries of american fiction descend but the only writers here who could comfortably be described by the term experimental are susan sontag and donald barthelme
stand quietly in the middle of the mall or the supermarket and just listen the sounds of the plague are all around you coughing and sneezing , sniffing and blowing we are at the height of the winter cold season the common cold knows no boundaries , respects no one and ignores the seasons if you have the talent , as i do , you can catch a cold in the south of france in august but winter colds are the worst , because they come on you like fate and seem to hang around forever if there is one universal plague on the human race , this is it how many historic disasters were caused by the common cold \? was the captain of the titanic perhaps not feeling quite his best that night \? at yorktown in 1781 , was the british commander , general cornwallis , fully in command of his faculties \? there must be some reason why we ended up with bill clinton instead of queen elizabeth as head of state victims try to dignify their common colds with more impressive names they say it s a virus , it s flu , it s an upper respiratory infection but no , it s just a cold , totally unimpressive and unimportant , except to the sufferer we get no sympathy , and really deserve none people with colds should just stay home and stop spreading the germs around i hate those valiant souls who crawl into the office coughing and sneezing like something out of saddam s biological warfare arsenal , just to show how dedicated they are there s an argument to be made for quarantine of cold sufferers it s estimated that workdays lost through colds cost 17 billion a year keep people from infecting their fellow workers , and that figure might drop all the way to zero cold sufferers seem drawn to public places , especially concerts and movie theaters , where their hacking coughs can best be appreciated if you have n't had your winter cold yet and feel left out of the general malaise , here are some excellent places to go the long island rail road is a hermetically sealed germ incubator if you can survive two rush hours without catching something , your immune system must be working overtime planes are also well designed to make you ill , circulating the same air throughout so that germs are distributed evenly but i have a theory that money is at the root of this , as of so many other human evils just watch the transactions in any store or post office employees , who are often all too obviously in the terminal stages of some infectious disease , count out the notes and coins and place them in your hand at every checkout stands a typhoid mary , passing on the cold virus from one stranger to another if we ever hope to get rid of the common cold , we 'll have to get rid of our dirty money first in other words , it will be around forever , or until cash is entirely replaced by credit a cold takes from 10 days to 10 weeks to run its course there s no cure antibiotics are worse than useless , building up resistance against the day when you get something really nasty vitamin c seems to be about as much use as aspirin once the virus has taken hold , you may as well lie back and enjoy it the only comfort i know is to stay in bed with radio , vcr , pile of good books , some cats and a toddy made up of whisky , hot water , lemon and honey modern technology has given us some small consolations paper tissues are great , and so are those strange green medicines that help us breathe at night but on the whole , it s a rotten medieval kind of disease with no redeeming features i can say with pride that i have played a very small part in the losing battle against the common cold years ago , as an impecunious young writer \( the description still applies , but i'm older now \) , i used to spend weeks at an establishment called the cold research center we were human guinea pigs the researchers learned some things from their experiments on us for example , that you ca n't get a cold by being wet or chilled , or by sitting in a draft the best way to get a cold directly from someone is to shake his hand they also concluded that colds are more or less incurable , because they are not one infection , but about 200 constantly mutating viruses i ca n't imagine that such a perverse disease could have evolved by accident somehow , the common cold must have a deep metaphysical purpose perhaps it was designed to make us suffer for our sins or to remind us of our mortality but , right now , i do n't really care how important the common cold is in the great cosmic scheme of things i 'd just like to meet the person who invented it , and shake his hand drawing \( p c vey \)
washington , june 2 the microsoft corporation once again tried to show in court today that the company was facing potentially lethal competition , even presenting as evidence an email message from one of its employees who called the competitive situation a very scary thing but as a microsoft lawyer , michael lacovara , tried to make the case that the personal computer business was seriously threatened , he first had to get past comments microsoft s chairman , william h gates , made in an interview published by newsweek magazine last month predicting the imminent demise of the personal computer has become an annual ritual , mr gates said well over 100 million pc s will be sold this year that means the world now buys almost as many pc s as color tv s franklin m fisher , the government witness facing crossexamination from mr lacovara today , raised the issue of mr gates s remarks when the lawyer tried to suggest that the operating systems in sony s new play station toy or in the palm pilot personal organizer could pose a threat to microsoft s industrydominating windows mr lacovara , of the sullivan and cromwell law firm , dismissed mr gates s observation , asking , is n't that exactly what you 'd expect mr gates to say publicly , given the nature of microsoft s business \? in preparation for the rebuttal phase of the trial now under way , microsoft subpoenaed thousands of documents from america online , sun microsystems and the netscape communications corporation about the online service s purchase of netscape and sun s cooperative role in the new venture mr lacovara has not hidden microsoft s excitement about what it found in those documents , and he entered a few into evidence today to support his assertion that microsoft faces competitive threats one document , prepared last november by goldman , sachs company , the investment banking firm that managed the netscape acquisition for america online , lays out what goldman took to be the strategic rationale the plan the first point in the plan said the company could extend netscape to be a more comprehensive desktop application , bundling communications and productivity applications to absorb more share of computing time , with the goal of becoming the user s de facto environment mr lacovara also entered into evidence an email message from last july describing a meeting between sun and america online executives in the message , a sun executive said america online planned to begin using a new browser on its service based on java , sun s programming language this , the sun executive wrote , will break the deadly embrace with microsoft america online , the world s largest internet service provider , with some 17 million subscribers , has distributed microsoft s internet explorer web browser with its software since 1997 today s courtroom maneuvers were intended to persuade the judge that microsoft faces competitive threats that could undermine the monopoly position that lies at the heart of the government s antitrust case several documents were entered into evidence under seal , including every document obtained from america online , at the online service s insistence but none of the public documents showed that america online subscribed to any of opinions and plans offered by the documents from goldman and sun in any case , it was not at all clear that any of it made much of an impression on judge thomas penfield jackson , who is hearing the case without a jury after mr lacovara had introduced several of these documents , judge jackson calmly asked him to stop , noting that they were cryptic and the witness , mr fisher , was not familiar with them what is more , judge jackson added all this is from last fall it s not clear whether this is current thinking or just wishful thinking the larger point mr lacovara offered was that america online and other companies were trying to counter microsoft s dominance by offering word processers , spreadsheets , email programs , calendars and other applications as online products that work with any operating system it was this budding business strategy that a microsoft employee called very scary , and mr fisher acknowledged that microsoft might have reason to be concerned the market is moving under our feet , mr lacovara said on the courthouse steps later david boies , the lead government lawyer , responded 'the fundamental issue for us is the operating system monopoly and that has n't changed
riverhead , ny , april 15 twenty years after he tortured , shot to death and cannibalized a poughkeepsie teenager , albert fentress testified in court today for the first time , hoping to persuade a suffolk county jury that he should be freed from a state psychiatric hospital he never mentioned the crime mr fentress , 57 , who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the killing of paul masters , is contesting the latest in an unbroken string of decisions by state judges to extend his confinement if the jury decides that he is no longer a danger to himself or others , mr fentress could be transferred to a halfway house with little supervision in an hour and a half on the witness stand today , mr fentress calmly spoke at length of his daily routine at pilgrim state psychiatric hospital in brentwood , his weekly meetings with therapists , his occasional field trips to manhattan or montauk point he let it be known that he watches the news on abc and prefers to read the new york times he said he awakens every morning at 5 30 to say a prayer , and attends roman catholic mass every sunday but he and his lawyer , kim l darrow , carefully avoided any discussion of the murder victim , a high school graduate who had planned to leave for college in albany when he wandered into the backyard of mr fentress , then a middleschool teacher , on a sunday evening in august 1979 jurors have been told repeatedly what happened that night how , with images from the movie deliverance playing in his head , mr fentress lured mr masters , 18 , into his basement , tied him to a post at gunpoint , sexually abused and mutilated him , shot him twice in the head , and cooked and ate parts of his body but because mr darrow did not ask mr fentress about the crime , lawyers for the state s office of mental health and the dutchess county district attorney s office , who are seeking to extend mr fentress s confinement , were barred from bringing it up on crossexamination though mr fentress confessed to the crime the day it happened , he was never required to testify in court , because prosecutors accepted his insanity plea his testimony today was part of a proceeding under new york criminal law that allows mental patients whose institutional commitments are extended by a judge to ask for a rehearing before another judge or for a jury trial jury trials are extremely rare , however , and state officials say they can recall none before on long island when mr fentress took the stand this morning , after seven days of testimony by medical and psychiatric experts who offered conflicting views of mr fentress' mental fitness , the jury sat in rapt attention but he spent the next halfhour matteroffactly reciting the most mundane details of his existence only when mr darrow asked about his family did mr fentress s voice become filled with emotion twice , he broke into sobs as he was questioned about the deaths of his parents , who lived in melville in april 1995 , he recalled , he visited his mother for the last time , just days before she died of cancer she sensed that there was not a lot of time left , mr fentress said haltingly , his voice breaking she had said that one of the things that had been most on her mind had been that that she had never been able to speak with mrs masters , paul s mother wiping tears from his eyes , mr fentress continued , in his only reference to his victim we had all hoped we could speak with mrs masters at one point mrs masters had recently died , and mom was aware of it god counts the tears of mothers it s a jewish saying and i was aware that even though i had not been able to speak to mrs masters , that mom and mrs masters would be speaking shortly reached by telephone at his home in san jose , calif , burt masters , the victim s father , said today that his late wife might indeed have welcomed an approach from mr fentress s mother but he said his own feelings toward mr fentress had not changed and probably never would it seems to me like mr fentress has spent a lot more time on litigation than on really recognizing and understanding his problems and trying to do something about them , mr masters said i 'd like to see more concern for paul it does seem to me like he is tending to ignore that he dwells on his own bad fortune , rather than what somebody else might be suffering i 'd be very relieved if the jury decides to retain mr fentress laurie gatto , an assistant state attorney general who is representing the office of mental health , said that she had elected not to challenge mr fentress too aggressively on crossexamination because he seemed well prepared for any attempts to rattle him but that did not stop the lawyer from dutchess county , assistant district attorney wayne r witherwax , from making a try after mr fentress explained that his brother , 41 , and sister , 52 , who also live in suffolk county , wanted to show their support , but that he had persuaded them not to attend because of the media coverage of his trial his brother has two young children who could face teasing from their classmates , he suggested his sister is ill , he said , and must avoid stress i do not want the family , the children , to suffer because of me , he said that prompted an angry retort from mr witherwax you did n't think of the stress and strain you 'd cause your family when you killed paul masters , did you \? photos burt masters , left , with a photo of his son paul , who was tortured and killed in 1979 by albert fentress , right mr fentress did not mention the crime as he made the case yesterday for being freed from a state hospital \( vic delucia the new york times john todd associated press for the new york times \)
last june a municipal court judge in long beach , calif , decided that a defendant , ronnie hawkins , was being disruptive at the defense table the judge issued an order to a court officer , and , by remote control , mr hawkins was zapped with 50 , 000 volts of electricity from a stun belt that guards had placed around his waist before he entered the courtroom the hightech discipline imposed on mr hawkins led to a federal judge s temporary injunction against use of stun belts in los angeles county courts that ruling was one of the first anywhere in the country concerning devices that are becoming standard equipment for court officers and prison guards now the california case and a report to be issued by amnesty international this morning are focusing increased attention on the belts , which many federal and state inmates who pose a special risk of violence or escape are required to wear behind prison walls or in court appearances , or both while officials say that the stun devices can often be the least forceful way of maintaining control of a violent prisoner and that they are in fact activated sparingly , critics contend that any use of them is needlessly cruel one jolt through the wearer s kidney can cause temporary paralysis and loss of bodily function control their use , the critics say , violates not only the constitution s ban on cruel and unusual punishment but also a number of international human rights agreements to which the united states is a party and even where strict controls on their use is in place , abuse is always a possibility in any event , legal experts agree that the courts nationally must address the issue at present , i do n't think there is an ironclad answer , said paul g chevigny , an expert on lawenforcement procedures at new york university law school if you think the person is misbehaving , the legal question is whether the force you use is reasonable in its report to be issued this morning , amnesty international says the use of the stun belt by corrections and lawenforcement officers has been growing since its introduction several years ago the report says laws and regulations now permit the use of the belt by corrections systems in 20 states , by local lawenforcement officers in 30 states and by government agencies including the federal bureau of prisons as for where the belt and similarly acting stun shields are actually used rather than merely authorized , amnesty international said it had found more than 130 jurisdictions across the country over the last several years , in conjunction with a rapid rise of the prison population , institutions all over the country are looking for new ways to control prisoners , curt r goering , deputy executive director of amnesty international usa , said in an interview yesterday and they are turning to stun belts at an alarming rate the only states where the belt is explicitly prohibited are massachusetts , michigan and new jersey , although some prison systems , including new york state s , have chosen not to use it we feel we have appropriate procedures in place and do n't feel the need to use stun equipment , said mike houston , a spokesman for the new york state department of correctional services as a rule , federal and state prisons that authorize corrections officers to have some inmates wear the belts say they have strict limitations on activation typically only to prevent escape or assault the federal bureau of prisons has permitted officers to require the devices since 1994 , although the bureau s spokesman , todd craig , said none of them had yet administered a shock to an inmate but mr craig also said federal prison officials had concluded that the belts were effective deterrents if there are technologies we can use to stop an escape or prevent an assault , which will ultimately protect the public , we 're going to use those technologies , he said legal experts say the device is too new for the courts to have reached any consensus about it in general , said david a strauss , a constitutional law expert at the university of chicago , the supreme court has held that wanton and unnecessary force against prisoners can be deemed cruel and unusual punishment and so unconstitutional but , professor strauss and other experts said , courts have given prison authorities wide latitude to control emergency situations like possible escape or assault judges , he said , including the supreme court justices , are inclined to give officials a lot of leeway before deciding that there has been 'wanton and unnecessary force' in the california case , mr hawkins filed a federal civil suit seeking damages from officials and an injunction barring the use of the belts he maintained that the devices violated not only the constitution but also international human rights guarantees against cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment in a preliminary ruling in january , the federal judge , dean d pregerson , agreed that even if the belt was not activated , it would have a chilling effect in court on a defendant forced to wear it for example , judge pregerson said , a defendant who was forced to wear a belt and was representing himself as was mr hawkins , a chronic offender who in this case was charged only with shoplifting but had been violent in jail might be afraid to object to a judge s ruling for fear of being shocked the judge issued a temporary injunction while the case awaited trial but los angeles county appealed his ruling to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , in san francisco , where the case is pending judy hammond , a spokeswoman for the county , said mr hawkins was the first beltwearing prisoner ever jolted by court officers there the case has been something of an embarrassment for the industry that manufactures electricshock devices while he said he did not know the details of the california case , dennis kaufman , president of one of the large manufacturers , stuntech inc of cleveland , said yesterday that any use of a stun belt to punish a defendant would be inappropriate he said the belt was intended only to stop escapes and assaults the belt is not to be used for punishment , mr kaufman said if it is , consequently it is clearly a violation of civil rights as well as a violation of what the belt was designed for some advocates for prisoners say the devices amount to a worrisome turn of technology in prison settings , it is a clear opening for abuse , said elizabeth alexander , director of the national prison project of the american civil liberties union but james turpin , legislative liaison of the american correctional association , a national organization of corrections officers and administrators , said he knew of no evidence that the devices were used in an abusive way , or even with any frequency
toronto , sept 15 a risque kiss \? so very quaint one of the more interesting minitrends of the 24th toronto international film festival , which wraps up on saturday , was the unusually large number of films with sexually frank themes and sexually explicit scenes , sometimes crossing into territory formerly reserved for hardcore fare one of the first of the festival s films to attract interest among united states distributors was a pornographic affair , from the the belgian director frederic fonteyne that , while not visually explicit , was a very intimately recorded account of a couple s desire to have a liaison based on nothing but sex \( after several days of bidding , the film was picked up today by fine line \) another film to draw a lot of chatter early in the festival was gojitmal , from the south korean director jang sunwoo , a much more explicit and discomfiting look at an increasingly sadomasochistic affair between a 38yearold man and an 18yearold girl but perhaps the most explicit of all , and a film that has drawn widely mixed responses , was the french director catherine breillat s romance , which is to be released slowly throughout north america , beginning in new york on friday \( review on page 14 \) the film is about a young woman who , through a series of relationships , explores the outer limits of her sexual experience , including sadomasochism it combines an intense philosophical viewpoint with some scenes as explicit as can be found in any adult video it is my feeling that the powers that be , the government and the church are trying to control people by censorship , by taking them away from the physical experience of sex , said ms breillat \( above \) i believe that physical love has a very metaphysical , a very spiritual aspect that is why those in power fear it but it is only by embracing this physical aspect , i believe , that we can go through the taboo and reach the next level of our spiritual evolution ok but how to market such a film in the united states , especially when the movie industry is under intense government and public scrutiny over its use of sex and violence \? romance had its premiere at the rotterdam international film festival earlier this year and was later released in france under a rating that excluded viewers under 16 ms breillat said she did not think that people that young should see her film , although she disapproved of any form of censorship , even the film industry s selfimposed motion picture association ratings system in the united states the film s united states distributor , trimark pictures , released the movie without submitting it to the association for a rating , fearful that an nc17 rating \( no one under 17 admitted \) , which it almost certainly would have received , would stigmatize the film and mislead arthouse audiences and those who expected a pornographic flick the film will not open outside new york until oct 1 , said dennis o'connor , senior vice president for theatrical marketing for trimark i believe the film will get critical acclaim , and we want to give those other markets time to react , he said and there are still a lot of major chains in other markets around the country that are sitting on the fence about the film , waiting to see how it is received in new york and elsewhere ms breillat has stirred controversy throughout her career , which includes seven films and six novels she is best known in the united states for 36 fillette , which was shown at the new york film festival in 1989 and is one of her least controversial projects it is about a young girl deciding whether to end her virginity with an older man mr o'connor said trimark had also decided to join one of the more popular adultoriented web sites to help promote romance , a liaison between the arthouse and the pornography worlds that rarely occurs the film is very provocative , so you have to be very careful how you market it , he said you need to market it to adults who prefer edgy , provocative films , some of whom still wo n't like it , will find it too strong but i think the people who do n't like it will at least respect what she s tried to accomplish in purgatory and then there is dogma , the controversial new film written and directed by kevin smith i hate that , said mr smith , who had his first success with clerks in 1994 it s never just 'dogma' it s always 'the controversial dogma ' i know i should be a little happy because we 're getting some publicity out of it , but i 'd rather do without that publicity he shook his head it s been a long six months , he said the film tells the story of two fallen angels , played by matt damon and ben affleck \( below left \) , banished to wisconsin for eternity , who think they have found a loophole to get back into heaven unfortunately , if they do , it will cause a cosmic chain reaction that will mean the end of all life on earth so another angel , played by alan rickman , talks a descendant of jesus , an abortionclinic worker played by linda fiorentino , into trying to thwart the angels' plan

osprey , fla , there was even more shootaround time also , we both ran in a 5k race in fiesta key , mrs frasca said , and we both won in our age divisions both women are experienced racers but in basketball , they are late bloomers , having started playing last summer when mrs frasca was 60 and mrs haines was 83 now that she has returned home , mrs frasca is back in the gym on thursday nights at st joseph school in new britain and on sunday afternoons at healthtrax in newington with the connecticut senior huskies , the state s only 60andover women s basketball team the team , which has 15 practicing members , will be playing in the national senior olympics in october in orlando , fla so , too , will the sevenmember hot shots of norwalk , the younger 50andover of the two senior women s squads in the state , both of which won gold medals in the massachusetts state senior olympics last summer while playing in the first tournaments they had entered what makes both teams particularly remarkable is that only a few of the players had ever played before but most have been involved in running and other events in the senior olympics and are fit , even though many of them did not get into competitive sports until they were in their 40 s , 50 s and , in mrs haines s case , their 60 s i could n't wait to reach 50 , said ginger katz of norwalk , a cocaptain of the hot shots , because until then , there s really no where you can compete with people your own age at age 50 , athletes are eligible for the senior olympics , which holds qualifying competitions in each state for the national olympics that are held every other year when mrs katz reached that milestone last year , she took advantage in grand fashion , qualifying for the national olympics by winning gold medals in the tennis singles , the 800meter run and in basketball , capturing silver medals in the 100 , 200 and 400meter races , the 5kilometer run and the 5kilometer bicycle race in the 50 to 54yearold category \( participants automatically qualify for the national olympics if they finish first or second \) the biggest thrill for mrs katz , though , was the formation of the hot shots during the connecticut state olympics in southington last june and then , a month later , winning the gold medal in the massachusetts games in springfield they played only one game , since only one other team was entered in the 50andover competition , but the hot shots won , 302 , doing so without having had a single practice for the halfcourt threeonthree competition which is employed in the senior olympics the girls got a feel for the game by watching a men s game before we played , said larry katz , the coach of the hot shots and the husband of ginger katz and then we did a little shooting before the game started fortunately , ginger and three other girls joan youngs , sheila mckenna and myrna nichols had played in the past , although not for a long time indeed the four hot shots had not played competitively since they were in high school but colleges did n't have women s basketball teams in those days and so you had to play field hockey , soccer or softball , which i did , said ms youngs , a retired teacher who , at the age of 61 , is eligible to play for the older senior huskies but opts to play for the younger hot shots that commitment requires a 170mile round trip from tolland , where ms youngs lives , to practice on thursday nights at the st thomas the apostle gymnasium on east avenue in norwalk the team also practices on tuesdays at the westport ymca ms youngs sometimes meets a teammate , sheila morris of windsor locks , in hartford to car pool the 70 miles to norwalk for another hot shot , paula passarello of north franklin , which is near willimantic , the trip is even longer , 95 miles each way fortunately , my husband , steve , who has his own business , comes with me and sits in the lounge outside the gym , reading trade publications and doing some work while we practice , said mrs passarello , who is one of the team s best players , capable of whipping a behindtheback pass , as she did to mrs katz during a recent practice scrimmage a former teacher , mrs passarello , who has not played basketball since she was in high school , is not eligible to play with the hot shots in the national senior olympics since she did not play on the team when it won the gold medal last summer i do it for the sheer joy and love of it , mrs passarello said it s well worth the long trip like the children and husbands of all the senior women players , mrs passarello s daughter , deirdre , who played basketball at skidmore college , has been encouraging
dublin , march 11 a group of antiabortion militants , including about 40 americans , have reignited the highly emotional issue of abortion in this roman catholic country by forcing their way into a dublin familyplanning office and occupying it for two hours the occupation happened saturday , and today a judge extended indefinitely an order prohibiting the militants , including the leader of the american group , from picketing or trespassing at the irish family planning association office in the center of the city , which does not perform abortions the militant groups were not represented in court and the prohibition , first granted on monday , was ordered for an indefinite period the chief executive of the planning association , tony o'brien , welcomed the decision of judge imelda macken it restrains leaders of the irish group , youth defense , which also had about 40 people at the occupation , and the christian defense coalition , a washingtonbased group headed by the rev patrick mahoney mr o'brien said the occupation of the office raised fears that violence and killing by abortion opponents would spread to ireland from the united states the action on saturday , he said , was the first forced incursion into a familyplanning premises there were none even during the vehement debate in 1992 before a vote on a measure that would have changed abortion law here the involvement of extreme american militants is probably the most sinister development in ireland s longrunning abortion controversy , mr o'brien said in an interview , given the unfortunate history of the issue in america according to a 1992 ruling by ireland s supreme court , abortion is constitutionally permissible in cases of danger to a mother s life but there are no legal centers for abortions in ireland and no legal exception in cases of rape or incest about 5 , 000 irish women go to britain each year for abortions in the 1992 referendum , voters rejected a proposed revision of the abortion law , some feeling the proposal was too liberal , some saying it was too restrictive the familyplanning association may legally distribute information on the availability of abortions in foreign countries , but it is not allowed to advise women to undergo one the revived issue led to scores of phone calls to radio talk shows many callers defended the right of the intruders to enter the clinic as a valid tactic to thwart the staff , whom they called murderers others said , in effect , that the americans should go home pat kenny , one of the country s favorite masters of ceremonies and the moderator of the main morning talk show on national radio , upbraided the leader of the american group , mr mahoney , a protestant evangelist it s not what we want to happen in ireland , mr kenny said that s not the way we do our business mr kenny said many people feared that violent attacks , including killings , by antiabortion militants could spread from the united states to ireland he noted reports that staff members at the association office said they had been frightened , and had to lock themselves in a back room during the occupation , and that the intruders told callers to the office that no officials would be allowed come to the phone because they were murderers several of the intruders made videotapes of staff members , he said mr mahoney told mr kenny that he deplored violence by the small number of americans who have used it to advance their campaign
to the editor walter murch s interesting speculations about a completely digital cinema only a decade from now , in which actual film would no longer be used a digital cinema of the mind \? could be , may 2 , begins with two inaccuracies first , he asserts that muybridge s quantization of movement in the 1880 s provided the insight that gave rise to motion pictures second , he expresses confidence that although film may fade away , there will always be pictures that move the two errors are intertwined motion pictures do not involve pictures that actually move , of course rather , the movement experienced by the viewer is stroboscopic the presentation of a series of still pictures , usually 24 per second , induces in the viewer a perception of apparent movement a still frame is projected , the projector shutter closes , the film advances to the next frame and stops moving , and the shutter opens to project the next still picture if the shutter were not closed while the film moved from frame to frame , the viewer would see only a blur rolling across the screen the insight that gave rise to motion pictures can be traced to the invention of the stroboscope in 1833 , which first showed that successively illuminating separate spots can create the impression of movement between them when none actually occurs by 1835 , several stroboscopic devices illustrating apparent movement had been perfected by faraday , plateau and other scientists and , in 1875 , exner , an austrian psychologist , conducted a series of quantitative studies of the factors governing this phenomenon all of this work was done long before eadweard muybridge , a british photographer \( who proved in 1872 that a galloping horse actually lifts all four feet off the ground at once \) , developed his zoopraxiscope , a machine that reproduced moving figures on a screen muybridge s work may have been a landmark on the path to motion pictures as we know them , but the insight that gave rise to them was achieved more than 40 years earlier herbert kimmel houston the writer is distinguished research professor of psychology , emeritus , at the university of south florida , tampa
ravello , italy fiction versus biography fact versus invention a mine field tread warily i have a vague recollection of a conversation several years ago with edmund morris i was still waiting for the second volume of his splendid life of theodore roosevelt what had happened \? postponed why \? he told me i would have fallen to the floor had i not been able to clutch at a passing console , courtesy of pg wodehouse reagan \? yes ! total access was mentioned every day no secrets a seat beside the throne i warned you will need hardship money battle pay i visualized a broken biographer , eyes glazed , sleepfamished after days listening to the most awesomely boring man ever to be chief magistrate i knew i was there back in the 50 s , early 60 s , i saw strong men faint , powerful women defenestrate themselves whenever ron entered a room allaglow with highly polished anecdotes culled from recent reader s digests and golden oldie saturday evening posts since none of us knew then that the wealthy usedcar dealers he quietly consorted with were planning to make this very good actor \( point never to be lost sight of \) into a governor of california and that they would , in turn , attract a group of even greater financial interests to make him president , we steered clear of him as we did of his friend robert taylor , reputedly the second most boring member of the screen actors guild nancy , on the other hand , was bright but to work i had the impression that morris had no idea of what hollywood was all about particularly the hollywood of the studios where actors were notsohighly paid puppets held to rigid contracts , their every move literally supervised by , in ron s case , the brothers warner more than one of ron s directors called me after he was elected president , horrified at this astonishing bit of national miscasting all they could hear themselves saying was , hit your mark , ron ! no , not there there ! i do n't think morris suspected any of this a president who was not interested in politics was something odd he also read no books , knew no history nevertheless , full of folksy charm , he could communicate masterfully on tv whatever message had been crafted for him , from that evergreen favorite the russians are still coming to let s cut the capital gains tax for the rich as well as any tax on corporate profits because a rising tide sinks all boats , or whatever the conventional wisdom was in due course , morris was on the case day after day , he must have been told , yet again , about ron s truly important life as president of sag the intricacies of the ida lupino warner brothers' contract of 1937 , no , it must have been '36 , ever fresh in his perfect anecdotal memory of all our presidents , he appears to have been , for his handlers and managers , the least trouble only occasionally would obsession undo him nicaragua contras red menace in the americas in fact , he was approaching what looked to be a disastrous ending to his presidency when he gave congressional testimony on film , naturally about the role he played in the irancontra affair where he must have thought dealing , illegally , with our enemy iran was child s play compared to dealing with bette davis when she went on strike against warner brothers \( i never called jack warner 'jack' he was always mr warner the greatest man i ever knew \) ayatollah khomeini was a pussycat compared to davis on the rampage incidentally , our greatest screen actress was a hard new england liberal , who always referred to reagan as little ronnie reagan , quite ignoring how good he was acting the part of an alcoholic playboy in her memorable weepy dark victory in any case , reagan sailed through his testimony on a wave of i do n't remembers what was edmund morris to do with such a subject \? in reagan , the masters of the media had found their most obliging president whatever corporate america wanted , corporate america had finally got small marginal lefty papers like the nation might mock this beloved paladin of all that was good in america , shining upon its hill , but for eight years no one was allowed to give the game away we were told he was on top of everything he was widely read with an innate instinct for high diplomacy finally , he had a sense of fairness that included even the downtrodden 1 percent that owns most of the wealth of the country as well as a lot of that of the rest of the world it took a man of saintlike compassion to realize that when taxed the rich feel pain , bleed the myth of this wizard of oz was furiously sustained on all sides now a serious historian was given a crack at him and found nobody there this is the dilemma for morris and his publisher how do you write about no one without giving away the game about how and why presidents are selected \? i believe at some point on morris s long road to damascus , he had his vision this is all fiction so , obligingly , morris has fictionalized himself , too he appears as a character in scenes from the past where he could not have been but has sufficiently researched so that he could reinvent himself as the hero was inventing himself , with a little help from his friends and agents at mca i think this is a superb solution even though , as a historical novelist , i would never have dared to be so avantgarde but then , i 've never dealt with an american president whose life owed so little to parson weems and so much to pirandello ca n't wait to read the book ! drawing \( greg clarke \)
detroit , june 26 the car company that grew up by pretending it did not know its parent company , the general motors corporation , is starting a family of its own saturn , the smallcar brand that gm created a decade ago to win back baby boomers from imports , will begin selling a midsize car in july about two years later , it plans to add a small sport utility vehicle saturn initially achieved a near cultlike following , enabling gm to turn its attention to saturn s troubled siblings , including oldsmobile , buick and cadillac but with only two aging models to offer its two million customers , saturn saw its sales slip to 231 , 522 last year from a high of 286 , 003 in 1994 now , gm is embarking on a new strategy and a new ad campaign starting on monday promoting the saturn brand and its midsize car this is about doubling the size of our company , and it is also about moving into a segment that , let s face it , was n't in our game plan , said jill a lajdziak , saturn s vice president for sales , service and marketing auto industry analysts and marketing experts are divided over gm s approach some worry that extending the saturn name beyond small cars will cause an identity crisis , while others applaud the move because it allows loyal saturn owners to trade up coming out with a big saturn is the same as coming out with a cheap cadillac , said clive chajet , a new york corporateidentity consultant who maintains that small size and low price are fundamental saturn attributes saturn becomes just like oldsmobile it no longer stands for a precise something others agree , saying that if saturn offers a full line of cars , it will become similar to gm s other divisions , many of which are struggling one of the problems is going to be how do you differentiate this midsize saturn from all the others out there , said jack f trout , president of trout partners , a marketingstrategy firm in greenwich , conn getting the image right is more important for saturn , perhaps , than for any other auto brand because so much of saturn s appeal has come from the strong image that marketers created , rather than the cars themselves ultimately , the product was mediocre their success was more built off the image they built up , said wesley r brown , an auto consultant at nextrend , in thousand oaks , calif but mr brown thinks that adding a midsize car is a good move that division has been for a long time begging to be able to expand their lineup , he said they 've needed more product for years gm executives are counting on the car s being a hit we expect great things to happen with that new car , roy s roberts , vice president for north american sales , service and marketing , said early this summer the midsize car is called simply ls for larger saturn its primary target market consists of married , collegeeducated customers between 35 and 49 , with one or two children and a household income of 55 , 000 or so about 55 percent of buyers are expected to be men the car , which starts at 15 , 450 , is intended to compete with lowend models of the toyota camry and the honda accord television teaser ads start on monday night on the fox network s popular ally mcbeal program and run on various primetime and cable programs through july the ads , all by saturn s longtime agency , publicis hal riney , will also be shown on saturn s world wide web site \( www saturn com \) others will appear in magazines , on the sides of buildings , and on bus shelters and other outdoor spaces saturn spent 210 million last year on advertising , according to competitive media reporting lisa m hutchinson , saturn s director of marketing , declined to say how much saturn will spend on the new ad campaign , except that it would be significantly higher that it was last year the ad campaign is important because we 're not just introducing a new car line we 're relaunching the saturn brand , she said one teaser ad simply shows five pairs of blue jeans being put out on a clothesline to dry each is a different size , and the logo smlsxl appears , along with the tag line coming soon the next big thing from saturn another shows children of varying sizes jumping into a pool and swimming underwater , followed by their father none of the teaser ads show the car the car is first scheduled to be shown in a 90second television ad beginning early in august the ad uses danny glover s voice to retell the saturn story in sweeping , emotionally charged statements one day a factory went up and people s spirits went up with it , mr glover says as images of happy workers in the rural setting of saturn s factory in spring hill , tenn , appear he talks of the road to creating a new car company against the odds mr glover cites the company s success , then says they realized there was more road , so they set out on it again and it led them here to the new larger saturn ls then , the ad shows the car and uses the tag line the next big thing from saturn perhaps the most striking ads will be three billboards one on sunset boulevard in los angeles , one on interstate 80 near the bay bridge around san francisco and one on the virgin megastore in times square which will replace teaser ads in those locations on aug 2 a saturn ls will be mounted on each billboard \( after having been hollowed out to lighten the load \) , with headlights that click on at dusk and windshield wipers that turn on when it rains thomas j else , the saturn account director at publicis hal riney , said , the biggest challenge we have is to convey to people that saturn has a new larger car , not a replacement car in the past , he added , we just had one car and we had to be appealing to everybody photo an example of minimalist , or perhaps teaser , advertising for the new line of midsize saturn cars
paris two of the most coveted spaces in the parisian museum world are being given over to a 61yearold english artist whom few people have known quite what to make of his name is david hockney on the rue stmerri , in the south gallery of the otherwise closed pompidou center , mr hockney has a retrospective exhibition of 164 paintings and photocollages \( many of them very large \) dated from 1962 to 1998 organized by didier ottinger of the musee national d'art moderne , it comes with a hefty catalogue in which french , german and english contributors take it in turn to assess a vast body of work that has been springing surprises , year by year , since january 1960 at the musee picasso there is david hockney dialogue with picasso between them , the two shows act as a corrective to anyone who has a onefocus , oneperiod , onemedium , oneambition idea of david hockney there is the work that everyone knows the repertory company of favorite sitters , the swimming pools \( some in california , others in connecticut \) , the panoramic los angeles interiors and the vertiginous upanddown and inandout of the roads that so often lead up to them but there is not one david hockney without ever flaunting it , he is a true citizen of the world he has traveled , read , studied and looked between 1973 and 1975 , for instance , he spent a lot of time in paris echoes of france recur throughout his career when we look at his deft and affectionate etching of gustave flaubert , for instance , or note what he got from reading henri bergson on memory , or study his monumental photocollage of the place furstenberg in paris , we know that he knows france from the inside when he was living in paris , he was already being talked about and written about in 1975 a thenyoung french critic , marc fumaroli , who is now an influential member of the academie francaise , got david hockney exactly right he played his part , mr fumaroli wrote at that time , in the emptyheaded circles that his allies and protectors frequented but he brought to them the graces of a young person who had all the gifts both as narcissus and as dandy , he had an innate feeling for what was the trend of the day but he never got stuck with it though always ready with the right word , he never lost either his catlike independence or his colossal capacity for work he sang for his supper , mr fumaroli went on , and his gifts as an actor served him well but he was neither the prisoner nor the subordinate of his troupe he was all the more 'in' because he had made up his mind to stay 'out' what more could be asked of a great talent at that time \? mr hockney cannot be pinned down no sooner did his paintings of boys in the shower take rank as the epitome of early 1960 s camp than he turned to what he called the marriage of styles as the motor force in paintings that were large , grand and contradictory in their idioms those first major american paintings , nobly shown in the pompidou , had nothing to do with the laidback life of los angeles iowa \( 1964 \) , arizona \( 1964 \) and rocky mountains and tired indians \( 1965 \) are monumental in scale inch by inch they are endlessly beguiling to look at there is something absolutely right about the imminent electric storms in iowa , the minutely defined geological striations in arizona and the presence of an uptotheminute knoll chair in the ancient uncluttered landscape of rocky mountains and tired indians one and all keep us alert as philippe starck says in the catalogue that the visual elements in these paintings take us on a long march through the history of art , one that leads from ancient egypt to minimal art nor can we miss the fact that the farm buildings in iowa hark back to cezanne s preoccupation with the cylinder and the cone in the musee picasso on the rue de thorigny , the dialogue with picasso is as much a matter of ideas as of actions , and the tone of mr hockney s contributions is not awestruck but conversational he first took fire from picasso in the summer of 1960 , when there was a large picasso retrospective in london the lesson was a general one that every option should be acted upon there was no style and no technique that picasso could not master , mr hockney said what was the point of settling down in one little corner of art and just painting on it over and over \? mr hockney the stagedesigner is ideally represented in the picasso museum by the adorable frivolity of his designs for francis poulenc s opera les mamelles de tiresias \( one of them is reproduced in miniature , and rare is the visitor who does n't crack a smile \) elsewhere in the show is a painting dated 1987 that shows how hockney can cut deep when the occasion calls for it one of the great moments in all opera falls near the end of wagner s tristan und isolde , when the dying tristan hears the approach of isolde now i hear the light ! he cries out with full voice , and in mr hockney s painting we see that in closeup , unforgettably for tristan at that moment , hearing was seeing , and mr hockney brought something rough and raw to the portrayal of his huge stricken head something of that roughness and rawness can be traced to picasso s late figure paintings , in which he strove to go beyond the previous limits of expression in figure painting in the pompidou show , mr hockney rides high on the limitless complication and the brash , aggressive color of his highflying californian landscapes of the 1990 s \( the paint in those pictures , as in the ones done last year in his native yorkshire , does not so much portray the landscape as couple with it \) at the picasso museum , the plain white spaces and the vibration of picasso s own presence encourage a more intimate scale and an epigrammatic demeanor as mr hockney sees it , what had been called distortion in many of picasso s portraits of marietherese walter in 1934 was simply the plain fact of what we see when we get up very close to another person and patrol that person s face at such times , the cubist vision is the true one and the standard , longauthenticated image of another human being makes no sense mr hockney had more than once painted his friend christopher isherwood in a traditional pose , with spectacles gleaming but in 1984 , when he painted christopher without his glasses , he toured the familiar head as if he were negotiating mulholland drive on the way to his studio isherwood s features were distorted , with eyes and nose and forehead going every which way , but those dislocations rang true this was the real christopher , alive and complete , just as the real mr hockney is alive , if not quite complete , in these two admirably thoughtthrough exhibitions the pompidou show can be seen through april 26 , and the one at the picasso museum through may 3 photo a 1984 portrait of christopher isherwood by david hockney , at the musee picasso \( reunion des musees nationaux \)
washington when i went out to buy a gun one night , i had no idea it would be easier and less expensive than buying a pink cashmere sweater set my friend jill and i drove to a sports authority in a bland strip mall in virginia , near the pentagon past fishing lures and boogie boards we found the gun department beneath a plastic 175pound deer target was a row of rifles a remington 12gauge shotgun for 219 , a mossberg 12gauge shotgun for 23999 , a browning 20gauge deer rifle for 59999 would you like to try one \? the young clerk asked pleasantly jill opted for a basic black mossberg nice pin , he said , admiring her brooch , as she puzzled over whether the butt went above or below the shoulder it was as easy as thelma and louise a driver s license , half an hour for a computerized background check , and the gun would have been ours trust me on this i am not the sort of person who should be able to walk out of a store with a really big gun in half an hour it was a shopping trip that left me even more dubious about the president s stressing the culture of violence as much as the machines of violence he called a white house summit on youth and media violence but none of his pals from hollywood were willing to be publicly spanked by the clintons and gores they do n't want to be pilloried in public and put in a metal stockade , said one industry executive it galled the movie big shots to be summoned to the principal s office by a president and vice president who have nurtured so many close and lucrative ties in hollywood next weekend , mr clinton and other democratic leaders will attend a 15 million fundraiser in beverly hills hosted by the dreamworks trio so the hollywood chieftains stiffed washington , saying that only their lobbyists would attend , and pointedly reminded the white house of their lavish past support they felt the president should not be aping the republicans and scapegoating the entertainment industry at first the clintonites huffed that the hollywood crowd was wimping out one took catty note that edgar bronfman jr of seagram s , which owns universal , turned down the summit invitation to open a roller coaster at universal s new theme park in orlando , fla as if the clinton white house is not enough of a roller coaster but hollywood was right to boycott another politically opportunistic gabfest as sean daniel , a hollywood producer , puts it the heads of movie , television and recording industries have their share of responsibility but they are being made to stand up as symbols of much more complex behavior , a mix of evil , dna , parenting , isolation , the singleminded alienation of being in front of a computer screen in your room six hours a day people invoke hollywood as a catchall for all the influences that come off any screen , including the internet and video games faced with all the noshows , the white house had to recast tomorrow s summit into a fuzzy hodgepodge on children , violence and responsibility , with no one famous taking part except maya angelou besides soothing hollywood , the president reached out to the nra , saying let s bury the hatchet \( the nra will gladly bury the hatchet it s the gun they wo n't bury \) rob reiner , the director , rearranged his schedule to come but then the white house , inexplicably , told him not to bother i'm not saying we do n't need some selfregulation , mr reiner told me i hate those movies where hundreds of people get blown up and there are jokes afterward they poison the soul sure , kids are affected , but not enough to turn a loved , securely attached child into a violent killer we have to figure out why our society is so angry , why our technology is making us more disengaged from human interaction and we have to stop the easy access to guns canada , germany , japan , england every country gets our movies , but they do n't kill anybody afterward the president deserves credit for his push on gun control but this is the moment to be brazen he s wandering the white house halls looking for a legacy how about a takenoprisoners , givenoquarter campaign against the nra and a ban on handguns \?
the rules for lobbying in albany are so abysmally loose that only occasionally does the outside world get a glimpse of how new york state s legislature can market its influence such a moment arrived this year when the tobacco industry was forced to open its files in state litigation around the country the documents listed how much money companies like philip morris had spent trying to secure protection in places like albany last week new york state s lobbying commission managed to get philip morris to agree to pay 75 , 000 , the highest fine the commission has ever imposed , for underreporting lobbying expenses in albany from 1996 to 1998 the tobacco giant also agreed to bar its chief albany official from lobbying the legislature for three years but philip morris was barely singed in the process the state attorney general , eliot spitzer , who has asked that a criminal version of this matter be referred to his office , fumed that the commission had been completely outlawyered by philip morris , bamboozled they gave an absolution where none was deserved mr spitzer may be overstating the case , since the commission can still refer the philip morris matter for criminal prosecution moreover , these same company documents could be used by the secretive legislative ethics committee to determine whether illegal gifts were given by lobbyists and received by legislators with an intent to influence legislation the real travesty in albany is the lobbying law itself set to expire at the end of the year , with the commission then closing its doors in march , the law gives the commission little power against some of the nation s most powerful lobbyists a strengthened law should limit gifts and favors , impose a broader definition of lobbying and allow the commission more freedom to levy higher fines a mere extension , as some state politicians want , would be a reason for many lobbyists to take the nearest legislator out to dinner to celebrate
last year chris broderick of rumson , nj , his wife , clare , and four other family members spent two and a half hours driving to an army football game at west point , ny on saturday the brodericks and nine other relatives and friends spent the same amount of time going to the same place but this time they traveled by highspeed ferry driving up last november was pleasant enough , but nothing like this , said mr broderick , a public relations executive , as he stood on the south dock at west point he had just stepped off the express i , a sleek , tripledeck , 95foot catamaran operated by the ferry company sea streak , that had departed from highlands , nj , near sandy hook coming by boat was great , very relaxing with some very nice scenery and none of the worries that go with driving going back was even nicer , he said later , because of the sunset the express i , with about 150 passengers , was not the only boat arriving at south dock , on the western edge of the united states military academy grounds , in time for army s game against ball state university the 92foot theodore roosevelt , another catamaran , arrived from manhattan with 135 people , as had the 154foot highlander , owned by forbes inc , with 71 the highlander , a luxury yacht that carries a helicopter on board , has been bringing guests of the forbes family to army games since the 1960 s , although nowadays it carries mainly advertisers and others doing business with forbes magazine its passengers have included elizabeth taylor , margaret thatcher , caspar weinberger and donald trump on the way home a dinner of lobster , caviar and champagne is served in recent years an increasing number of people have discovered the pleasures of a trip to west point , by small private boat or the larger ferries , even without the forbes kind of luxury when i joined the staff here 16 years ago , maybe you 'd have a dozen yachts and other small craft bringing people to the games , but now we 'll have anywhere from two to three dozen , said rick camarda , the west point harbor master we think it s great because it alleviates traffic and parking problems cruise operators , whose ferries carry commuters on weekdays between new jersey and manhattan , are also delighted over the phenomenon our football cruises have been a tremendous success , said sharon kramer , the cruisemarketing manager for ny waterway , which operates the roosevelt and runs sightseeing cruises up the hudson on fall weekends some private boaters are incredulous at the hospitality shown them by the harbor master s crew i thought we 'd have to pay , but they said there was no charge , said cliff thompson , a new york city firefighter who lives in warwick , ny he pulled up to the dock with his wife and their three daughters in their 30foot yacht , chick s ahoy because the dock is only 170 feet long , smaller craft like the thompsons' usually have to anchor nearby they told me to drop off my wife and children , and they would pick me up in a launch , and they did , mr thompson said now that s service no one , mr camarda said , comes as far to army games as the 18 men who annually make a ninehour boat trip from stamford , conn this is our 29th year , bill brennan , the owner of a real estate company , said after the 58foot rigger arrived with the group on the day before this season s opening game against wake forest on sept 11 some of us went to army games by car for years but then one saturday in 1970 our car got stuck in heavy traffic on the bear mountain bridge , and we missed part of the first quarter of an armypenn state game while we 're sitting there , one of the guys , dick merritt , looks down and notices a few boats going up the hudson toward west point and he says 'look , there s no traffic down there why do n't we go by boat next year \? ' they did , along with four friends , aboard mr merritt s 32foot yacht , which the group eventually outgrew after dick merritt moved to florida , we began to charter yachts , mr brennan said and over the years we 've used about a halfdozen the trip is an elaborate expedition for the stamford group , which calls itself the west point crew , although none of its members have any formal ties to the academy this year three men drove to west point on the thursday before the game with a car and two vans that were loaded with food , a tent for tailgating , tables and chairs , cooking grills and other items they returned to stamford in the car and at 9 the next morning were aboard the rigger when it shoved off after cruising along the connecticut and new york coastlines , the rigger passed under the throgs neck bridge and into the east river , around the lower tip of manhattan and then up the hudson along the way herb kohn , a native new yorker and the group s selfappointed cruise narrator , pointed out sites like gracie mansion , the united nations , ellis island and grant s tomb at 6 30 pm on friday the rigger reached south dock the men were driven to the hotel thayer , on the academy grounds \( the thayer s guest rooms and dining room are open to the public all year long \) on saturday morning the men , some wearing black baseball caps with west point crew emblazoned in gold letters , set up a tent in a parking lot near michie stadium their breakfast , lunch and dinner were scheduled around the pregame parade and the game itself but football may well be secondary to the boat trip for some of the west point crew charlie minckler came up with us by boat for years , mr brennan said , and i do n't think he ever went to a game other boat travelers may feel the same mr camarda said that when lady thatcher was a guest on the highlander , as soon as it docked at west point she took the yacht s helicopter back to manhattan apparently she had no desire to see the game , he said after a second night at the thayer the members of the stamford group , in keeping with custom , went to church together on sunday at 10 30 am they were back on the rigger for trip home you can drive up from stamford in about an hour and a quarter , mr brennan said but it just would n't be the same setting sail the remaining army football games at home are scheduled for tomorrow , against east carolina university thursday night , against the university of louisville oct 23 , against new mexico state university , and nov 20 , against the university of houston two ferry companies in the new york region make trips to west point for the games the cruises are mostly sold out for this fall , but cancellations are possible seastreak operates the express i and the express ii to west point from highlands , nj , near sandy hook each ferry carries about 225 passengers trips are sold out for all games except the one on nov 20 for that game the ferries will leave highlands at 8 am and arrive at west point at 10 30 , two and a half hours before the game starts the cost is 60 a person round trip and includes a ticket to the game and bus transportation from the dock to michie stadium information \( 732 \) 8722628 or \( 800 \) 2628743 the theodore roosevelt , operated by ny waterway from manhattan , carries approximately 150 passengers all trips this fall are sold out the cruises cost 69 round trip and include a game ticket and bus transportation the boats depart from pier 78 at west 38th street and 12th avenue at 7 45 or 8 45 am , depending on whether the game starts at noon or 1 pm , and arrive at west point two hours later information \( 201 \) 9028700 or \( 800 \) 5333779 new york fast ferry , based in highlands , has also made a number of football cruises to west point in the last two years but this year the company has made only one chartered trip jack davis , the company s general manager , said more trips were planned for next year information \( 800 \) 6936933 there are no docking or mooring charges for ferries or private boats that use south dock at west point free bus service to the stadium is alsoprovided to those arriving on private boats information \( 914 \) 9383011 photo the highlander , the forbes family s luxury yacht , arriving at south dock at west point for a football game \( suzanne dechillo the new york times \) map of new york highlighting west point
no matter how well senator john mccain does in the early presidential contests , he is facing inhospitable terrain in one of the next skirmishes , the delegaterich new york primary on march 7 republicans in much of the state will not cast their ballots for mr mccain , his campaign concedes , because his name will not appear on their ballots four years after the state s burdensome election laws were widely criticized for keeping prominent republicans out of the presidential primary , the field is once again dwindling , and some candidates are declaring that in new york , tammany hallstyle bossism lives on the mccain campaign hopes to qualify in half of the state s congressional districts , but even that goal may be too ambitious three underdogs gary l bauer , senator orrin g hatch and alan keyes are expected to skip new york s primary altogether , saying that as usual , the system for ballot access is rigged to favor the choice of the state party , in this case , gov george w bush of texas so while voters in several states with primaries on the same day will select from a full menu of contenders \( not to mention some unknowns \) , most new york republicans will probably decide between two mr bush , who will readily land a spot across the state because the party establishment has deployed its foot soldiers to help him , and steve forbes , the millionaire publisher , who plans to spend 750 , 000 to navigate the many shoals in the petition process elsewhere , getting on the ballot can be simply a formality california , connecticut , maryland and massachusetts , all of which hold primaries on march 7 , automatically give spots to candidates with national recognition missouri requires only a 1 , 000 filing fee in new york , republican candidates are required to collect 82 to 890 signatures in each of the state s 31 congressional districts , with the level depending upon party registration in the district a minimum of 5 , 000 signatures must be gathered statewide what follows can be just as grueling flush with campaign funds , frontrunners have the luxury of challenging the petitions of other candidates over technical items like misspelled names , in a timehonored ritual that usually forces others to spend time and money in court defending their rights to the ballot in the end , it is possible for candidates to qualify in a patchwork of districts across the state each district elects three delegates to the republican national convention , regardless of how many republicans are in the district the rules this year are less stringent than those in place in 1996 after the uproar surrounding the last primary , gov george e pataki , a republican , agreed to lower the number of signatures that must be collected , sometimes substantially but some candidates point out that they still must set up an extensive statewide operation to mount a petition drive in each district there is no reason why new york law should be so difficult , said guy v molinari , the staten island borough president , who is bucking the party leadership by heading the mccain campaign in the state we have the most onerous election laws , and that is done deliberately to give the party in power the upper hand he said the campaign was still examining where it would try to qualify mr molinari and others opposing mr bush also asserted that senior party officials had told party regulars that they would be punished if they worked for rival campaigns in a quinnipiac college poll of new york republicans last month , mr bush was favored by 56 percent of respondents , followed by mr mccain , 17 percent , and mr forbes , 8 percent recent polls showed that in new hampshire , with the crucial first primary on feb 1 , mr bush and mr mccain were roughly even in new york , the same election laws generally apply to democrats , but this year s primary is not expected to stir the same backlash because the campaigns of both major candidates , vice president al gore and former senator bill bradley , believe that they will be able to gather enough signatures to get on the ballot throughout the state the state s democratic party is neutral in the primary , unlike its republican counterpart aides to mr pataki , who is a staunch supporter of mr bush , dismissed the other candidates' criticism , saying that mr pataki should receive credit for sharply reducing the number of signatures we believe that candidates with even modest support in the state will be able to get on the ballot , said michael mckeon , a spokesman for mr pataki asked whether mr pataki would advise the bush campaign to challenge the forbes and mccain petitions , mr mckeon said , we would like to see a good campaign , where the campaigns lay out the issues and the voters have choices , and we believe that ultimately , they will support governor bush jeffrey buley , general counsel to the republican state committee , said the party should not be blamed for the decisions by other candidates to avoid the state hatch got a late start , mr buley said as for gary bauer , i'm not really sure that he is a viable national candidate anyway jeffrey bell , a senior aide to mr bauer , said that if given the chance , mr bauer would have received strong support in new york , particularly if he performed well in the iowa caucuses on jan 24 and the new hampshire primary new york is in a class by itself in terms of discouraging competition from those who are n't wealthy or insider candidates , mr bell said for the forbes campaign , earning a spot on the ballot means reactivating the operation that it put in place for the 1996 primary , when it fought the rules by spending more than 1 million and successfully suing in federal court a judge ruled that the system was unduly restrictive , but his decision did not bar the governor and the legislature from establishing a similar structure for the 2000 campaign , which they did in june none of the candidates have gone to court over the new rules , though some are considering it in 1996 , the party leadership supported bob dole , the eventual nominee mr dole won easily , but the primary was the first in the party s recent history to be truly contested patrick j buchanan , now a reform party candidate , also qualified in some districts bill dal col , the forbes campaign manager , said that while the numbers were lower this year , the change was superficial it barely reduces the burden , mr dal col said it s every district and you know how arcane the rules are if one signature is bad on a page still , too many games are allowed to be played by the state party i would expect them to challenge our petitions at every turn because the last thing that the czars of new york want is multiple candidates where you can have a democratic vote chart the rules getting on ballot new york and a handful of other states hold presidential primaries on march 7 these are among the requirements for republicans who want a spot on the ballot new york collect 82 to 890 republican signatures in each of the state s 31 congressional districts , with the goal based on party registration in the district a total of 5 , 000 signatures is needed statewide signatures are often challenged by rivals , leading to costly legal fights california , connecticut , maryland , massachusetts candidates recognized in the news media as national contenders automatically win spots other methods for those who do not meet this standard georgia executive committee of state party

when nassau county s department of social services announced in april that it would no longer provide many substance abusers with transportation to treatment centers , halina schafer felt a sense of terror among the drugaddicted women in the intensive fivedayaweek treatment program she runs in freeport half a year later , ms schafer said , six of the nine women who relied on the free van service are using drugs again ms schafer , director of mercy women s day rehabilitation services , a program run under the auspices of mercy medical center in rockville centre , called the county cutback a precipitating factor in the quick relapse of one young woman who later bore a crackaddicted baby if we had the ability at that point to provide direct transportation for her , we might have had more leverage holding on to her , said ms schafer , whose 440 , 000ayear program gets its budget allocation funneled through the nassau county department of drug and alcohol addiction if you ask a client to walk to a treatment center , to go even a couple of blocks to a bus stop , it can create an additional problem for women who live in highly druginfested areas and pass crack houses for a woman trying to get to a treatment center with two children , a diaper bag and a stroller in tow , and she needs to take two buses to get here , you 've severely limited access to treatment ms schafer said that her program , like many nonprofit health and human service programs in nassau county , can no longer fill gaps created by lost or stagnant government funding dwindling state and federal funding is prompting nonprofit health and social service providers to cut back services and spend more time fundraising , administrators at nonprofit agencies said county contributions have remained flat over the years , but service providers said the county s gaping 300 million budget deficit had intensified a labor dispute with health and human services workers and had prolonged contract renewal processes involving nonprofit agencies as the county sought ways to cut costs dozens of nonprofit social service agencies contracted by the county to provide for its residents have seen delays in county reimbursements for all the talk of trimming waste and patronage from the county budget , health and human service providers fear that the financial ax will fall hardest on programs intended to help some of the county s most disadvantaged residents a lot of these organizations have a hole in the budget that the county does n't fill , said jack o'connell , executive director of the health and welfare council of long island , which represents 300 organizations with nassau s financial house in disarray , the great fear is that the county would utilize its budget cutting on an already crippled health and human services sector peter clement , an assistant to the soontoretire nassau county social services commissioner , irene lapidez , pointed to areas into which the county has pumped more money as a result of welfare reform , such as day care and domestic violence he denied that the delayed reimbursements were caused by the budget deficit and attributed them to computer problems that have now been corrected but he did not answer questions about the transportation issue and other lapses in social services health and human service agencies operating in nassau asserted that efforts to save money in the short term could strain them further and force the county to bleed unnecessary red ink something as simple as transportation has financial impact of far greater value in many other county systems when a client is not able to maintain abstinence and build sobriety , ms schafer said women who have a drug problem have family court or criminal court mandates to treatment , so we 're looking at potential problems in child protective services , we 're looking at potential problems in probation and parole systems the deficit has also caused an exodus of senior social services managers and other county employees responsible for executing contracts with nonprofit agencies the county workers are taking early retirement rather than see their salaries and pensions cut mental health service providers said their clients were also enduring lapses in service caused by a labor dispute that county officials said was intended to keep costs in line , but that mental health caseworkers and labor leaders said was an attempt at union busting in june , the county sent layoff notices to 93 caseworkers who oversee most of nassau s mental patients the county tried to restructure the program so that the caseworkers would be employed by four nonprofit mental health agencies the caseworkers are seeking recognition as county employees and want the county to provide better wages , health insurance and other benefits the county , trying to save money , argues that they are employed not by the county but by federation employment and guidance service , inc , a manhattanbased contractor , and therefore are not eligible for civil service pay classification and benefits
washington , sept 8 president clinton testified for an hour today in the investigation by an independent counsel into accusations that secretary of labor alexis m herman illegally solicited campaign contributions for mr clinton s 1996 presidential campaign the independent counsel , ralph i lancaster , interviewed mr clinton under oath at the white house this morning as part of an inquiry into accusations of campaign finance violations and influence peddling by ms herman mr clinton was represented by his chief private lawyers , david e kendall and nicole k seligman , and three lawyers from the white house counsel s office mr lancaster was joined by two lawyers from his office , david barry and john t kotelly mr kotelly last year represented larry l cockell , the lead agent in mr clinton s secret service detail , in his appearance before the federal grand jury investigating the monica lewinsky matter the white house would give no details of the president s testimony , and mr kendall declined to comment calls to mr lancaster s office were not returned a lawyer involved in the case said mr clinton was interviewed as a witness and was not a target of the investigation the lawyer said the interview suggested that mr lancaster s inquiry was nearing an end the white house said in a terse statement , the interview lasted one hour and was conducted under oath it also said , consistent with prior practice , no further statement about the interview will be made the investigation of ms herman has been virtually invisible since mr lancaster was named in may 1998 as the fifth independent counsel to investigate accusations against the president and senior members of his administration w neil eggleston , ms herman s lawyer , said that contact with mr lancaster s office had been sporadic over the last year and that the inquiry had required little of his time and virtually none of ms herman s attorney general janet reno said last year when she approved the appointment of an independent counsel that she had found no evidence clearly demonstrating wrongdoing by ms herman but ms reno said the accusations and the law compelled her to initiate the inquiry the investigation arose from accusations from laurent j yene , a businessman from cameroon in westcentral africa , that ms herman took cash kickbacks in 1994 from a client of his seeking a federal license for a satellite telephone system mr lancaster is also looking into accusations that ms herman used her position as white house director of public liaison in mr clinton s first term to illegally solicit campaign contributions from clients of the consulting firm she ran before joining the administration in 1993 ms herman was appointed secretary of labor in 1997 the investigation of ms herman is the last to pose a threat to a member of mr clinton s cabinet henry g cisneros , the former housing secretary , pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of lying to federal investigators on wednesday and paid a 10 , 000 fine mike espy , mr clinton s former agriculture secretary , was acquitted on bribery charges the investigation of bruce babbitt , the interior secretary , is winding down and the independent counsel inquiry into former commerce secretary ronald h brown ended when mr brown was killed in a plane crash in croatia in 1996 kenneth w starr , the independent counsel who investigated the lewinsky matter and business dealings of mr clinton collectively known as whitewater , chose not to seek indictments of mr clinton or hillary rodham clinton staff members are preparing a final report for congress
he is long island s champion political escape artist , the houdini of mineola but as he struggles with a huge budget deficit , a health insurance scandal and a drumbeat of reported abuses at the county jail , the nassau county executive , thomas s gulotta , faces his greatest challenge ever , maybe even a career breaker in his 12year tenure , mr gulotta has survived setbacks and rebounded to score even bigger election triumphs than before now some politicians say his luck may be running out i think tom realizes he s living on borrowed time as well as on borrowed money , said one public official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , who has talked with mr gulotta and the chairman of nassau s republican party machine , joseph n mondello mr mondello has made little secret of his exasperation at the mounting difficulties and has even revived talk that he might engineer mr gulotta s resignation and , by appointment of the county legislature , take over the county executive s job himself for awhile to straighten out the mess no one expects such a drastic step any time soon , however instead , mr mondello is first trying to get top county officials to solve the problems themselves to that end , earlier this month he summoned mr gulotta , comptroller frederick parola and the county legislature s presiding officer , bruce a blakeman , to a meeting at party headquarters in westbury though relations among the four men have been rocky , for now they seem to be trying to harmonize for gop selfpreservation mr gulotta has been grappling with the largest deficit in nassau s history , officially estimated at 160 million to 190 million for 1998 the deficit projection for 1999 is 125 million , which would be the second biggest deficit , and bondrating agencies have put the county on notice that its creditworthiness may be downgraded mr gulotta is also saddled with a scandal over the transfer of the county s health insurance to benefit plan administrators the contract was supposed to save up to 15 million , but instead raised the county s costs by as much as 50 million the red ink and sloppy supervision of the contract are damaging enough , but it s the smell emanating from the deal that may hurt the republicans most mr gulotta s chief deputy , robert j mcdonald , helped arrange the contract , then retired and began collecting a 150 , 000 annual fee from william m blake , the former suffolk county republican party chairman and head of the brokerage that underwrote the deal and then there is the federal investigation into charges of abusive guards at the nassau county jail , a case prompted by an inmate s brutal homicide there sheriff joseph jablonksy , who runs the jail , is mr gulotta s appointee these successive setbacks are hardly the way mr gulotta hoped to celebrate nassau county s 100th anniversary this year this is a defining moment for those of us in county government , mr blakeman said this is an opportunity for tom to show that he has the leadership skills to solve tough problems mr gulotta has begun to tackle the issues , ending the insurance contract and announcing a series of revenueraising moves but mr blakeman has also grown increasingly assertive on behalf of a usually docile legislature , issuing investigative subpoenas , calling the county budget director s testimony a disgrace and accusing mr mcdonald of a conflict of interest republican leaders are clearly nervous , not just about mr gulotta and his future , but about the rest of the party they fear repercussions for their ticket in this fall s offyear elections all 19 seats in the legislature are up , as well as 27 local offices in the towns of hempstead , north hempstead and oyster bay and the cities of glen cove and long beach republicans control the legislature by a lopsided majority , 14 seats for them and 5 for the democrats the backtoback 199899 deficits could not come at a worse time for the republican legislators they may be forced to impose tax increases or program cuts or both in adopting the next budget a vote that by law must come just before the election although he is not running this year , mr gulotta s record will surely be a focal campaign issue if he proves to be a major liability , he may have the most to lose if the republicans reach the point of it being either him or them , then something s going to happen , said arthur j kremer , a former democratic state assemblyman from long beach if the county gets downgraded to junkbond level , gulotta s not invincible lewis j yevoli , the former democratic supervisor of oyster bay , who lost to mr gulotta for county executive in 1997 , said i do n't think he survives this time he s got nine lives , but i think he s into his ninth life despite mr gulotta s woes , most politicians contend that it would be a big mistake to write him off so soon i 've been on standby half a dozen times for the political wake of tom gulotta , and it has n't happened yet , so do n't ever count this guy out , said bruce nyman , the legislature s minority leader comptroller parola said i would never underestimate him we 're obviously going to have a deficit , but there is time to deal with it mr gulotta actually has plenty going for him for starters , nassau has no impeachment or recall process to remove him , and he has nearly three years left in his term

washington , june 28 consulting their political as well as their ethical compasses , members of a white house ethics panel decided in a straw vote today to recommend that federally financed scientists be allowed to derive stem cells from human embryos as well as to conduct research on stem cells derived by others the vote by the national bioethics advisory commission , which follows the recommendation of its draft report released last month , frames a position that some members hope will be more acceptable to abortion opponents in congress than that of the national institutes of health , the principal source of universities' biomedical research money embryonic stem cells can develop into almost any tissue of the body in the seven months since they were first isolated , they have aroused intense interest as a possible allpurpose tissue repair kit for a host of afflictions but of the two principal ways in which the stem cells can be harvested , the more convenient involves the destruction of a living embryo the embryos , microscopic blobs of a few hundred cells not yet ready to implant in the uterus , are ones that have been discarded by fertility clinics in the other method , cells are taken from aborted fetuses , a use that the commission views as arguably equivalent to transplanting kidneys or corneas from a cadaver the line the commission seeks to draw must run through morally contested ground , between those who say an embryo deserves the same rights as a person , and those who believe the prospect of significant medical progress justifies the destruction of embryos members of congress opposed to abortion have incorporated the first view into a clause that prohibits federal money for any research in which an embryo is destroyed for the last three years the clause has been attached as a rider to the bill setting the national institutes of health s budget officials of the institutes hope to finesse the rider with a legal opinion issued in january by the department of health and human services the opinion holds that federally financed scientists can do research on human embryonic cells derived with private money , though it would be illegal for them to derive the cells themselves although 33 nobel laureates have endorsed embryonic stem cell research , no fewer than 70 members of congress are furious with the department s interpretation of the rider , saying in a letter that the financing of embryonic stem cell research would violate both the letter and spirit of the federal law in a draft report released last month , the ethics commission agreed that it was morally inconsistent to let scientists do research on cells they could not legally derive there is no compelling ethical justification for distinguishing between the derivation and use of human stem cells , the commission said it concluded , as a draft recommendation , that federally funded scientists should be allowed to do both at today s meeting , one member , dr thomas h murray , president of the hastings center , a research organization that deals with ethics issues , said that having the government support research on the cells but not their derivation would in fact be the better policy because it would avoid offending those who are troubled by the destruction of embryos i think we speak to a great number of americans who have complex views and who are undecided , and many of these will find a distinction between use and derivation useful with respect to public funding , dr murray said but other members said privately that they thought that antiabortion members of congress would be more likely to respect a consistent position on the derivation and use of the cells when a straw poll was taken between this position and dr murray s , there were 10 votes against dr murray s proposal , 3 abstentions and apparently none in favor we ought not hide behind the idea that this is just use , said alexander m capron , an ethicist at the university of southern california law school that is what the nih tried to do , but i do n't think it will convince the people who need to be convinced commission members said human embryonic stem cells could be derived by a method that is indisputably legal and far less controversial than using embryos discarded by fertility clinics that is to culture the cells from aborted fetuses during fetal development , a batch of embryonic cells known as the germline cells is sequestered as a future source of sperm or eggs embryonic stem cells were developed from a fetus s germline cells last november they are assumed to be equivalent to the stem cells derived from embryos , although this has not been proved to derive stem cells from fetal tissue is a slog it s extremely difficult , said david r cox of the stanford university school of medicine but what would be lost , the commission several times asked itself , if it recommended approval of just the fetal source of stem cells and left for later a decision on using spare embryos \? the answer given by dr cox and by carol w greider of johns hopkins university was that research with embryoderived stem cells would then speed ahead in private companies federally supported researchers would not be able to contribute , impeding progress , there would be no system of federal oversight , and an important new area of science would be completely controlled by private companies the commission s report will be completed in july , said its chairman , harold t shapiro , president of princeton university one test of its success may be how it plays in congress , where opponents of stem cell research plan to reintroduce the rider though advocates of the research can now emphasize the probable benefits of stem cells , the balance of forces seems at present too close to call nih does n't know that they have the votes to reverse the prohibition , said richard doerflinger , associate director for policy development at the national conference of catholic bishops but i do n't know that my side has the votes to get language that would explicitly ban it

washington , dec 27 it does not resemble a bunker its computers have suffered the same routine glitches that computers do in every other office suite but as the millennium approaches , two floors of a nondescript building near the white house have been transformed into command central for the federal government s response to year 2000related emergencies the information coordination center , as it is officially known , will open for business on tuesday morning it will begin 24hour operations on thursday by the time midnight arrives on dec 31 , as many as 200 government bureaucrats will be in place on the 8th and 10th floors of 1800 g street , along with scores of journalists , industry representatives and others if all goes according to plan , details of a sudden power failure in bangladesh would flash across the computer screen of john a koskinen , who is president clinton s year 2000 coordinator , as would news of a run on automated teller machines in bangor , me cots are available in the center for naps coffee will be brewing at noon and night mr koskinen will provide media briefings from the center , and he will talk with vice president al gore , who has been designated the white house contact , on a secure line is there a button mr koskinen can push to start the atm s working in maine \? no , the command center s goal is not to fix year 2000 problems , but to gather information about such glitches and help coordinate the government s response from the outside , the 12story building is run of the mill for downtown washington owned by private investors , it houses the veterans affairs department on three floors and the world bank on another three until recently , the headquarters of the secret service was there concerned about security , government officials refuse to describe exactly what devices the command center contains but a tour today revealed a vast expanse of computers , walls of glass creating a futuristic command center look , and large tv monitors and world maps in case the lights go out , the building has two generators in the basement and a third one that had been installed for the secret service the building is also equipped with a system to keep computers running if the power is interrupted , said robert e carl , the building manager creating the center cost about 30 million , officials said operating it until june , the date officials expect to wrap up their work , will bring the total cost to about 50 million but the expense is necessary , mr koskinen said although government command centers exist in the white house , the pentagon and numerous other departments and agencies , none were appropriate for this unique situation , mr koskinen said there was no other place in the government that was geared up to handle this volume of information , said mr koskinen , who considers the year 2000 conversion the greatest information processing exercise since world war ii a typical hurricane only concerns a handful of states , mr koskinen explained even the bombing campaign in kosovo was centered on a specific region , he noted in contrast , the date rollover could cause problems anywhere in the world the command center will receive reports , filtered through the federal emergency management agency , from similar command centers set up in every state the center will also gather data from year 2000 coordinators in 180 countries worldwide embassies and military bases will also forward updates a test of the computer system at the command center about a month ago disclosed some glitches but the computers passed a followup test after a new year s eve trip to new york city to reassure the public that airplanes are up and running , mr koskinen plans to spend most of his waking hours , and perhaps some of his sleeping ones , at the center despite the expense and work of putting it all together , he said he would be pleased if it did not turn into a beehive of activity

washington , jan 15 following are excerpts from the presentation today by representative steve chabot , republican of ohio , in the senate impeachment trial of president clinton , as recorded by the federal news service , a private transcription agency as one of the managers who represents the house , i am here to summarize the law of perjury while today s discussion of the law may not be as captivating as yesterday s discussion of the facts , it is nevertheless essential that we thoroughly review the law as we move forward in this historic process i will try to lay out the law of perjury as succinctly as i can without using an extraordinary amount of the senate s time , but i beg you to indulge me in the united states criminal code , there are two perjury offenses the offenses are found in section 1621 and 1623 of title xviii of the united states criminal code section 1621 is the broad jury , the broad perjury , statute which makes it a federal offense to knowingly and willfully make a false statement about a material matter while under oath section 1623 is the more specific perjury statute , which makes it a federal offense to knowingly make a false statement about a material matter while under oath before a federal court or before a federal grand jury it is a wellsettled rule that when two criminal statutes overlap , the government may charge a defendant under either one as you know , the president s false statements covered in the first impeachment article were made before a federal grand jury therefore , section 1623 is the most relevant statute however , section 1621 is applicable as well what constitutes perjury the elements of perjury there are four general elements of perjury they are an oath , an intent , falsity and materiality i 'd like to walk you through each of those elements at this time first , the oath the oath need not be administered in any particular form , but it must be administered by a person or body legally authorized to do so in this case , there has been no serious challenge made to the legitimacy of the oaths administered to the president , either in a civil deposition in the jones vs clinton case or before the federal grand jury the next element is intent to this day , the president has refused to acknowledge what the vast majority of americans know to be true , that he knowingly lied under oath the president s continued inability to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth has forced this body , this jury to determine the president s true intent the intent element requires that the false testimony was knowingly stated and described this requirement is generally satisfied by proof that the defendant knew his testimony was false at the time it was provided as with almost all perjury cases , you will have to make a decision regarding the president s knowledge of his own false statements , based on the surrounding facts and , yes , by circumstantial evidence this does not in any way weaken the case against the president in the absence of an admission by the defendant , relying on circumstantial evidence is virtually the only way to prove the crime of perjury the federal jury instructions which federal courts use in perjury cases can provide helpful guidance in understanding what is meant by the requirement that the false statement must be made knowingly let me quote from the federal jury instructions when the word knowingly is used , it means that the defendant realized what he was doing and was aware of the nature of his conduct , and did not act through ignorance , mistake or accident so as you reflect on the president s carefully calculated statements , remember the federal jury instructions and ask a few simple questions did the president realize what he was doing , what he was saying \? was he aware of the nature of his conduct , or did the president simply act through ignorance , mistake or accident \? the answers to these questions are undeniably clear , even to the president s own attorneys in fact , mr ruff and mr craig testified before the judiciary committee that the president willfully misled the court let s listen to mr ruff and i'm going to respond to your question i have no doubt that he walked up to a line that he thought he understood reasonable people , and you may be , have reached this conclusion , could determine that he crossed over that line , and that what for him was truthful but misleading , or nonresponh sive and misleading , or evasive was , in fact , false in an extraordinary admission , the president s own attorney has acknowledged the care , the intention , the will of the president to say precisely what he said the president s actions speak volumes about his intent to make false statements under oath for example , the president called his secretary , betty currie , within hours of concluding his civil deposition and asked her to come to the white house the following day president clinton then recited false characterizations to her about his relationship with ms lewinsky
i sort of shudder at the word 'hot , ' said jerold l stodden , lead manager of the alleghany chicago trust growth and income fund that sort of denotes a nearerterm outlook on things while mr stodden prizes a fastrising equity , his firm s investment discipline requires a fiveyear history of stable growth in sales and earnings that standard , intended to reduce risk , rules out bets on many technology yearlings but the fund , with 504 million in assets , has done just fine without any of the new internet stocks or other volatile holdings that have helped so many funds it returned 331 percent for the 12 months ended april 9 , versus 233 percent for the standard poor s 500stock index , according to morningstar inc , the chicago financial publisher and for the five years ended that day , it returned 288 percent a year , on average , versus 274 percent for the s p mr stodden , 56 , has been with chicago trust , which advises the fund and is a subsidiary of the alleghany corporation , for three decades he has managed the fund since its inception in december 1993 nancy m scinto , 39 , has been his comanager since december 1997 and has been with the firm since 1984 , when she started as an analyst ms scinto emphasized the fund s longterm perspective we hold our companies usually for a long time , she said i think a little over 20 percent of the current portfolio has been there since inception the portfolio usually contains 35 to 40 stocks , none of which account for more than 5 percent of assets stock selection begins with a computer screening , to find companies that are outperforming the s p 500 in measures like earnings growth , sales growth and return on equity special attention is paid to a company s pricetoearnings growth ratio in this case calculated as its priceearnings ratio for the period two years hence multiplied by its expected twoyear earnings growth rate and then we look at the level of stability of historical earnings not the growth rate , but the stability of the earnings pattern over the past five years , mr stodden said we try to find companies that are more stable than the market itself the process yields about 350 to 400 stocks the group that is then handed over to the analysts , ms scinto said the firm s five analysts look at company balance sheets , business models , competitive market positions , strategies and management before making recommendations to the firm s equity committee , which is composed of five senior portfolio managers , including mr stodden the committee picks the stocks but then it s up to the individual managers to implement those decisions , mr stodden said the managers choose how to buy those stocks and what to sell to raise cash walgreen , the drugstore chain , has been in the growth and income fund nearly from the start ms scinto is impressed that the company has grown through internal expansion , rather than through acquisitions she also lauds walgreen s technology the company uses a computer program , for example , to determine what size vial is used to fill a prescription the fund started buying walgreen in 1994 for 5 a share it is now at 256875 ms scinto said she expected walgreen earnings to grow about 16 percent a year through 2000 , with share prices at least keeping pace the fund has held cintas , a workuniform rental company , since april 1996 , when it was at 26 it closed on friday at 6350 mr stodden said cintas should benefit as more businesses hire contractors to supply and clean uniforms the market is still very lowly penetrated , maybe only 25 percent penetrated , he added , and cintas has by far the largest market share the company , he added , has had 26 years of consecutive growth he estimated annual earnings growth at 20 percent over the next two years , with comparable increases in the stock price one of the fund s newest purchases is omnicom group , the big holding company for advertising agencies the fund started buying omnicom in december at about 54 a share it now trades at 751875 the stock accounts for 25 percent of the portfolio this management is viewed as having some of the best financial controls on a company , ms scinto said , but they 're also the most creative , and in an advertising agency , that s key to getting net new business wins she said omnicom has had consistent growth , attributable in about equal proportion to new work for its existing clients , signing of new clients and acquisitions of other agencies she estimated earnings growth for the next 12 months at 18 percent and said the stock price

austin , tex , feb 12 for three weeks , doctors , corrections officials and inmates have been describing to a federal judge here the conditions in texas' vast network of prisons , and much of the testimony from the prisoners has been a grim litany of abuses and humiliations one man described being locked in a cage for five days another suffered a stroke , but his guards , failing to recognize it , simply ridiculed his stumbling gait rather than immediately summoning medical help yet another , driven to despair by abuse , tried to kill himself by biting into his arm until he hit a vein prisoners told of being raped by other inmates , beaten by guards , covered in pepper spray one prisoner , who said he had been locked naked in a cell while still coated with pepper spray , recalled his solution shamefully , i went over to the commode and spread out the water on the floor and rolled around on it and cleansed myself off as best i could on the strength of such accounts , backed by the testimony of medical and outofstate corrections experts , lawyers for the prisoners of texas have argued in the proceeding here that the federal court supervision to which the state s prison system has been at least partly subject since 1980 should continue the state , on the other hand , maintains that the experiences of abused inmates , though regrettable , are little more than anecdotes that do not provide a thorough picture of the prisons it is time for our prison system to stand on its own two feet , gregory coleman , a lawyer for the state , said in closing arguments today we have come a long ways , thanks in large part to the courts , but we believe we have now arrived it is time for us to move into the future on our own during the hearing , state prison administrators testified to the improvements made in the system in the last two decades , including better training for guards , a more stringent policy on their use of force and closer attention to prisoners' medical needs medical experts testifying for the state argued that the prisoners' lawyers had relied too heavily on the misfortunes of a handful of inmates instead of looking at the system as a whole , which , with 73 prisons and more than 140 , 000 prisoners , is second in size only to california s the case argued here has roots dating from 1979 , when , after trial of a classaction lawsuit filed on behalf of texas prisoners , a federal district judge , william wayne justice , ruled the prison system unconstitutional because of horrific overcrowding , abuse by guards , poor medical care and other cruel conditions the following year judge justice demanded a raft of reforms and imposed daytoday oversight of the system by the federal courts in 1992 , after the gradual introduction of policies aimed at easing crowding and safeguarding prisoners , the judge issued a final ruling he returned daytoday control of the system to the texas department of criminal justice but left in force injunctions requiring the state to take specific steps dealing with matters like abuse of prisoners and any inadequate medical care the hearing that began in austin on jan 21 before judge justice yes , the very same , 78 years old now resulted from a request in 1996 by dan morales , then the texas attorney general , that even those final injunctions be lifted and full control of the prisons be given back to the state \( the newly elected attorney general , john cornyn , made ending the federal oversight a part of his campaign platform \) each side was allowed 50 hours of testimony and one hour to sum up , and when final arguments had ended today judge justice said he would decide by march 1 whether the state s prisons should be free of federal supervision for the first time since jimmy carter was president overcrowding , the main failing that emerged from the 1979 trial , was corrected long ago , said mr coleman , the state lawyer what this hearing focused on were prisoners' preying on one another , being physically abused by guards and being denied proper medical and psychiatric care in closing today , donna brorby , appointed by the court to argue on behalf of the prisoners , as she did in 1992 , said the evidence clearly showed that texas was denying inmates the minimal civilized necessities of life and that only with the inducement of continued federal injunctions was the state likely to continue improving its prisons the easily forgotten bottom line is that prisoners are human beings , ms brorby said they have human feelings and human needs mr coleman responded by saying none of the testimony had been sufficient to show that abuses were prevalent or frequent enough to warrant continued federal oversight what constitutional problems that may have existed in the texas prison system , he said , they are but a memory of an era which has now long since passed ms brorby said the state was relying on volumes of new policies it had developed under court supervision but had not determined whether the prisons were actually complying with them in fact , she said , some conditions are as grim as ever , with the powerful preying on the weak and corrections officials either joining in or looking the other way they continue to deceive themselves , ms brorby said , by looking at their accomplishments photos judge william wayne justice will decide whether to lift court supervision of texas prisons \( lynne dobson austin americanstatesman \) meal time at a maximumsecurity unit , part of a vast network of texas prisons under renewed court

if a tree falls at christie s officials at christie s chose christmas eve to send all staff members email announcing that christopher m davidge , chief executive worldwide since 1993 and a 34year veteran of the company , was leaving to pursue other interests edward dolman , managing director in new york , will replace him while few at christie s expected the news to come just as everyone was leaving for the holidays , it did not come as a surprise a management shakeup had been expected since the french investor francois pinault bought the company a year and a half ago mr pinault is known for waiting a year after acquiring a business before making major changes it was also well known at christie s that there was bitter conflict between mr davidge and several top board members and that he did not always get along with mr pinault christie s said that mr davidge declined to comment on the reasons for his departure he plans to move on to different things , mr dolman said there have been rumors that mr davidge was talking with the french investor bernard arnault , who bought phillips , the londonbased auction house , two months ago but mr dolman emphasized that none of mr davidge

hampton bays is not the hamptons , said a friend who has a house there still , with the coming of bistro 26 , this laidback community is acquiring a bit of hamptons style while the new restaurant is not dropdead gorgeous like some east end spots , it is nonetheless a charmer it certainly makes a different statement than the sports bar that it replaced eyes are drawn to its rafter ceiling and the slim balcony that circles the room there , an atticload of antiques provides interest residing there are skis , oars , a wooden plane propeller , baskets , pots , plates and a row of kerosene lamps the rest of the decor runs to shiny wood floors , interesting pictures and plates on the walls , glass bottles in the windows , nosegays of flowers on the papercovered tables and huge potted palms and other greenery peeking out from corners of the room jeff kent and george torres are fulfilling every chef s dream they have opened a place of their own the two cooks acquired most of their experience on the chichi side of the shinnecock canal their last stint was at the independent in bridgehampton the two friends also shared chef duties at duke s in east hampton a few summers ago the dining room staff is accommodating , without a hint of attitude a reminder or two was needed , though , to get more butter or replacement silver the restaurant lives up to the bistro in its name \( the 26 refers to its address on montauk highway \) with its offering of steak frites this bistro staple was the best dish sampled a satisfying piece of beef with bordelaise sauce and a knob of herb butter melting on top , a classic watercress salad and a tangle of super fries those crispy potatoes can also be ordered a la carte they arrive in a paper cone , belgian style the best opener was not a european tempter but that american favorite manhattan clam chowder bistro 26 s version is bursting with flavor thyme , bacon , clams , a load of chunky vegetables and , surprisingly , mussels another fine brew was the soup of the day , a smooth tomatocurry puree with garlic croutons and nubbins of chicken the caesar salad sports similar croutons , along with a thin toast spread with a black olive paste it was pleasing , but the endive and roquefort salad is even better toasted walnuts , thin slices of anjou pear and a smooth sherry vinaigrette add to its appeal an appetizer special of smoked scottish salmon , a clump of salad , creme fraiche crowned with caviar and a wedge of crispy potato cake was a treat also making the alist were the grilled panhetta prawns , three jumbos mated with white beans and salad the antipasto of grilled asparagus , roasted peppers , marinated olives and small balls of fresh mozzarella , and the panseared crab cake the last is a large patty of solid crab with a standout topper of scallions , basil and tomatoes one evening it was also offered as an entree two cakes , haricots verts and a wedge of layered potatoes speaking of potatoes , the opener the menu calls a warm vegetable gratin is mainly sliced potatoes it is served with a disk of melting goat cheese on top and a handful of salad on the plate it , along with the hohum country pate , were the least memorable starters forgettable , too , were the two pastas sampled rigatoni bolognese and penne with sauteed chicken the latter had a tangy lemon flavor , but was still not in the same league as the meat entrees the rigatoni featured a sauce chunky with cubed beef and a big scoop of icecold ricotta cheese on top , which never melded into the sauce a second beef entree gives the steak frites a run for the top prize braised short ribs were fallawaytender and arrived with mashed potatoes , carrots and meltinyourmouth leeks another hit was the roasted chicken liberally perfumed with rosemary a special of sliced club steak , cooked exactly to order , was augmented by sauteed mushrooms and a yummy bernaise barbecued salmon and a grilled pork chop were the alsorans both were overcooked and dry the chop was nearly saved , though , by its spicy southwestern flavors and seductive hominysweet corn stew most of the desserts are homemade and definitely worth the calories the fallen chocolate souffle cake with ice cream and valhrona chocolate sauce is a decadent delight the same sauce can be had over ice cream for a tiptop sundae the creme brulee was silky perfection and the apple crisp a la mode homey and good it would have been even better if it were served warm , not steaming hot from the microwave a commercial cheese cake \( holy moses brand \) was another worthy pick bistro 26 26

albany , friday , aug 6 finally calming the partisan tensions that have buffeted it all year , the state legislature ended its annual session early this morning by forging a lastminute deal with gov george e pataki on a handful of outstanding issues the governor and the legislative leaders agreed on measures that would stiffen penalties for stalking and for blocking abortion clinics , expand the state s database of dna specimens from criminals , and allow the construction of new power plants they focused on those bills after jettisoning others that proved too nettlesome , including one that would have permitted new york to join the multistate powerball lottery while officials here hailed the latenight compromise , it was reached nearly two months after the legislature had planned to adjourn , and the topsyturvy negotiations that dragged on throughout the day and into the evening on thursday could serve as a primer on the difficulties of getting things done in albany in fact , the deal came together after the senate majority leader , joseph l bruno , threw up his hands on thursday afternoon , broke off discussions with the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , and ordered the senate closed for the session but in a highly unusual spectacle , mr silver kept the assembly working into the night and continued negotiating with mr pataki , even though it was not clear how the bills could become law with the senate having decamped shortly after 10 on thursday night , mr pataki , mr silver and mr bruno announced a deal under which the assembly would approve the bills immediately and the senate would do so the next time it is in session perhaps as soon as next month , but more likely in late november , when the legislature plans to return for a short special session the governor and the legislature had earlier agreed to extend a law that allows thousands of people to live in otherwise illegal loft apartments , mostly in lower manhattan the republicans had been withholding their approval in an effort to wring concessions from the democrats on other bills the law had expired on june 30 , leaving tenants fearful of eviction until late thursday night , the talks had yielded mostly grief , and the disarray on the lawmakers' last day of work had seemed an apt finale to one of their least productive sessions in recent memory as with the state budget , which the legislature approved this week after missing the deadline by more than four months , all sides at times seemed more willing to dig in their heels than to hand a victory to the opposition the session , which began in early january , had been scheduled to conclude on june 16 , but it was repeatedly extended because of the haggling over the budget while the governor and lawmakers had attained some accomplishments by this morning , they had long ago abandoned bargaining over dozens of other measures , including one that would loosen the rockefellerera penalties for drug crimes and another that would change the rules regarding polluted industrial sites this has been a frustrating and exasperating session , mr bruno said before the compromise was announced not just today and yesterday , but practically since we started the session after negotiating well into wednesday night , mr bruno , who is known for his impatience with albany s penchant for delay and gamesmanship , gave up he had the senate pass the latest drafts of the important remaining bills and send them to the assembly , adopting a takeitorleaveit approach with the assembly speaker the senate then recessed mr silver , a manhattan democrat , rejected those versions of the bills , but then spent thursday evening cobbling together new compromises with mr pataki mr silver s spokeswoman , patricia lynch , acknowledged that the negotiations were unconventional i have never seen it quite done this way , she said the collapse in talks before the latenight deal was caused largely by the longstanding albany strategy of linking unrelated measures to exert leverage in other words , one side refuses to approve a bill until another agrees to endorse a separate measure the connections can often become so convoluted that in the end , either all the measures are approved or none of them are those tactics infuriated some supporters of the bills , who assumed that with the governor and the legislature in general agreement and seeking only to resolve minor disputes , the bills would easily become law abortion rights groups had lobbied the senate republicans for months to support the clinic access bill and were jubilant after they dropped their opposition in june but by thursday afternoon , the groups were despondent , only to rally again after learning of the compromise i have never seen an issue that was this up , this down , this unsettled and then finally came out all right , said joann smith of family planning advocates blocking access to an abortion clinic is already prohibited under federal law , but the federal statute is not often used a state law can be enforced by the local police the assembly has passed the bill several times , and the calls for a state law gained urgency with the killing last year of dr barnett slepian , a buffaloarea doctor who performed abortions mr pataki has pressed for mandatory collection of dna fingerprints from all felons , a measure that had also been advocated in new york city by mayor rudolph w giuliani and police commissioner howard safir just as fingerprints collected from criminals can be put into a computer and matched to those found at crime scenes , a dna database would allow law enforcement officials to match hair , skin or blood samples left at a crime scene to the files of known criminals the state already collects dna information , usually from a saliva sample , from people convicted of certain violent crimes , including sex crimes , or about 8 percent of all felony convicts mr silver had wanted to limit the new categories of criminals who would be subject to collection under the bill , which was opposed by some civil liberties groups , the state would gather specimens from all violent felons and those convicted of several other kinds of offenses photo members and staff of the new york state senate leaving the chamber after the end of the session yesterday afternoon the assembly worked into the night , however , as negotiations with the governor continued \( associated press \) \( pg b8 \)

the dialogue came at a delicate time of a player s career , near its conclusion , which , doc rivers believes , explains the revulsion he had for the job he now loves this was five years ago at the knicks' training base and rivers had just aired out his feelings over his diminishing playing status he and pat riley , power coach , argued until they both were out of breath finally , riley said you 're like me , stubborn you 'll coach in this league i do n't know , riles , rivers answered i'm a family guy look at you , all wound up in this working 24 hours you have no friends what particularly alarmed rivers was that riley did n't argue with him at the time i had that conversation , i was reaching the point where i just wanted to get away from the locker room , rivers said after returning yesterday to madison square garden , where , in two and a half years , he cultivated a decade s worth of unwavering support allan houston saved the depleted knicks from rivers s dogged magic , 9996 , with 30 points and the gamewinning jumper judging from the way orlando played , hard to the last threequartercourt heave , riley was the world s bestdressed prophet rivers was , to borrow from another highprofile sideline stalker , born to coach maybe he was kidding himself all along , just biding his time when he played in san antonio , where a serious playoff run was sabotaged when dennis rodman sat on the sideline in socks when his wife became pregnant with their fourth child , rivers took a job as a television analyst the following year , someone set fire to his home outside a san antonio golf course the family was away r c buford , a spurs assistant coach and close friend , happened to be on the course when the house went up he found a way in , asked himself a question most of us have what should he save \? he got the family photo albums and the videotapes of the kids , rivers said he went in twice and was going to go in again when the police said they 'd arrest him if he did with friends like that , rivers reminded himself , he did n't need a coaching job not to have time for them he led a stressfree broadcasting life , watching the game continue to devolve into riley s ultimate vision of basketball , as a hockey score after a while , it made him crazy watching guards walk the ball up the court , the shot clock ticking , the fans yawning by last season , his third in headphones , rivers found himself , at courtside , conjuring up alternative game plans i realized i still had something left on the bench , he said he rejected a chance to be milwaukee s general manager the garden s dave checketts had a chat with him about the knicks' gm job , before the friendly bounce of houston s runner in miami that rerouted jeff van gundy s career the nets , wasting valuable time as phil jackson s bluff , could not have done any better than rivers but then , rivers was in a rare position for a former africanamerican player who was never a boxoffice draw he had some leverage himself and was too smart to start at the bottom of the ladder , set up to fail so he signed with orlando , which promptly jettisoned most of its disgruntled veteran talent poor doc , people said poor nothing , he said , over his early dismay , now embracing the franchise blueprint we 're not going to be rebuilding very long , i 'll tell you that the magic has denver s and golden state s firstround draft picks this season , and a bundle more in the next three years it has salary cap room to kill for these are not amenities one should necessarily bank on , but , as rivers said , orlando s weather is this league is about recruiting now , he said the money s the same everywhere and orlando is where tiger woods lives ken griffey jr wesley snipes wesley snipes \? oh , right white men ca n't jump and the magic , as currently assembled , ca n't win except orlando , stripped to its salary cap core , has been far more competitive than , for contrast s sake , the exceedingly wellcompensated nets rivers s players get to run he tries not to hustle them he admits it is easier to speak his mind to what is , excepting darrell armstrong , a collection of role players i tell them my opinion and it does n't have to be their opinion and they do n't have to like it but , so far , they do , he said if i had five superstars , i might not be able to coach the same way if he had latrell sprewell , he said he would have had to say that sprewell did n't handle his return to golden state too well he would have told sprewell that shaking p j carlesimo s hand would not have been selling out rivers added , but that s none of my business unfortunately , van gundy has responded similarly , the inevitability of building with flawed beams dissent becomes house rule in orlando , there has been speculation that rivers could lure tim duncan next season , based on their relationship when rivers was broadcasting spurs games this is a remote possibility , and one the coach cannot comment on he is n't on television anymore , free to share every who , what , why , where and whimsy he is a coach , his career bio presented on page 319 of the national basketball association register , on the page opposite florida s other main man on the bench once again , rivers is face to face with riley , who told him this was exactly where he 'd end up photo doc rivers returned to madison square garden for the first time as coach of the magic yesterday \( jeffery a salter the new york times \)
solidgold cutlery will not grace the dining tables and the tenor in the shower stall next door will not be caruso , but the landmark hotel knickerbocker at broadway and 42d street may one day welcome overnight guests again , after eight decades as an office building as times square history is uprooted around it , the coppercrowned knickerbocker a sumptuous architectural confection that never really lost its french renaissance flair would emerge as a rare survivor of the theater district s earlier gilded age , the last time a century turned numerous new hotels are being built or planned around times square but none can compete with the knickerbocker s lineage built by the astors and adorned by maxfield parrish s mural old king cole and his fiddlers three , the 15story knickerbocker opened in 1906 as a fifth avenue hotel at broadway prices only two blocks from the old metropolitan opera house , it was a home away from naples for enrico caruso , who posed on the rooftop for weddingday pictures with dorothy park benjamin in 1918 only three years later , with business falling under prohibition , the hotel closed and was converted to office use today , known as 1466 broadway , the building s tenants are mostly sportswear manufacturers but the s l green realty corporation , which bought the building last year , has different ambitions for the property and is marketing it to hoteliers through lehman brothers we think there s tremendous potential for its being a hotel , said stephen l green , chairman of the board and chief executive of s l green that s what it was built for a moderate hotel for tourists at broadway and 42d street \? mr green asked rhetorically sounds good to me for now , the building s chief function seems to be as a gap billboard the facade is cocooned in scaffolding that is covered by protective mesh panels , about 50 feet high , printed with gigantic images of three impassive youths wearing orange and gray gap vests the scaffolding went up in march and will remain for another year or more while inspectors from bone levine architects meticulously examine the complicated , landmarked stonework , as a statement from s l green described the process once this is finished , any needed repairs will begin whenever you put up pipe scaffolding , you have to put up protective mesh , said christopher pollack of s l green ordinarily , facade inspection is performed on rigs hoisted from rooftops but the steep threestory mansard roof at 1466 broadway made that impossible , so scaffolding was installed the mesh is covered in gap imagery because the chain s flagship new york store occupies the base of the building , the statement from s l green said in june and july , the department of buildings issued notices of violations for the gap signs it s not so much that you ca n't have signs , said ilyse fink , a spokeswoman for the agency it s that they erected them without permits the scaffolding itself has been authorized benjamin feldman of s l green said the company was discussing the violations with city officials to make sure we clear this up although s l green believes a hotel is probably the highest and best use of 1466 broadway , mr green said , it would be happy to continue operating the building for the garment trade if no buyers were found s l green specializes in buying , upgrading and leasing older class b office buildings it acquired 1466 broadway , the graybar building at 420 lexington avenue and 25 west 43d street last year from the helmsley interests for 165 million the knickerbocker was developed by john jacob astor \( 18641912 \) , who also built the st regis hotel at fifth avenue and 55th street and the astoria hotel later joined by a hyphen to his cousin s waldorf hotel on the site of the empire state building richly encrusted with terra cotta and limestone pediments , balustrades , keystones and quoins , the knickerbocker looks like the work of many hands , as it was the architects marvin davis , bruce price and trowbridge livingston and artists like parrish , frederic remington and frederick macmonnies about 1 , 000 guests could be lodged there and 2 , 000 patrons seated in its many dining rooms , which included a private chamber with solidgold service for 48 another novel feature was a corridor lined with settees and heraldic banners that led directly to the times square subway station \( to this day , there is a doorway at the east end of the shuttle platform , bearing a masonry plaque reading knickerbocker in letters eight inches tall \) the hotel was converted to office use in 1921 and known as the newsweek building from 1940 to 1959 when the magazine , then owned by vincent astor , was the main tenant the parrish mural was eventually installed at the st regis , as the focal point of the king cole room with the demand for office space in times square almost nonexistent in 1980 , harry b helmsley and david baldwin began converting the building to residential lofts , using city tax incentives commercial demand surged as the project neared completion , so they changed course and marketed 1466 broadway as a showroom center , a kind of northern outpost of the garment district the landmarks preservation commission designated it a landmark in 1988 as one of the very few grand hotels in the beauxarts style surviving in the times square area although the facade is now largely obscured , the commission does not regulate scaffolding or scaffold signs , said the chief of staff , terri rosen deutsch , because they are viewed as temporary installations and they do not damage the building photos the hotel knickerbocker in times square , now known as 1466 broadway , may become a hotel again , after being bought by a realty company that would like to convert it \( don hogan charles the new york times \) below , the facade in 1997 \( david w dunlap the new york times \)
i spend a lot of time compromising , and you just do n't see it before talking about the source of that quotation , let s go to chinatown many merchants and residents there fear that a cherished tradition , rooted in a culture dating back thousands of years , is about to be outlawed once again by city hall fiat this is a centuriesold custom of setting off firecrackers to celebrate the chinese new year , which will begin on feb 16 on the chinese lunar calendar , with its repeating cycle of 12 animals , it will be the year of the rabbit a sweet year , you might say , because those born in it are said to be affectionate and tranquil in chinatown , the new year was ushered in for decades with lion dancers wending their way through the neighborhood while red firecrackers popped away and heightened the excitement this was not noise for noise s sake , an asianamerican version of the familiar yahoo approach to the fourth of july for the chinese , red is a symbol of good fortune the firecrackers themselves have spiritual meaning their noise scares off evil spirits , and their smoke carries away bad spirits that may linger without any firecrackers , it is no celebration at all , said paul lee , whose family has owned general store on mott street since 1891 this view was echoed by another mott street businessman , jan lee \( no relation , as they say \) jan lee is also a director of a liondance troupe called the chinatown community young lions the whole celebration of the lion dance is tied to the firecrackers , he said the lion dance without firecrackers is like the st patrick s day parade without bagpipes or marching bands yet for the last two years , chinatown has been silenced on its big day because mayor rudolph w giuliani has preferred to ban the firecrackers as a supposed menace to public safety last year s holiday was the dreariest in memory , local residents said streets were largely empty , and many stores did not bother to open never mind that city hall could not say what serious injuries in chinatown had been suffered in the past never mind that organizers of the celebration had arranged last year for an amply controlled pyrotechnics display , with barricades to keep crowds back and with an ambulance and a firetruck on hand just in case something went wrong the mayor said no , and that was that do n't mention tradition , he said his exact words were , before we do this , like , cultural thing , we have to sort of , like , get real here the authorities in beijing , too , had clamped down on fireworks , he noted , apparently taking comfort in the fact that his policy matched that of the communist regime no question , mr giuliani has supporters in chinatown , businessmen like ronald liong , a pharmacist on mott street i prefer the ban , mr liong said i think fireworks are hazardous but actually , one way or another , it does n't matter to me it does matter , though , to many of his neighbors some feel demeaned by the mayor s downplaying of the cultural issue others are still offended by a city hall spokeswoman who waved off the profireworks forces last year as people who condone a dangerous life style , as if they were dope peddlers or gun runners but a new year brings a new chance to work something out , said robin mui , vice chairman of the asianamerican education and heritage foundation although mr mui was not overly hopeful about mayoral flexibility , he pointed out that city hall s opposition to fireworks was not absolute somehow , macy s is allowed to blast away along the east river on the fourth of july i think if a corporation can have a pyrotechnics display , why not a community \? mr mui said deputy police commissioner marilyn mode said discussions with civic leaders in chinatown began last month but no one doubts that ultimately it is up to mr giuliani to decide whether there is a way to satisfy all parties the man is the man , mr mui said we 're doing it his way now which brings us back to the unattributed quotation at the top of the column the person who said he spends a lot of time compromising was none other than the mayor himself , in an interview with city hall reporters last week jan lee said he was curious to see in the weeks before the new year if that spirit of compromise could extend to chinatown and its customs
the adventures of roberto rossellini by tag gallagher illustrated 802 pp new york da capo press paper , 2450 in the preface to his biography of the italian film director roberto rossellini , tag gallagher describes how , as a penniless young film buff , he slept outdoors in the rain and on any available floor over the course of three nights so that he could see rossellini s threepart television movie , the age of the medici gallagher s extreme , even obsessive dedication to his subject informs much of the adventures of roberto rossellini he appears to have tracked down almost anyone connected to rossellini every friend , relative , former girlfriend and professional collaborator the result is an 802page biography that is both exhaustive and exhausting on the positive side , we do generally learn a good deal about the circumstances under which rossellini made his films this is particularly useful in the long chapters gallagher devotes to rome , open city and paisan , which changed film history and virtually founded the genre of italian neorealism these chapters are examples of how biography can contribute something important to one s understanding of major works of art at the same time , gallagher s passionate attachment to his research occasionally makes the book prolix and indiscriminate he appears to have fallen in love with his own research to a point where he is unwilling to part with even the smallest detail we learn , for example , what the rossellini family valet did during world war i , as well as what rossellini ate when filming in india although gallagher , the author of john ford the man and his films , is a worshipful partisan of rossellini the filmmaker , he is fairly candid and detached about rossellini s faults as a man the portrait that emerges from these pages is of a charming and talented rogue who seduced producers and actresses , borrowed money shamelessly without the least intention of repaying it , left his servants unpaid on the theory that they should have felt lucky to work for such a great man although he talked endlessly about his position as a moral filmmaker , in his own life he behaved with colossal selfishness toward the women he kept seducing and the children he kept producing rossellini s early life gave few signs of artistic promise born in 1906 , the son of a wealthy roman building contractor , he was an indifferent student who grew into a spoiled playboy rossellini liked fast cars , fast women and cocaine and spent his way through a substantial inheritance when he ran out of money in the mid1930 s , he wandered almost accidentally into the italian film industry on the strength of friendships and his appealing personality rossellini , like many in italian film under fascism , worked under the patronage of vittorio mussolini , il duce s oldest son , who had a passion for movies and the company of intellectuals although rossellini made a few movies that could be described as fascist propaganda , vittorio mussolini created an atmosphere of comparative tolerance and openness , lightyears from the ideological ferocity that led to leni riefenstahl s triumph of the will none of his early work , however , provides any genuine anticipation of the extraordinary breakthrough rossellini achieved in 1945 , with the making of open city the experience of the war , and especially the 10 long months in which the germans occupied rome , appeared to have been the turning point in his life and career the german occupation during which rome became a theater of mass arrests and narrow escapes , of desperate antifascist resistance and bloody nazi reprisals brought out previously unsuspected depths in rossellini he and some of his filmmaker friends , in particular the scriptwriter sergio amidei , conceived the idea of making a film about the german occupation as they waited for the allies to arrive in rome almost as soon as the german troops left , rossellini sprang into action collecting anecdotes and stories they had heard during and after the occupation , he and amidei created a fictional film filled with real incidents and real people shot while the war was still raging in the north of italy , with numerous scenes in the recently evacuated streets of rome , the movie captures the pain , anger and humiliation of the occupied city in an extremely palpable way at one point , gallagher writes , a crowd of onlookers had to be restrained from attacking extras dressed in german uniforms the sense of authenticity in open city electrified moviegoers around the world and made rossellini an international celebrity it remains quite justly his most important and popular film , and its success gave him the money and freedom he craved to take his innovations much further as gallagher points out , open city was more innovative in its subject matter than in its technique it worked within the confines of a highly detailed script and , while using some nonactors , is dominated by the powerful presence of anna magnani and aldo fabrizi , who were established stars of italian film in paisan , rossellini worked with only a loose script , which he

washington , may 5 speaker j dennis hastert met today with more than two dozen house republicans who were pushing for an early vote on overhauling the nation s campaign finance laws , but he made no commitment to act earlier than the end of september although majorities in both the house and senate last year supported a bill that would ban unregulated and unlimited donations to political parties , the republican congressional leadership put up an array of procedural hurdles to try to stop passage of the legislation the bill died when its supporters in the senate fell 8 votes short of the 60 needed to cut off a filibuster and bring the bill to a vote with fundraising for the 2000 presidential and congressional races already under way , the sponsors of the legislation want a house vote by the summer in order to put pressure on the senate with republicans holding a narrow majority in the house , the small group that met with the speaker today could force an early vote by joining with democrats on a petition so far they have avoided such a step , but several republicans said they noted the possibility in their meeting today we made it very clear that september is too late , representative marge roukema , republican of new jersey , said after the meeting she and others said mr hastert said he would consider their request asked what would happen if mr hastert does not move up the timetable , ms roukema said flatly , then we 'd have a large problem representative christopher shays , the connecticut republican who is the principle sponsor of the bipartisan bill , refused to comment the other sponsor is representative martin t meehan , democrat of massachusetts after the session , mr hastert released a statement promising a vote on campaign finance legislation by september which an aide said meant no later than the end of september the speaker also said , i have serious concerns about certain definitions of reform that unduly regulate free speech and that unfairly discriminate against certain political parties the republicans traditionally raise more money they also object to the bill because of its efforts to rein in the ability of independent groups to run advertisements attacking or endorsing candidates in the period before elections they have wanted instead to limit the ability of labor unions , a big backer of democrats , to put large sums of money into campaign efforts mr hastert s position has put the republican moderates in the difficult position of deciding how far they will go in challenging their new speaker in a year in which the narrow balance of power in the house has led republicans to put a premium on staying united democrats last month began their own effort to force the campaign finance measure to the floor by signing a special petition that can be used as a way to circumvent the house leadership so far the democrats have gathered 191 signatures they need 218 to prevail and could do so if the 32 republicans who are cosponsors of the shaysmeehan bill also sign none have so far , and they still seemed today to be looking for ways to avoid that step several did say they had pointed out to mr hastert that they could choose to go that route representative constance a morella , republican of maryland , said we did not threaten him we simply said , you know there s an awful lot of attention paid to this issue representative zach wamp , republican of tennessee , noted that mr hastert had said he would take their pleas for an earlier vote into consideration and get back to them he did n't rule it in , mr wamp said he did n't rule it out he said the group did not give the speaker a deadline for a decision let s not tie him down and beat him up , he said let s give him a few days some of the allies of the republican backers of the overhaul legislation were growing impatient mr meehan , the bill s chief democratic sponsor , said the majority of them want to give the speaker the benefit of the doubt the doubt at this time is beginning to far outweigh the benefit he said that if the speaker did not budge on his timetable , democrats could begin taking drastic actions and use parliamentary tactics to tie the house in knots fred wertheimer , president of democracy 21 , a public policy group supporting the shaymeehan bill , said , speaker hastert wants the moderate republicans to be coconspirators in killing their own campaign finance reform legislation as the group of republicans pressed today for a vote , the house subcommittee on the constitution heard conflicting testimony on whether such legislation would violate constitutional guarantees of free speech in a sign of the odd coalition that has arisen in opposition to the campaign legislation , representatives from both the american civil liberties union and the conservative cato institute spoke out against key elements of the shaysmeehan bill
makobola , congo , jan 9 there is no doubt that something awful happened here dozens of mud huts are burnt to the ground in one the horns of a charred goat poke through the ashes most people have fled fresh dirt is piled up over at least four bodies the question and it may be impossible to answer now is whether there are more graves here , perhaps hundreds more a roman catholic news agency reported this week that at least 500 people , many of them women , children and the elderly , were massacred by rebel troops last week in their fivemonthold war to overthrow president laurent kabila the rebels strongly deny the charge , and today they escorted a group of journalists , along with their own investigators , to this town of about 5 , 000 people in south kivu province , eight days after the last of the killings reportedly took place soldiers closely tailed the reporters villagers were reluctant to talk but standing aside one grave , a man said his grandmother , nakashindi , was burnt alive in her house by rebel soldiers another man , even as he stood next to a rebel commander , said soldiers had torn through the town , shooting and burning huts , including his own perhaps as many a 100 dwellings looked like they had been razed everything was burned , he said even my clothes were burned he said 15 civilians had been killed in his little cluster of huts alone a number that exceeds the rebels' contention that only 10 civilians died in the entire town , people they say were caught in crossfire in two battles in all , the man said , 600 people died in makobola the commander , charles muchu , scoffed did you notice that they never say 200 died or 250 \? he said they all say 600 that s the same number that the church gives they all heard it on the radio keeping the moral high hand is exceedingly important to the rebels , and they are eager to refute the allegations of a massacre today ernest likongo , the rebel commander in charge of the region , gave his account of what happened early on dec 30 , he said , a band of attackers ambushed a small army post in makobola , 10 miles south of the eastern city of uvira , on lake tanganyika he identified the attackers as militiamen from the hutu ethnic group from neighboring burundi and mayimayi warriors , a loose federation of particularly fierce fighters in the kivu area both groups are reportedly aligned with mr kabila a battle broke out after rebel reinforcements arrived , he said , and two days later the town was again attacked a third ambush followed on jan 3 in all , he said , 3 rebel soldiers were killed , along with 10 of the ambushers and 10 civilians caught in crossfire , including two mothers and their two babies both he and other rebel officials said it was possible that more civilians were killed , but he said that none were killed systematically and that the numbers were wildly inflated five hundred is too many , commander likongo said that s a whole village the account differed starkly from that given by the missionary service news agency , which cited witnesses in reporting that it was the rebels who had carried out three days of killings , starting jan 30 they also said soldiers from rwanda , which along with uganda is backing the rebellion , carried out the attacks , a charge that rwandan officials deny as several foreign governments , including congo s former colonial power , belgium , called for an outside investigation , the international committee of the red cross in nairobi said six of their volunteers had been killed in the village both sides in the conflict have been accused of carrying out mass killings , and mr kabila had been accused of similar atrocities when he came to power it s unfortunate it takes a makobola to make the outside world remember that there are daily tragedies , human suffering and the killing of innocent civilians , going on not only in the kivu but the whole democratic republic of the congo , said nina galbe , the red cross spokeswoman in nairobi , who called on all parties in the conflict to spare civilians' lives in two closely supervised hours roaming around makobola , reporters saw no mass graves , though several villagers said there was one several miles away bullet casings littered the road almost everyone agreed that there had been an attack on the army outpost , and several people said the attackers had also looted homes the took my bike , said bahati shabani , a 20yearold english teacher and father of three sons they even took many of my clothes , and my wife s we tried to ask them 'who are you \?

the search for new music can take you on some long trips in 1994 the search took me to the new orleans jazz and heritage festival , a place that had become a kind of mecca to music fans since its inception in 1969 and is now almost overgrown in its mass popularity , drawing a couple of hundred thousand people every year i had been told that it was the place where you could still make discoveries even then , the festival was booking international headliners the allman brothers , wynton marsalis , little richard , buddy guy but i had been writing about music jazz and pop for nearly 10 years , and i was looking for something new , something that had n't yet been picked up by a major label or sucked into the electronic media whirlwind the year before , a friend had raved about a relatively unknown northern mississippi bluesman named r l burnside who , he said , played the best rhythm guitar he had ever heard as often happens , the new sound came from a completely unexpected source on one of the festival s many open stages , in the hot louisiana sun , a small ensemble was creating a frenzy in front of them , a couple of dozen dancers were kicking up dry grass and a cloud of dust the band in its entirety consisted of fiddle , accordion , guitar and triangle the fiddle and accordion players looked ancient they played mostly in a driving twostep beat that kept the dancers going occasionally there was a waltz the songs seemed vaguely blues and folkderived but beyond that the music , to me , was incomprehensible the fiddle and accordion players took turns singing in high , wailing french in their keening nasal inflections , the vocalists sounded out of tune , and so for that matter did the violin , which the fiddler never seemed to tune in fact , he responded to offpitches only by playing harder the accordion , meanwhile , pumped out syncopated melodies of doubled notes , more or less in synch with the fiddle i did n't know what i was hearing , but i was immediately attracted to it the beat , as in so much of american vernacular music , was irresistible and so was the commitment and energy of the players , the participation of the dancers and other onlookers i could n't attempt to judge this music i did n't even know what to call it , after all what s more , i was divorced from it by language and by social background \( i am middleclass jewish guy living in boston , having had no more in common with the frenchspeaking black and white rice farmers of southwestern louisiana than i do with the taliban rebels in afghanistan \) only later did i discover that the fiddler onstage that day , canray fontenot , and the accordionist , alphonse \( bois sec \) ardoin , were two of the most important living exponents of louisiana s indigenous creole music , music that later branched off into the countrystyle cajun music of people like d l menard \( and , most famously , hank williams s jambalaya \) and the randbinflected zydeco of clifton chenier of course , the thrill of discovery is what had drawn me to new orleans in the first place , the sensation of not knowing , whatever the familiar trappings i had experienced that sensation before discovering jazz in the early 70 s , i had come across a charles mingus album in a friend s collection i knew mingus only by name the first tune had an abstract title , folk forms , no 1 , and though it began with a perceptible theme and vaguely new orleansstyle parade rhythm , it soon took off into a collective improvisation that i could n't follow the music stopped and started at unpredictable points in one passage , it seemed that the musicians themselves were hesitating , unsure of where to go next intellectually , i was fascinated i could n't judge for myself the legitimacy of what i was hearing , but the recording had the authority of mingus s fame \( and that of at least one of his sidemen , eric dolphy \) , and the name of a famous jazz critic \( nat hentoff \) as producer and linernote writer something else must have grabbed me , too , because i kept listening to it , over and over again that kind of experience has been at the core of my interest in music and the arts in general yes , an accumulation of knowledge about a musical genre can lead , ultimately , to an appreciation of its niceties but it is the initial , naive , purely emotional response to a new form of music that sets one on the road to learning about it sometimes , the experience has been akin to overhearing a language in another tongue at other times , the familiar and the strange combine in new and exciting ways of course , in time , if we pursue them far enough , even our strangest passions become familiar through listening to more mingus and other jazz over the years , my ear began to pick up on the jazz vocabulary , the kind of patterns that lend meaning to both music and speech the same thing began to happen with louisiana s creole music i attended more festivals i caught cajun and zydeco stars in their tours of the northeast the music engaged my intellectual curiosity and , besides , it was fun to dance to i saw boozoo chavis , beau jocques , c j chenier , d l menard , walter mouton , beausoleil i even began to write about it a little and gradually , the combination of curiosity and the urge to dance passed into the connoisseurship that true fans experience as a kind of love when menard \( the cajun hank williams \) played a small club near boston , i was as thrilled as i 'd been seeing bob dylan perform live for the first time or hearing the jazz musician steve lacy s new york homecoming concert in the late 80 s and when menard sang the first notes of la porte en arriere \( the back door \) i experienced at once the strangeness , of it the french language , bent notes and nasal inflection made him sound as out of place in somerville , mass , as they had seemed natural on the new orleans fairgrounds and the familiarity of being in the presence of an acknowledged master
after falling further behind than ever in reducing the snarled backlog of citizenship cases , local immigration officials have forsaken their problematic computer system and begun processing 120 , 000 mislaid naturalization applications the oldfashioned way by hand the files , stranded in a kind of digital purgatory for up to three years , represent the delayed dreams of many legal immigrants in the new york city area like nearly two million similarly hopeful applicants nationwide , they have waited in vain through three computer experiments , five naturalization directors and many earnest promises for the immigration and naturalization service to fix its chronically ineffectual system for deciding who will become a united states citizen and as they have waited , often at the cost of a hopedfor family reunification as well as other benefits of citizenship , the naturalization backlog has caused a new set of problems in other immigrant services in concentrating staffing and money on plowing through the pileup of naturalization cases , the agency now finds itself with a ballooning backlog of unprocessed applications for permanent residency , work permits and the temporary protected status that was offered to hondurans late last year after hurricane mitch devastated their country nationally , more than 18 million people are waiting for their citizenship applications to be acted on , about the same number as were waiting at this time last year to get permanentresident status , the immigration service said , an applicant must now wait an average of 33 months , up from only 21 months a year ago they keep making these socalled improvements and things just keep getting worse , said mark hetfield , a lawyer at the hebrew immigrant aid society in washington , a private organization that assists and resettles immigrants for some reason , he added , the ins is cursed in that it can never get a new data system up and running every time they move toward automation , they have problems that other agencies and businesses do n't experience agency officials do not use loaded words like cursed to describe their technological travails but their frustration with the last few years' worth of computer trial and error is now openly voiced as soon as they fix one problem , another pops up , said mary ann gantner , the deputy director of the new york district of the immigration service that has been particularly true for her district and for the vermont service center , a support arm of the agency that is supposed to enter applications into a computer system so appointments can be made to take fingerprints and interview applicants for several years , both offices have been bombarded regularly with letters and calls from thousands of immigrants seeking information about citizenship applications sent in 1996 and early 1997 , but not acted on but no one was absolutely sure how many of these waylaid files there were , in part because the computer system lost track of most of the files as they were being transferred from one new program to the next ms gantner said she had determined that 120 , 000 old new york naturalization cases from those years were still stuck in a form of computer limbo , and she had 40 , 000 of them brought as paper files from vermont to new york city for hand processing she had to make a special plea to headquarters officials in washington we said , send us those and we will do what we used to do and do well , ' ms gantner recalled her staff has now plowed through 19 , 000 in the last two months and scheduled the applicants for interviews this month and next the 80 , 000 files that remained in the vermont service center are being handled manually by immigration officers there we 're touching each one of them to make sure everything is correct , said paul novak , the center s director he has hired 30 new employees just to deal with the old cases , bringing the staff to 48 , and he said they had already processed 10 , 000 officials said they found that many applicants had never been given an appointment for fingerprinting so had to be scheduled for a criminal record check others had waited so long for an interview that the validity of their background check had expired and fingerprints needed to be retaken together , the vermont cases are a full 40 percent of the new york citizenship processing backlog , which stood at 307 , 000 cases at the end of may only the los angeles district has a bigger caseload of pending naturalization applications , with 369 , 000 cases waiting for action at the end of april , the last month for which the agency could provide statistics the new york district temporarily lost more files to computer error than other districts because it raced through more different systems in a shorter period than most at each juncture where the pipes have to meet on the system , some cases would just not go through , said mary ann wyrsch , the federal agency s deputy commissioner nowhere else in the country , she added , is so much of the catchup work on citizenship being done without computers it took us a while to realize we could n't deal with this in a systems way , ms wyrsch said it is terribly resourceintensive , but now new york s productivity has gone very high but judging progress is difficult because the agency s statistics about new york are the products of the same filelosing computer systems that helped create the backlog
washington , feb 8 following are excerpts from the presentations today by the house managers in the senate impeachment trial of president clinton \( today s excerpts were recorded by the federal news service , a private transcription agency \) f james sensenbrenner jr republican of wisconsin when this trial began four long weeks ago , we said that what was on trial was the truth and the rule of law that has not changed despite the lengthy legal arguments you have heard the truth is still the truth , and a lie is still a lie , and the rule of law should apply to everyone , no matter what excuses are made by the president s defenders the news media characterizes the managers as 13 angry men they are right in that we are angry , but they are dead wrong about what we are angry about we have not spent long hours poring through the evidence , sacrificed time with our families , and subjected ourselves to intense political criticism to further a political vendetta we have done so because of our love for this country and respect for the office of the presidency , regardless of who may hold it we have done so because of our devotion to the rule of law , and our fear that if the president does not suffer the legal and constitutional consequences of his actions , the impact of allowing the president to stand above the law will be felt for generations to come the almanac of american politics has called me a stickler for ethics to that i plead guilty as charged because laws not enforced are open invitations for more serious and more criminal behavior this trial was not caused by kenneth starr , who only did his duty under a law which president clinton himself signed it was not caused by the house judiciary committee s review of the independent counsel s mountain of evidence nor was it caused by the house of representatives approving two articles of impeachment nor by the senate conducting a trial mandated by the constitution regardless of what some may say , this constitutional crisis was caused by william jefferson clinton and by no one else president clinton s actions , and his actions alone , have caused the national agenda for the past year to be almost exclusively concentrated on those actions and what consequences the president , and the president alone , must suffer for them this trial is not about the president s affair with monica lewinsky it is about the perjury and obstruction of justice he committed during the course of the civil rights lawsuit filed against him and the subsequent independent counsel investigation authorized by attorney general janet reno the president has repeatedly apologized for his affair , but he has never , never apologized for the consequences of the perjury and obstruction of justice he has committed perhaps those decisions were based upon a dick morris public opinion poll which told the president that the american people would forgive his adultery but not his perjury perhaps it was for another reason whatever the white house s motivations were , the fact remains that the president s apologies and the statements of his surrogate contritionists have been carefully crafted for the president to continue to evade and , yes , avoid responsibility for his deceiving the courts to prevent them from administering justice to keep a president in office , whose gross misconduct and criminal actions are a wellestablished fact , will weaken the authority of the presidency , undermine the rule of law , and cheapen those words , which have made america different from most other nations in the earth equal justice under law for the sake of our country and for future generations , please find the president guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice when you cast your votes christopher b cannon republican of utah i do know that the issue is grave and that your responsibility is great so i'm here today to ask you to set aside some of your natural inclinations , for the good of the country i would implore you , senators , both republican and democrat , to set aside partisanship , politics , polls and personalities , and exchange them for loftier inclinations , those of procedure , policy and precedent these are the only guidelines this body should have as the senate deliberates this case , i would ask that a few key facts never be forgotten that the president committed perjury when he lied under oath , and he obstructed justice the senate has historically impeached judges for perjury , even recently by some of you assembled here any american watching these proceedings who commits perjury will be punished by the law if the senate follows our nation s precedents of punishing perjurers and if the senate follows its own precedents of convicting perjurers , then there is only one clear conclusion in this matter conviction senators , we as americans and legislators have never supported a legal system which has one set of laws for the ruler and another for the ruled after all , our very pledge of allegiance binds us together with the language liberty and justice for all
the first signs that dr barbara zuckerpinchoff s life was about to come apart were small and seemingly innocuous as she lay on an operating table at new york university medical center in 1988 , preparing for the birth of her second child by caesarean section , her nose began to itch she felt terribly congested , her hands started to swell and her face turned beet red she told her husband she thought she was allergic to the hospital s airconditioning system but then her blood pressure started to dive and she was headed toward anaphylactic shock , a dangerous condition caused by an extreme allergic reaction as doctors rushed to take the baby from her womb , others pumped her with epinephrine to raise her blood pressure but it was not the airconditioner that caused her nearly to die nor was it , as she had suspected , the drug she received for pain relief it was , she was shocked to discover later , an allergic reaction to the latex gloves that covered the two sets of hands that dipped inside her during surgery that allergy was so severe , it ended her career as an anesthesiologist because she was unable to wear the gloves or to be near others wearing them more than 10 percent of the country s health care workers are allergic to latex , an allergy that was almost unheard of a decade ago about a halfdozen state legislatures , including new york s , have introduced legislation to limit the use of latex gloves in hospitals and other medical offices or to develop committees within their health departments to study the issue no important proposal has become law , however , often because of lobbying by glove makers critics complain that the federal food and drug administration has been slow to act on the problem and has taken too long even to consider regulating latex use in hospitals glove manufacturers say they are reluctant to turn out alternatives because doctors complain that nonlatex gloves are less comfortable and provide less protection and hospitals balk at the cost of the alternatives , which are usually about 30 percent more expensive than latex further , many medical professionals hesitate to admit that they could have the allergy , for fear of ruining their careers it is extremely serious , said anne schott , a spokeswoman for the new york state nurses association latex is everywhere in the hospital environment , and if someone develops a serious allergy , that is a huge impediment to a normal life experts said as many as 17 percent of those in health care who work almost exclusively in hospitals and with patients' fluids , like nurses in emergency and operating rooms , could be allergic to latex , since allergies to latex worsen with exposure to the material the illness affects roughly 3 percent of the general population , and since the late 1980 s , at least 30 people have died of latexrelated illnesses , experts on the allergy say the number is small compared with , for example , allergic reactions to penicillin , which cause 400 to 800 deaths a year the sharp rise in reported allergies , experts said , stems from a sevenfold increase in the use of the gloves since 1987 , when the centers for disease control and prevention began recommending that most health care workers wear them to protect against infection from hiv natural rubber latex , derived from the sap of the rubber tree , contains proteins that can cause allergies the powder that manufacturers sprinkle inside the gloves to help them slip easily onto hands absorbs those proteins , and when the gloves are snapped on or off , the powder is released in the air allergic reactions to the gloves , from direct contact or inhalation of the powder , range from hives to asthma to anaphylactic shock and even death there is no known cure for latex allergies , but treatments for the symptoms range from overthecounter antihistamines , for the mildest symptoms , to steroids , to epinephrine for shock \( doctors caution that not all hand rashes from gloves indicate a true latex allergy \) the allergy is unpredictable , and it can be devastating in some people , allergies build up slowly through the years , starting with hand rashes that turn into a serious respiratory disease others , like dr zuckerpinchoff , have no symptoms until they find themselves in nearfatal shock after a person becomes sensitized , routine chores can become threatening , the elastic in a pair of stockings toxic , a trip to the dentist impossible someone with the allergy cannot use latex condoms , which are generally believed to offer the best protection against hiv infection children s birthday parties are a menace , dr zuckerpinchoff said , since latex balloons can send her into a fit of wheezing and choking most troublesome is that those who are allergic to latex are often made much sicker when they seek treatment because doctors' offices and hospitals , where the air is thick with latex powder , are the most dangerous places this was true for lieut harold henderson , a military nurse in san diego who went into shock and died in 1997 during a hospital stay for an allergic reaction to latex
the evolution of hideki irabu from an uncaring and often puzzling pitcher to a devoted and usually reliable pitcher continued at yankee stadium yesterday the once valid questions about irabu s desire , his consistency and his pedigree for starting games in the postseason drift farther away every time he does what he did in an 83 victory over the toronto blue jays irabu fought , he battled , he scraped and , eventually , he succeeded there were atbats when irabu could have folded and let the blue jays creep closer but he kept throwing powerful fastballs and sweeping curveballs , and he refused to relent this was the new irabu , although he is really not new any longer he has been pitching this way for more than two months it helped that chuck knoblauch opened the yankees' half of the first inning with a home run for the third time in six games , and that later in the inning bernie williams followed with the first of his two homers and three of his five runs batted in to give irabu a 40 cushion it helped that the lead swelled to 62 after three innings , and that irabu gave up just one run in a fiasco of a fourth and then stopped the jays through the seventh i never had any doubts about his ability and his stuff , williams said of irabu he s right up there with the best in the game , and is showing that right now the feelings of invincibility that sometime circulate around the yankees because of last season should not fool anyone this was a crucial august game , because the talented blue jays are threatening to stage an actual race in the american league east they began the day just five games behind the yankees even joe torre , the yankees' manager , called the jays legitimate contenders not only for the wild card , but for the division so it was up to irabu to calm the growing edginess in yankeeland and make sure that the firstplace yankees would travel to seattle last night feeling safer irabu gave up three runs , struck out eight batters and walked none in seven innings to improve to 80 with a 311 earned run average in his last 12 starts and to boost the yankees' lead over toronto to six games he is 93 with a 389 era this season , and has been more consistent than roger clemens , david cone , andy pettitte or orlando hernandez he s got a little sense that he belongs , cone said he s been our best pitcher after the yankees battered kelvim escobar for five runs in the first two innings , irabu felt more comfortable he was comfortable enough to hit shannon stewart with a pitch , with two outs and none on in the third , after derek jeter had been hit in the left elbow by escobar it seemed obvious that irabu was retaliating , and it cost him when the next batter , tony batista , homered to make the score 52 irabu had a difficult fourth in which twoout singles by darrin fletcher and jacob brumfield sliced the score to 63 and left two runners on base the yankees were probably one hit away from calling the bullpen , but irabu blew homer bush away with a 22 fastball he retired 9 of the last 11 batters he faced to send the jays to their eighth loss in nine games against new york he had the one bad inning , but the wheels did n't come off , torre said he kept it together you can see that grit in him where he just hitches up the belt and goes after people even as williams , cone and torre called irabu the yanks' finest starter , irabu was cautious there is still a mysterious quality about irabu , and he is rarely forthcoming in interviews irabu said he had been helped by being allowed to throw as many as 120 pitches , and he dismissed any desire for vindication after being criticized by george steinbrenner before the season baseball is a sixmonth season , irabu said through a translator it s not something that shows what you can do in one or two weeks it takes time so there is no way to answer criticism over such a short period irabu has combated the criticism by getting better , which starts before he throws a pitch after irabu silenced boston , 133 , last friday , he ran laps around fenway park early saturday morning in a routine out of clemens s cy young handbook when torre came to yankee stadium hours before a recent game , he ambled through a barren clubhouse and figured he was alone but the manager was surprised when he went to the exercise room and found irabu sweating on a treadmill he s taken the starts and realized that he s not going to pitch for five days , so let s get the most out of it , torre said he s been a battler torre defended irabu , admonishing television reporters who asked whether steinbrenner deserved credit for the pitcher s turnaround and if torre expected the pitcher to collapse that is the old irabu this irabu is the best starter on the yankees and is pushing to be a central figure in october these next two months , i do n't know what is going to happen , said irabu , who did not pitch in the 1998 postseason i have n't really thought about i just want to throw as hard as i can and play as well as i can in the next two months inside pitch six of chuck knoblauch s nine home runs this season have been leadoff homers , and he has 23 leadoff home runs in his career but trying to hit flies can hurt knoblauch s swing i think my swing is a little better this year , which is producing more line drives , knoblauch said some of the homers i 've hit have been line drives when knoblauch , who is hitting 284 , was asked if he was playing his best as a yankee , he said yeah i mean i'm really not trying to think about it in his second rehabilitation appearance , jeff nelson pitched a scoreless inning for class a tampa against the clearwater phillies , striking out two and walking one photos yankees' hideki irabu , 80 in his last 12 starts , improved his record to 93 yesterday with a 389 earned run average \( photographs by g paul burnett the new york times \) bernie williams homering in the sixth inning yesterday he smacked two homers ,

washington , sept 17 when representative j dennis hastert became speaker , he pledged to work for a new tone of civility in the house to heal the wounds from impeachment in a move that went beyond symbolism , he even quietly reduced the speaker s reserve fund that had been used under his predecessor to help pay for congressional investigations of the clinton administration but the 106th congress is starting to look a lot like the last congress that newt gingrich led bitterly adversarial , with few accomplishments and a heavy emphasis on investigations fresh from the august recess , congressional committees are examining the 1993 siege near waco , tex , president clinton s decision to grant clemency to 16 members of a violent puerto rican nationalist group and the administration s russia policy in light of a criminal investigation into accusations that russians laundered money through accounts at the bank of new york and once again , with republicans issuing subpoenas and mr clinton citing executive privilege to rebuff them , the parties are hurling charges of bad faith at each other we 've had very little cooperation from this white house from day 1 , senator orrin g hatch , the utah republican who is chairman of the senate judiciary committee , said on thursday on fox special report with brit hume on the other side of the aisle , representative henry a waxman of california , the ranking democrat on the house government reform committee , which is investigating the texas siege and the clemency decision , accused the republicans of being bereft of ideas so they 're spending their time using taxpayer dollars to conduct partisan investigations against clinton and anything that will embarrass gore and the democrats , mr waxman said in an interview today the tone in congress stems in part from the republican majority s inability to push through an affirmative agenda that members can rally around the party is hampered by its razorthin majority , ideological divisions in its own ranks , a partisan democratic minority and president clinton s opposition to republican initiatives like the 792 billion tax cut that was supposed to be the crown jewel of the party s agenda so instead of moving an ambitious agenda of their own to keep control of congress , the republicans say they hope that gov george w bush of texas will become the republican presidential nominee and that they will ride his coattails to keep their majority the tax cut , which mr clinton has vowed to veto , will become a 2000 campaign issue , the republicans' exhibit a in arguing why the country should elect a president from their party right now , republican leaders are simply trying to pass mustdo spending bills and to fight off mr clinton s spending proposals by contending that such programs would eat into the social security surplus then they hope to emerge as best they can from debates driven in large part by the democrats over health care , gun control , increasing the minimum wage and overhauling campaign finance laws mr hastert pledged today , for example , that the house would hold its debate over how to regulate managed health care an issue that fractures the republican party in october and for the first time he committed to allowing a bill favored by democrats and some dissident republicans to come to the floor while some republicans would consider a managedcare bill an accomplishment they could run on , many are opposed to many provisions in the legislation coming to the floor the speaker is also pushing to get congress out of town by the end of october the speaker s view is the longer we stay in session , the more mischief can happen , said an aide to the house republican leadership the republicans' minimalist agenda may be only practical given the divided power in washington but it has created a vacuum that has allowed the latest investigations of the administration to become prominent even though none of these were on the horizon when congress began its august recess republicans say that this new round of inquiries has the blessings of the republican leadership and that the investigations are legitimate looks at serious policy questions did the federal bureau of investigation cover up its role in the texas siege \? did mr clinton make the grants of clemency , as some republicans charge , to help hillary rodham clinton s likely senate bid in new york \? has international monetary fund aid to russia been misused \? they note that even staunch democrats like senator charles e schumer of new york and robert g torricelli of new jersey have criticized the president s decision to grant clemency to the puerto rican nationalists and the inquiry into russia is being led in part by representative jim leach , an iowa republican who is far from being a partisan firebrand maybe these are things the american public wants investigated , said representative mark foley , republican of florida i do n't know that anyone was happy with the voyeurism with the president s personal life but here , for example , mr foley said referring to the investigation into suspected banking improprieties , there are serious indications that money was stolen from the imf still , republicans' zeal for investigations has hurt them before most notably last november when their focus on impeachment helped them lose five house seats democrats say the inquiries will backfire again any day that dan burton and henry hyde and bob barr are on tv is a good day for democrats , said james m jordan , the political director of the democratic senatorial campaign committee , naming three republicans who have been prominent figures in investigating mr clinton representative peter t king , a republican from nassau county who will be one of those looking into the russia situation as a member of the house banking committee , said his party must be careful to keep a judicious tone and not , for example , try to focus too heavily on vice president al gore when examining russia s finances mr gore has played a key role in the administration s policy toward russia we have to keep it at a policy level and show why we think the policy s wrong , said mr king , who was a critic of how his party handled impeachment we ca n't take it to the black helicopter stage and say al gore s a russian agent perhaps the most significant aspect of what is going on in congress is what it says about the ability of the republicans and president clinton to work together as mr clinton finishes his term the distrust and bitterness are so great that some republicans acknowledge that part of the reason their leaders opposed negotiations over a smaller tax cut is that they do not trust mr clinton enough to bargain with him there is this almost psychological lack of willingness to sit down and talk with the clinton administration about these issues , said richard e may , a former republican staff director of the house budget committee they think that whenever they negotiate with clinton they come in second place and with the new investigations starting , it is hard to see the climate suddenly improving
when selma sherman learned that her insurance was being canceled by her managedcare company , she did n't know how she would be able to afford the rezulin she needs daily to treat her diabetes after years of paying a monthly 5 copayment for her prescription , mrs sherman , an elderly resident of levittown , suddenly faced a monthly bill of 170 rivoli starr , a 75yearold woodmere resident , takes several medications every day , including two pills to control her blood pressure , one for cholesterol and another for acid reflux none of her prescriptions are covered by medicare , she said , adding , these medications cost a fortune and if you need an antibiotic , forget it i can understand why many people just stop taking their medications lillian curcio was paying 20 for a threemonth supply of cumadin when she learned she had exceeded the 500 annual cap on her insurance plan and would no longer be covered for prescription drugs her cost for a threemonth supply of the blood thinner immediately jumped to 45 when the elderly elmont resident also learned she would have to pay 8850 for a heart medication that had cost her 20 , she could not afford to get her prescriptions filled these examples reflect a growing trend among long island s elderly , according to a study recently completed at the request of representative carolyn mccarthy , a mineola democrat it was prepared by the house of representatives committee on government reform , of which ms mccarthy is not a member over several months , the study tracked the prices , in both independent and chain stores within her fourth congressional district in nassau county , of five brandname prescription drugs most commonly used by the elderly the five drugs investigated were zocor , a cholesterolcutter manufactured by merck prilosec , an antiulcer treatment made by astra merck procardia xl , a heart medicine made by pfizer norvasc , which reduces high blood pressure and is made by pfizer , and the antidepressant zoloft , also made by pfizer philip schiliro , staff director of the house committee , said the study showed that consumers who pay for their own drugs pay more than twice as much for the five monitored medicines as do hmo s and large insurance companies the price discrimination is an intolerable situation for many seniors , mr schiliro said seniors as a group use more prescription drugs than any other population , yet they can least afford them onethird of seniors do n't have insurance , many are on fixed incomes , and they are being forced to pay more than twice as much for their prescriptions many have had to choose between paying for their medications and buying food according to mrs mccarthy s office , 98 percent of her over65 constituents are on medicare , which until recently provided benefits that included prescription drugs and small copayments but this year , many managedcare plans withdrew their medicare programs , leaving thousands of elderly long islanders without insurance and forced to pay for their prescription drugs out of pocket other companies have annual caps of 500 to 1 , 000 for prescriptions , which many elderly use up within several months this system is cruel to seniors , mrs curcio said i 've been pretty ill and have to take several different medications when you 're not healthy , 500 for an entire year of prescriptions is nothing now i ca n't get any more medications paid for until january where do these companies think we seniors on fixed incomes are going to come up with the money \? john scanlon , a pharmacist at cvs in syosset , said the problem among elderly customers exists not only in mrs mccarthy s district , but throughout the island i 've seen customers in tears because they ca n't afford their prescriptions and do n't know what to do , he said many are not eating so they can pay for the medications they need i 've even seen customers buy cat food to eat so that they can fill a prescription the investigators , the pharmacists and the drug manufacturers disagreed over who was to blame mr schiliro pointed a finger at the manufacturers it s not the pharmacists who are making the money , but the drug companies , he said most pharmacies have small markups on prescription drugs , while the drug companies are engaged in discriminatory pricing that victimizes those who are least able to afford it thomas d'angelo , owner of franklin square pharmacy , said we 're making between 3 and 5 percent on a prescription it s the drug manufacturers who are making the money there is a two tier pricing one for insurance companies and another for retail pharmacies the preferred customers can buy the drugs up to 60 or 70 percent cheaper than i can then the uninsured elderly customers are stuck paying the higher prices , and at the same time , many local pharmacies are being driven out of business a spokesman for merck , the new jerseybased manufacturer of one of the five drugs monitored in the study , cast doubt on its conclusions
monroe , la this early in the quest , patrick buchanan seems to be sounding his patented campaign reveille as much for himself as for his political pitchfork brigades january and february that s when the armies will meet ! exulted the once and apparently constant presidential aspirant , sitting in a catfish restaurant here and waxing nostalgic for the merry field marshal s persona that was his signature in the 1996 republican primaries back then , mr buchanan scored such a stunning defeat over bob dole in new hampshire that he decided to return for the 2000 contest and here in louisiana , site of a caucus victory for mr buchanan in 1996 , he worked in mid may in obvious contentment among the discontented in the economically burnedout cotton fields and in the nearby pentecostal churches , preparing for the wintry battles to come nothing like it , the 60yearold candidate enthused over a mug of nonalcoholic beer , the strict spartan campaigner in these early organizing months of dogged trail work last time , with the momentum we had , thousands and thousands kept showing at our rallies even after we were finished , he said i felt like el cid up there on that horse , after i was dead mr buchanan s rich laugh pealed through the restaurant as he took stock of how different the 2000 challenge would be the social and economic conservative wing of the party that he exploited so promisingly four years ago is more crowded with candidates this time he must first prevail over them if he is to narrow things to another showdown opportunity against the party establishment candidate , as he puts it most likely gov george w bush of texas , by mr buchanan s reckoning you ask who i'm most concerned about right now and my answer is steve forbes s checkbook , mr buchanan continued not the candidate the checkbook , he said of the millionaire rival he beat four times in 1996 , only to see him come on with zombielike persistence as an eventual spoiler forbes had the money to stay in the game and wait down the road , mr buchanan said when he finally won in arizona , i lost the momentum to beat dole that i had won in new hampshire across his political decades as a superbly pugnacious polemicist and lateblooming candidate , mr buchanan has proved he is nothing if not personally indomitable he seems once more unfazed by the assessment of political handicappers that , in his third time around , the gleam has worn off his underdog candidacy as the irate populist pleading for forgotten workers and impassioned moral causes i just wonder whether buchanan s heart is in it , said the political analyst charles e cook jr he got traction in '92 challenging president bush , and he had a semblance of that in '96 with dole as a pretty good foil but i do n't really see it this time in his recent campaign forays across the country , mr buchanan has been tuning up small but dedicated crowds with his old energy , sharpening an early stump speech firmly rooted in opposition to abortion , free trade , the bombing of yugoslavia and a national culture of death he sees hollywood , not easy access to weapons , as the dominant factor in the recent school shootings this was about evil in the human heart , mr buchanan boomed here at a christian life pentecostal church after joining in the choir s rafterthumping round of singing and handclapping for jesus we 're going to make america a prolife country again ! he moved on the church stage hesitantly , a rusty political evangelist searching for the old fire , far from the cnn crossfire program that is his beltway sparring perch among campaigns one big difference this time is that behind the scrim of his busy schedule , much of mr buchanan s battletested '96 cadre had already been hired away by rivals before he took to the field after '96 , pat went back to his old career on television and did n't keep an infrastructure in place to capitalize on what he accomplished , said one disappointed buchanan veteran who has moved on to another candidate he lost a lot of the grassroots field operation that makes things happen mr forbes , whose checkbook so haunts the conservative commentator , hired the entire buchanan '96 staff in new hampshire as well as influential coordinators in iowa and louisiana plus greg mueller , a political operative from the first two buchanan campaigns mr buchanan , insisting he has found gifted rookies to galvanize his new effort , is convinced that his early opposition to the nato attacks on yugoslavia will make him the standout among the second tier of conservative republicans he hopes to underline this antiwar stance , in contrast to governor bush and other candidates , on june 1 before the national press club in a speech that his campaign director , jay townsend , promises will be a crucial initiative in the campaign we we are now in a foreign war that s none of our business , mr buchanan has been telling audiences , drawing applause from new hampshire to virginia and from iowa to louisiana
memphis , june 24 the weekly managers' meetings at the family physicians group , a private practice here , almost always include a lot of angry discussion about the increasing frustrations of dealing with health maintenance organizations and other managedcare insurance companies but at this morning s meeting , the anger was tempered by hope , said dr charles j woodall , the group s medical director , in light of the american medical association s decision on wednesday to form a union for doctors doctors have long been hamstrung by managedcare regulations that require needless procedures and do n't cover useful procedures , dr woodall said so i am quite pleased that the ama has taken it upon themselves to bring these problems to the forefront none of the doctors in his group could join an ama union because they do not work for health maintenance organizations or hospitals but dr woodall said the ama move signaled a push by doctors across the country to address growing feelings of helplessness in the face of managedcare restrictions on services doctors are permitted to provide , and the accompanying paperwork the companies require for simple procedures in the past five years , he said , his group of 15 doctors has hired 42 employees who deal solely with the paperwork required by managedcare companies dr woodall said of the ama s decision , it s a start , and the fact that the ama , a credible national organization , has stepped in shows that these are farreaching problems which do n't just affect doctors in larger cities and larger states , but now affect doctors in places like memphis and rural tennessee and mississippi barry levine , 59 , an internist at massachusetts general hospital in boston , also supported the ama we 're fighting to control the control that the insurance companies have over us , he said we really do need some representation , or it s going to be the mba types who are telling us how to practice medicine but not all doctors interviewed today agreed that a union would solve their problems i do n't think the unions are the prescription , said e william rosenberg , 69 , a memphis dermatologist and professor of medicine at the university of tennessee medical school i do n't think the unions are the illness either i think they 're a symptom of the changing economics of medical care and while i'm not opposed to them , i do n't think they are the answer jack needleman , an assistant professor of economics and health policy at the harvard school of public health , also questioned unionization i see the unionization push as a firstcut response to a very real set of problems for the profession in terms of economic power , dr needleman said it just does n't feel to me like it will be ultimately the response that prevails in california , where doctors' unions have long been in place , charles goodman , 40 , a pediatrician in private practice in the west hills section of los angeles , joined the union of american physicians and dentists , a 6 , 000member division of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , about one and a half years ago it has been a good idea for me and a direct help for many of my patients as well , dr goodman said as with roughly twothirds of the 620 , 000 practicing physicians in the nation , the ama union will not be able to bargain on dr goodman s behalf because he is in private practice and bargaining for him would violate antitrust laws but he said his union had helped him and his patients in other ways if i have a problem with an hmo , i can ask a union to step up to bat for me , he said when the union calls , the hmo s take it a little more seriously it gives you more clout than if you were alone against these enormous multibilliondollar companies as a fourthyear resident at the university of tennessee medical center in memphis , cindy woodall would qualify for membership in an ama union i am learning to be a doctor in this world of managed care , and it has kind of burst my bubble to see how it works against the patients , dr woodall said so if a union could address that and help us provide better care for our patients , then i would definitely want to join
in an escalating battle of the books , amazoncom inc , the online retailer , cut the prices on bestselling books by 50 percent yesterday , a move that was matched hours later by its internet rivals , barnesandnoblecom and borderscom , all of whom will almost certainly lose money on the bargain sales amazon s pricecutting comes during a rather auspicious time for its no 2 rival , barnes noble inc , which has plans for a public offering of its internet unit within the next few weeks but a company spokesman for amazoncom in seattle said the timing of its discounts on books from the new york times bestseller lists was a matter of coincidence there are three things that drive this business , said bill curry , a spokesman for amazon it s selection , price and convenience and we are constantly working on all three of these things we 've added convenience with distribution centers that will get merchandise faster to customers and this is an opportunity to do something with price with a flurry of announcements yesterday , the three electronic booksellers announced virtually identical plans to cut the prices of hardcovers and paperbacks appearing on the times bestseller lists that amounts to deep discounts on about 70 titles in any given week generally , publishers offer books to retailers for less than half of the list price , which means that the electronic rivals will be losing money with these discounts on best sellers but that did not seem to deter the major booksellers , who offered similar reasons for plunging ahead we intend to remain competitive in the marketplace , said leonard riggio , the chairman and chief executive of barnes noble , who added that amazon has changed their prices in the middle of a public offering for barnesandnoblecom and that speaks for itself \( barnes noble has a business tie to the new york times , selling books through links from the newspaper s web site \) borderscom , a unit of borders group inc , also announced a price cut i have to tell you that this is not the battlefield that we think we 're going to win on in the long run , said rich fahle , a spokesman for borderscom but we 're not going to let this distinguish us from the competition none of the booksellers set any particular time limits on the 50 percent discounts and , in fact , amazon was issuing refunds on the difference in price to customers who bought bestselling books shortly before its announcement of the discounts kate delhagen , director of online retail strategies for forrester research inc , a technology research firm , said the outbreak of discounting was not particularly surprising given new competitive pressures there are a number of new companies that are helping book buyers to compare prices through web site services like add all , that instantly list shipping and title costs for major booksellers for example , that site compared the prices for more than 24 bookstores yesterday and prominently listed amazon for offering the lowest price for the bestselling children s novel , harry potter and the sorcerer s stone the list price is 1695 , but with the discount and a shipping charge , amazon was selling the title for 1243 people are using these comparison tools , ms delhagen said and what amazon is doing is making sure that they are there it s definitely a defensive strategy being deployed , but it s also part of their increasing energy to add customers to their data base mr curry , amazon s spokesman , declined to say whether the company would lose money on the 50 percent discounts we 're just not talking about whether we 're selling at a profit or a loss , he said mr curry said , however , that amazon had decreased its reliance on book distributors and was dealing more directly with publishers those efficiencies have resulted in increased savings that amazon is now passing along to its customers , he said he insisted that the discounts were not a reaction to the activities of competitors we do n't fancy ourselves with the competition , he said we 're focused on our customers as opposed to what the competition is doing

new orleans charles musson , an engineer for an oil company here , stood in front of a portrait of a child at the new orleans museum of art , astonished the painting , of a wellgroomed darkeyed boy of 9 , dates from 1855 the painter was edgar degas , then 21 the subject was his brother rene mr musson , 47 , is rene s greatgrandson and thus perhaps in the most direct line of descent from the painter himself , who never married or had children but if the thread that connects him to art history is slender , it is also vivid both my daughters look exactly like him , mr musson said same nose , same eyes , everything it might well be said that the same oblique but penetrating relationship exists between edgar degas and new orleans , the city where his mother was born and which , despite only a single visit by the artist , now claims him as one of its own it is a relationship underscored by the exhibition mr musson was viewing , degas and new orleans a french impressionist in america , which presents roughly 40 of his works and is the centerpiece of louisiana s celebration of 300 years of french presence here both by what it includes and leaves out , the show resonates with the character of a boisterous , mysterious city where tangled social currents can flow unnoticed for generations sex , money , politics , race they were all roiling concerns in degas s extended family , whose members were the focus of his work during his visit here in the winter of 187273 , and who , to judge from the paintings , he saw in a troubled light the men engaged in business , fending off financial calamity the women in melancholy isolation at home , the children in seemingly aimless play but there was even more going on than degas portrayed almost spookily , one of his paintings foreshadowed disaster in his brother s marriage , a rupture so severe that rene s descendants would renounce the degas name \( rene spelled it de gas \) and what edgar did n't paint was nearly as telling a branch of the family , living within the city then and now but only peripherally addressed by the museum show , was black in subsequent years , that line of the family had a split of its own the museum chose to embrace one opportunity and in doing so missed another , said christopher benfey , a cultural historian who has written at length about new orleans it s a very interesting show about a very interesting detour in the history of french impressionism the opportunity it misses is the degree to which the degas visit was a complex new orleans story involving all the divisions within the city two years ago a book by mr benfey , degas in new orleans , set the city astir by revealing that a branch of the degas family in this city is descended from a black woman , constance vivant , who had six children with vincent rillieux , a brother of degas s maternal grandmother one of the children , norbert rillieux , became a prominent engineer responsible for advances in sugar refining mr benfey s book went on to point out the membership of several of degas s close relatives here , including rene , in the crescent city white league , a fundamentally racist group bent on wresting political power from the more diverse \( if no less corrupt \) postcivil war carpetbaggers that the mix of race , family and politics at least obliquely concerned the family at the time of degas s visit seems indisputable and that the family would not know of norbert rillieux , given his achievements , is unlikely degas himself wrote frequently in his letters home about black people observed in the street , black women taking care of white children finding implications in what is not shown but with the exception of one partly obscured figure in one painting , he did n't paint them in his book mr benfey argued there were psychological implications to this disjunction , and he recalled that argument in a catalogue essay for the exhibition , which runs to aug 29 in summary , the exotic for degas hit a bit too close to home , he wrote but beyond this and other catalogue references the exhibition pays scant attention to the racial context of the new orleans paintings and although several musson descendants were invited to the museum opening and gala , no effort was made to locate and invite the descendants of vincent rillieux and constance vivant , some still in the city and listed in the phone book it was not until after the opening that their identities became known to museum officials , who then invited them to a reception of their own , to be held later this month neither the rillieuxes nor the mussons knew of each other before mr benfey s book they have still never met and in interviews , several rillieuxes , all aware of their ancestor norbert , seemed happier to be invited in the end than they were angry to have been excluded initially i was n't really upset , said dolores rillieux turner , a special education teacher it bothered me in a way i think we should have been recognized , but not to the point where i was upset a family split 'it s some story'
a naked man crouches atop a glass case containing a whirring engine his bare torso is painted white his red tongue extends in a bestial snarl schubert s song erlkonig plays in the background , replacing the recited polemics of adolf hitler that had filled the auditorium before the curtain rose hitler quotes and nazi salutes may seem like strong stuff to american audiences , but in germany , the critics complained that the production was n't radical enough american theatergoers will be able to see for themselves when , next month , the renowned german troupe berliner ensemble brings this production of bertolt brecht s the resistible rise of arturo ui to berkeley and los angeles brecht s drama , a parable about the rise of the nazis , thinly disguised as mafiosi and gang members \( the characters giri and givola are goering and goebbels \) , will be presented in a successful 1995 production by the company s director heiner muller , who died that same year it is appropriate that arturo ui should be presented in the united states when brecht wrote the work in 1941 , while in exile in finland , american performances a broadway run , in fact were what he had in mind for all of its references to nazi germany , the play is also clearly set in gangsterera chicago certain aspects of the play take on the significance brecht wanted when it s performed in the united states , says the actor martin wuttke , whose performance in the title role has been lauded as outstanding both in berlin and on tour throughout europe and south america one of the leading troupes in berlin , the berliner ensemble is sometimes known as brecht s theater it was founded by him when he returned to east germany in 1949 , and for long years in that country , his theater remained a place of pilgrimage for brecht enthusiasts a few minutes away , where he lived , the brecht house , a dark publike restaurant , is crowded with brecht memorabilia , and the tables are illuminated by ancient stage lights from original brecht productions the performances at the university of california at berkeley on thursday and friday and at the university of california at los angeles on july 711 mark the berliner ensemble s first and , the presenters proclaim , last appearance in the states the company , in their rather theatrical depiction , is being disbanded and then reconstituted in the fall under a new director , claus peymann this is like saying that the chicago opera has disbanded because it has got a new artistic director in fact , since german reunification , the berliner ensemble has undergone a series of artistic and administrative upheavals , some of which have severely tested the company s link to brecht s legacy mr peymann , who has reigned at vienna s leading burgtheater for 13 years , is a star in the world of germanlanguage theater he holds the promise of renewal and artistic vitality to an organization that is , after all , not a museum but the guardian and presenter of a living art in the former east germany , the company was more museumlike than innovative , dedicated primarily to keeping the brecht flame burning after reunification , in 1990 , berlin s cultural officer , ulrich roloffmomin , sought to implement a new theater administration befitting the berliner ensemble s special status as a result , a fiveman team of some of germany s most eminent men of theater among them heiner muller , peter zadek and matthias langhoff was installed as joint directors in practice , this noble idea proved a disaster none of these men had reached the peak of their profession through teamwork and compromise , and they were n't ready to start developing their skills in those areas now the working climate rapidly degenerated into one of open conflict when the smoke cleared , most of the directors had decamped , leaving muller alone at the top the successful premiere of arturo ui seemed to augur well for muller s tenure while he directed the play , muller was also writing his own germania 3 , which deals with stalin and hitler his interest in arturo ui was therefore historical , which meant his approach was fairly straightforward , at least by the standards of contemporary german theater he focused more on the nazi past than on reinterpreting the play in terms of the present some german critics who view stage directing as a creative act in its own right found it too much by the book , too unquestioning in its presentation of brecht s tale still , as the daily newspaper stuttgarter zeitung noted , it got the strongest applause that s been heard in the berliner ensemble for a long time , and some took this as a sign that the company was entering a new era this era , however , proved shortlived muller s germania 3 had its premiere a few months later , but posthumously he had died of cancer at the age of 66 even under muller , arturo ui was one of only three brecht plays actually in repertory at brecht s theater and muller s successor , for all of his big dreams , was n't able to change this i wanted to usher in a new brecht era , says martin wuttke , who took over as artistic director at the age of 33 what interests me about brecht are his tools , in the figurative sense his techniques heiner muller once said , 'to use brecht without criticizing him is a betrayal' mr wuttke may have carried muller s artistic torch , but the young actor lacked administrative or directing experience i tried out in a lot of new jobs that year that i did n't know at all , he says and , he adds , i had problems with brecht s heirs
the president of the university of tennessee , j wade gilley , said yesterday that the school s general counsel s office had not found any kind of systemic , unwarranted or tutorial help in the school s athletic department and said that none of its student athletes violated national collegiate athletic association rules gilley said he had received an oral report from the associate general counsel , ron leadbetter , who conducted the monthlong review into allegations reported by espncom on sept 26 that some tennessee football players , including at least one member of the 1998 national title team , were suspected of turning in plagiarized papers or papers cowritten by tutors he said the report clearing the program will be forwarded to the southeastern conference and to the ncaa there s nothing verifiable to precipitate further action , gilley said in a telephone interview we have no evidence that the student athletes or tutors acted improperly there s no pattern we are confident we have a very sound system with seasoned people of integrity in place leadbetter said he will deliver the threepage report to gilley today , and it will be made public perhaps as early as tomorrow he would not comment on the specifics of the report , but said in a telephone interview that the review was very thorough the university does not find itself in difficulty , he said leadbetter said he spoke with every person cited in the espncom report , which alleged that at least four tutors may have done schoolwork for as many as five players dating to 1995 and that highlevel administrators in the athletic department were made aware of instructors' and staffers' suspicions but did not pass them on to the school s compliance officials we spoke with everyone who had useful information , some people multiple times , leadbetter said , declining to say how many we talked to anyone who remotely might have had firsthand knowledge of the allegations when released , the report is certain to create more debate on the knoxville campus where concerned faculty members have recently undertaken several initiatives to gain greater control of the academic pursuits of athletes it s been an embarrassment to the university , lorayne lester , dean of the college of arts and sciences , said last week about the allegations tennessee s faculty senate recently voted to study how often grade changes were made for athletes and a subcommittee on academic integrity will also examine the tutoring program , as well as the specialneeds program for learning disabled athletes many faculty members have also suggested that someone other than the general counsel s office should have conducted the review leadbetter said , however , that though the focus of the report was on determining whether ncaa violations occurred that he was bound to report any other violations that broke university rules he indicated he discovered none the report is very positive , he said gilley pointed out that as the author of a 1986 book titled , administration of university athletics internal control and excellence , he too was intent on a serious , wideranging inquiry it cost the university tens of thousands of dollars , he said people can make anonymous charges all the time , and you have to take them seriously but it will be up to the ncaa enforcement division to decide whether tennessee violated any bylaws the organization does not comment on potential or current investigations at specific institutions a spokeswoman , jane jankowski , said it is routine for the ncaa to get reports from member institutions many of them acknowledging violations but that the ncaa still acts independently
by now , he is as familiar a figure on the city landscape as the souvlaki vendor he and the sense here is that men are more the issue than women is the fellow you see behind the wheel of a lexus or some other car of suitable status , trying to negotiate new york traffic while talking on a cellular phone you know him well he veers erratically from lane to lane and brushes back pedestrians as he turns into a crosswalk , jabbering nonstop , one hand on the wheel and half a brain on what he is doing the sinking feeling in your stomach tells you it is only a matter of time before the selfabsorbed clod does serious harm the city s taxi and limousine commission amply recognizes the potential for mayhem and so , by its fiat , cabbies are about to be prohibited from using cell phones while tooling around the ban , which will go into effect by july 1 , applies equally to handheld and socalled handsfree phones it is based on evidence that the issue is not so much where the driver s hands are as where his mind is or is n't except for a few cabbies unhappy about not being able to gab while the meter is running , the commission says the new rule has been wellreceived that being the case , why not take its edict to its next logical step \? would n't the city be an even safer place if a similar ban were applied to all drivers \? exhibit a is a university of toronto study , published two years ago in the new england journal of medicine , which showed that driving while talking on the phone can be as dangerous as driving while drunk the risk of an accident increases fourfold when drivers are on the phone , the researchers said it is the same as when a person s blood alcohol level reaches new york city s legal limit of 10 percent exhibit b is the conclusion of the national highway traffic safety administration that driver inattention is the most frequently cited precrash condition for drivers who use cellular phones translation it makes no difference whether the phone is handheld or handsfree the point is , you 're mentally somewhere else , said tim hurd , a safety administration spokesman john kaehny , executive director of transportation alternatives , a new york advocacy group for bicyclists and pedestrians , predicted that it s only a matter of time before cell phones are regulated , since they are a real threat the dangers are great in this city , mr kaehny said , because the street density and stopandgo nature of the driving require far more concentration than driving down a highway in wyoming restrictions of the sort he would like are rare in carcrazy america , though they exist in several other countries , including israel , notorious for aggressive driving but nothing comparable seems likely here for some time checks with the mayor s office , the city council and the state s department of motor vehicles show it is not on any of their radar screens that hardly means the safety issue is going away any more , to switch gears for a moment , than etiquette problems attached to cell phones are about to disappear just because some officials insist there are none here , the issue is behavior not in cars but on public transportation officialdom has a way of taking refuge in certain statistics \( not that columnists are much different \) in this case , the masstransit systems for the city and its suburbs say they receive few complaints , half a dozen a month at most , from riders angry over inconsiderate cellphone use by other commuters but since when do big numbers mean everything \? that s not an accurate measure of people s discomfort , said lawrence h silverman , chairman of the long island rail road commuters council his riders group found in a survey that noisy cellphone use ranks high among passenger nuisances , even if few people bother to complain to the railroad anyone who rides new york city buses knows from all the eyerolling and tsktsking that loud phone conversations annoy them , too but banning cell phones from trains and buses is hard to do instead , the commuters council hopes to preach the virtues of lowdecibel speech to phone users who would rather shout , if only to impress fellow travelers with their importance in other words , speak softly , even if you carry a big shtick a similar pitch for safe driving , by staying off the phone , might be made to that selfcentered lexus driver

roosevelt cecil bridgewater was insistent i do n't care if you do n't play the right notes , he told the nine young musicians seated in front of him at roosevelt juniorsenior high school but you 've got to get the right rhythm put those instruments in your lap , and let s clap patiently , mr bridgewater , the veteran jazz trumpeter , led the youngsters in sustained rounds of clapping to improve their rendition of a blues scale he had given them the previous week to practice it was his third meeting with members of the school s jazz band during an eightweek residency sponsored by friends of the arts clearly , he was still in the preliminary stages of honing the skills and interests of teenagers brought up mainly on rap and rhythmandblues mr bridgewater s residency here is just part of a quiet , littleheralded revolution under way in schools all over long island the coming of age of artsineducation programs these programs can be as simple as inviting a calligrapher to teach students art with a pen or as complex as investing an entire year in creating ways of using the arts to teach academic subjects like mathematics , science , social studies and language arts on the island , the programs will cost 5 million this year , ranging from 100 for a single classroom visit by an artist to 170 , 000 a year in a fouryear pilot project to devise an integrated curriculum the money comes from school districts , parentteacher associations , local arts groups , foundations , and federal and state agencies these include the national endowment for the arts and the new york state council on the arts , which has made 300 grants totaling 26 million this year to artsineducation providers throughout the state since 1985 , the council has spent nearly 30 million to bring the arts into the schools along with regular classroom instruction in the arts , these programs have traditionally been the first eliminated as frills when budgets are reduced after substantial cuts when state aid diminished in the late 1980 s and early 90 s , arts classes have stabilized and even increased on the island , administrators say even high school electives seem to be coming back , said kevin mcguire , superintendent of the half hollow hills school district and president of the suffolk county council of school superintendents salvatore randazzo , director of art and music in the east islip school district , said when i came here three years ago , we had 16 music teachers and 11 art teachers , which was already up from the late 80 s when the staff was reduced by about 6 positions now , we 're up to 18 music teachers and 12 art teachers , and i sense that this is the case elsewhere no arts courses were eliminated during the budget crunch in wantagh , but a marvelous artsineducation program that we had , a 'poet in the school' who for years came and worked with the kids and cost only 5 , 000 , was cut , said george besculides , the school superintendent and head of the nassau county council of school superintendents like wantagh , which has budgeted about 20 , 000 for artsineducation this year up 2 , 500 from last year other districts have experienced a similar growth when we bring these cultural programs into the district , we motivate the kids and the community , mr randazzo said they 're a shot in the arm and help our regular programs build his district will spend 21 , 000 on artsineducation this year in roosevelt , which has budgeted 10 , 000 for artsineducation this year , the friends of the arts project , underwritten entirely by the bell atlantic foundation , has struck a responsive chord me and jazz were soso , said shantell cameron , a 12thgrade saxophonist and clarinetist i was never really interested in it before but you know , i'm learning to like it and play it she hopes to study performance and music education at ithaca college now , jazz is turning out just as beautiful as classical music and what i play in band , she said and some of my friends wish they could do what i'm doing get into it , not just get it the rhythm tentatively absorbed , mr bridgewater a musician , composer and arranger who has appeared with the max roach quartet , the thad jonesmel lewis jazz orchestra and the horace silver quintet turned , with quiet humor and dogged perseverance , to translating the sounds into something resembling music in addition to coaching and cajoling , he filled the session with asides about jazz s history and relationship to the music the students know best \( 99 percent of what you hear today , including rap , is based on the blues \) and biographical snippets about sonny rollins , whose tenor madness they were about to play ca n't we play it faster \? a trumpeter asked tuning up first would have been a good idea , mr bridgewater replied your ears are your most important instrument , he continued it s kind of like eating things you bite in , expecting something sweet , but you get something terrible , something that makes you twitch
acting as though they had just discovered that the constitution requires a census every decade , the house republican leadership has declared that next year s national headcount will be financed with an emergency appropriation of 45 billion the leaders treated veterans' health care the same way , deeming it an offbudget emergency the process of putting together a federal budget is always untidy , but this year the house appropriations committee has been turned into a wonderland the unhappy chairman , c w bill young , had been warning for months that the spending caps imposed by the 1997 balanced budget act were impossibly rigid , but no one seemed willing to listen both parties happily supported a 155 billion increase in the defense budget , to 266 billion that used up about half of the 538 billion set aside for discretionary spending , painting mr young into a corner as the pot available for other purposes grew smaller and smaller the unrealistic caps set in 1997 were a classic example of politicians' tendency to schedule all their really tough challenges for sometime in the future president clinton and leaders from both parties have been bragging for three years about the way they got spending under control , even as they began looking for loopholes to protect themselves from the consequences last year congress approved emergency expenditures outside the caps to the tune of more than 20 billion this year the house leaders have already decided to pay for the census with an emergency appropriation , as if it were a flood or earthquake thanks to an accounting gimmick , additional spending on veterans' programs is supposed to be financed through the borrowing authority of the tennessee valley authority this week gop leaders were entertaining a delusion that the nation s republican governors would help them out by giving back 6 billion in federal funds the states received to pay for welfare reform the appropriations battles are part of a larger spectacle of fiscal irresponsibility , like the republican leadership s insistence on a 792 billion tax cut that would eat up a projected surplus whose size is based , in part , on the same spending cap fictions that mr young is wrestling with republican moderates , who wanted more modest tax reductions , settled for a compromise that was at best a meaningless fig leaf this is the worst kind of budgeting , a cynical exercise in which both parties try to trick the public into believing that the government can make draconian cuts in spending while still providing the programs people want responsible fiscal policy requires a clear and honest set of numbers , achievable goals and a willingness to forgo a certain amount of political gamesmanship in the name of responsible government none of that is happening in washington this year
saddle brook , nj , june 5 there was no note , no sign of illness or depression , and no apparent motive for suicide but there was a folding chair kicked over on the floor , a halfempty bottle of johnnie walker red nearby and two bodies one of them a convicted gangster hanging from a ceiling beam it is the type of mystery that mob buffs live for , an aging wiseguy found dead with his dead son dangling at his side , a curious brew of suicide and organized crime that many law enforcement officials are saying just does not feel right the story began on may 21 when a police dispatcher here received a frantic phone call from a young woman saying that her father , giovanni ligammari , 60 , and her brother , pietro , 37 , had hanged themselves , face to face , in separate nooses , with nylon packing cord from the basement rafters of the elder man s twofamily home in this affluent bergen county suburb giovanni ligammari was a known figure in organized crime , having been found guilty of racketeering and conspiracy charges in 1987 in the socalled pizza connection case , in which 31 men were charged with running a heroin ring from several new york pizza shops but his death was ruled a suicide , and the case was officially closed after a brief investigation , during which his widow and daughter were never interviewed within hours of the news of the deaths , cynical shop talk started as veteran organizedcrime investigators from as far away as rome began clucking their tongues at whether the salty old sicilian and his son had really killed themselves was it suicide or something darker \? for the moment , not many people are sure it smells , said one veteran fbi agent who worked on the case and agreed to speak only if his name was withheld it just does n't jibe at all , you know \? and i'm not normally a doubting thomas but on this one i am run down a list of possible motives for suicide and those who knew the ligammaris will say that none of them applied the elder mr ligammari lived a quiet pensioner s life here , collecting social security and drawing income from renting out the second floor of his wellappointed home , said frank p lucianna , his longtime friend and lawyer he was not poor , not depressed and , according to the saddle brook police department , no longer involved in crime in his 40 s and 50 s , mr ligammari was associated with the bonanno crime family , the federal authorities said , but was a minor player in the pizza connection case , one of several investors who put up money for the heroin ring he had suffered greatly , both physically and emotionally , during the eight years he spent in federal prison and got out in 1995 , a troubled man , mr lucianna said but , he added , mr ligammari seemed to have left the painful memories of prison life behind he was that hardy , old , toughguy type from the mountains of sicily , mr lucianna said they both were , and it disturbs the hell out of me if you told me john gotti had committed suicide , i 'd be just as surprised pietro ligammari lived in massapequa , ny , where , by all accounts , he led an uneventful life , mr lucianna said mr ligammari was married and had two children he was never implicated in the pizza connection case or any other crime neither man was under investigation by the federal authorities , the united states attorney s office in new jersey said and it was the manhattan office of the federal bureau of investigation , which helped prosecute the pizza connection case , that initially looked into their deaths , rather than the newark office , only 20 minutes away all of this has left conspiracy theorists studying their videotapes of goodfellas and spinning sinister couldhavebeens late into the night i got a call the afternoon the bodies were discovered from one of our old sources who said they 'd actually been killed , said one former prosecutor who worked on the pizza connection case but then i called an fbi guy i know , and he told me that the initial report was a double suicide either way , he said , it s weird voluntary suicide or not father and son \? very strange experts in suicide agree while they say that lovers will sometimes kill themselves together and parents have been known to kill their children and then themselves , double suicides involving fathers and sons are exceedingly rare i know of no other dual pact like this with a father and son , none , said dr andrew slaby , a professor of clinical psychology at new york university and a former president of the american association of suicidology it s a truly remarkable case , he said , adding , if it s actually a suicide picture the scene , dr slaby said father and son standing on the same small chair , facing death , staring into each other s eyes to choose that mode of exodus , he said , would mean that both of them would 've had to create the noose and make the decision to go at the exact same time it s such a native thing in human beings to preserve their children s lives that you would have to posit that both were terribly , psychotically depressed
schaumburg , ill , july 13 a year ago , motorola inc was faltering badly investors were dumping shares , complaining that the company had lost its way it had missed a critical beat a few years earlier , betting on analog products when the world began craving all things digital the company took a charge against earnings of 19 billion a year ago , but today it is on the rebound shares that were selling for 38 last october are going for nearly 100 a 30 billion leap in market value the reason a revamping that trimmed the work force and refocused the company s marketing of cellular telephones and semiconductors in addition , demand has begun to revive in the critical asia market , which slumped in 1998 today , motorola handily beat wall street projections by reporting earnings of 273 million , or 44 cents a share , for the second quarter of the year , up from 6 million , or 1 cent a share , a year ago analysts had estimated 41 cents a share the announcement came after the close of trading but ahead of the earnings release , shares of motorola closed at 9650 , down 250 , on the new york stock exchange underlying motorola s recent spate of good fortune is a lesswellknown strategic shift , top executives say the company plans to recast itself from a manufacturer of technology hardware to a software maker that is boldly vowing to bring the world wide web not only to cellular telephones and pagers but even to the automobile , which could soon be wired to download video games for backseat passengers it is unclear whether motorola s futuristic musings are just that , but the company has already invested billions of dollars and hired thousands of new software engineers it also says it will equip every cellular telephone it makes next year with an internet browser we are becoming much more of a software company , said dennis a roberson , chief technology officer at motorola it s a very significant break for us there are more software capabilities in the devices we produce , and we 're expanding into the internet space none of these ambitions would be possible , of course , without a recovery in the sale of cellular telephones and microchips , which account for about 68 percent of revenue this year , the company is finally selling substantial numbers of digital cellular telephones , allowing motorola to compete against nokia of finland and ericsson of sweden still , executives at company headquarters here in schaumburg , a suburb of chicago , are cautious about using the word turnaround just yet , and for good reason motorola faces some huge problems , ranging from a billiondollar investment in a tottering satellite venture called iridium to the challenge of regaining market share in the increasingly competitive market for wireless products and infrastructure although it is now making and selling digital products , for example , motorola still does not have a digital telephone able to supply the one rate plan at att wireless , one of the nation s largest wireless service providers motorola executives say such multiplesystem phones should be ready later this year christopher b galvin , the 49yearold chief executive , talks about creating a new motorola , a company in search of breakaway opportunities doing so means fostering doubledigit growth at a giant with 30 billion in revenue and more than 130 , 000 employees motorola is emphasizing software ventures , in part , to make the company more flexible and less capital intensive wall street analysts have been almost universally optimistic about motorola in the last year but several analysts said the company still had to prove it could execute its plans they have been a wellregarded stock lately , kenneth leon , a wireless communications analyst at abn amro , said of motorola but they have a growth rate in the low teens , and their competitors , like lucent and nokia , have growth rates in the 20 s and 30 s motorola says a corporate makeover is well under way some factories have been shuttered and their functions farmed out , and executives have been trying to do away with a warring tribes culture that pitted one division against another gone is the sense of invincibility that once pervaded the company , analysts say motorola had an insular attitude , said merle gilmore , an executive vice president at the company we need to change that view things are happening too fast customer demands are too exacting now you need to be part of an overall echo system the company found itself outside that echo system in recent years and did not adequately foresee technological changes and market trends motorola stumbled when the wireless industry began to shift from analog to digital technology in 1994 , it practically owned the cellular market , with a 60 percent share in the united states nokia , which then had only 11 percent of the united states market , is now the leader at about 34 percent , with motorola second at about 31 percent , according to herschel shosteck associates motorola executives saw the shift coming but did not expect it to come so swiftly , they now acknowledge
birmingham , ala in alabama , a federal grand jury has been hearing evidence for more than a year in a 1963 racist bombing that killed four black girls in a downtown birmingham church in louisiana , the wife of one of the first black deputy sheriffs in a small parish met in october with a prosecutor who recently began reexamining the 1965 killing of her husband in an ambush and in mississippi , a white man pleaded guilty this summer , and three others are to go on trial nov 10 , in the 1970 killing of a black sharecropper who was beaten and found dead in a rural river across the south , these and other unresolved , racially motivated killings of blacks from the civil rights era are under new scrutiny this fresh round of investigations into the longago killings , many of which were ignored by the authorities for years , was inspired by the wellpublicized conviction in 1994 of an aging white defendant in the 1963 assassination of the mississippi civil rights leader medgar evers for years , black community leaders and relatives of victims complained about the lack of action in both the more prominent and lesserknown cases but their urgings have been taken more seriously recently , experts and historians say , because the political , social and legal climate in the south has changed so significantly since the era of the killings blacks have steadily gained political power and have pushed for these cases to be heard before today s racially diverse juries at the same time , more witnesses , perhaps with less fear of retaliation and with heavy consciences they want to unburden , are coming forward and a new breed of prosecutors and investigators , feeling a sense of urgency as many witnesses and defendants in the cases grow old , is realizing the important role that resolving these cases can play in the south s efforts to move beyond its past of racial hate and terrorism in the south , we now have a black constituency that has political clout and a white constituency that is not against these hatemongers being brought to justice , said david sansing , professor emeritus of history at the university of mississippi and the black constituency , emboldened by newfound political power , is saying , 'justice delayed is justice denied , so let s quit denying this justice' surprisingly , they are being met with sympathy from district attorneys at least seven of these longdormant cases are now being reexamined in the south a few are before grand juries or are being prosecuted but some have only just begun to be reinvestigated and have had little national attention the case in louisiana , for example , has gotten little publicity , even though a law officer , deputy sheriff oneal moore , was killed , and his partner , also black , was maimed and there is the littleknown case of the 1967 carbombing of a black father of five who had been promoted to chemical mixer in a factory , a job usually reserved for white men another example of a lesserknown case involved the 1967 shooting of a black man at a protest by black university students the officials pursuing these cases are mostly southern and white most are in their mid40 s to early 50 s a few have childhood memories of the crimes and of the violent reaction of the ku klux klan to school integration and black voter registration but they share some sense that the decadesold cases are a stumbling block to the south s progress these prosecutors , mr sansing said , are realizing that they 've got to do it now , rather than leave it unsettled forever for instance , united states attorney doug jones , 45 , a birmingham native , was 9 when birmingham s 16th street baptist church , a center for civil rights activity in the 1960 s , was bombed , killing the four girls as a law student in 1977 he skipped classes for a week to watch bill baxley , who was the alabama attorney general , successfully prosecute the klan leader robert chambliss for murder in the bombing mr baxley chose not to prosecute other suspects at that time , in the hope that better cases could be developed against them later when mr jones became a united states attorney in 1997 , he pushed for the current grand jury investigation of others named in federal bureau of investigation files as suspects to be able to get back and reopen the case , and let the community know that it s not forgotten , that s important for everybody , mr jones said another reason the climate is better today for pursuing these cases , said morris dees , cofounder of the southern poverty law center in montgomery , ala , is that the fbi , which investigated some cases when they occurred , is more cooperative than it was 30 years ago in the birmingham case , for example , documents show that j edgar hoover , who was the fbi director for nearly 50 years , prevented bureau agents from meeting with prosecutors to present the voluminous evidence they had collected now , it is the bureau that is leading the new investigation , along with mr jones s office the reexamination of the birmingham bombing was a result of meetings between local black religious and community leaders and local bureau officials in the mid1990 s officials close to the case now would not discuss specific evidence but have said there are no new suspects , only new information still , there are hints at the direction in which the case is going
brussels , may 15 in a behindthescenes struggle over military strategy and tactics , the pentagon is blocking a plan by the nato commander , gen wesley k clark , to send apache helicopters into combat against serbian troops , pentagon and nato officials say seeking to increase allied firepower , general clark has pressed the united states to authorize the final combat preparations for the helicopters , which are part of a united states army ground force in albania although 24 of them , along with their accompanying army rockets and artillery , have already been deployed , the pentagon has balked , fearing that the mission is too risky the dispute adds a new strain to the alliance s sevenweekold air campaign nato s generals have often found themselves hemmed in by political constraints the resistance this time , though , is not coming from allied diplomats it is coming from the army leadership at the pentagon , defense secretary william s cohen and gen henry h shelton , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the issue is that clark is being aggressive , and there is some resistance to doing what he wants to do , a senior american official said the apache is the army s premier tankkilling weapon it can fly low , at night and in bad weather , and is equipped with a sophisticated infrared system that generates images from the heat of its targets it is armed with laserguided hellfire antitank missiles and 30millimeter guns since general clark first requested them 48 hours after nato s air strikes began on march 24 , the apaches have been a particularly sensitive matter for the clinton administration , which has been reluctant to use combat troops in kosovo it took weeks for washington to agree to general clark s request to deploy the apaches then it took weeks more to lug the men and supplies for the helicopters and the army units that accompanied them to albania further , washington only agreed to send the apaches and rockets on the condition that they not be used in combat without the formal approval of president clinton that approval , which apache commanders expected by early may , has yet to take place , largely because top pentagon officials have refused to recommend such a step to the white house , fearing the possible domestic and international consequences if the missions fail nor are the apaches allowed to conduct live fire exercises without the clinton administration s consent such exercises , in which the helicopters fire their guns and missiles , are an essential prerequisite for employing them in combat american officials have pledged to give general clark whatever weaponry he says he needs to wage the air war pentagon officials still recall defense secretary les aspin s fateful decision in 1993 to turn down the military s request for tanks and ac130 gunships in somalia , a judgment that cost mr aspin his job after 18 army soldiers were killed but general clark wants to conduct the live fire test by shooting at targets in kosovo , and he still has not received permission to do so two of the helicopters have already crashed during training missions , killing two pilots there was no concept of using the apaches just as a feint , a nato official said general clark would not have asked for them if he did not have every intention to use them the serbs are using helicopters against civilians in kosovo why ca n't we use helicopters against the serbs \? general clark flew to albania today to meet with the task force commanders and review their tactics and preparations he declined to be interviewed about the apaches general shelton indicated this week that the pentagon was concerned about the risks and complexity the operation this is a relatively complicated operation , very similar to running any other type of air operation , same types of resources required in terms of electronic warfare , support aircraft , the suppression fire that has to be in place , he told the senate appropriations committee and all this has to be rehearsed , and then you weigh the risk versus the gain the 24 apaches are part of task force hawk , a 5 , 000 army soldier unit in albania , which also includes surfacetosurface rockets , artillery , bradley fighting vehicles and m1a1 tanks the task force is under the overall command of lieut gen john walter hendrix , who also serves as commander of the united states army s v corps in germany it is very unusual for such a highranking officer to head up such a small task force , and his appointment reflects the united states' anxiety over the operation the apache squadron is commanded by brig gen richard a cody , one of the army s most respected helicopter officers one of general cody s most notable exploits took place in 1991 , when he led task force normandy , the apache helicopter unit that fired the opening shots of the persian gulf war the apaches blasted two clusters of iraqi earlywarning radars , firing hellfire missiles and 30millimeter guns but the mission in kosovo is far more complex and dangerous serbian troops are armed with sa7 shoulderfired missiles , antiaircraft artillery and sam surfacetoair missiles , which pose a major threat to the helicopters

investors , a method that even mr browning expects will vanish sometime soon i'm not so sure i can make a living doing this , mr browning said , from his office in his allentown , pa , home , clad in sweatpants and a tshirt , his dog curled up at his feet i do n't know how much longer this market is going to exist even now , he makes far less than he used to so far in 1999 , though , an extraordinarily buoyant market for new stocks has made trading them an easy way to make a modest amount of money in november , companies raised almost twice as much , 169 billion , through firsttime sales of stock as in any other month , according to thomson financial securities data the average gain in the first day of trading for initial public offerings in november was also the highest ever , at 102 percent the 501 initial public offerings , or ipo s , this year have jumped an average of 62 percent on their first day of trading , more than three times the firstday gain in any other year in the 1990 s a dozen quadrupled and 22 more tripled in the first day from the prices at which they were offered to investors for stocks to appreciate that quickly , the shares have to change hands rapidly , with some being bought and sold several times a day that is hardly the sort of buyandhold investing that many market experts like byron wien recommend for most investors these people just rent the stocks , they do n't own them , said mr wien , who is the chief united states strategist at morgan stanley dean witter such startling immediate returns have attracted the attention of individual investors , who now clamor for , and get , a piece of the action and often resell , or flip , the shares they buy within days , even hours while company insiders are usually barred from selling newly issued shares for a certain period often six months outsiders face no such restriction so great is the demand that services have sprung up to keep investors posted on the latest news about public offerings and established brokerage firms are changing their businesses to cater to people who want to use computers to actively trade these and other stocks yesterday , merrill lynch introduced an online trading service that promises investors a chance to buy new shares , but officials of the firm said they were still trying to decide how to deal with customers who flip them , a practice the firm has traditionally frowned upon other firms , like charles schwab , are trying to find ways to get more shares of newly public companies into the hands of small investors before the stocks start trading mr browning has bought and sold 20 new offerings this year , never holding one longer than three weeks , through eight online trading accounts at four different brokerage firms all that flipping has brought mr browning a profit before taxes of more than 30 , 000 , he said , adding that he has made at least 10 , 000 more this year trading other stocks the sum falls well short of the 80 , 000 he earned at his old job , a salary he has found difficult to replace in the allentown area but mr browning said he had lost money on only three new offerings he had been able to participate in using two computers to monitor the ipo sections of the world wide web sites of e trade group and three other online brokerage firms , mr browning vies with thousands of others , usually in electronic lotteries , for as few as 100 shares at a time e trade and other members of a new breed of electronic brokerage firms , including wit capital group and fbrcom , use these small allotments of ipo s as enticements to customers oldline investment banks have begun to include these upstart firms in distribution of new issues to whet the appetites of individual investors for the stocks they underwrite the underwriters have also opened up the offerings because managers of some of their client corporations , especially internetbased companies , insist on making some shares available to investors electronically executives of young companies have also come to regard a big firstday jump in the price of their stock as an invaluable promotional event , even though such runups suggest that the company could have sold its stock for much more money on various electronic message boards and chat rooms dedicated to stock trading , dozens of speculators can be seen exchanging information and strategies for getting shares of companies poised to go public at least two services have been created this year to cater to these online speculators , offering to alert them instantly to the latest opportunities for a monthly fee
the first time somebody asked me the inevitable question who s buried in grant s tomb \? i had no idea what the answer might be i must have been about 12 and had eyed the great granite monument every time my family drove along the west side highway into manhattan from westchester , where we lived i had a vague sense of ulysses s grant , i certainly knew what a tomb was , but the thought that he might actually be in there was somehow shocking if you had told me that calvin coolidge was lying under the appetizing counter of zabar s , i could n't have been more disconcerted it was n't so much that the famous man was buried there as that there was actually a dead body on riverside drive and 122d street i think it had n't occurred to me that anyone was buried in manhattan for that , one went to brooklyn or queens but of course that is precisely where the power of the monument comes from it is in essence a mausoleum , preserving not merely the memory but also the mortal remains of the general who , at a terrible cost , led the north to victory in the civil war the capacity to stomach horrendous losses and keep on going was part of grant s disturbing greatness i saw an open field , he wrote , describing the calamitous consequences of the battle at shiloh , so covered with dead that it would have been possible to walk across the clearing , in any direction , stepping on dead bodies , without a foot touching the ground though grant turned out to be a splendid writer \( his personal memoirs have just been reissued by penguin \) , his tomb , unlike the voluble memorials to lincoln and jefferson in washington , makes a mute appeal despite a couple of brief time lines that sketch his life from his early years through his postpresidential career , it is tokens of death and war that dominate two circular antechambers display the flags under which grant served , along with maps marking key battles a single quotation , let us have peace , is chiseled into the pediment high above the entranceway the rest is stony silence but if there is nothing grant said to match the grandeur of lincoln s second inaugural , his tomb is a stark reminder that there might have been no second inaugural if grant had not slogged his way to victory at vicksburg and at the battle of the wilderness the lincoln and jefferson memorials live on the other side of immortality there is something enormously comforting about the luminous marble statues of the men those monuments honor , as if they were still there , dispensing the wisdom carved so memorably on the white marble walls but grant s tomb has an undeniable sepulchral gloom there is no statue of grant , only a hollow at the center of the main room through which one can gaze down onto his redbrown granite sarcophagus , and the matching sarcophagus of his wife , julia dent grant in the 1930 s , a change in the tomb allowed visitors to descend directly into the crypt where the bronze busts of grant s five favorite generals mcpherson , ord , sheridan , sherman and thomas ringed the general and his wife , keeping guard with fierce expressions this modification lets one get closer to what is left of grant , but it does little to bring one into contact with his complex character in a sense it is the contradictions of grant and of his tomb that make him so compelling when he died in 1885 , he was one of the most famous men in the world one million people turned out to see his funeral , 60 , 000 marched in the procession though at the time the spot was literally miles from the inhabited areas of manhattan , it was not only a popular destination for picnickers and strollers , it was also central to the imagination of the city and the nation , a place for rallies and memorial day gatherings today , though a bustling city exists around it , with its sweeping view of the hudson , the tomb has got to be one of the least visited places in new york this may be one of the reasons i love going there walking across the vast , empty plaza , which even inline skaters seem to avoid , i always feel i am approaching an undiscovered place that , for all its monumental architecture , is hidden from the rest of the city even the national park service rangers who run the site give it the look of something i would expect to find in , say , st louis , or galena , ill , the other places considered as burial sites for our 18th president behind the tomb , inside a little fencedin area , are a ginkgo tree and a chinese cork planted when the monument was completed in 1897 by two chinese dignitaries , li hung chang , grand secretary of state , and yang yu , envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary the quaint effect of these trees , and the descriptive plaque in english and chinese , clashes awkwardly with the garish mosaic benches that surround grant s tomb on three sides the result of a misguided attempt in the 1970 s to give the site contemporary appeal , the benches are the most dated thing about the entire structure i began visiting grant s tomb regularly about seven years ago when i moved to riverside drive i had abandoned a phd in english literature , had just gotten married and within months had taken a leave from my job to write fiction my future seemed entirely insecure and i would often break up a directionless day of writing with long walks through riverside park that would always end at grant s tomb it was not , i confess , out of historical devotion but personal need that i found the idea of grant comforting
albany , may 29 new york , until recently considered a leader in combating smoking , is rapidly becoming a laggard , as other states leapfrog past it in the size and aggressiveness of their efforts two years ago , new york was one of just four states that financed advertising and education programs aimed at persuading the public , particularly teenagers , not to smoke now , 8 states have such programs , and 11 others , including new jersey and connecticut , expect to begin theirs in the next year with one possible exception , all those states anticipate spending far more than new york on the programs , when adjusted for the states' populations gov george e pataki , a republican whose party has reaped major campaign contributions from the tobacco industry , has proposed spending 84 million on new york s antitobacco program over the next year , up from 82 million in the last year california , in contrast , is spending 1201 million in the current fiscal year florida is spending 704 million , and massachusetts , 60 million the cost of other existing state programs ranges from the 259 per person that oregon spends in its current budget to the 1126 that mississippi allots new york spends 45 cents per capita that s about like throwing a mosquito at an elephant , said michael moore , mississippi s attorney general , who led the multistate sixyear legal fight against tobacco companies it has no effect michael mckeon , mr pataki s press secretary , defended new york s program we could probably spend a zillion dollars , and there s always going to be advocates who say we could do more , he said but we think we have a good plan and a good program , and we 're always open to new ideas under mr pataki , new york began antitobacco advertising on radio and television three years ago those ads have been dismissed by antismoking groups as all but useless , mostly because they do not appeal to young people , and they are broadcast so infrequently that many people have never seen or heard them one shown last year featured dennis c vacco , then the attorney general , speaking earnestly of the dangers of smoking the most prominent part of new york s current campaign is billboards with a collage of celebrity faces and the line , we choose not to smoke , reminiscent of the just say no antidrug campaign of the 1980 s by contrast , ads in other states often have a slapintheface tone , aiming to be shocking or darkly funny one television ad shown in florida depicts a ceremony held in hades , with adolf hitler in the audience , to award tobacco the prize for most deaths caused , ranking ahead of other contenders like murder and drugs john signor , a spokesman for the new york state health department , which administers the antismoking program , noted that some of the advertisements used by new york were produced by other states or by the federal government we have a very comprehensive plan of advertising , education and enforcement , he said but timothy nichols , the director of governmental affairs for the american lung association , said new york pales in comparison to these other states what they call an antitobacco program , they might as well not even spend the money while antismoking groups in new york direct most of their criticism at the governor , the leaders of the legislature , in both parties , have put little pressure on him to strengthen new york s program the rush by states to start antitobacco programs has been propelled in part by research showing that aggressive advertising can be highly effective in reducing smoking several studies have reported that in the 1990 s , smoking has declined more than twice as fast in california , which has the oldest such program , as nationwide a report this year showed that just one year into florida s effort , middleschool students there were 19 percent less likely to smoke , and smoking by high school students had dropped 11 percent the federal centers for disease control and prevention called the results one of the largest documented oneyear changes in smoking rates anywhere in new york , as in the rest of the country , adult smoking has declined in the 1990 s a 1996 study found the rate at 23 percent of adults in new york , while in california it had dropped to 18 percent the prospect of having billions of dollars to spend from settlements with tobacco companies has also motivated states to embark on new antitobacco campaigns , a trend that has taken on particular intensity this spring , as states draft their budgets for the next fiscal year some states have also been swayed by the argument that the programs will save money , because the decline in smoking could cut healthcare costs in new jersey , gov christine todd whitman has proposed 186 million for antitobacco advertising , education and law enforcement in the fiscal year that starts july 1 , and legislative leaders have agreed in principle in connecticut , gov john g rowland has proposed just 200 , 000 , which would make it the only state spending less per capita than new york but leaders of the legislature are pressing in budget talks for a much higher figure
austin , tex , jan 9 in a stunning run of discoveries over the last three years , astronomers have observed 17 nearby stars that appear to be orbited by planets more or less the size of jupiter the most recent detection of a planet around a star other than the sun was described here today but while astronomers continue the search for more such objects , they have now seen enough to be puzzled by an emerging pattern none of these extrasolar planetary systems seems to resemble the sun s family of planets is this an observational fluke \? or is the solar system a cosmic oddball \? at a meeting of the american astronomical society , scientists reviewed the mystifying evidence all of these objects are found in orbits much closer to their parent stars than jupiter , the solar system s giant , is to the sun astrophysicists could only speculate how such large planets , ranging in mass from onehalf to 10 times the mass of jupiter , can orbit so close to a star and survive what must be destabilizing gravitational stresses other studies reveal that many of the stars orbited by large bodies typically have two to three times more heavy elements than exist in the sun and except for the extrasolar planets extremely close to their host stars , most of these objects appear to travel in orbits unlike those of planets around the sun for the first time , we have enough extrasolar planets out there to do some comparative study , said dr geoffrey w marcy of san francisco state university , who is the leading discoverer of these objects we are realizing that most of the jupiterlike planets far from their stars tool around in elliptical orbits , not circular orbits , which are the rule in our solar system dr marcy noted that 9 of the 17 detected extrasolar planets sweep relatively close to their stars and then swing far out again , giving an oval shape to their orbital paths the others travel in more circular orbits , presumably because they are even closer to their stars and are regulated by gravitational tides one of these is only four million miles from its star and takes only 42 days to complete its revolution , or year an elliptical orbit was observed for the most recently discovered extrasolar planet , around the star hd 168443 in the constellation serpens , the snake this new planet , dr marcy reported today , orbits its star once every 58 days at an average distance that is nearer to the star than mercury , with an 88day orbit , is to the sun the eccentricity of the newly discovered planet the degree that it deviates from a circular path is 054 , about 10 times the eccentricity in the orbit of most solar system planets theorists have proposed several possible explanations for such eccentric orbits when enough large planets orbit a star in proximity , perhaps they generate a gravitational slingshot that projects the planets into elongated orbits or perhaps a passing star has upset the delicate balance of these planetary systems in some cases , the planets could be perturbed because their star is part of a binary system , where two stars are locked in gravitational embrace if elliptical orbits appear to be common for other planets as massive as jupiter , astronomers are wondering what different circumstances in the solar system keep mighty jupiter and saturn in circular orbits it is not a trivial question , for the emergence of life on earth probably depended on the answer jupitersize bodies plunging toward and away from their stars are likely to sweep aside smaller worlds , sending them crashing into the star or flying out of orbit into interstellar space current technology is incapable of detecting earthsize planets around other stars , but they almost certainly could not exist near their star s warmth in a system so unsettled by large planets in wrecking orbits , dr marcy said the implications are also profound for the search for extraterrestrial life , dr marcy said yet of the all the sunlike stars that have been studied so far by planet seekers , only 5 percent have been found to have jupitermass planets in such eccentric orbits taking an optimistic view , dr marcy said that leaves 95 percent of stars that may be free of these influences and could harbor habitable planets although nearly all astronomers agree that these detected objects are extrasolar planets , a few holdouts are not so sure they have raised the possibility that these are brown dwarfs , objects that formed like stars but lacked sufficient mass to support nuclear fusion in their cores dr william d cochran , an astronomer at the university of texas here , said that too many of the objects had masses comparable to jupiter s for them to be brown dwarfs but at the meeting , he cautioned that they may not be planets , particularly because so many of them have eccentric orbits and are so close to their stars they might be some new type of object unlike anything in the solar system to find a new type of object would be an extremely exciting result , dr cochran said right now , we are still going to call them 'planets , ' even though they may really be something slightly different

the board of u s west inc , the smallest of the regional bell telephone companies , met last night to approve a merger with qwest communications international inc , the fastgrowing longdistance communications carrier , in a deal worth more than 30 billion the companies could announce a deal as soon as this weekend , according to executives close to the talks with this deal , a resolution of qwest s battle against global crossing ltd , an undersea fiber optic communications company , to acquire u s west and the frontier corporation , the big longdistance carrier , will probably begin to take shape it appears that qwest , which characterized its previous two offers for u s west as acquisitions , will instead call its deal with u s west a merger of equals u s west s previous deal to join forces with global crossing had been called a merger of equals and it appeared that u s west was not willing to step back from that terminology in dealing with qwest qwest and u s west will appoint equal numbers of members to the combined company s board in a similar vein , it appears that solomon d trujillo , the u s west chairman , who had not been assured a substantial operational role in the combined company under qwest s earlier offers , will become a member of a newly formed office of the chairman , to be led by joseph p nacchio , qwest s chief executive mr nacchio and mr trujillo could also potentially share the title of chairman but although qwest appeared to make concessions on executive leadership and structure , it did not appear that qwest agreed to raise its bid for u s west above its latest public offer of 69 a share u s west had earlier agreed to merge with global crossing for 60 a share , plus a special 1 dividend for each u s west share after u s west announces a deal with qwest , global crossing will have five business days to make a counteroffer but executives close to the talks said yesterday that qwest and global crossing had struck a deal under which global crossing would not contest qwest s deal with u s west and qwest would withdraw its bid for frontier global crossing would also agree to a reduction in the breakup fee it would be owed by u s west for backing out of their original deal , to roughly 425 million from 850 million , and part of it would be paid in the form of network services instead of cash , the executives said instead , global crossing would acquire only frontier , which would give global crossing an advanced nationwide longdistance communications network , an asset that at some level would seem to mesh more easily with global crossing s undersea network than would u s west s farflung local systems by splitting u s west and frontier , both qwest and global crossing would be able to declare victory global crossing would gain a united states network , and qwest would gain millions of customers u s west , which is based in denver , provides local telephone service in 14 states in the west and southwest but while the swirl of deals seemed to include something new for everyone except , perhaps , frontier , which would not become the subject of an even more prolonged bidding war some communications analysts were picking winners and losers yesterday this is a big win for qwest because it s proving that you can acquire your way into local access , said mark r bruneau , president of the business strategy group at renaissance worldwide , a consulting firm in boston , and it s a big loss for global crossing because it has a limited time to convert its lofty market valuation into a real , sustainable revenue engine and operation none of the companies involved would comment
chipper jones was shaking his head and chuckling a little at the absurdity of the situation the most consistent team of the 1990 s had just been rendered road kill by the yankees , and jones could not even find it in himself to be terribly upset the atlanta braves may have painted a beautiful picture for themselves this decade the best record over that span , the finest pitching rotation of their generation but it was as if they had just got a glimpse of picasso at work they could only stand back in wonder , dazzled by the masterpiece they played pretty much a perfect series , said jones , the braves' third baseman they were awesome , from the starting pitching to the relief to defense to clutch hitting they did it all if they play a perfect series , they 're going to sweep just about anybody they were awesome we lost to a superior team there is little bitterness between these two teams , none of the animosity that existed between the braves and the mets that prevented them from saying a kind word about each other except through tightly clenched teeth it was telling , in the aftermath of the yankees' game 4 victory wednesday night , that only manager bobby cox who undoubtedly will have to answer questions about why his team repeatedly dominates the regular season only to collapse in the postseason seemed truly traumatized by the result cox admitted that he was unusually emotional after the loss more so than in 1996 , when the braves won the first two games at yankee stadium , only to lose the next four the rest of the team , as second baseman bret boone explained afterward , had seen this coming perhaps if the braves had made this more of a series , if they had lost a game 7 , it would have been more difficult to accept instead , the braves simply gushed at what the yankees do , the patience they show at the plate , their discipline in executing a game plan seamlessly if you give any pitcher of his stature the chance to close out the world series , you 'll see foam coming out of their mouth , john smoltz said of roger clemens , the pitcher who outdueled him for the game 4 victory if i pitch 10 more games like this , i think i 'll win nine every hit they got was amazing what amazes me is how some guys lay off pitches i could n't believe some of the pitches i threw and they laid off i was throwing a ton of pitches they should have swung at it s a team plan they attack the pitcher with the same plan no matter who s there they are so disciplined they do n't go up freehacking the yankees play like a national league team they do all the things they have to do to win i do n't know in 1996 if i felt this way i thought we should have won you ca n't say we should have won this series you ca n't feel we were the better team no way jones , especially , was overwhelmed by the yankees' pitching staff , which held the braves' hitters to a desperate 200 batting average he likened clemens s pitches to a chainsaw slicing through the strike zone , and paid homage to a team that had had to battle the long shadow cast by last year s recordsetting season i played that team they had last year , jones said i did n't think i 'd ever seen a ball club stronger from 1 to 25 than they were if it s possible , i think this team is better they did n't win as many games in the regular season , but they were just as dominant in the postseason it was their pitching we 've got some guys who are capable of swinging the bats and they shut us down roger clemens was as good as i 've ever seen him it s a dominant performance by the staff that earned them the sweep greg maddux joked that the braves had to be pretty good to lose so many world series four of the five they played in the 1990 s but he was more impressed with the yankees' phenomenal number 12 straight victories in world series games , dating to the four games in a row the yankees won from the braves in 1996 after the braves had taken a 20 lead in the series the yankees have not lost in the world series since and have lost just three playoff games in the last two seasons it s amazing that they 've won 12 straight , maddux said it s hard enough just to play in 12 games , let alone win them all that s something i would stick my head up really high about , if i had that number on my side photo chipper jones , center in the dugout , had shown little respect for the mets but he said the yankees played pretty much a perfect series \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
the old factory building on 43d avenue and 97th place looks much like its neighbors in that industrial stretch of corona , queens at one end , workers sell live chickens from big metal cages in another section , seamstresses piece together ladies' garments nowhere is there a hint that this is actually a place with a pretty interesting past , that just 60 years ago , artisans for louis comfort tiffany worked here , shaping fanciful lampshades laden with peacocks and dragonflies of glass soon , though , the red bricks will bear a small bronze memorial to that history for today , the old tiffany workshop , along with 10 other humbly notable buildings in east elmhurst and corona , the neighborhoods honored this year , becomes a queensmark the local version of the official designation awarded by the city s landmarks preservation commission from across the river in manhattan nobody is suggesting that these queensmarks can compare with such official city landmarks as trinity church in lower manhattan or the ansonia hotel on the upper west side , which virtually drip with historical relevance then again , this is queens , the rodney dangerfield of boroughs , preservationally speaking to go by there , you would n't necessarily know that it was once tiffany s studios , said stanley cogan , president of the queens historical society and a prime mover behind the queensmarking movement he admitted that the blocklong building has little architectural character , but added , we 're giving it for its culture and history , because how much more splendid a name could you get than tiffany \? a quick flip through the official guide to new york city s historic landmarks shows why the historical society felt the need to make its own designations manhattan boasts more than 500 landmarked buildings and 38 historic districts , while queens has only 41 buildings and 2 districts even staten island outshines queens , historically speaking , with 67 landmarked structures and 2 districts , making the city s largest borough dead last in landmarks so the leaders of the society , a band of dedicated weekend preservationists , decided a few years ago to rectify this landmark inequity they regularly scour the streets of queens looking for buildings of historical or architectural merit and select a few each year to queensmark this year s queensmarks also include a firehouse with french flourishes on its facade , several churches and the new york hall of science in flushing meadowscorona park \( in addition , one of the borough s culinary landmarks , the lemon ice king of corona , will receive a special mention \) they will be honored today at a ceremony at the hall of science , joining 46 others already given bronze plaques that confer an air of historic value without subjecting the buildings' owners to the legal restrictions on renovation or demolition imposed by law on official landmarks dr cogan and other members of the historical society said that queens' underdog status in the annals of historical significance stems in part from outsiders' perception that there is little of historic value in queens but they also said that the generally working class nature of the borough has , for the most part , favored development and pragmatism over preservation the downfall of queens , preservationwise , goes all the way back to the 1840 s , said dr cogan , citing the prohibition on cemeteries in manhattan , which resulted in a developers' rush to buy and clear huge tracts of land in queens to create cemeteries there are fewer historic places to start with because lots of the oldies were torn down long ago , he added , noting that the developers' pattern of buy and destroy continued into the early 20th century i have a saying , he said queens is landmarks' stepchild and the developers' paradise but even though hundreds , perhaps thousands , of buildings of historic value have been destroyed by the wrecking ball or lost their historic cachet in renovations over the years , dr cogan insists that there remain many more that deserve some type of historic recognition previously queensmarked buildings include victorian homes in richmond hill , old factory buildings in college point , gardenapartment complexes in jackson heights , and row houses in the hunters point section of long island city the historical society started the queensmark program in 1996 in richmond hill and then moved onto other neighborhoods across the borough dr cogan said he originally envisioned two grand queensmark announcements every year , but quickly learned that the tiny historical society could n't sustain that pace the six members of the selection committee , all of them volunteers and some of them architects and historians , first survey selected neighborhoods , sometimes on foot and sometimes while peering through the windshields of their cars after arguing over the merits of various choices they select the dozen finest then there are the details of actually scheduling a program , making the plaques and inviting all the interested parties it s really quite a production , you know , dr cogan said

mayor rudolph w giuliani would postpone his plan to bring school vouchers to new york city next fall under a tentative compromise reached in closeddoor budget negotiations , city , education and union officials said yesterday invoking the timehonored political tactic of defusing controversy by formally authorizing a delay , mayoral aides and city council negotiators agreed in principle to finance a costly study of vouchers mr giuliani could still scuttle the deal , which some described as a facesaver for the mayor , who faced potentially insurmountable political opposition to the voucher plan he had pushed for months aides to the mayor , who was traveling in michigan yesterday , said he had not signed off on any plan we 're still in negotiations there has been no settlement yet , said brenda perez , a spokeswoman for the mayor but council members say his aides have agreed to the outlines of a compromise there is not going to be a voucher program next year everybody understands that , herbert e berman , chairman of the city council finance committee , said yesterday we are going to study possible ways of improving the schools officials said the deal would set aside 6 million in the next fiscal year the amount the mayor originally requested for an experimental voucher program to pay for a study of vouchers and other education ideas city council , union and board of education officials said they were confident that none of that money could be diverted to an actual voucher program without the consent of the council mr giuliani first proposed using tax dollars to send public school students to private and religious schools in his state of the city address last january , saying that new yorkers should not be afraid of change and adding , do n't kill it even before it gets a chance to grow over the last few months , he has made the plan a cornerstone of his education agenda , as he considers running for the united states senate vouchers are particularly popular with the national republican party , and among many black and hispanic voters who have not been among the mayor s traditional supporters but the mayor s plan also prompted a threat by schools chancellor rudy crew to resign if the mayor tried to push vouchers through the board of education , and it triggered a bitter debate among new yorkers , with the teachers' union and many religious and civic leaders accusing mr giuliani of abdicating his responsibility to the public schools mr giuliani argued that vouchers would force the public schools to improve by creating competition in the face of dr crew s threat to resign , mr giuliani revised his voucher plan so that it would be run by city hall , not by the board of education he proposed to use 12 million over two years 6 million starting in the fall as seed money to induce one school district to volunteer for a pilot voucher program but aides said that money for tuition could still come out of the board of education budget and could amount to much more hillary rodham clinton , a possible rival senate candidate , alluded to mr giuliani s feud with dr crew over vouchers and other issues in a public appearance only this week , suggesting that education would be a focus of the campaign aides to dr crew said they were familiar with the outlines of the deal and were satisfied that it would not pave the way for a pilot voucher program or force the chancellor to carry out his threat to resign we are not in the least worried about any misuse , or any end run , said chiara coletti , a spokeswoman for dr crew randi weingarten , president of the teachers' union , the united federation of teachers , said she , too , liked the plan and did not expect it to result in a pilot voucher program but officials also cited the mayor s tenacity and said that they did not expect him to give up his advocacy of vouchers i would assume that the mayor is still going to be interested in convincing the universe of the positive impact of his voucher program , mr berman said i do n't think the mayor gives up that easily i'm sure that no matter what we work out , over the ensuing year or so he s going to pursue that the 6 million a year for the study project would be allocated in the miscellaneous portion of the city budget , rather than in the board of education s portion , thus avoiding any implication that the council or the mayor were trying to force any programs on the board , officials said the agreement would allow the council and the mayor to study a wide array of initiatives , ranging from changes in education finance to the creation of more charter schools
despite a threeyear surge in bus ridership , new york city transit has cut service on about 20 percent of its routes , including some of the most popular , according to a report released yesterday by the straphangers campaign , a transit watchdog group the group , basing its analysis on new york city transit s own records , found that fewer buses are running along 41 of the 201 routes served by the transit agency , including such heavily traveled manhattan routes as the m1 , m2 and m3 along madison avenue and fifth avenue , and the m104 on broadway a new york city transit spokesman , al o'leary , said yesterday that the report contained a kernel of truth and reflected the difficulties faced by the agency in accommodating a rapidly growing ridership but he said that the straphangers campaign had not taken into account the complex logistics involved in managing new york city s huge grid of bus routes the system is trying to adjust as quickly as possible to changing ridership patterns , mr o'leary said he said that he did not know the specifics of those 41 routes but mr o'leary said that , as a general rule , new york city transit has some routes with more buses than are needed , and these routes are candidates for reductions in its report , the straphangers campaign examined ridership data on all new york city transit bus routes for the twoyear period that ended in january , and compared that information to changes in service levels during a slightly longer period , beginning in september 1996 the cuts on several bus routes have led to elbowintheribs crowding and more bus bunching , said gene russianoff , staff attorney for the straphangers campaign bus bunching is when several buses arrive at a stop at the same time , after a long period in which none come bus ridership in neighborhoods across the city has increased sharply , and the rise is attributed largely to the robust economy and tourism , which began pushing up demand for all forms of public transportation in 1996 , and to the advent of free transfers between subways and buses in july 1997 information provided yesterday by new york city transit , a unit of the metropolitan transportation authority , showed that a daily average of 22 million people were riding its buses during the first three months of this year , up from slightly more than 2 million a day for all of 1998 bus ridership has increased steadily since 1996 , when the daily average sank to 16 million after several years of declines although executives of new york city transit have applauded the turnaround in ridership and said they intend to add many buses to their fleet over the next two years , mr o'leary said yesterday that the expansion of service cannot be carried out immediately we have to do this in a systematic way , he said , adding that the transit agency must conduct a detailed analysis to determine which of its bus routes are attracting the most new riders and avoid adding buses where they are not needed the agency has been expanding its bus fleet , adding 600 buses during weekday peak service hours , to a total of 3 , 700 , since mid1996 , he said mr o'leary said another installment of its bus service expansion is due this summer , with 73 million budgeted by new york city transit for new buses that will be put into service over the next three months he declined to say how many buses would be added , or where they would be deployed , but said that service would be expanded on at least 10 of the 41 routes identified as having sustained service cuts

as a boy , i went for many years to the dragon school in oxford the rooms in which we lived were called leviathan and pterodactyl and ichthyosaurus the men who instructed us in dead languages were \( through some arcane local custom \) known always by their nicknames guv and plum and inky a few of the boys at the school , and they were nearly all boys , had come there from the squirrel school , down the street and once we 'd mastered our secret runes , we would proceed , as old dragons , to another medieval castle , full of dungeons and towers , where boys in black robes , called praepostors \( the word is the source of our own preposterous \) , would sweep into classrooms at 11 40 each morning to summon malefactors to the headmaster s study i mention all this because , as harry potter s adventures conquer the nation \( i would n't be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future , j k rowling writes , with wizardly prescience , in the first chapter of the first book \) , readers on this side of the atlantic may not appreciate how much there is of realism , as well as magic , in the exotic tales of young sorcerers being trained at the hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the classical boardingschool process favored by the english middle classes is esoteric in fact , mad to the point of resembling some charms school for apprentice mages the main languages we learned , from the ages of 7 to 14 , were ones that had been out of use for 2 , 000 years or more , and friday nights would find us bouncing up and down in our pajamas , reciting the principal parts of greek irregular verbs every sunday night , in our flowing black robes \( we were known as tugs \) , we would gather in a classroom dating from 1441 to sing hymns in latin , and whenever we passed a beak ie , a teacher in the street , we were allowed to greet him only by raising one solemn finger silently into the air what movies like heathers \( or novels like the virgin suicides \) are to the american experience of growing up , the harry potter books , i suspect , are to the english the heart of magic realism is that if you describe the features of one culture to another , radically different , they will seem as strange and wonderful as fairy tale the people of aracataca , in colombia , doubtless read much of garcia mrquez as if it were the local newspaper and my own mother treats the fantastications of salman rushdie s imagination as an unfailingly accurate account of daytoday life in the bombay of her youth what j k rowling has done , with considerable charm and inventive brio , is to take the traditional rituals of english public schools and show them in a light in which they seem as curious to outsiders as the rites of passage of tribal africa she makes it easy to overlook the fact that the most visible character going through harry potter s training even now is harry windsor for those who passed through these eccentric playgrounds , though , much in the harry potter universe can seem as familiar , and even as nostalgic , as passages in cyril connolly s enemies of promise here are all the rites i remember as vividly as lemon drops the cryptic list of instructions that would appear through the mail , describing what we must and must n't bring to school \( the point of all the rules being not to make order so much as to enforce obedience \) the trip to dusty old shops with creaky family names new lingwood or alden blackwell where aged men would fit us out with the approved uniform and equipment , as they had done for our fathers and our fathers' fathers the special school train that would be waiting in a london station to transport us to our cells once the doors clanged shut behind us , we knew we were inside an alternative reality where none of the usual rules applied and where there was only one sex , everyone wore tails every day and it was assumed that every boy would partake of anglican worship twice a day it is precisely through the accumulation of such details that rowling casts her spell , the names of her boys ringing out like hoofs on cobblestones crabbe and goyle and longbottom and finchfletchley \( many , in

bays and tuckshops where we mumbled the lord s prayer in latin and thought it strange that some children did n't run a steeplechase through agar s plough one could even say that the stranger the detail in rowling s world , the closer it is to something everyday to us as gruel harry plays quidditch , a peculiar game featuring bludgers and chasers and quaffles we had three brutal sports not played in any other school , the most savage of which had walls and behinds and no official goal scored since 1909 at harry s school , inscrutably , the thirdfloor corridor on the righthand side is

washington , dec 19 former senator bill bradley and vice president al gore have been sniping at each other over health care for weeks , and their disagreements have become a way of defining the differences between the two candidates for the democratic presidential nomination in a televised debate today , the candidates continued to argue over the merits and details of their health care proposals , with each accusing the other of distorting his position mr gore s health policy is , as might be expected , a continuation of policies proposed by president clinton since the collapse of his plan in 1994 to guarantee health insurance for all americans mr gore , like mr clinton , proposes a series of incremental steps to expand two programs for poor people and lowincome families medicaid and the children s health insurance program and like mr clinton , mr gore proposes a major investment in medicare , the federal insurance program for the elderly and the disabled , to offer prescription drug coverage to all beneficiaries and to shore up the hospital insurance trust fund mr bradley says his proposals are bolder , more ambitious and more comprehensive he says he would require all parents to obtain insurance for their children and he would let families purchase insurance through the health program that covers government workers , the federal employees health benefits program mr bradley would offer subsidies , on a sliding scale , to help lowincome families buy such coverage when he unveiled his proposals in september , mr bradley emphasized the importance of government doing a few big things well and on the nbc news program meet the press today , mr bradley said his proposals showed that he was willing to deal with a big problem , a comprehensive problem in a way that ensures middleclass americans some health mr bradley , like mr gore , would provide prescription drug benefits under medicare mr bradley s proposals cost more than mr gore s , but the disparity is not as great as is often suggested equally significant , mr bradley and mr gore have chosen to spend the money in different ways mr bradley would use most of the money to expand coverage for people under the age of 65 , while mr gore would use billions of dollars to extend the life of medicare s hospital trust fund by 12 years , to 2027 on friday , mr gore said he would set aside 15 percent of the anticipated federal surplus over 15 years for medicare , and he asserted that mr bradley does not set aside a penny for it pressed to explain how he would ensure the solvency of medicare for the babyboom generation , mr bradley said , we 're going to be able to probably have a reduction in medicare costs over time , because of breakthroughs in drugs and healthier living habits , including more exercise and less smoking here is a comparison of the main aspects of the democrats' health care proposals cost mr bradley says his proposals would cost 55 billion to 65 billion a year in the current political climate , that is a huge sum in the last 10 months , congress struggled to find an additional 3 billion a year for medicare most of the money sought by mr bradley would be used to subsidize the premiums on private insurance bought by lowincome families in addition , 5 billion to 7 billion would go for tax breaks to help people buy health insurance , 10 billion would go for medicare drug benefits and 2 billion would be used to improve public health programs mr gore s campaign has given only 10year cost estimates for his proposals he says he would spend 146 billion over 10 years , about 15 billion a year , to increase the number of people with health insurance in addition , mr gore says he would invest 374 billion in medicare over the next 10 years that includes 118 billion for drug benefits most of the remainder would bolster the medicare trust fund coverage mr bradley says his proposals would provide health insurance for 30 million of the 44 million americans who have no coverage aides to mr gore say his proposals would cover 11 million to 15 million people medicaid in place of medicaid as it now exists , mr bradley would offer financial assistance to lowincome people to buy private health insurance the nation , he says , should mainstream current recipients of medicaid this would be a major change medicaid now provides health insurance to 40 million people the package of benefits is more generous than that typically offered to workers by employers mr bradley says his proposal would provide greater choice of insurance plans to people now on medicaid but mr gore has harshly criticized mr bradley s proposals , saying they would shred an important part of the safety net for poor people mr gore said today that mr bradley s plan eliminates medicaid and replaces it with little 150amonth vouchers mr bradley replied that s wrong that s not correct it s not a voucher it is , rather , a rough approximation of the federal contribution to the cost of private health insurance for poor people mr bradley s web site says that for current medicaid recipients and for adults with annual incomes below the poverty level \( 16 , 400 for a family of four in 1997 \) , the government would pay the full annual premium , 1 , 800 a year for an adult and up to 5 , 000 for a family mr gore says it is difficult to buy good health insurance through the federal employees program for 1 , 800 a year , or 150 a month ninetyfive percent of all the health insurance plans that are part of the federal employee benefit plan have premiums that are far in excess of the 150 a month , mr gore said mr bradley insisted that these figures were not a cap on the federal contribution , but rather a weighted average of what the government would contribute moreover , he said , medicaid is far from perfect medicaid is supposed to cover people who are poor , he said but 40 percent of the people who are in poverty in this country do not have any health insurance none medicaid does n't cover them children the candidates agree on the importance of health insurance for children , but disagree on the best way to provide it mr gore says he would guarantee access to affordable health coverage for every child in america , by offering tax breaks and by expanding medicaid and the new children s health insurance program mr bradley says he would guarantee not just access to insurance , but actual coverage under his proposal , he said , no child in this country will be without health insurance parents will enroll their children in health plans at the moment of birth , just as they sign up for auto insurance when they buy cars , he said
phoenix , sept 27 his voice firm but his eyes glistening , former vice president dan quayle effectively bid farewell today to a national political career that has made him a household name and sometimes a household laughingstock for more than a decade , announcing that he would abandon his quest for the republican presidential nomination for lack of money and support there s a time to stay and there s a time to fold , mr quayle said quietly as his wife , marilyn , stood beside him at a hotel news conference in his adopted home state here there s a time to know when to leave the stage mr quayle endorsed none of his rivals , but pledged to work for the republicans' eventual nominee , which he said appeared all but certain to be gov george w bush of texas he took pains to note that at 52 , he was hardly over the hill and , referring wryly to richard m nixon s famous premature farewell , said i seriously doubt if this will be my last press conference still there was an air of poignancy , as mrs quayle seemed to struggle to hold back tears and mistyeyed aides lined the wall of an elegant frank lloyd wright ballroom at the arizona biltmore resort and spa it is always possible that mr quayle , who was a senator from indiana , could run for lesser office someday , but even longtime aides said his days as a national candidate were effectively over , a casualty of his lingering if in their eyes unfair reputation as a lightweight it was sort of a sad moment today , though in some ways perhaps an inevitable one , said william kristol , mr quayle s vicepresidential chief of staff and now the editor of the weekly standard , a conservative magazine by chance mr kristol watched his old boss s announcement from the bush campaign headquarters in austin , tex , where he had gone to interview the republican frontrunner i think he underestimated how much damage had been done from the vicepresidential years and that he could n't just sit out a few years and then come back , mr kristol said i think if he were on a successful second term as a governor , things would look different in today s news conference , and in a telephone interview afterward , mr quayle expressed no bitterness over the image problems that dogged him from the moment of his debut as george bush s running mate in 1988 , from questions about his national guard service during the vietnam war to doubts about his spelling ability when he put an e on potato before a group of new jersey school children instead , mr quayle sounded notes of gratitude for the help of his family and friends , blended with frustration at his inability to raise enough money to compete in next year s string of frontloaded primaries believe me , there s about 15 different ways you could conclude a campaign , he said in the interview this would 've been no 16 mr quayle said that his new hampshire campaign chairman , former gov john h sununu , who was chief of staff in the bush white house , had convinced him that he had a reasonable shot at winning the primary there , and his own polls showed him gaining , aides said but even if he won new hampshire , mr quayle said , he concluded that he could not afford to compete with mr bush in the 18 contests that will occur within 30 days afterward reality set in , mr quayle said , and in discussions over the weekend , he decided that winning the nomination would be virtually impossible for months , mr quayle had said he would not go through the exercise of running if he did not think he could win , and so he made his announcement today in the first six months of this year , mr quayle raised about 35 million , compared with 37 million for mr bush , but aides said that was not mr quayle s only problem money s a part of it but it s not all of it , said mr quayle s poll taker , kellyanne fitzpatrick , who noted how accelerated the election cycle seems at this point in the fall of 1991 , george stephanopoulos was just making his first acquaintance with bill and hillary clinton how we judge and select our candidates has changed so significantly since then i always say to be nominated as a republican , you need cash , conservatism , character and chits , ms fitzpatrick said but you also need chatter , and this year the emphasis on buzzbuilding has surpassed so many of these other nuts and bolts at the same time , mr quayle , who had sought to define himself in large measure by his support for traditional family values , was at pains to compete against other candidates , like steve forbes and patrick j buchanan , for the support of the party s more conservative voters like former gov lamar alexander of tennessee , who with representative john r kasich of ohio and senator robert c smith of new hampshire preceded him in dropping out of the republican race , mr quayle said he would favor increasing the 1 , 000 individual limit on presidential campaign contributions to make it easier to raise money but he said he opposed any proposals for more taxpayerfinanced matching funds for campaigns ms fitzpatrick and other aides said mr quayle had also been handicapped by having to run against governor bush , whose father had plucked mr quayle from comparative obscurity in the senate to run for vice president she said mr quayle was too much of a gentleman to take a chainsaw to the frontrunner in the interview , mr quayle also reflected on the challenges of facing the son of his old patron i never imagined in my wildest dreams that i would be running against george bush s son , he said things would have been a lot different had that not happened a lot it was very awkward i was very loyal to president bush and the whole family today , george w bush said of his rival , i wish him all the best since leaving the white house , mr quayle has written books , appeared on the lecture circuit and served on corporate and charitable boards he said today that he and his wife planned to take time off to decompress but that it was too early to talk about what he might do next , except that he would continue to fight for those ideas that i believe in , fight for the philosophy of smaller government , lowering taxes , strengthening the american family and reinvesting in our national defense those are the ideas of the republican party as well , he added i'm going to work to unite this party like mr bush , mr quayle said he hoped mr buchanan would not bolt to the reform party , saying , i do n't think we ought to write anyone out of the republican party mr kristol said he thought time had already vindicated some of the views for which mr quayle was once mocked , like his broadside against the plot line celebrating single motherhood on the television comedy murphy brown he was willing to take abuse for saying something that everyone now acknowledges was pretty important , mr kristol said in that respect , he will have a kind of intellectual and moral vindication mr kristol added , one of the odd things about politics is when you get out , you get treated more fairly photo dan quayle with his wife , marilyn , today after announcing that he would no longer seek the republican presidential nomination \( associated press \)
mayor rudolph w giuliani offered strong praise yesterday for the 792 billion republican tax cut passed by congress this summer , saying it would be great if the plan became law with his remarks , mr giuliani drew a clear distinction on what could be a central issue in a race against hillary rodham clinton for united states senator mr giuliani had until now refrained from offering an opinion on the tax cut , the largest in nearly 20 years president clinton has pledged to veto it , and prospective democratic congressional candidates , mrs clinton among them , have attacked it as a threat to such programs as medicare and social security the republican mayor , first in an interview on msnbc and later at city hall , said it was unlikely that a tax cut of this magnitude would become law but he urged congress to reach a compromise that came close to the 792 billion republican plan , rather than a 300 billion alternative put forward by democrats i certainly would support a lot more than the 300 billion and a lot closer to the 800 billion that the republican leadership wants , and if they can get all of it that would be great , mr giuliani said in the television interview but i would be willing to compromise some of it , if you got kind of close to it , but not at 300 billion mr giuliani has long pressed for tax cuts as mayor but the 792 billion congressional tax cut , which washington republicans would like to make a central issue in the 2000 congressional elections , has posed a potential problem for him as he contemplates a race in new york political strategists in both parties say tax cuts are not a particular compelling issue in the state mr giuliani has been attacked by conservative republicans for failing to endorse the bill mrs clinton has attacked the tax cut as a threat to the nation s economy and domestic programs , in what her aides said was an attempt to force mr giuliani to take sides on the issue the first lady s political aides seized on mr giuliani s remarks as soon as the msnbc interview was broadcast finally rudy giuliani shows his true colors , said howard wolfson , mrs clinton s campaign press secretary hillary clinton opposes this irresponsible scheme because it would threaten economic progress and jeopardize social security , medicare and education at city hall , mr giuliani said he was prepared to accept a smaller tax cut , but he called the democratic proposals meager if you want to do tax cuts , you have to always recognize that you should ask for more , be willing to settle for less , but not settle for insignificant amounts , which is what the president s proposal right now would be , mr giuliani said he said the most important taxes to cut , for the sake of new york state , were the capital gains tax , which he said was crimping business development , and the income tax mr giuliani also offered support yesterday for gov george w bush of texas , a republican candidate for president , in his refusal to answer questions about past drug use , and the mayor criticized the news media for raising the issue this is for the purpose of just hounding the man this is a game , mr giuliani said the mayor volunteered that he himself had never tried marijuana or cocaine i 've answered that before , and i regret actually having answered it , mr giuliani said it s really none of your business if i did or i did n't
george steinbrenner strolled through the bowels of yankee stadium last night with his chest puffed out and a confident look on his face he was heading for joe torre s office to congratulate the manager after the yankees stymied the rangers , 31 , to take a commanding 20 lead in the threeoffivegame series when steinbrenner was asked if he was most impressed with the pitching on a night when andy pettitte fired sevenandonethird crisp innings , jeff nelson notched two strikeouts and mariano rivera pitched a powerful ninth with two more strikeouts , the owner instead focused on an intangible i like the heart of this team , he said this team has a lot of character the yankees displayed that by beating texas for the eighth straight time in the postseason and forcing the rangers to begin seriously pondering their offseason plans if the rangers had won , game 3 tomorrow night would have been quite interesting because of the pressure on roger clemens to rescue the yankees now they are going for a sweep and feeling very confident two to none in a fivegame series is huge , torre said it puts a team at a terrific advantage one reason the yankees have that advantage is because nelson was spectacular after replacing pettitte in the eighth with the yankees clinging to a 21 lead , nelson whiffed ivan rodriguez and juan gonzalez and pumped his first as he danced off the mound am i happy to be up , 20 \? steinbrenner said i 'd much rather be up , 20 , than down , 20

to the editor your column noted how some temporary workers like the flexibility and variety in fact , many temps do n't like the work at all and while some temps may enjoy morphing into permatemping , many resent the fact that they perform the same work as regular workers , but at less pay and with no job security or guaranteed access to health care , pensions , holiday or vacation pay or paid sick leave temp work can be great when it s voluntary , fair and equitable for many , it s none of the above ellen bravo milwaukee , april 22 the writer is codirector of 9 to 5 , national association of working women
los angeles , may 5 seinfeld was often called the prototype of the postmodern sitcom , and so it seemed apt that the last episode involved a strange dream sequence and a sinister finale for a group of selfabsorbed singles stumbling in an amoral world now compare that with the recent taping of the final episode of home improvement , a primetime hit on abc for the past eight seasons after a tearful tim allen , the star , told a joke for a cast and crew drenched in tears , they taped a slightly maudlin story , scheduled to air on may 25 , in which mr allen s character reaffirms his love for his wife and family , and his loyal sidekick finds the love that had long eluded him , lending the closing a poignant moral gravity the episode was touching and , many people in television believe , a historical relic , as the traditional family sitcom a staple of the medium for more than four decades goes the way of the western if that show was pitched to a network today , nobody would take it , lamented matt williams , one of the creators and an executive producer of home improvement and previously a producer of another traditional family sitcom , the cosby show this show was created to celebrate the american family , and i'm not sure you can do that in the same way now at one time domestic sitcoms like father knows best , leave it to beaver , the dick van dyke show , the brady bunch and even all in the family and sanford and son virtually defined television while conveying powerful images of an often idealized if somewhat quirky middleclass existence built around family units households across the united states generally had a single television , there were only three networks , and the experience of watching such shows was shared those days are long gone homes frequently have many television sets 74 percent of homes now have more than one , compared with 35 percent in 1970 and with the advent of cable and satellite television there are now scores of channels transmitting images that have changed subtly but significantly singles dominate sitcoms shows like friends , the drew carey show or ally mcbeal , for example and the networks for the most part no longer even try to attract broad audiences audiences are deeply divided by age and even by race advertisers press the networks to pursue thin slices of the audience , preferably younger , affluent , white men , and pay dearly to reach them advertising age , a trade publication , reports that advertisers pay 425 , 000 for a 30second spot on friends , compared with 210 , 000 for an ad on home improvement and just 115 , 000 for an ad on cosby perhaps the most successful family sitcom still on the air is the simpsons , fox s animated sendup about a dysfunctional family whose creator , matt groening , openly describes it as the anticosby show the idea and delight we once took in celebrating family , community seems to be vaporizing before us , said norman lear , the creator of shows like all in the family and the jeffersons you now have all these shows about lone people coming together it seems to me this is part of something profound it s a disease of our time there s a television in every room and the family has become splintered one of the last popular domestic sitcoms is everybody loves raymond , on cbs phil rosenthal , a creator and an executive producer , said he faced enormous resistance from network executives when he presented the idea several years ago to be honest , there was nothing about the premise of this show that anybody at a network found attractive , mr rosenthal said they said it had to be edgier , hipper , not so family but what you have to realize is that this is a show about a family with kids , but it is very much for an adult audience it s not aimed at the broad audiences it s a new kind of family show , maybe an evolutionary step indeed , there are people who believe that while the oldstyle show may be dying , there is plenty of demand for newstyle family shows perhaps it wo n't be a traditional family sitcom , but i think america is waiting for the next one , said warren littlefield , a producer who was president of nbc entertainment when it put shows like seinfeld and friends on its schedule the rule in television is follow the trends , then buck them nevertheless , the producers of home improvement have decided to all but pull out of the medium that made them wealthy , a rarity in the business indeed , the show s finale was conspicuously elegiac for the team that created and oversaw home improvement , mr williams , carmen finestra and david mcfadzean , who make up the wind dancer production group home improvement was one of the great successes of the early 1990 s and it may earn 1 billion by the time its years of reruns run out , television executives say the wind dancer partners are estimated to have earned tens of millions of dollars each on the program
washington , oct 2 in the last quartercentury , only one senator , bob dole in 1996 , has won his party s nomination for president but this has not been for lack of trying some of the most prominent senators in both parties have tried for the nomination and lost badly , among them the democrats edward m kennedy , john glenn and henry m jackson and the republicans howard h baker jr , phil gramm and richard g lugar in 1984 , when senator ernest f hollings of south carolina was running a campaign for the democratic nomination that went nowhere , a reporter asked him whether all senators dreamed of becoming president every damn one , every damn day , mr hollings replied , an observation that he says holds true today this year , the prominent senator running seemingly quixotically for president is orrin g hatch of utah , a 65yearold republican , the chairman of the judiciary committee , a fixture on the sunday television interview programs and a masterly dealmaker with a wide range of legislative accomplishments over 22 years in the senate , including expansion of health insurance and a measure to contain terrorism in august , senator hatch finished last among nine contestants in the iowa straw poll he was second to alan l keyes , the radio talkshow host , in the alabama straw poll they were the only two competing mr hatch has raised barely 1 million , less than 2 percent of the 56 million collected by the frontrunner , gov george w bush of texas tied to washington by his legislative responsibilities , he spent only a few days campaigning last month no one in republican circles outside his own campaign staff believes he stands a chance to win the nomination senator hatch concedes that his candidacy is a long shot so why is he running \? here is how he answered that question in an interview in his office this week the single most important issue is who s going to appoint the up to five supreme court justices and the 50 percent of the rest of the judiciary i'm very concerned about having al gore or bill bradley do that in fact , i'm concerned about having any of the other republican candidates do that because none of them have any experience in this area i have more experience than all the rest put together beyond that , it s going to take a conservative with guts to handle the nation s problems , to solve social security and medicare , and i'm the conservative with the most guts he is way behind , he said , because he started late , not announcing his candidacy until july 1 let s face it , he went on , most people do n't even know i'm in the race i found that some of my closest friends in california did n't know it he takes heart , mr hatch said , from his experience in his first race for the senate in 1976 when he started running , he was a lawyer in private practice hardly known around his state all of a sudden , the dust cleared , he said , and i was the united states senator as for governor bush , he s way ahead in the polls , but he s a mile wide and an inch deep , said mr hatch , who tends to talk about himself in the third person orrin hatch is 40 miles deep and 10 inches wide mr hatch continued on mr bush he s a very fine person i love his parents but i'm concerned because you have a man here who has four years of experience in a constitutionally weak governorship does that qualify him to go up against an al gore or a bill bradley \? here is mr hatch s take on some of his other competitors senator john mccain of arizona can you name very many pieces of legislation he s done \? has he been able to bring all sides together \? he s the author of the mccainfeingold bill that bill would wreck the republican party \( the bill , which mr mccain is sponsoring with senator russell feingold , democrat of wisconsin , would eliminate unrestricted donations to political parties \) elizabeth dole i wish her well i do n't think there are very many people who believe she s going to be our nominee for president steve forbes i do n't think money is a qualification for being president of the united states a lot of us have worked very hard to make sure this party sheds the image that it s the party of the rich senator hatch s chief strategist , sal russo , said frontrunners in their first campaigns for president generally faltered mr hatch s intention , mr russo said , is to be around to pick up the pieces if mr bush founders in the end , mr hatch said , it s going to come down to george bush , john mccain and myself , and he said the party will turn to him because of his experience but mr hatch s experience is entirely legislative , and he sounds more like a legislator than a presidential candidate this is how he described his ability to work with democrats here s a fellow that put together the drug price competition and patent term restoration act , the hatchwaxman bill here s a fellow that put together the child care development block grant , the hatchdodd bill here s a fellow that put together the capital gains rate reduction , the hatchlieberman bill here s a fellow that put together the dietary supplement health and education act with tom harkin here s a fellow that put together countless legislative enactments with none other than the bugaboo of all conservatives , ted kennedy the other senator from utah , robert f bennett , who is also a republican , said legislative experience did not always prepare politicians well for presidential campaigns a campaign is an executiveoriented exercise , mr bennett explained if you 've spent years working out deals behind the scenes , it is not the same as making an executive decision at high noon that may explain why so many senators have failed to win their party s nomination for president technically , even mr dole was not a senator when he was nominated with the nomination sewed up , he resigned from the senate in june 1996 , a month before the republican nominating convention but it should not be surprising , mr bennett said , that so many senators try to become president in the senate , he said , you have access to people who have great power and the closer you get to people who have great power , the easier it is to convince yourself that you 're as smart as he is , and you say to yourself , 'i can see these issues as clearly as he can , maybe clearer , and if he can do the job , certainly i can' as for mr hatch , he is hedging his bet in addition to his presidential campaign , he is running , as utah law permits , for reelection to a fifth term in the senate photo senator orrin g hatch of utah concedes that his candidacy for the republican nomination is a long shot , but says his plan is to pick up the pieces if gov george w bush of texas falters in his bid for the presidency \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
it has been a long time since there was a face to go with the taxi drivers when they had a gripe , and now , more and more , the face belongs to a 27yearold woman named bhairavi desai , an organizer for the new york taxi workers' alliance she has never driven a cab , but unlike most of the people she represents , she has had the benefits of a college education in this country so what s a rutgers graduate doing with the cabdrivers \? you will forgive her if she has a tendency to speak in a kind of marxistlabor jargon \( she also giggles if you call her ms desai it seems so serious , she says \) it s just on labor that this is the way she is i had been politicized most of my life , by my experience as a poor person and immigrant , ms desai says i wanted to work around issues of class and labor , and what is a better community than taxi drivers \? there are about 40 , 000 yellowcab drivers in new york city , and they have no union nor have they had a unified voice but lately this has been changing , and much of the credit is given to bhairavi desai \( pronounced bayrahvee dahsigh \) and the 2 , 000member alliance ms desai , in communal spirit , calls herself merely an organizer , but she has been organizing well it was the alliance , with another group , the united yellow cab company , that helped mount the cabbies' 24hour work stoppage last year after the mayor introduced stiff penalties against drivers more recently , the group has been responding to the complaint of the actor danny glover that five cabbies passed him by because he is black ms desai , adding her quiet voice to a forum on the matter at pace university last weekend , said that many cabbies turned down fares to the boroughs outside manhattan because they thought they could earn more money in manhattan she also added , none of this justifies people being denied services does she deny that there is racism among cab drivers \? the taxi industry does not exist in a vacuum , ms desai says at the alliance office on west 27th street it s reflective of a larger society itself if , by the way , you are one of those people who fret about labor leaders' having fat paychecks , you will be cheered by ms desai the labor leader s winter coat is a double handmedown a cousin gave it to ms desai s mother , who works in a factory ms desai s salary is 1 , 500 a month she lives in jersey city , where her rent is 550 as for her background , ms desai was born in gujarat , india , near bombay , and concerns about social justice were a family matter her grandmother told ms desai and her two older brothers stories of being arrested in the fight for independence for india ms desai s father was a lawyer , who also fought for the rights of the underprivileged when ms desai was 6 the family moved to the united states , settling in harrison , nj it was reaganomics , ms desai says dryly , putting her childhood in an ecopolitical frame it was the end of affirmative action , but it was n't the end of racism my father ended up buying a small grocery store my mother got factory work to me it really is a powerful image , my mother very new to america , kind of hitting the streets with my brother , going from factory to factory filling out applications there s a lie about immigrants in america you do n't get handed jobs you work very hard to find jobs a grocery store is almost the same as a taxi you work 70 to 80 hours a week we were fortunate , because the store was almost like in the back of our apartment and there was a little bell set up , so if my father needed help he could ring a bell and my brothers and i would come out and help that s almost pavlovian , ms desai is told as if she had been programmed to help people it s also the nature of immigrant life in america , ms desai says labor becomes a family activity i think it s much more revealing of economic need than of individual personality marx might agree , but freud would not that s probably why i'm much more drawn to marx than to freud , ms desai says ms desai realized just how poor her family was when she applied for college aid they were living below the poverty level she graduated from rutgers university in 1994 with a degree in women s studies , then worked with battered women at 23 , ms desai became involved with the committee against antiasian violence , which was organizing a group in new york called the lease drivers coalition she caught drivers during their shift changes or breaks , at garages and at restaurant hangouts she asked about their concerns , followed up with phone calls in august 1997 , the group organized a demonstration of 2 , 000 yellow cabs at 14th street and avenue d a move , ms desai said , that brought them to a bargaining position with the taxi and limousine commission in february 1998 , ms desai and several other organizers , seeking more independence , created the new york taxi workers' alliance why , again , is this woman whose parents sacrificed for her to have a better life , working like , well , a taxi driver \? i believe it s not just my parents that put me into college , she says it s the sacrifice of the working men and women in the country , of the immigrants in this country i think i owe them something in return photo bhairavi desai , 27 , says life as a poor person and immigrant politicized her \( ruby washington the new york times \)
god made only water , wrote victor hugo , but man made wine we thought about this on a recent meander through the vineyards of northwest connecticut and adjoining new york state there are four wineries in this section of the state , and three more across the state line in new york , just enough to make a pleasant weekend outing it seemed reasonable that we could easily visit all seven , stop for meals at some of the better restaurants in the area and stay overnight in one of the country inns along the way such an excursion is especially appealing in the fall during foliageviewing season , as the vistas of the berkshires and the rolling hills of the hudson river valley are spectacular when calling wineries to check their hours we learned that weekends are crowded , verging on chaotic it s a zoo here on saturdays , so many people said the woman at the mclaughlin vineyards she suggested that we drop by on a weekday so we decided to begin our vineyard tour on a quiet thursday , returning home on friday evening our tour started from danbury , heading east about 10 miles to sandy hook and the mclaughlin vineyards , our first stop after driving by the vineyard , we climbed several steps to the winery s hydrangeabordered terrace , with its cafe tables for picnicking , and entered a small attractive shop the vineyard s wines were displayed , along with its maple syrup and various new england products jams , salad dressings and gift items a second room held a show of paintings and photography by local artists morgen mclaughlin smith , the vineyard owner s granddaughter and wine maker , poured for us as we sampled five of the wines seyval cabernet franc and millot roses , foch red and seyval blanc white we followed the standard tasting routine , pouring out the residue from one sample and rinsing the glass for the next wine , while clearing our palates with bread or crackers a sampling of three wines is about par , ms smith told us , as wineries do not like to encourage a lot of drinking by people who are driving of the five wines we sampled , the mouthfilling foch red table wine with its long finish , much like a gamay beaujolais was the best we bought a bottle of it , at 13 , though there was no pressure on us to buy \( this was the case at all our stops \) ms smith explained that by midoctober a guesthouse on the grounds would be finished as a bed and breakfast for visitors as we left , she gave us directions to our next stop , digrazia vineyards , about a dozen miles away in brookfield center \( we found it helpful , especially in new york state , to ask each winery for the best way to get to the next vineyard on our list this led us along more scenic , rural roads than the straight map routing \) this winery s austrianstyle , knotty pinepaneled showroom is reached from a pretty entrance by a wheelbarrow full of autumn flowers and a rabbitshaped sign pointing to the door dr paul digrazia was behind the counter and seemed genuinely delighted to have guests sample the wines as we sipped , he described how interest in wine led to buying a farm in 1978 , planting grapes and selling them to wineries , then in 1984 starting his own winery the vineyards are miles away from his tasting and processing buildings he led us to the room where the wine is aging in oak barrels and bottles are filled and labeled dr digrazia and his wife once did everything themselves but one time we labeled 30 , 000 bottles by hand and she threatened 'either you get a labeling machine or another woman' we produce 10 , 000 gallons a season , he told us here , try my new blueberry port , it s made from connecticut berries we preferred his 98 wind ridge seyval blanc , semidry , with a flowery bouquet , and 98 fieldstone reserve , a mediumbody foch merlot blend , both at 1199 , and bought a bottle of each in addition , digrazia makes dessert , specialty fruit wines and port wines we stopped in new milford for soup and sandwiches at the bistro cafe \( if we had budgeted an extra night , this would have been the time for a detour to woodbury for a browse at some of the village s numerous antiques shops \) instead we continued along route 202 to haight vineyard in litchfield the setting evokes wine growing most vividly of any of the wineries we visited that day to the left of a huge , fauxtimbered twostory building are broad fields of russettinged grape vines , strung in rows in classic fashion just outside the building is a huge wooden wine tun , a barrel intended for 250 gallons or more of wine indoors , we could smell the rich aroma of grapes being crushed and of wine aging the large , rather dimly lighted showroom is up a series of steep stairs a woman greeted us with which wines do you want to taste , sweetie \? she kept encouraging us , try this one , honey you 've got to taste our merlot , it s won many awards indeed , the nonvintage merlot was complex , with good body and balance , so we had to have a bottle a good value at 1198 haight also produces a chardonnay , two seyval blanc whites , a rose and a wellnamed picnic red
jakarta , indonesia , nov 16 rudy ramli has become the most celebrated banker in indonesian history , though for reasons he could scarcely have imagined the 41yearold former president of bank bali is at the heart of a financial scandal that has shaken jakarta even contributing to the downfall of a president , b j habibie , who withdrew from last month s election in parliament rather than face the likelihood of defeat last summer , mr ramli admitted paying 80 million to a company with ties to mr habibie s golkar party the money was a commission to help him recover loans owed to bank bali by other banks this week , he goes on trial here for violating banking laws by concealing that payment from indonesia s central bank on the eve of his trial , mr ramli granted his first interview since the scandal overwhelmed him sitting in a drab , barely furnished rental apartment in central jakarta with eight bodyguards listening in the adjoining apartment mr ramli said he now regretted making the payment but he insisted that he had no choice if he was to save the familyowned bank he had taken over from his father in 1992 i was trapped i needed to get the money , mr ramli said the bank would have been in so much trouble without the money as it happens , bank bali landed in far worse trouble after mr ramli s illfated deal the bank was taken over by the indonesian bank restructuring agency , which ousted him and turned over management to standard chartered plc of london and mr ramli became the central point of a vast investigation that later involved two cabinet ministers , the central bank governor and a top adviser to mr habibie none of those officials has been charged with wrongdoing , which nourishes mr ramli s belief that he is the scapegoat in a scandal that reaches far beyond him the police started an investigation the bank authority started an investigation , he said , but the police only identified me and three other bank bali directors as targets after trying to charge us with corruption and embezzlement , they 're now only charging us with concealing a transaction mr ramli said he did not report the deal in the accounts because he later asked the bank restructuring agency to cancel it and he insists that he informed standard chartered about the arrangement from the beginning standard chartered agreed in april to buy 20 percent of bank bali , subject to an examination of the bank s accounts it was during this inquiry that it said it discovered the 80 million shortage whatever the validity of mr ramli s contentions , he has kept the loyalty of his former employees in what has turned a scandal into a spectacle , bank bali staff members demonstrate almost daily in jakarta s business district to support their old boss and vilify their new ones on monday , more than 1 , 000 employees marched to the british embassy , carrying signs that read , we want rudy and scb is a robber the employees have not stopped with rallies last week , they barred the expatriate managers appointed by standard chartered from entering the headquarters , after the managers dismissed a bank bali employee and suspended 47 others for refusing to cooperate with the new team of course , i am not behind the things they are doing , mr ramli said , responding to accusations that he was stirring up trouble for standard chartered the campaign by bank bali employees has had some effect on wednesday , the bank restructuring agency said it would remove the managers appointed by standard chartered because they could no longer function a spokesman said the agency would also review its contract with the bank analysts warned that if standard chartered s overture to bank bali failed , it could scare away other foreign banks that are considering investing in indonesia the government is eager to attract foreigners to help defray the cost of overhauling the debtridden banking system for mr ramli , these broader concerns count for little next to the anguish he said he had endured the publicity from the scandal was so intense that mr ramli abandoned his house and moved from hotel to hotel for months because he feared for his safety he is pale and gaunt from a mild stroke earlier this year , spent 38 days in a jakarta prison in september after his police interrogation , and faces up to 15 years' imprisonment if convicted nonetheless , mr ramli said he was guardedly optimistic with mr habibie s departure and the emergence of abdurrahman wahid as the country s first democratically elected president , mr ramli said he thought that the bank scandal would be relegated to the past , along with indonesia s culture of corruption i think the world has changed , he said i hope it has we never had a new president like this before photo rudy ramli , left , former president of bank bali , in a jakarta courtroom yesterday with his codefendants firman soetjahyo , hendri kurniawan and rusli suryadi mr ramli contends he is being made a scapegoat \( agence francepresse \)
filmmakers have given us a lot of richard nixons over the years , but they 've all really been variations on the same buttonedup , tightly knotted politician who occupied such a prominent place in our country s history and psyche peter riegert played him as an ambitious young congressman in concealed enemies rip torn as a ruthless stonewaller in blind ambition philip baker hall as a paranoid in secret honor lane smith as verging on instability in the final days anthony hopkins as a man caught up in forces outside his control in nixon as fine as these performances were , none of the actors or writers or directors associated with them appear to have had the wit \( or vision \) to present richard nixon as a great romantic hero , riding astride a white stallion along the beach at sunset toward a waiting maiden but thankfully , that sublime image is one of the many wonderful moments in dick , a perfect little popsicle of a movie in a hot summer that dares to wonder whether richard nixon s presidency might not have been undone by a pair of bubbleheaded teenage dogwalkers the nixon on horseback is but a brief moment in the film , and part of a fantasy at that but the rest of the nixon characterization is distinctive as well , and if the president who so frequently reinvented himself were in a position to see this film , he might be pleased to see his new image nixon in this movie has a lot in common with the mary richards character in the mary tyler moore show , which of course constitutes one of the classic comedy texts obviously , nixon is n't nice and bright and sweet the way mary was , but like her he is the sane , levelheaded axis around which all of these other amusingly neurotic people orbit yes , nixon still has moments here where he s a bully and a tyrant , but basically he s just a busy guy with a lot of important stuff to do a country to run , a war to prosecute , a soviet leader to cajole , a scandal to manage and unfortunately he has to rely for help on people who 've got their own quirks a publicityhungry henry kissinger , a wobbly john dean , a maniacal gordon liddy , an alltoofervid bob haldeman \( it s interesting , by the way , what figures

effervescence they generate without end it is particularly pleasurable to see dan hedaya as nixon in his scenes with the girls this is a nixon we 've never seen , a nixon who is kind and patient and considerate , if for his own selfish reasons leave it to me , he says to haldeman when they begin to think that the girls need to be watched i can relate to young people this is an especially hysterical line for anyone who can remember the 1970 antiwar rally when nixon ventured out to talk to some of the young protesters and ended up awkwardly chatting about surfing but at least he aims to relate to betsy and arlene the way he relates to his own daughters at this age , it was all makeup and frankie avalon , he says with a touch of fatherly weariness and befuddlement with that line , this spoofiest of movies manages to humanize this hardest to know of men perhaps because they 've been so thoroughly chewed over for a quarter century , nixon and his crowd do n't come off especially badly they 're the same stock characters we 've seen for years the targets who do suffer are bob woodward and carl bernstein , the heroes of the scandal , the ike and patton of the baby boomers' good

hoffman s starlight all these years , you have to put up with mr ferrell and mr mcculloch s gum on your shoes but as funny as his performance is , mr hedaya may not have delivered the best nixon in a

brussels , april 13 the nato commander today delivered the first comprehensive assessment of the campaign against yugoslavia , saying that the allies had damaged every broad sector of the serbian military he said , however , that president slobodan milosevic appeared determined to ride out the air war and showed no sign of withdrawing from kosovo in an hourlong presentation , the commander , gen wesley k clark , marshaled an array of statistics and a blizzard of maps , photographs and videotapes to make his case that the alliance had the firepower to grind down yugoslavia s military forces and was methodically proceeding toward that goal excerpts , page a14 underscoring that the serbian military has endured only a small dose of nato s striking power , general clark said he would seek still more allied warplanes , pushing the armada to more than 1 , 000 aircraft the reinforcements would include 300 additional american planes , he said senior officials have said the pentagon plans to approve that request after almost 1 , 700 bombing runs , general clark said , nato had damaged broad military categories like air defense , command centers , fuel production and supplies for tanks and other hardware , field units and transportation none were considered destroyed , he said , although nato does say it has destroyed many individual targets in the broader areas still , general clark stopped short of declaring that the alliance would win a victory from the air he said only that the yugoslav military was potentially vulnerable to collapse if enough military pressure was applied , and he generally tried to sidestep any political questions asked at one point whether nato s political leaders had been too slow to act against mr milosevic this year , general clark said , you 're asking judgments about political leadership , which it s not appropriate for me to give after three weeks of air attacks intended to cause so much military pain that mr milosevic would withdraw his troops and agree to allied conditions for a settlement , general clark acknowledged , mr milosevic does not appear to be cowed as we have said from the outset , the commander said , this is likely to be as long and difficult as president milosevic makes it and we 're approaching it very systematically , methodically and increasingly intense he spoke at nato headquarters here as secretary of state madeleine k albright and foreign minister igor s ivanov of russia met in oslo but failed to resolve their differences over nato insistence that an allied military force police a kosovo peace in washington , president clinton and congressional leaders from both parties tried to avert any attempt by congress to vote on the eventual use of ground forces in kosovo as the supreme commander of the 19member alliance , general clark , who has had about as much personal contact with mr milosevic and his top generals as any nato diplomat , confronts a complex political , as well as military , equation his aim is to send the serbs a message that nato has the firepower to break their will while trying to reassure western political leaders and voters that the alliance would use only the minimum force that was needed the task has not been easy since the attacks began three weeks ago , nato says , the bombings have been hobbled by bad weather , a limited number of aircraft and political constraints critics have complained that the alliance was withholding crucial details in an effort to mask a disappointing performance today , however , general clark gave a smooth performance his methodical , technocratic style contrasted with the blustery manner of some of his predecessors , like gen h norman schwarzkopf in the persian gulf war in 1991 , a plus for an alliance that is still skittish about the notion of ground forces and eager for a negotiated solution seeking to solidify western support , general clark began by documenting the steady serbian military buildup in kosovo his presentation was intended to show that mr milosevic had repeatedly violated his promises to withdraw from kosovo but it also inadvertently raised questions about the adequacy of the alliance s military planning , which initially relied on limited air attacks to punish the serbian forces for their assaults on the ethnic albanian population in kosovo nato , general clark said , had damaged a broad range of targets , but destroyed none he said the alliance was in a race , trying to damage supplies and equipment faster than yugoslavia could replace or repair them at one point , in a remarkable personal aside , general clark recalled in some detail a meeting in october that he had in belgrade with a leading serbian general the general insisted that the yugoslav military could have finished off the kosovo liberation army in two more weeks if it had been allowed to continue sweeping villages and towns and i said to him , general clark recounted , 'yes , and you created about 400 , 000 homeless people in this process in a campaign that s totally disproportionate to any reasonable definition of a threat it s a political problem , and you 've tried to solve it by force' he said he and the other general had a long dialectical discussion , adding that s when i realized that there was still this very strong proclivity to believe that this problem was a problem which was appropriate to be solved by military force , and the target would be the population , since they could n't get at the kla directly on another politically sensitive issue , general clark said there was little that the nato military could do to ease the plight of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who , nato says , have been driven from their houses by serb forces and left homeless in kosovo with little food on monday , nato ambassadors asked general clark to look into ways to provide food and medicine to the civilians there but today , the commander said that it would take 60 to 100 flights of slowmoving transport planes each day to drop relief supplies and that the serbs' air defense might down the planes our view on this is that , frankly , this is a problem that s caused by president milosevic , general clark said he needs to address this problem a fourstar army general , general clark is not an obvious spokesman for air power he did speak out , however , in a measured and qualified way giving new information , he said nato had flown 5 , 924 missions , including 1 , 687 bombing runs because of the distances involved , a larger percentage of the missions consists of refueling flights than in previous air campaigns and because belgrade demonstrated its potential to lash out by sending two mig s over bosnia last month , the alliance also maintains constant air patrols around yugoslavia general clark insisted , however , that the bombing was effective , because a vast majority of the strikes were with laserguided bombs and other precisionguided munitions for much of the campaign , general clark said , poor weather has handicapped the bombing over three weeks , he said , nato had enjoyed good weather on seven days on 10 days , he said , more than half the bombing missions were canceled because of bad weather photos in brussels , gen wesley k clark vowed more bombing but stopped short of predicting a victory from the air \( associated

washington , oct 14 the senate proved wednesday night with its rejection of the nuclear test ban treaty that it can stop one of president clinton s policy initiatives in its tracks but mr clinton proved this afternoon that he still knows how to wield his office as a powerful political weapon the republicanled congress has used its power in recent days not only to kill the treaty , but to turn down one of mr clinton s judicial nominations , block his efforts to provide lowcost prescription drugs under medicare , and sidetrack his proposals on education , child care and tobacco but mr clinton , as he has so often before , has employed a form of political jujitsu to turn these republican victories into political campaign themes by portraying them as reckless defiance of the national interest or public will and he showed last week that he can still manage an occasional legislative victory , with the vote in the house on a patients' rights bill that met many of his longheld goals , while also showing the weakness of house republican leaders the republicans' rejection of the comprehensive test ban treaty will come back to haunt them , mr clinton argued in his news conference this afternoon what he called their isolationism , partisanship and indifference to public opinion will be powerful arguments against them in the coming political year , he said by this vote , the senate majority has turned its back on 50 years of american leadership against the spread of weapons of mass destruction , mr clinton said in a rehearsal of a campaign speech that is likely to be delivered on behalf of democratic candidates over the next year they are betting our children s future on the reckless proposition that we can go it alone as the president nears his final year in the white house , he is no longer running for office , only for a place in history and while he continues to prove adept at embarrassing his enemies , he may end up with little to show for the last 15 months of his presidency the ironic thing is that bill clinton could have a successful year , said frank luntz , a republican pollster who is no fan of the president but he s so intent on destroying congress s reputation that he 'll end up destroying his own he could get tax relief , budget reform , social security reform , but he 'll end up with none of it , by his own choice , because he just wants to play politics mr luntz was expressing a view commonly held by republicans that everything mr clinton does is for partisan political advantage mr clinton is suspected of sending phony budgets to capitol hill , knowing they will be rejected so that he can accuse the republicans of insensitivity to the poor , the old and the infirm there were whispers this week that the administration mounted only a tardy and halfhearted defense of the test ban treaty because mr clinton wanted an issue for democrats to use in the 2000 campaign white house officials denied that , and mr clinton acknowledged today that he was unprepared for the rapid treaty debate and vote it is a measure of the ill will between mr clinton and the republicans that they suspect him of engineering humiliating defeats for political advantage but he certainly has learned how to use the powers he retains the veto , the bully pulpit and the unilateral foreign policy action against a senate that can vote down treaties and torpedo judicial and ambassadorial nominations the president and the democratic party still are effective players on many issues , including the ongoing budget negotiations , patients' bill of rights and gun control , said john isaacs of council for a livable world and there is , moreover , no reason why bill clinton ca n't be successful on a number of foreign policy issues as he tries to help secure a middle east peace settlement , work more for a final settlement in ireland or improved relations with china but any international agreement requiring a twothirds majority in the us senate over the next 15 months i think you can forget in his news conference today , mr clinton explicitly threatened to veto any spending bills that in his view shortchange education or health care he knows he holds the polltested high ground with the public on these issues , and he intends to try to cement a public view of congressional republicans as tightfisted and uncaring mr clinton was clearly trying to link in the public mind the republicans' action on the treaty and their hard line on taxes and spending this just reinforces the hardened , partisan , ideological image that exists of this congress , said rahm i emanuel , a former senior adviser to the president these people are hellbent on their own political destruction the only thing that unites them is their antipathy to bill clinton that anger , which boiled over this week , augurs poorly for meaningful compromise on budgets , social programs , trade and foreign policy , said stephen hess , an expert on the presidency at the brookings institution in washington mr hess , who worked in the eisenhower , nixon and carter administrations , said that the presidency is like an hourglass , with the sand pouring inexorably through typically the eighth year of any presidency is not very productive , mr hess said theoretically , there is hope of some accomplishment over the next 14 months , but in the 40 years i 've watched politics , i have never seen the depth of the animosity the congress has for this president , and vice versa unlike presidents eisenhower and reagan , the two oldest men to serve in the presidency , mr clinton is young and energetic and wants to make a mark as the clock ticks down especially because he lost a year to scandal and much of the first half of this year to the conflict in kosovo , he is impatient in trying to achieve at least a measure of his stillambitious domestic agenda there are legitimate differences of opinion , but we can put an end to reckless partisanship , to gimmicks and gamesmanship , mr clinton said hopefully this afternoon we can put people first and make a principled , honorable compromise we can work for a season of progress , not a winter of politics and i am committed to do just that photo during his news conference yesterday , president clinton called on the republicans in congress to put an end to reckless partisanship \( shana raab

washington , oct 10 it was a rare moment of introspection for vice president al gore he had spent the week in campaign mode , moving at warp speed from washington to new hampshire to upstate new york to new york city \( twice \) to louisville to nashville , the kmart in his celebrated pledge to move his campaign from k street to kmart , away from the unspeakable beltway he had lighted some fires and put a few out , oratorically speaking , but to an outsider , he still seemed uncomfortable with the business of selling himself i'm the kind of person who s not a natural backslapper , mr gore conceded in an interview last week in the back seat of his limousine as it headed for la guardia airport i do n't go into the process of campaigning for its own sake not for the sheer joy of it but i do enjoy campaigning for what it can achieve for the issues i can bring to light the subject came up , of course , because mr gore is being pressed unexpectedly hard by his rival for the democratic presidential nomination , former senator bill bradley mr bradley is no hail fellow well met , either the two of them are right up there with calvin coolidge and walter f mondale in the deadpan derby but mr bradley is a former basketball star who has never lost the aura of madison square garden that sets him apart mr gore learned a certain rural southern reticence from his father , who preceded him as a senator from tennessee it has been reinforced by a realization over the last seven years that every time he opens his mouth in public , he speaks not only for himself but also for a president , a party and an administration now , he says , he is trying to let it all hang out the very phrase sounds unnatural coming from a man whose shoes are always polished , whose hair is always combed , whose shirts and suits are always crisply pressed all \? he does n't even let his shirttail hang out but the vice president said he had started to connect with the american people he had trouble defining exactly what he meant it s a feeling that i 've tuned in , cut through the static the way you did on old car radios to find a clear station and lock it in it s a feeling that people are responding to me and that i'm learning how to carry their message in washington , important democrats continue to badmouth mr gore a former party chairman said the other day that his body language puts me off completely elsewhere , the story is different some of the insiders who are listening to the vice president rather like what they are hearing it has n't quite clicked yet , said paul adler , the chairman of the democratic party in rockland county , ny , after meeting with mr gore last week , but i think that he s finally on the way the notion that there is a new al gore , more relaxed , funnier , less scripted , has taken root in his somewhat shellshocked organization several of his aides said the turning point came on aug 12 at a bingo hall in mason city , iowa , the town used by meredith willson as a model for river city in the music man mr gore arrived late , about 9 pm , the aides said , and found a boisterous crowd , full of beer and brats he jumped on a chair and brought the house down , one of the aides said if there was one moment when he broke through , that was it they also point to a meeting , right after labor day , at the general aviation terminal at logan airport in boston preparing for a speech on health care , mr gore listened to his pollsters and strategists , some of whom are not around anymore , and to policy specialists from the white house ultimately , he rejected both the sweeping proposals of the former and the incrementalism of the latter , and said , let s just help kids mr gore is less specific about when he decided to change gears , but he said he was learning how to be less studied and more authentic , to use the word he prefers presumably that means finding ways to let his evident charm and affability in private show through in public it s casting away that selfvetting , that splitsecond s hesitation that keeps you from saying what s on your heart and mind , he said should i say that \? is it safe \? how will it sound \? i need to stop that the problem is related , of course , to mr gore s relationship with president clinton , and the transition from vice president to presidential aspirant for other democratic no 2 s who have sought to step up in recent years , the imperative has been distancing themselves from the major policy failures of their bosses , without seeming to be disloyal in 1968 , hubert h humphrey struggled to develop a less hardline position on the vietnam war than lyndon b johnson s week after week , he looked and sounded like a man with his fingers stuck in taffy antiwar demonstrators chanted dump the hump ! not until the end of september , in a speech in salt lake city , did he call for a bombing halt by then it was too late in 1983 and 1984 , mr mondale staggered under the burden of jimmy carter s unpopularity and the bitter legacy of the iran hostage crisis about the best formula he ever managed was this i was proud to serve as mr carter s vice president we had some problems , we had some bad breaks that s the way it is now i'm running for president
washington , jan 27 for weeks , the feverish guessing game had focused on whether a swing group of as many as a halfdozen republican senators might buck their colleagues and side with democrats in trying to end or truncate the impeachment trial against president clinton but when it came time for those pivotal votes today , only one politician broke party ranks , and that maverick turned out to be a democrat , senator russell d feingold of wisconsin like all his republican colleagues but none of his fellow democrats , mr feingold , one of the senate s most earnest and independent thinkers , opposed a motion to dismiss the charges against mr clinton and supported a motion to take depositions from three witnesses votes to the contrary , mr feingold said , would have been an assertion that there was no possible way for the house trial managers to convince him and other senators that mr clinton should be removed from office , and he had not reached that point of certainty yet i simply cannot say that the house managers cannot prevail , mr feingold said in a painstakingly worded , threepage written statement released by his staff just moments after he had cast his votes but mr feingold was careful to add that his votes should not be interpreted as signals that he was in favor of convicting mr clinton i have not reached a decision on that question , he said it is my inclination , however , to demand a very high standard of proof on this question it is my view at this point that the house managers' case has some serious problems , and i am not certain it can be helped by further testimony from witnesses , although i believe it is possible that it can in retrospect , mr feingold s vote was largely predictable , because he had articulated a stern disapproval of mr clinton s actions and hinted at a belief that the second article of impeachment , which charges the president with obstruction of justice , deserved careful consideration moreover , mr feingold s political career has been marked by principled stands that flouted conventional wisdom or party unity for example , during his campaign for reelection to a second term in the senate last year , mr feingold , a fierce advocate for campaign finance reform , refused to accept soft money donations even as his republican opponent outspent him and drew ever closer in the polls several colleagues said they respected his independence russ is an original thinker who really grapples with the issues , said senator charles e schumer , democrat of new york , and i know he was grappling with this one right up until the end and , as senator richard j durbin , democrat of illinois , left the capitol after the vote , he was overheard telling a companion , you 've got to give russ feingold credit mr feingold , 45 , has often chosen what he clearly considers the intellectual high ground over the pragmatic path of least resistance a former rhodes scholar and harvardeducated lawyer , he was one of a handful of senators in 1996 who voted against a popular antiterrorism bill he cited its inclusion of the death penalty , which he strongly opposes , as his reason but he is perhaps best known as the cosponsor , with senator john mccain , republican of arizona , of campaign finance overhaul legislation that would , in part , eliminate soft money this unlimited and largely unregulated campaign money is restricted to general party activities but is often used on behalf of candidates that legislation failed to pass the senate last year mr feingold was one of the first and only democrats to call for an independent counsel to investigate mr clinton s fundraising activities , and has been equally critical of the president s behavior concerning the monica lewinsky affair at one point early last year , mr feingold said that if there was any proof that mr clinton lied under oath , i will have no trouble voting on his impeachment photo senator russell d feingold , democrat of wisconsin \( associated press \)
for taxpayers , the pesky software flaw known as the year 2000 problem could cause lots of trouble not in the year 2000 , but this spring , when the internal revenue service processes 1998 income tax returns the problem will be felt a year early at the irs because the service must , early this year , reprogram all its computers to be ready for next year some of these still use technology developed when dwight d eisenhower was in the white house the irs must also process 124 million individual tax returns and millions of corporate and other returns so that it will be ready for the year 2000 at the same time , irs executives are trying to reorganize a bureaucracy with 110 , 000 employees and change its culture from one of deep suspicion of taxpayers to one dedicated to helping them comply with increasingly complex tax laws if things go badly , americans can expect all sorts of foulups , like lost tax returns or an occasional anticipated refund check emerging from irs computers as a demand for millions in additional taxes if there is a bad filing season , it will be the upcoming one , because this is the period when the service has to test whether they are going to be y2kcompliant , said michael murphy , a former senior irs official who is executive director of the tax executives institute , a washington organization for corporate tax officials if they ca n't demonstrate it in this filing season , they are going to have difficulties in the next one charles o rossotti , the commissioner of internal revenue , said , our task is like changing the engines in the plane while you are still flying in the real world , such a situation would virtually assure a disastrous crash but mr rossotti said that while he anticipated there would be some unusual and unexpected problems for taxpayers , there should not be many , and only a few people should be affected it should n't be too bad , he said , but people need to understand that 1999 really is going to be the risky year for us , not the year 2000 among government agencies that could experience disasters because of year 2000 problems , none faces a bigger challenge than the irs , which still uses huge reels of magnetic tape , rather than modern disk systems , to store and process data mr rossotti likens the main irs data center in martinsburg , w va , to a living museum of early computer technology today , the martinsburg center s relics of dataprocessing past operate in a tenuous electronic marriage with highly complex data bases that are supposed to link each section of the tax code , each regulation , and each schedule of taxes , penalties and interest to the appropriate lines on thousands of different tax forms those completed by taxpayers and those used by the irs to generate notices a big concern is that with the complications introduced by reprogramming , this marriage might become a communications problem that would thrust taxpayers into a nightmare of bizarre notices and demands or into a void where their information would vanish groups like the national association of enrolled agents have alerted their members to be on the watch for bogus notices and to send them on to its national headquarters in washington joseph lane , an enrolled agent in bellevue , wash , who serves on a national advisory panel for the irs , said , tax practitioners are all geared to watch for indications of programming glitches , such as oddball notices saying 'you owe 35 million , ' and we have an early warning identification system mr lane said he expected few problems , however so far as i know , they have done enough systemsacceptability testing to process the torrent of tax returns each spring , the irs operates 10 paperpushing factories around the country , commonly known as the pipeline in these sprawling complexes , clerks open letters , sort the returns , assign numbers to track the documents , enter most of the data from the returns into computers and then review the results for accuracy before deciding which returns need immediate attention and which can be boxed for storage the pipeline is from an era when department stores had wooden floors and charge slips were rolled up and put in metal canisters that were moved by wireandpulley systems to clerks on other floors in 1985 , part of the pipeline , the irs philadelphia service center , suffered a breakdown , brought on in part by inadequate computer systems some employees ended up shredding some tax returns and putting others in the trash so that they could appear to be meeting work quotas representative steve r horn , republican of california , has been holding hearings on the administration s progress in dealing with year 2000 issues he gave the treasury department , of which the irs is part , a grade of c in november , up from dplus 90 days earlier the irs was not among 25 individual departments and agencies given report cards , but mr horn singled out the service for praise in its efforts to deal with the problem , saying that mr rossotti , a former computer systems executive , was an outstanding commissioner who understands this problem better than others in the administration and was moving the service to the cutting edge of technology mr rossotti also said that the complex changes congress had made to the tax code were creating new difficulties for the service s aging computers he cited new protections for innocent spouses as a prime example innocentspouse relief requires separating the tax liability of spouses , he said , but our computers are not equipped to deal with proportionate liability
in the month since announcing her interest in a united states senate seat from new york , hillary rodham clinton has discussed her potential candidacy with more than 50 influential democrats in the state , most often in lengthy telephone calls she placed from the private quarters of the white house mrs clinton , over the last few weeks , talked about her possible political future with labor leaders , elected officials and democratic party chairmen from suburban and upstate counties crucial to winning a race she also recently entertained powerful new york democrats and public figures at the white house , including dennis rivera , the labor leader several of those who spoke with mrs clinton said she did not hint at her ultimate decision , but was systematically studying the politics and issues of a state where she has never lived a number of them said she told them that she planned to do polling and was looking for ways to raise money even before she made a decision on the race many of the county officials , who seem stunned and pleased by the first lady s attention , described their conversations about local issues with mrs clinton as lengthy and very detailed she s obviously been doing her homework , said steve pigeon , the democratic chairman of erie county , the state s largest democratic stronghold outside of new york city mr pigeon said he spoke by phone to mrs clinton for an hour on monday night i have to explain to a lot of candidates who come to me that you ca n't view upstate monolithically , he said she already knew the vast differences mr pigeon said mrs clinton told him she did not want her delay in making a decision to undercut the ability of other potential democratic candidates like representative nita m lowey of westchester to raise money largely because of the possible impact on other likely candidates and their ability to raise money if mrs clinton does not run , many democrats have been irked by her announcement that she will not decide until later this year , perhaps as late as the fall the election is in november 2000 in an apparent response to that concern , the first lady and her advisers are exploring fundraising options she said they 're looking for vehicles to raise money to be used for whoever the candidate is , mr pigeon said i think as long as she s raising money that can be used no matter who runs , whether it s her or nita , that can buy some time election law lawyers said yesterday that such a vehicle might be a committee , allowed under federal election law , that would raise money for an unspecified senate candidate in donations of up to 1 , 000 in making her calls , mrs clinton works from a list of 200 names provided by harold m ickes , a former white house official and a veteran of new york politics mrs clinton s advisers say she has methodically made her way through the democratic power structure in new york state , reaching out not only to labor leaders and local democratic leaders , but to fundraisers , members of the new york congressional delegation and leaders of black , jewish , hispanic and women s groups she has also had meetings at the white house yesterday with the new york city comptroller , alan g hevesi , and last friday with new york s assembly speaker , sheldon silver mr hevesi said that he and the first lady spoke for more than an hour , half of which he said was spent discussing the case of amadou diallo , the unarmed african immigrant whose shooting death by the new york city police has led to protests against mayor rudolph w giuliani , a potential opponent of mrs clinton mr hevesi said mrs clinton brought up the case herself , but made no comment on mr giuliani s handling of it mr silver said he met for an hour and 45 minutes with the first lady in another indication that mrs clinton may be positioning herself as a candidate , mr silver said that she elaborated on her remarks last year that a palestinian state was very important to middle east peace mr giuliani has called her comments a very big mistake , and political analysts have said her remarks could give him a chance to cut into any support she has among conservative jewish voters mr silver said mrs clinton told him that her remarks were a reflection of her discussions with yitzhak rabin , the late israeli prime minister , and that rabin had told her that 'it was very difficult to negotiate with a nonentity' mrs clinton also said her remarks were not inconsistent with american policy , the speaker added most upstate and suburban democratic party officials said they came away from speaking with her believing that she would be a candidate i thought i was talking to a political pro , said steve paquette , the onondaga county democratic chairman , who spoke to

albany , jan 1 george elmer pataki began his second term as governor today by declaring that his success in scaling back government had rekindled new york s spirit , saying that the strides of the last four years showed that the state was ready to lead the nation into the next century we the people of new york must light the way to a brighter future , mr pataki said in a 14minute inaugural address that often had the feel of a civicminded pep talk mr pataki , 53 , a republican who rose from a childhood on a peekskill farm to become the state s 53d governor , outlined no new proposals in the speech and did not refer to his ambitions beyond albany , which have been the subject of growing speculation since he easily won reelection in november but the tirelessly upbeat oratory suggested he was honing a theme he plans to expound while traveling the country that his brand of republicanism fiscally conservative , with little emphasis on divisive social issues had worked in new york , and would work elsewhere we charted a bold new course for this state , he said , a course driven by our determination to see that government remains the people s servant and not their master as he often does , he referred to his idol , theodore roosevelt , who was inaugurated governor of new york 100 years ago today mr pataki noted that both he and roosevelt stood at the edge of a new century , which is spread out before us like an undiscovered land of promise roosevelt also was the last new york republican to win the presidency mr pataki has declined to say whether he will run for president next year , insisting only that he has not ruled it out and saying that as leader of a large state , he wants to help set his party s agenda in recent weeks , he has uncharacteristically lashed out at the republicans in congress he has asserted that they have damaged the party by neglecting core issues , like cutting taxes , in their zeal to impeach president clinton a presidential bid could prove daunting for mr pataki , because while his support for abortion rights and views on other social issues play well in new york , they put him in conflict with the conservatives who hold sway in republican presidential primaries in other states though he did not detail his agenda for his second term today , he plans to use his state of the state message on wednesday and his budget message later this month to announce new proposals they will include a budget that is to be considerably more austere than his electionyear one , which raised spending at more than the rate of inflation at the ceremony in the convention center here , mr pataki took the oath of office from the state s chief judge , judith s kaye , while a 19gun salute resounded in the piercing cold outside earlier , judge kaye swore in the new lieutenant governor , mary o donohue , a former judge and prosecutor from upstate new york , who was recruited by mr pataki to replace betsy mccaughey ross mr pataki had a long fallingout with ms mccaughey ross after he removed her from the reelection ticket , she became a democrat , lost the party primary and ran against mr pataki in the general election on the liberal party line the state comptroller , h carl mccall , and the new attorney general , eliot l spitzer , also took their oaths of office today besides starting his second term , mr pataki is now the most prominent republican in the state , replacing his mentor , united states senator alfonse m d'amato , who was defeated for reelection in november mr d'amato had anointed mr pataki , then an obscure state senator , as the party s nominee for governor in 1994 the d'amato defeat capped a disappointing election for the republicans dennis c vacco was ousted as attorney general by mr spitzer , a wealthy former assistant district attorney from manhattan , and the party failed to pick up seats in the legislature , despite spending heavily that showing tarnished mr pataki s victory over the democratic nominee , peter f vallone , the city council speaker mr d'amato sat in the front row during the inaugural ceremony , two rows in front of mayor rudolph w giuliani , a republican who spurned mr pataki and endorsed the threeterm democratic incumbent , mario m cuomo , in 1994 , only to return to the fold in last fall s election and campaign for mr pataki mr giuliani also has national aspirations , but publicly , he and mr pataki say they get along privately , there is no affection between their camps mr pataki s relatively short address today had little in common with his first in 1995 , when he cited his upset victory over mr cuomo as evidence that the public was angry with the state s condition he attacked a paid and pampered bureaucracy , pledging a smaller government , new work requirements for welfare recipients and tough criminal justice laws , including the death penalty , which mr cuomo had blocked he returned briefly to these issues today when he noted that he had followed through on his promises the tone of the speech was not the only difference the inauguration this year was short and restrained , with none of the exuberance of 1995 , when the republicans held a weekend of parties to celebrate winning the governor s mansion for the first time in 20 years about 2 , 100 people attended the swearingin today , down from 13 , 000 in 1995 the financing of the 1995 events turned into a major controversy of mr pataki s first term when he refused to disclose which companies had made large donations to pay the cost he later released some information after a court battle with the democrats who control the state assembly mr pataki s campaign , as well as mr mccall s and mr spitzer s , paid for this year s events today , in addition to the swearingin , mr pataki attended an inaugural mass at the cathedral of the immaculate conception , next to the capitol , and held a reception at a hotel , with tickets costing 80 in his speech , mr pataki made no mention of the contrasts with his first inaugural instead , he concentrated on the inspirational , repeatedly returning to the idea that under his stewardship , new york s potential was limitless we will keep our state moving forward , he said , with policies that continue to fuel the passion , unleash the power and tap the vast reserves of strength , creativity and determination of new york s greatest resource the spirit of our people photos lieut gov mary o donohue at the ceremonies in albany with her son , justin , her husband , brian , and her daughter , sara she replaces betsy

my roommate , james , has a ritual when he goes for a walk , he scans the sidewalks for stray chairs , wayward tables and homeless armoires when he returns , i never know what will accompany him through the front door once , he brought in a 6foothigh , mintgreen wardrobe that he found on west 13th street in manhattan , outside st vincent s hospital no one , including me , understood what attracted him to this monstrosity until he stripped it to its natural color , sanded and refinished it people now marvel at how this ugly duckling has become such a swan ask new yorkers especially young people in studio apartments where they find their furnishings , and many will respond , proudly , on the street for them , it s a badge of honor to be known as a garbage shopper in a ridiculously expensive city , someone with both the brains to spot a jewel in the junk and the brawn to lug it down god knows how many blocks and up god knows how many flights of stairs of course , most city dwellers pay hard cash for most of their home furnishings but among the 20somethings , there is a definite cheapchic esthetic the idea is to find items that cost little or nothing but that together create an atmosphere of rustic gentility and , of course , it s ok to throw an expensive item or two into the mix the chairs do n't have to match , but the colors should the overall look should make a a visitor think wow ! they 've created a minor masterpiece on a shoestring generally , the college dorm look halogen lamps , beerbottle art , milk crates as coffee tables does n't fly , nor does the downright tacky the goal is to acquire inexpensive stuff that does n't look its price and does n't act it people used to buy a plywood dresser at a store with low prices and it did the job until you put your clothes in and the bottom fell out , says christine dimmick , 29 , founder of the good home company , a maker of low and moderatelypriced home accessories and bodycare products you always got people who foraged through the trash or went to the salvation army , but nowadays they 're honing in on what their style is and choosing quality over quantity people are more apt to spend money on a few classic pieces , like a knoll or eames chair , and then supplement that from inexpensive stores unlike some manhattanites , who were appalled by the arrival of kmart , ms dimmick says she was thrilled and ca n't wait for walmart to come , too others in the business agreed that there was much to be found in such stores young people ca n't afford the ralph lauren home collection , said jackie glanz , president of mg concepts , a designer of merchandise display areas in central islip , ny but they know you can find good designs at kmart or j c penney pilar newton can speak to that a cartoon animator , ms newton , 25 , furnished most of her brooklyn apartment from thrift shops , sidewalks and kmart she knows her retailers , too bradlee s is terrific , because they have things for every part of the house , from linens to kitchen appliances , she says kmart is good for towels , shower curtains , martha stewart living linens when it comes to foraging , though , anything goes recently , for example , she found a gorgeous red velvetcovered armoire from the 1930 s on a brooklyn street the one imperfection , a cigarette burn , does n't bother her a friend s mother gave her a secondhand dining room table , and little by little she found chairs on the street , none of which match eventually , she plans to reupholster them meanwhile , who cares \? in the past , no one would be caught dead with mismatched chairs , but today \? it does n't matter as long as it does n't look cheap , she said as for ms dimmick , who is also the author of home file , a home decoration guide \( andrews mcmeel , 1998 \) , she spent about 600 on furnishings for her 800squarefoot apartment in chelsea , including a 120 bed frame from a thrift shop while she , too , loves to browse the streets and in flea markets she prefers heading directly to original sources , like hardware stores , or outlets for restaurants or medical supplies \( she recommends going to flea markets during blizzards and rainstorms , when there are fewer shoppers and the vendors are more likely to reduce prices \) ms dimmick is also a fan of stores where every item costs 99 cents sure , they have ugly vases , but they also have lots of cute glass bottles and things , she says you can use ordinary materials in a different way to create a stylish look stylish but cheap it makes a lot of sense when the biggest challenge facing young new yorkers is n't furnishing an apartment it s finding one they can afford drawing \( nancy doniger \)
the genamerica corporation , one of the first mutual life insurers to sell shares to the public under a hybrid structure two years ago , said yesterday that it was becoming a company owned completely by stockholders half a dozen mutual companies have converted to hybrids , which can sell shares worth up to 49 percent of their value while 51 percent of the company remains with the policyholders because the majority ownership of the hybrids , known as mutual holding companies , stays with policyholders , they became immune from hostile takeovers and the minority public stake gave the hybrid some insulation from shareholder demands for performance that pure stock companies faced for those reasons , consumer advocates and executives of stock companies allied as critics of the hybrids predicted that the hybrids would never move toward full stock ownership genamerica , one of the top 40 life insurers , with assets around 20 billion , is the first to take that step one reason for the shift , said richard a liddy , chief executive of genamerica , was to be able to raise unlimited amounts of capital we could have raised enough capital to last us awhile , he said , but sooner or later we would have to find ways to raise more critics of the hybrids pointed out that while the new company could sell stock , none of it would go to the policyholders not only were they denied any tangible benefit from the hybrid structure , the critics argued , but the new structure created a struggle over profit between policyholders and shareholders mr liddy said he also proposed the change , which was endorsed by the company s board yesterday , because he thought it was time to deliver value to the policyholders when a mutual insurer converts to full shareholder ownership , the company s equity is divided among the policyholders and after two years as a hybrid , there is more equity to be shared in genamerica s case , 13 billion , compared with 1 billion when the hybrid was formed early in 1997 that 13 billion will be divided among 300 , 000 policyholders , an average of 4 , 33333 each 762 more than two years earlier , when 280 , 000 policyholders would have shared 1 billion the actual amount received will depend on the size and duration of each policy furthermore , the value of the shares is almost certain to increase when they are offered on the market larry mayewski , a senior analyst at a m best , said the shift was not surprising genamerica has always been a progressive organization , more entrepreneurial and more like a stock company than many mutuals , he said cathy seifert of standard poor s said the change sent a positive signal about genamerica to the markets with the hybrid structure , she said , you have sort of divided loyalties and priorities between shareholders and policyholders , and it gives the sense that the company is not quite focused
time of our lives the science of human aging by tom kirkwood 277 pp new york oxford university press 2750 a means to an end the biological basis of aging and death by william r clark 228 pp new york oxford university press 2750 almost four years ago a political scientist , harvey sapolsky , fretted in the journal technology review over the fate of american science in the postsoviet era the end of the cold war , he argued , had eliminated a major justification for american research and development to keep their funding levels high , scientists needed to find another bogeyman to replace the evil empire sapolsky s candidate \? mortality most taxpayers , he pointed out , want to live longer or even forever moreover , scientists will almost certainly never defeat mortality , so they can remain on the public dole forever sapolsky must be pleased with his prescience over the past few years federal funding has subsided for physics the primary beneficiary of the cold war and soared for biomedical research senescence in particular has become one of science s most glamorous topics virtually every week , it seems , researchers announce the discovery of a new gene or protein or something related to aging given the frenzy of media speculation unleashed by these findings , one would think that we are on the verge of becoming a race of methuselahs can you live forever \? esquire asked on the front of its may issue probably do you want to \? see inside those who want a clearereyed appraisal of aging research can now choose between two solid books on the topic \( issued by the same publisher \) both convey the excitement of the science of senescence , but both also emphasize how far investigators are from discovering the fountain of eternal youth time of our lives , by tom kirkwood , a prominent british gerontologist , is the livelier kirkwood is a charming , chatty guide , who leavens his text with vivid metaphors and fun facts discussing the limits of the human life span , he tells the story of jeanne louise calment , a frenchwoman who was the longestlived person known to science in 1965 , when she was 90 , she made a deal with her lawyer he would pay her a monthly stipend until her death , when he would take ownership of her apartment the deal seemed like a nobrainer for the lawyer , except that calment lived for another 32 years , accumulating payments that vastly exceeded her apartment s value she even outlived the hapless lawyer by two years her record will almost certainly be broken someday , kirkwood says , but by how much \? his pursuit of such questions in the 1970 s led him to propose his now influential disposable soma theory as he explains it , natural selection has placed a premium on preserving our germ cells ovaries and sperm but natural selection takes a more casual view of our somatic cells our bodies which serve merely as vehicles for propelling germ cells into future generations our bodies are designed to live long enough to reproduce and insure the survival of offspring after that , we gradually fall apart the disposable soma theory tells us that aging is unlikely to be caused by only a single mechanism , because it applies equally to all the different maintenance and repair systems of the soma , kirkwood says he views cancer , heart disease , arthritis , dementia and other afflictions of the elderly as byproducts of the inexorable decay of the body s basic cellmaintenance systems he compares the elderly body to an automobile repair shop run by aging mechanics their ability to keep pace with a constant stream of breakdowns and accidents will slowly be impaired now if the accident rate were to increase because the drivers are aging too , the situation would eventually become unworkable kirkwood is no fatalist we can live longer , healthier lives , he says , by adhering to the sensible old standbys eating lots of vegetables , fruit and fish exercising , copulating , drinking a little red wine and avoiding red meat , fatty foods and tobacco \( he neglects to mention that calment smoked until she was 120 \) but kirkwood looks askance at more exotic antiaging elixirs , whether wrinkle creams containing retinoic acid or injections of fetal cells of sheep he calls them wonkavites , after the pills that make grandma georgina younger in the roald dahl story charlie and the great glass elevator none of these wonkavites lives up to its advertising , kirkwood contends , and some may even foreshorten life by causing cancer or other side effects rocket fuel may make an old banger of a car go , he says of human growth hormone , which is reportedly all the rage among the rich and vain , but for how long \? kirkwood challenges the increasingly popular belief that we can significantly stretch our life spans by tinkering with our genes geneticists who tout their advances as heralding 200year human life spans coming soon , or who condone journalists who hint at this , are contemptible , he harrumphs he points out that gene therapies have failed thus far to counter even diseases caused by a single mutant gene it will be vastly more difficult to find gene therapies for agerelated ailments like cancer and heart disease , which spring from many genetic and environmental factors interacting in complex ways
seattle , nov 10 seventeenyearold kip kinkel was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison today , shortly after the oregon teenager read an apology for the shooting rampage he went on last year that left his parents and two fellow high school students dead and nearly two dozen people injured i absolutely loved my parents and had no reason to kill them , mr kinkel , who was 15 at the time of the may 1998 shooting , told a courtroom in eugene , ore , this morning i had no reason to dislike or try to kill anyone at thurston i am truly sorry for all of this still reading from a small sheet of white paper , he added , these events have pulled me to a state of deterioration and selfloathing that i did n't know existed today s sentence , which totals more than 111 years in prison without the possibility of parole , came after several emotional days of testimony , including ones in which injured victims or relatives of the dead spoke of the continuing pain and nightmares caused by the attack and pleaded that mr kinkel be locked up for life testifying for the defense , which plans to appeal today s sentence , a portland psychiatrist said last week that mr kinkel never would have turned violent had his mental illness been recognized earlier and treated for three years , he was fighting off an illness and no one knew it , said dr william sack , a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatry at oregon health sciences university i think if he could have been under treatment with appropriate medication and appropriate followup , i do not think he would have gone on to commit these acts but judge jack mattison , in his ruling today , said the testimony had left him convinced that a jury would have found mr kinkel guilty of several counts of aggravated murder and would have wanted him to spend his life in prison judge mattison said this morning that the sentence needed to account for each of the wounded , who rightly call themselves survivors , and for mr kinkel to know there was a price to be paid for each person hit by his bullets kent mortimer , a lane county assistant district attorney and lead prosecutor in the case , said in a telephone interview today that the incident was a horrible , horrible event that had torn this community in many ways that ca n't be described we had all along been asking for a sentence where he would die in prison , mr mortimer said and that was the ruling from the court under the terms of the sentence , which can be commuted only by the governor , mr kinkel is not entitled to parole in september , mr kinkel confessed to killing his parents , bill and faith kinkel , as well as 16yearold ben walker and mikael nickolauson , 17 , both students at thurston high school in springfield , ore , on may 21 , 1998 he also confessed to wounding 22 students , shooting at three others , and attacking a detective after his arrest he used a semiautomatic rifle in the school cafeteria , spraying the room with about 50 rounds in a minute and a half before some students managed to wrestle him to the floor some clues to mr kinkel s state of mind emerged during the sentencing hearing he was said to have told doctors that since the age of 12 he had heard voices ordering him to kill , and his journal contained passages telling of his selfloathing and fantasizing that he might blow up his school or walk into a pep rally with guns but even the killer himself said he could not explain what happened i have gone back in my mind hundreds of times and changed one detail , one small event , so this never would have happened , he said at today s hearings i wish i could the thurston high killings were part of a wave of killings in schools by students in the last two years it followed similar shootings in pearl , miss , west paducah , ky , and jonesboro , ark , and preceded by a year the killing of 12 students and a teacher at columbine high school in littleton , colo victims and family members had little sympathy for mr kinkel s descriptions of illness if you believe as anyone else does in karma , it s going to come back to you , laura woodward , whose son , kyle , suffers continuing complications from three gunshot wounds inflicted by mr kinkel , said in court on friday for you to be tortured and troubled as we are is to me the final justice i do have my son , she continued , but i am also left with a spirit of fear because of what you have done to us we all have nightmares , jump at loud sounds , have a lot of paranoia that none of us had before josh ryker , a thurston student who helped tackle mr kinkel to the floor , said i hope he lives with the mental images of what he has done to us for the rest of his life i 've been rushed into an adult world that was n't really planned but mr kinkel s 22yearold sister , kristin , had used the sentencing hearing to plead with the judge for a more lenient sentence what keeps me believing in him and loving him is the fact that he is a good person that came from a good home , she said to the judge , reading from her statement and breaking into tears i feel silly writing that , because it seems so contradictory , looking at what actually took place however , it s the truth , and it keeps me alive mr kinkel s lawyer , mark sabitt , said in a telephone interview today that he was profoundly disappointed in the judge s decision he s a sick kid , but he s not a throwaway , mr sabitt said he deserves some hope for the future photos kipland kinkel , at his booking , apologized in court yesterday \( associated press \) adam

havana , march 27 despite the excitement over the baltimore orioles' exhibition game here and the veneer of openness it conveys , american baseball comes to cuba in a climate of heightened political repression a law passed this year tightens the reins on both dissent and press freedom and specifically makes it a crime to engage in conduct that supports american policy toward cuba and despite the feelgood nature of an event that exemplifies the clinton administration s stated efforts to reach out to the cuban people , the orioles come less than three months after the president rejected bipartisan calls to review the 37yearold trade embargo against cuba and its failure so far to bring democratization here so when two prominent people to people exchanges the orioles game and a joint concert by more than 100 cuban and american artists play on sunday , the backdrop will not be rapprochement but one of the chillier periods of the cold war relationship between cuba and the united states they 're pretty bad , an american official said of the relations they 're not trying to accomplish anything with us or do anything constructive at this point jose luis toledo , a member of the national assembly and dean of the law school at havana university , concurred there s no evolution in the relations , he said in an interview they are where they 've always been international human rights monitors said cuba s latest retrenching only served to underscore how little the situation has changed , even after pope john paul ii , during his visit here last year , urged cuba to open up to the world but perhaps because of the high expectations raised by the pope s visit , the government now finds itself the target of international condemnation over its new curbs and the recent sentencing of four dissidents charged with sedition the crackdown is widely regarded as an attempt to assert control in response to growing internal dissent and in anger at the measures that the clinton administration instituted last january in lieu of a fundamental reevaluation of american policy some steps taken by washington , like allowing more dollars to flow to cuba , aim at providing direct help to cubans , but officials here argue that the true goal is destabilization in a message to the united nations human rights commission in geneva , delivered on wednesday , vice president carlos lage defended the crackdown , citing exceptional conditions caused by american efforts to destabilize the country and liquidate the socialist state at the time of judging cuba and its revolution , it ca n't be forgotten that ours is not just any country , mr lage said international rights monitors say such a reaction is to be expected , particularly when a government perceives a loss of control cuba s control has been slowly eroding because of increasing contacts with the outside world through family visits and tourism , and more access to dollars , which makes cubans less economically dependent on the government , american and other western officials said the reaction of the regime is totally predictable said jose miguel vivanco , executive director of the americas division of human rights watch in washington the big challenge is to keep cool heads and keep going , trying to have a flexible policy toward cuba and to pressure , in a concerted way , the cuban government to improve human rights this week two groups , the press association , whose membership list stretches from canada to argentina , and the committee to protect journalists , which is based in new york , cited cuba as being among the worst violators of press freedoms amnesty international says that the number of political prisoners in cuba has declined but that at least 350 remain they include vladimiro roca , felix a bonne , rene gomez manzano and marta b roque , who were sentenced this month to terms from 3 1 2 to 5 years for sedition after issuing a document urging the communist party to allow political pluralism and an impartial legal system they should n't be in prison just for having an opinion , said magaly de armas , wife of mr roca , who is 56 vladimiro says his father always taught him to put his ideas into practice if he was sure of them , and to follow ideas , not men mr roca is the son of a revolutionary leader , blas roca , who died in 1987 in a public response to the international uproar over the sentences , cuban officials said in the government newspaper granma that the four were sentenced not because of their opinions but because they served the goals of american officials by meeting with them , calling for a boycott of elections and other such subversive actions laws passed last month present critics of the government with ever harsher penalties while an anticrime law , addressing new crimes like money laundering and stiffening penalties for drug trafficking and prostitution of minors , is accepted by many as necessary , another law has left dissidents and independent journalists with what one called psychological paralysis this law imposes sentences of 7 to 15 years on anyone who provides information to facilitate the objectives of the

subversive american material anyone collaborating with newspapers , radio , television and other foreign media to further the american goals faces as much as five years in jail the trick of this law is its ambiguity , said raul rivero , head of cubapress , a news agency of 27 independent journalists who have continued working with american and other foreign news media the problem is you never know when you 're 'collaborating' even a love letter could be interpreted that way in this climate of fear , the sports and cultural exchanges are going forward to impress american values on cuban people directly , a senior clinton administration official said the official said those and other contacts , like visits and remittances from cubanamerican relatives , have helped make cubans less willing to accept their government but while many here regard the exchanges as positive , some cubans said they expect no breakthrough the awareness is already there , noted manuel cuesta , secretary general of a social democratic organization whose goal is recognition as a political party that is why so many leave mr vivanco , of human rights watch , said the united states embargo has divided the international community and prevented many countries that care about human rights from coalescing with the united states for a unified response to cuba he said that is about the only pressure that could make the cuban government budge but american officials say the embargo will remain as long as fidel castro wants it lifted without making any reforms at a construction site here where baseball

washington , feb 25 newly released transcripts of secretly recorded white house tapes show president richard m nixon musing about breakins at foreign embassies , brainstorming about blaming president john f kennedy for the murder of south vietnam s leader and saying he and his aides would have been out of our minds not to spy on leftwing americans in the transcripts , nixon twice discusses authorizing breakins at foreign embassies in may 1973 , he told his military aide , gen alexander m haig , there are times , you know , when , good god , i 'd authorize any means to achieve a goal abroad including the breakingin of embassies and so forth that same month , he told his legal aide , j fred buzhardt , when we get down , for example , to the breakin , the chilean embassy that thing was a part of the burglars' plan , as a cover a cia cover the transcript appears to refer to a breakin at the chilean embassy in washington by nixon s secret white house team known as the plumbers that team conducted the june 1972 burglary at democratic party offices in the watergate complex , which led to nixon s downfall a breakin at the chilean embassy in washington on may 13 , 1972 , was reported to washington police no link was made to the white house at the time , and none have been made since there was always a rumor that the plumbers hit the chilean embassy , john dean , nixon s white house counsel during the watergate affair , said in an interview today mr dean said one of the plumbers , james w mccord jr , a former cia officer , was thought to have used his knowledge of american espionage against the chilean embassy as a bargaining chip after his conviction for the watergate breakin mr mccord , now 78 , has rarely spoken about watergate and could not be reached today the embassy was a likely target for american intelligence eavesdropping , since the central intelligence agency had been ordered by nixon to help destabilize the government of salvador allende gossens , the freely elected marxist president of chile , who fell in a coup led by gen augusto pinochet in september 1973 speaking of president ngo dihn diem of south vietnam , whose assassination in november 1963 preceded kennedy s by three weeks , nixon said , this government murdered him i know it and you know it , too , nixon told his press secretary in may 1973 but while one of nixon s aides fabricated evidence implicating kennedy in the killing , there is no known record of a presidential assassination order , although kennedy regretted giving tacit american approval to the coup that led to diem s death the 124 transcripts made public today , some of them fragments of a sentence , some several pages long , had been kept secret on national security grounds the tapes , recorded on a white house system installed by nixon , were formally released by the national archives today transcripts were prepared by the privately financed nixon library and made public on its web site \( www nixonfoundation org \) the material is part of the 201 hours of white house tapes identified by an act of congress as evidence of nixon s abuse of power those tapes were kept from the public during 22 years of litigation by nixon and , after his death , by his estate they are a fraction of the 3 , 600 hours of tape recordings from the nixon white house that eventually will be made public john h taylor , executive director of the nixon library in yorba linda , calif , said in an interview that the abuses of power with which nixon was charged should be understood in the context of the times , more than a quartercentury ago , amid social skirmishes over race and class and sex , political battles over the future of the country and more than 50 , 000 americans dead in vietnam richard nixon was a wartime commander in chief , mr taylor said we were in a culture war then and what the culture tends to remember as the domestic abuses of watergate can only be understood in the context of these challenges nixon and his most senior aides spent hours discussing plans to use federal law enforcement agencies and intelligence services to conduct domestic spying operations against americans in 1970 , nixon personally approved the most radical of these plans it was called the huston plan , after its author , tom charles huston , a white house aide j edgar hoover , director of the federal bureau of investigation , blocked its full implementation five days later mr dean , who in 1973 decided to cooperate with federal investigators in the watergate case , took a copy of the huston plan with him when he left the white house in the new transcripts , nixon and his aides worry aloud about the plan becoming public one fragmentary transcript shows the white house wondering if elements of the plan survived after hoover died in may 1972 and was succeeded by an acting fbi director loyal to the nixon white house , l patrick gray in the oval office on may 16 , 1973 , mr buzhardt told nixon about his discussions with the deputy director of the national security agency , louis w tordella , about the huston plan the nsa conducts international electronic eavesdropping , but like the cia , it is not supposed to spy on americans at home anything the nsa did is totally defensible , nixon said , referring to the huston plan mr buzhardt replied they move into a broader category with respect to domestic affairs an illegal realm what do you mean \? nixon asked electronic surveillance \? mr buzhardt replied , yes , sir , targeting us citizens' conversations nixon appeared unsure that the huston plan had been turned off dia says that thinks it was terminated \? he asked , referring to the defense intelligence agency , a pentagon service that was part of the huston plan they think it was terminated , mr buzhardt said now , we 're going to check this thoroughly with nsa because they were the most aggressive group referring to mr tordella s notes on the huston plan , mr buzhardt added they never quite got a handle on it until pat gray was appointed in 1972 in that same conversation , nixon anticipated a story saying the president authorized a superduper activity in 1970 involving burglary , etc , and wiretapping defiantly , he said americans would understand the plan was to control riots by people protesting the vietnam war
my horse , named jorp , was a goodnatured , shaggymaned icelandic mare who liked to trot beside a friend from the stable , a gelding named glofaxi on a dirt road bordering a forest in vermont , jorp stayed toward the head of the pack , but clearly wanted to keep glofaxi a little in front as collected as tin soldiers , we were moving at an exhilarating flying pace , which is an amazingly smooth running gait characteristic of icelandic horses , a rare breed on these shores icelandic horses are renowned for their steadiness and good temperament jorp seemed to be feeling no strain at our comfortable gait , and i decided to test her mettle i got a green light from glofaxi s rider , cheryl eppel , who , with a slight movement on her reins , shifted glofaxi down a gear to what is called a tolt , a fast walk that is another specialty of the icelandic breed go for it ! she told me , dropping back on glofaxi freed from the protocols of stable hierarchy , jorp enthusiastically took the squeeze of my leg and flattened out into a fast canter hooves thumping like a bongo marching band , we flew up to the top of the hill and stopped there within a minute or so the other riders in our group of eight had caught up and were regrouping to continue on down the hill at a walk jorp was n't winded or sweaty in fact , she had taken the opportunity to go to sleep as we set off again , jorp snapped out of her nap without missing a stride this was during the second day of a weekendlong ride that my wife , nancy , and i recently took on icelandic horses along the cool forest trails and flowering hills of the green mountains in the sleepy mad river valley , not far from sugarbush , the northcentral vermont ski resort the daylong treks left each morning from the vermont icelandic horse farm , a modern ranch in waitsfield that occupies the crest of a gently rolling meadow where its prized herd of more than 30 icelandic horses are turned out to graze and romp when they are n't working under the saddle the stable s owner is karen winhold , 34 , one of a handful of united states horse breeders who are working to introduce americans to the icelandic she runs a steady schedule of weeklong , weekend and daily one and twohour rides year round from her stable she and her assistants have good eyes both for matching riders to horses and for making sure that groups on extended rides are n't held back by inexperienced riders unable to handle the faster gaits each day in rides interrupted by lunch back at the ranch , we covered about 20 miles of forest trails and hills that sometimes opened into breathtaking vistas in which armloads of rounded mountain peaks appeared to be piled like pillows against the horizon already , scattered bursts of color were showing in the trees , a harbinger of the early fallfoliage season expected throughout the northeast this year because of the dry summer weather on horseback , even on a one or twohour ride , is considered by enthusiasts to be one of the best ways to experience the fall spectacular the scenery was magnificent , and the ride was well organized , but the horses were the real trip although nancy and i are experienced , frequent riders who plan holidays and vacations to schedule at least some time on horseback , we had never heard of , let alone ridden , icelandics before i chanced upon the vermont icelandic horse farm s web site \( www icelandichorses com \) while browsing for information on horse treks in vermont do you believe these guys \? nancy said of the horses , laughing as she trotted up to join us on her gelding , pjakkur \( pj for short \) , whom she had been keeping to the middle of the pack in order to gauge his pacing it s like riding a couch , declared ms eppel , a psychotherapist from watertown , mass besides my wife and me , our party included a mother and preteenage daughter from massachusetts a couple from connecticut \( she was a regular rider , he had n't ridden since he was thrown by a horse many years ago \) an older woman who travels the world on horse treks two middleaged women from new jersey who own horses a couple from wisconsin , and the eppel sisters , cheryl and lynne , who now live 1 , 000 miles apart in massachusetts and colorado they had come to vermont to celebrate lynne s birthday by reclaiming a part of their teenage years , when they rode horses together on hunts and rambles through new jersey horse country like the rest of us , ms winhold loved the icelandics at first sight when i bought the place seven years ago , there were three icelandics in the stable , she said , running her hands through the dolly partonlike blond mane of the bay she was on the rest were standardbred horses now , all her horses are icelandics , which she also breeds and sells they 're magnificent herding animals , which means they 're good with each other in a pack like this , said ms winhold , who wo n't saddle a young horse until it has been socialized in the herd on her ranch for about four years ms winhold is a careful and observant trailride leader , but not a hyperanxious one she likes to see responsible experienced riders have fun clearly enjoying herself as much as we were , she rode just in front as three or four of us played at jockeying for position while pacing up a steep , open stretch of deserted road like the riders , the horses seemed to like the jockeying for the lark that it was

washington , oct 4 with the clock running in overtime , congress gave final passage to the sixth of 13 spending bills for the new fiscal year today , financing federal transportation programs but republican leaders faced growing dissent and disarray over how to pass the rest of the bills the new fiscal year began on friday , and the government is operating on a threeweek , stopgap spending bill that expires on oct 21 the largest and most controversial spending bills for the military , labor , education , health and human services , housing , veterans , commerce , diplomacy and justice remain unfinished republican leaders are tangled among the financial constraints imposed by spending caps signed into law in 1997 , members' desire for more money for the bills and their own promises to abstain from spending surplus social security funds by most independent accounts , congress is on course to spend upwards of 18 billion of social security funds , although some republicans say the sum could be as little as 4 billion , and some democrats say it could be as high as 30 billion one idea for avoiding that politically perilous course became a fiasco last week when the republicans' leading presidential contender , gov george w bush of texas , strongly criticized them for considering delaying billions of dollars in tax breaks for workingclass families no coherent new strategies have emerged from the republican caucus , and some house members are worried that none are forthcoming one possibility is to call for acrosstheboard spending cuts of 3 or 4 percent for federal agencies , but it is unclear whether all republicans would support cuts in military spending or whether president clinton would sign such a spending measure another idea is to pass another stopgap spending bill late this month , adjourn and try again next year some republicans worry that this would appear to be an admission of failure tonight , with an 88to3 senate vote , a 495 billion transportation spending bill was ready to be sent to president clinton , who is likely to sign it the house adopted the final version of the bill on friday by a 304to91 vote the bill provides 277 billion for highways , 101 billion for the federal aviation administration , 58 billion for mass transit , 4 billion for the coast guard and 571 million for amtrak , the national passenger railway system other bills remained stymied tonight indeed , the house created what could be another conflict with the senate by moving to strike several provisions favoring oil , gas and mining industries from an interior department spending bill
unauthorized videotapes of hundreds , perhaps thousands , of naked male athletes in the locker rooms of more than 50 universities are being produced , sold and distributed on sexually oriented sites on the world wide web , according to a lawyer representing 200 of the men who were taped without their knowledge , the athletes were videotaped at urinals , at showers or weighing in unclothed at competitions no camera was ever in open view , the students said the tapes were made by employees or students working for video companies posing as athletic trainers , they were able to slip into the locker rooms carrying hidden cameras in gym bags sometimes a zoom lens was used the result was a video , with no sound , that later was edited for sale on the internet or by mail the students' attorney , louis s goldstein of chicago , filed a lawsuit in illinois state court late last month seeking a permanent injunction to stop the video producers and web sites from marketing and displaying the videotapes this is a big business , he said eventually , he and dennis a berkson , another chicago lawyer , will seek classaction status for the victims , whose numbers he expects will increase once a university is identified through student uniforms or its buildings i know that we have at least 1 , 000 kids on eight tapes , goldstein said there are many more tapes than eight , and usually there may be from 5 to 10 schools on each tape this could eventually involve thousands and thousands of college athletes shown naked and being marketed and distributed world wide on videos and on the web the videos of the students , including their faces , are now marketed through web sites under such titles as voyeur time , after the game , wrestle time and shower time one former varsity athlete learned from a roommate that he had been taped a few years ago in a locker room at his school i pulled up the home page and i am looking at myself naked on the internet , said the former athlete , who spoke on the condition that neither his name nor his sport be identified and everyone in the world has access to it my parents have seen it now , and they are very upset it is terrible because i have no control over it according to the complaint filed initially on behalf of 28 john does a judge has ruled the students' names may be kept confidential the students were members of football , wrestling and squash teams goldstein said baseball and track athletes were also videotaped , along with men in a united states marine corps locker room the universities where the taping occurred are identified as northwestern , eastern illinois , illinois state , pennsylvania , iowa state , michigan state , indiana and illinois two other ivy league schools besides penn are also apparently involved , but goldstein would not identify them goldstein said the clandestine operation , which began almost a decade ago , depends on fresh material for steady web site users who typically buy memberships to a site or a group of sites to increase the number of people looking at the site , the sites promote the hidden camera angle and the outright sale of the videotapes the video companies earn upward of 20 , 000 a month , with virtually no overhead and who runs them \? mitchell kamarck , a beverly hills lawyer who represents celebrities whose images routinely appear on the web via hidden camera , says it is mostly college kids wanting to earn a buck the lawsuit was filed in illinois state court rather than in federal court because the law on the federal level is limited to audio wrongdoing listening in but not to video eavesdropping illinois is one of a handful of states with a statute that bars secret videotaping in saunas , bathrooms and tanning booths in addition , the students are suing under statutes that allow individuals to assert property rights to their own images , and under racketeering statutes that , if they prove their case , will entitle them to triple damages a spokesman for the federal bureau of investigation in chicago said there was no active investigation as is its policy , the united states attorney s office in chicago would not comment within the legal community , there is a debate on what criminal laws were violated , if any there is no federal eavesdropping law regarding hidden video cameras , so prosecutors are examining two laws one that makes interstate distribution of pornography or indecent material a violation , and another that deals with racketeering statutes making the issue more difficult is the uncertain law governing control over images and words on the internet there is wideranging freedom on the internet , and lawyers for the companies are expected to use that freedom as their first defense their lawyers always begin with that , but the first amendment does not hold when it comes to commercial exploitation , kamarck said the use of hidden cameras in bathrooms is illegal , immoral and impermissible the web sites are bold , he added , and because there are so many of them , they feel they wo n't ever get caught the lawsuit said , the hiddencamera activity , accomplished in a locker room where students have the presumption of security and privacy , was extreme and outrageous in addition to the obvious invasion of the locker room , the students fear employers will believe they were willing participants none of the companies named in the lawsuit is a household name they are franco productions , rodco , hidvideo , and hidvidcoatlas video release , logan gaines entertainment , diy triangle video and cal video none had listed telephone numbers , and no one could be reached for comment the companies' owners were also sued individually , as were a group of internet service providers , companies that lease the computer space where the videos are posted and promoted they were identified as psi net , tiacnet and gte internet and its offspring , genuitynet the university of pennsylvania has mounted a vigorous attack to get the videos removed from the internet the school s general counsel , peter c erichsen , wrote letters to two video companies , logan gaines entertainment of kahului , hawaii , and hidvidco of boston , saying the university s legal rights had been violated logan gaines , whose company displayed and distributed the tape of the penn wrestlers on the web , wrote back saying he would remove all hiddencamera images of penn wrestlers from his site , erichsen said hidvideo has not replied , said erichsen , who plans further legal action goldstein said the scheme began to unravel last spring with the discovery of two tapes one was found by a university of memphis track athlete who recognized wrestlers from penn and sent the tape to friends there another tape and a hidden camera were discovered at the midlands national wrestling tournament at northwestern , which attracts scores of schools because of the hiddencamera taping , penn is renovating its locker facility , separating the shower section from the rest of the locker room , to address the problem , a spokesman said other schools are also tightening security at their locker rooms but the athlete who spoke on the condition of anonymity said locker rooms are not the same to him anymore you know , you see a gym bag and you do n't think twice about it , he said but now i do
washington , aug 28 it has been 27 years since the united states banned the pesticide ddt , and the payoff is undeniable the peregrine falcon , once pushed to the brink of extinction , came off the endangered species list this month , and the bald eagle may soon follow brown pelicans are flourishing in florida on the shores of long island , the ospreys are back now the united nations is drafting a treaty that may lead to a worldwide ban on ddt but the negotiations , set to resume in geneva next month , are drawing opposition from an unlikely quarter public health professionals , who say ddt is necessary to stop the spread of malaria , a disease that kills as many as 27 million people each year , mostly children in undeveloped countries a child dies of malaria every 12 seconds , said dyann f wirth , a malaria expert at the harvard school of public health and president of the american society of tropical medicine and hygiene that could go up dramatically if we lose this important control tool dr wirth is among more than 370 medical researchers in 57 countries who are urging that the treaty allow ddt to be sprayed in small quantities on the interior walls of homes , where it acts as a repellent to the diseasecarrying insects the scientists argue that if the pesticide , which is cheap and effective , must be eliminated , it should be phased out gradually , and only if western countries conduct research on the more expensive alternatives and help pay for them some type of public health exception is likely , said jim willis , director of chemicals for the united nations environmental program , which is sponsoring the talks but the specifics are engendering intense acrimony between the public health experts and environmentalists , and have created some friction in the federal government , as it tries to formulate its policy for the negotiations this poses an unusual dilemma , said a state department official involved in the talks usually the dynamic is protection versus economics there , it is very easy for one side to paint the other as the black hat but here there is a peculiar tradeoff between health and the environment most countries no longer use ddt for agricultural purposes \( or do not admit to it if they do \) , but experts estimate that 23 nations still use it for malaria control the biggest users are china and india mexico has pledged to stop spraying ddt by 2007 and the world bank has lent india 200 million to help devise alternatives to ddt the ddt dilemma stems from a united nations plan to eliminate , or greatly reduce , the use of 12 toxic chemicals classified as persistent organic pollutants the group the dirty dozen to environmentalists consists of eight pesticides , including ddt , as well as chemical byproducts and industrial chemicals all accumulate in the food chain and can travel thousands of miles through air , water and bird migration , causing lasting contamination in her 1962 book silent spring , rachel carson , a marine biologist , chronicled ddt s poisonous effects , showing , for example , how it killed the robins that ate the earthworms that dined on the leaves of dutch elm trees that had been sprayed with the insecticide the public outcry was tremendous the book led to the establishment of the environmental protection agency in 1970 and the united states ban on ddt in 1972 the treaty negotiations on the group of pollutants began in 1998 and are scheduled to conclude by the end of next year the geneva meeting , which runs from sept 6 to 11 , is the third of five scheduled sessions , but the first to examine each chemical in detail mr willis of the united nations predicted a rather thorough discussion of the ddt issue among advocacy groups hoping to influence the talks , that discussion is already under way , and it is fraught with competing studies and statistics experts are arguing about everything from whether ddt is harmful to human health \( the evidence is inconclusive \) to whether the recent rise in malaria rates in mexico results from cutbacks in spraying , or from last year s hurricanes , which provided fertile breeding grounds for mosquitoes \( the answer is probably both \) positions have hardened , said dr gerald t keusch , director of the fogarty international center , the branch of the national institutes of health devoted to promoting scientific research overseas in the heat it has not been possible to step back and look at the light on one side is the nonprofit world wildlife fund and physicians for social responsibility , a doctors' group concerned with environmental health they argue that even small amounts of ddt sprayed inside homes are harmful to the environment and cite studies suggesting that the pesticide turns up in the breast milk of nursing mothers and has other subtle effects on human health taking its cue from mexico , the wildlife fund is pressing for a ban on ddt by 2007 but the idea of a specific date is extremely contentious , and the state department official said the united states would not ask for one
garden city , ny , sept 23 it seemed harmless enough last winter when little alex silverman started asking his mother for extra money to buy packs of pokemon trading cards , the children s craze that has swept schoolyards and stationery stores across the country six months and more than 2 , 000 later , however , his mother , janet , is convinced that her 9yearold son s new hobby is no ordinary passing fad but a real threat to his welfare and to her wallet in what could bring at least a smile , if not some remuneration , to millions of other concerned moms and dads , mrs silverman and another merrick mother have signed up with a team of classaction lawyers on both coasts to charge that the pokemon craze constitutes a form of illegal gambling no less addictive than scratch tickets or slot machines as only the childless need to be told , pokemon \( derived from the japanese words for pocket monster \) cards are about the same size as baseball cards but carry the images and describe the special powers of dozens of imaginary creatures and monsters with names like alakazam , blastoise and charizard a pack of 10 or 11 sells for 5 to 8 children can pit their cards against their friends' in a fantasy game but many children , like alex silverman and his soccer teammate , andrew imber , quickly find themselves skipping the game to trade for more valuable cards that s not surprising , given that the more powerful and soughtafter cards can fetch as much as 50 on the thriving secondary market , which ranges from friendly dickering between thirdgraders over chewing gum and candy bars to coldblooded auctions on the internet the odds of getting a powerful premium card are stated at 1 in 33 , and certain specific cards may be twice as scarce as that , according to a lawsuit filed in federal district court in san diego this week that , parents say , leads to children s behaving just like some adults who buy lottery tickets you 'd take them to the store to buy two packs , and they 'd rip them open and throw away all the worthless cards , said marci imber , andrew s mother and they 'd beg and beg you for another 5 to buy more the lawsuit , against nintendo of america inc and two other defendants , is the latest of several filed against the tradingcard industry by alan s hock , a garden city lawyer who became concerned several years ago after his own 8yearold son became obsessed with baseball and other cards he seized on the industry s switch , in the late 1980 s , from printing equal numbers of each player s card to including limitedrun cards known as chase cards which he says turned a harmless childhood pastime into an illegal lottery , and also generated billions in profits mr hock said that the pokemon cards , like other trading cards , involve all the elements of a gambling enterprise a price to play , the element of risk and a potential payoff , in the resale value of the rarer cards in a prepared statement , richard flamm , general counsel for nintendo of america , declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit but said nintendo was generally familiar with the cases that have been filed by these plaintiffs' attorneys in the past he added to our knowledge none of these cases has been successful in asserting that collecting trading cards is a form of illegal gambling we see no reason to expect a different result in this case but mr hock notes that his lawsuits have not failed , either , surviving numerous motions to dismiss them by lawyers for the card makers indeed , one suit against upper deck , a leading card company , generated a 1997 opinion by federal district judge rudi m brewster , who likened the trading cards to pieces of cardboard which can be exchanged for cash whether the piece of cardboard contains lotto numbers , scratchoff boxes or the face of michael jordan , it is still gambling , the judge said in denying a motion to dismiss the case it is headed for trial next year in san diego whatever comes of the pokemon lawsuit , the experience has been an eyeopener for the silvermans and imbers the boys said they had watched friends get into fistfights over trades gone bad , seen other children break into tears when cards were stolen , and watched older children try to bamboozle younger naifs into trading away precious cards for worthless ones alex silverman said he was not just six months older , but wiser , too do n't waste your time , he said he would advise his contemporaries do n't waste your money photo alex silverman , left , and andrew imber , 9yearolds in merrick , ny , display their hundreds of pokemon cards at a lawyer s office \( vic delucia the new york times \)
newark , july 1 nine newark police officers have been suspended from duty indefinitely because some of them beat a criminal suspect in a station house and others allowed prisoners to continue pummeling him in a cell , the authorities said today the two assaults took place on june 14 , minutes after the suspect , manuel aldea , 23 , of newark , was arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a minor on a street , newark s police director , joseph j santiago , said the first attack occurred inside the headquarters of the department s north district , he said , and then mr aldea was placed in a holding pen with several other prisoners when some of the officers told the prisoners about the sexcrime charge against mr aldea , the prisoners started hitting him with their fists , mr santiago said some of the nine officers witnessed the attack in the cell , while others were aware of it and did nothing to stop it , mr santiago said mr aldea required hospital treatment for a broken nose and head cuts he filed a complaint with the police on june 17 , a few hours after he was released on bail mr santiago denounced the attacks as an intolerable breach of trust and issued what he called a declaration and warning to the newark s 1 , 500 police officers the newark police department will not tolerate police brutality , we will not foster brutality , and we will not tolerate a blue wall of silence , he said during a news conference in a statement , newark s mayor , sharpe james , denounced the beatings as disgraceful and said he expected all of newark s officers to treat residents with respect and courtesy we are not bullies trampling on people s rights , he said in the statement mr santiago , the police director , said that the department s investigation of the incident was continuing and that all information and evidence gathered would be turned over to the essex county prosecutor s office for possible filing of criminal charges against some or all of the suspended officers and the prisoners involved in the beating mr santiago stressed that he had little patience for officers who broke department rules or the law in his three years as police director , he said , he has ordered the dismissal of 70 officers under what he called a zerotolerance philosophy for violations of rules and regulations or of the law aides said the past dismissals were handled privately and quietly , with none of the public denunciations and warnings mr santiago issued today the nine suspended officers are lieut dennis tassie and sgt anthony caruso , both 10year veterans michael turner , wendell harper , michael clegg and marison gonzalezcardona , all patrolmen , and three probationary officers chris gialanella , anthony venancio and silas smith mr santiago refused to say which officers had struck mr aldea and which ones had put him in the cell with other prisoners he offered little information about the alleged sexual assault , other than saying that a resident had reported it as happening on june 14 on a street near the north district headquarters and that officers clegg and gonzalez had arrested mr aldea and taken him to the station house mr santiago also refused to provide the age or sex of the victim in a brief interview at his home here tonight , mr aldea denied he had sexually assaulted anyone he said that five police officers and eight prisoners had beaten him at the station , and that he was scheduled to undergo surgery on friday to straighten his broken nose his mother , marta , said that mr aldea was mentally retarded and that neither she nor his father , ramon , believed their son had committed a sexual assault the charges , they said , involved a 9year old boy from their neighborhood a neighbor , esther rios , said she did not believe mr aldea had committed the crime he s a nice guy , she said of mr aldea the guy s clean , slow i do n't think he 'd do that
physics in the 20th century by curt suplee edited by judy r franz and john s rigden illustrated 223 pages harry n abrams in association with the american physical society and the american institute of physics 4950 the trouble with grasping modern physics is that in the quantum world , objects have properties for which there are no physical counterparts that you can see and as knowledge of both the microcosm and the macrocosm has advanced , cosmology has become inseparable from particle physics one understands and accepts this , especially after too many fruitless attempts to get a grip on quantum physics and the theory of relativity through metaphor all the same , when a lushly illustrated , oversize book like curt suplee s physics in the 20th century comes along an art book about physics , really you ca n't help being attracted and thinking , this has just got to make things clearer at first you are disappointed , maybe inevitably the text is lucid enough a longtime science writer and editor at the washington post , mr suplee is practiced at making the abstract appear concrete beginning with the atom , logically enough , he explains how various turnofthecentury scientists discovered the electron but among the first illustrations is a photo captioned the device built and used by robert millikan in 1913 to determine the electrical charge of the electron this tells you absolutely nothing other than that the man was not compulsively neat what the picture shows might as well be a workbench full of the parts of a disassembled lawn mower , with fog coming from somewhere it could measure the charge of an electron \? so what \? this is the problem with many of the volume s early photographs they depict machines like a particle detector , a synchrotron \( for accelerating particles \) and a molecular beam system that allows atoms and molecules to be studied individually but aside from showing you how impressively large and stunningly complicated these contraptions are , they tell you little moreover , as the text proceeds , you notice a faintly disconcerting pattern as each new discovery is explained , the discussion ends with some practical application of the concept thus , the critical insight that particles have an intrinsic spin' leads to an account of magnetic resonance imaging , or mri , in medicine and einstein s explanation of the photoelectric effect eventually produces the photocell sensors that turn lights on at night or open doors automatically , as well as the chargecoupled device , or ccd , the basis for television cameras , home camcorders and highly sensitive astronomical recording devices now all these are unquestionably invaluable inventions what s more , their introduction into the discussion lends useful concreteness to a dauntingly abstract subject still , you sometimes get a sense that the whole point of 20thcentury physics was not simply to extend the frontiers of knowledge but , like du pont in the old commercial , to produce better things for better living through chemistry yet despite these mild drawbacks , physics in the 20th century turns out to be worth reading the illustrations improve one photo illustrating how the transistor revolutionized electronics shows the near roomful of pretransistor wired components that would be replaced by a single texas instruments handheld calculator others show the microdevices built with what is known as nanotechnology , because their scale reaches into the billionths of meters still others present the fantastic colored images of materials revealed by a scanning tunneling microscope \( stm \) and the eerie otherworldly forms seen with the hubble space telescope some of these photos are breathtaking in their beauty and for all its practical bent , mr suplee s text makes a lot of difficult abstract ideas a little clearer , particularly superconductivity , chaos theory and einstein s theory of special relativity explaining the latter , he writes that , for example , a sound wave traveling at 1 , 000 feet per second toward an observer who is approaching at 500 feet per second has a speed of 1 , 500 feet per second relative to the observer how could light behave differently \? he continues einstein s leap of insight explained how it could he postulated that the speed of light is always the same to any observer in any reference frame the price to be paid for this constancy is that space and time the two factors that determine speed turn out to be relative to the way the observer is moving thus , if your friend were to take off in an accelerating rocket , and you could somehow watch as she approached the speed of light , you would see two odd things happen a clock moving with her would appear to slow down , and she and the objects around her would shrink in her direction of motion \( also , her mass would approach infinity as she neared light speed a speed that is unattainable for any object that has mass \) of the dozens of accounts of this idea i 've read before , none have seemed quite so clear and succinct of course no visual image is offered to illustrate the point in relatively few cases do the pictures elaborate the text , with the possible exceptions of the colored bands of different wavelengths that make up the spectrum and various computergenerated images of subatomic events yet all in all the contiguity of text and illustrations seems to have the intended effect although the difficult concepts of modern physics ca n't be visualized , the presence of so many pictures somehow helps you to see both the microcosm and the macrocosm a little more distinctly photo curt suplee \( todd cross the washington post \)
there is a curious inversion afoot in silicon valley , where internet entrepreneurs whose startup companies fail are more marketable to venture capitalists than those who have never failed at all it is not how business is supposed to work , but there it is in that corner of the economy , failure has become an asset , a resumebuilder perhaps in an industry where people do not know what they are doing , any experience is better than none perhaps the willingness to fail is admired because it suggests the courage to try whatever the explanation , the turning of failure on its head is a reminder of americans' incessantly ambivalent and constantly mutable relationship with the idea of not making it failure has been with us as the shadow of success since the republic s early days , when benjamin franklin lectured that little strokes fell great oaks that with enough diligence and tenacity , anyone could succeed in the two centuries since , as capitalism has expanded its hold on american life , success has become that much more important and failure that much more catastrophic its definition , in fact , seems to have quietly broadened to encompass not just those who fail outright , but those who do not achieve extraordinary and public success as in silicon valley , of course , there are exceptions in the age of instant memoirs and commercial endorsements , for example , bob dole , dick morris , and others have shown that failure can actually be profitable indeed , to judge from talk shows and tabloids , the only true failure nowadays sometimes seems to be obscurity but for most americans the stigma of failing remains , and thus the quest to assign a moral cause for it continues whether the blame for those who fail to make it up the ladder lies with larger socioeconomic forces or with the individual is an unspoken subtext of the ideological battle between liberals and conservatives it is the backdrop of countless policy debates , on subjects from welfare to how hard it should be to declare bankruptcy yet while plenty of americans have experience with failure , few like to dwell on it , at least outside their therapists' offices historians in particular and americans in general do n't like to talk about failure very much , said scott sandage , a professor at carnegie mellon who is at work on a book called forgotten men failure in american culture , to be published by harvard university press there are , he says , dozens of studies of the ideology of success in america , but until recently , historians have not looked at the experience of failure professor sandage is doing just that researching not great men who momentarily stumbled , but ordinary men who despite their honest toil slowly , or sometimes instantaneously , sank he has dug through family papers and diaries , credit reports and letters to understand how americans grappled with failure in a society where hard work was supposed to equal success the answer was usually to find some flaw in the person s character he cites the example of robert brown , a farmer and planter in antebellum virginia who was described in various business records as one of nature s best sons a decent if slightly naive man while he was prospering but when he went bankrupt some of the same people described him as a man of no energy a phrase that professor sandage says became common in the 1850 s and 1860 s to describe failures who were not idlers or drunkards it is a profound threat to the fundamental ideology of america if it never comes together despite one s best efforts , mr sandage said so when fitch raymond , a cleveland grocer who failed during the panic of 1873 , requested assistance from a friend , he defended himself against the assumption that he was to blame i have been struggling incessantly trying to re g ain a little foothold but without success , he wrote not because i am imbecile , shiftless , lazy , listlessly , loafing about , no , not a bit of it , but the reverse is true over time mr sandage said , failure has been transformed from an action failing at a business or other venture to an identity today , being known as a loser and the words i am a failure have become common coinage the rise of supersuccesses like carnegie and rockefeller at the end of the 19th century helped breed the phenomenon that might be called failure through inadequacy unless one achieved and amassed on a grand public scale , one had failed as capitalism exploded , americans began grappling with how to process failure in a society that held that the individual made his fortunes or broke them the notion of treating failure as a bump on the road to success still very much evident today in selfhelp books with titles like failure the back door to success began to emerge in the 1920 s , the decade when president calvin coolidge proclaimed that the chief business of the american people is business , a little homily called the failure circulated in popular magazines , merrill peterson writes in lincoln in american memory it recounted the defeats abraham lincoln had suffered and concluded how would you stand in the face of such setbacks \? think it over !
boulder , colo it somehow comes as no surprise to learn that the headquarters of blue mountain arts , a greeting card company that set up shop here in 1971 , used to be a hot tub palace the tubs are gone , but it is not hard to imagine the company s founders , stephen schutz and susan polis schutz , kicking back in the buff in the steaming water the image fits nicely with their selfproclaimed mission to help people communicate their deepest emotions what is surprising is that this touchyfeely principle has helped propel blue mountain to the very top of the fierce world of ecommerce its site is now the web s most popular shopping stop moreover , at a time when ecommerce companies attract loads of venture capital and promises of throughtheroof stock offerings , blue mountain is the rare case of a site that has rocketed to the top tier of the internet without cashing in yet instead , the company is trying to pull off a truly tricky feat staying true to its original mission to serve the cause of heartfelt sentiment while starting to be serious about making money and in doing so , the family that runs blue mountain reflects the twin impulses that rule the internet an openhearted , freewheeling , spreadtheword sort of place that has also been profoundly altered by the temptation of potential gold until two years ago , blue mountain was a small card and book publisher , featuring for the most part the inspirational art and poetry of the schutzes and a coterie of likeminded contributors full of bald announcements of emotion and feelgood pep talks card titles include believe in miracles ! and to my daughter , with love the cards captured a loyal but limited following the company is privately held , but according to its own estimates , blue mountain , with about 100 employees , accounts for just about 1 percent of the 63 billion greeting card market hallmark , by comparison , accounts for 42 percent in september 1996 , the schutzes , both 53 , started a web site less concerned with possibly cutting into their own paper card sales than with reaching out , they decided to give the ecards away they were an instant hit blue mountain cards began popping up in emailboxes all across the country , with colorful animated greetings for just about every occasion , from embracing polar bears for hugging day to an unfurling rose for robert burns day even though the company has never paid to advertise its web site \( www bluemountainarts com \) , its growth has been staggering , even by internet standards in november , it passed amazoncom as the most visited shopping site , according to media metrix inc , the leading internet audience measurement firm \( yes , even though blue mountain gives its cards away , analysts still count it as commerce \) in december , it became the 10thmostvisited site on the whole web , putting it in a league with america online and yahoo blue mountain has now reached 21 percent of the entire web audience , or some 123 million people when it comes to ecommerce , the company is so far out in front of hallmark and american greetings , both of whose web sites charge a fee for ecards , that jared schutz , 24 , the founders' son and the company s vice president for business development , calls them irrelevant yet even as blue mountain s web site has flourished by giving cards away , the need for money has grown for starters , competitors , backed by big venture capital dollars , are using advertising and professionalquality graphics to cut into blue mountain s lead there is also the question of cost right now the web site is being carried by the schutzes' publishing business , which has experienced 20 percent annual growth since the company went on line , but it is definitely a drain on both finances and management energies finally , there is the lure of loot mention making a profit and susan polis schutz sounds a bit annoyed frankly , i do n't care about that , she says curtly her ambition is for the site to become the poetry and emotional center for communications on the web that explains , in part , why the schutz family has turned away a steady stream of interested buyers and investors still , the opportunity to go commercial has piqued at least the second generation s interest when you constantly have new york investment bankers beating down your doorstep , jared schutz said , it does n't require too much of a leap of faith to realize that we have something enormous on our hands the question now , somewhat paradoxically , is what , exactly , the most formidable merchant on the web can sell not cards users now expect those free at the end of november , blue mountain started experimenting with taking ads from 10 partners the biggest are discover card , barnesandnoblecom and qwest ms schutz calls the ads , which are small and not featured on the main page , the least obnoxious way to support the enterprise still , they are not without risk blue mountain has developed the kind of personal relationship with its customers that most merchants including those on the web can only dream of for a surprising number of blue mountain s users , the warm feelings they feel when sending an ecard have spilled over to their electronic messenger they have sent letters of thanks and also of a much more personal nature
washington , april 14 house democrats today began a petition drive to buck republican leaders and force a vote on a campaign finance overhaul it was the opening salvo in a battle that promises to be as spirited , convoluted and perplexing as it was last year although majorities of lawmakers in both houses of congress seem to support legislation to impose more stringent controls on campaign contributions , particularly the unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties that are known as soft money , leading republicans have blocked such changes since their party took control of congress in 1995 a similar petition drive last year forced house leaders to allow legislation by representatives christopher shays , republican of connecticut , and martin t meehan , democrat of massachusetts , to the floor but the leaders used a variety of procedural tactics , including weeks of truncated latenight debates , to delay the vote until late in the year and then block a vote in the senate the republican senator at the head of the opposition , mitch mcconnell of kentucky , vowed today to block any measure like the shaysmeehan bill again this year but house democrats said this year s petition drive was an attempt to get legislation on track earlier and rally enough support to overcome senate opposition in order to pass a law before next year s campaigns kick into high gear we must act now , in a nonelection year , representative tom allen , democrat of maine , said on the house floor this morning if you thought that the presidential election year of 1996 was awash in soft money , 2000 promises to be a deluge the shaysmeehan bill finally got 61 republican votes and passed the house by a decisive vote of 252 to 179 last august but the senate , which had seen a companion measure filibustered to death earlier in the year , had no appetite for another goround this year s petition , sponsored by a group of conservative house democrats headed by representative jim turner of texas , limits the debate on the shaysmeehan bill or any alternative measures to a maximum of 17 hours the petition needs 218 signatures , or a simple majority of house members , to be effective by early this evening , 184 democrats and the lone independent member of the house had signed it , a measure of the ardor democrats bring to the issue and their desire to put republicans who oppose campaign finance overhaul on the defensive although enough republicans in the house support such legislation that it will probably pass , none had signed the petition by early evening so far , house republicans have been heeding appeals from party leaders to leave the timing on the campaign finance overhaul in their hands the speaker , representative j dennis hastert , told reporters today , i expect some kind of campaign finance reform bill will come forward sometime this year but i ca n't tell you when house democrats accused republican leaders of once again trying to doom legislation by delaying it and said that the house must pass a bill in the next few months if there was any chance for such legislation to muster enough votes in the senate , where it faces more formidable obstacles , especially mr mcconnell he heads the republican senatorial campaign committee , which provides money to candidates , and the senate rules committee , which handles election law legislation last year , he led the filibuster that killed the bill in the senate only 52 senators , when 60 are necessary , voted to bring the bill to a vote asked in an interview today if he would take the same steps to prevent such legislation this year , mr mcconnell said , is grass green \? but senator john mccain of arizona , cosponsor of the bill with senator russell feingold , democrat of wisconsin , expressed guarded optimism for a bill s odds in the senate this time around there s a much better opportunity if the house passes it early on , he said in an interview today the shaysmeehan bill would not only eliminate soft money but also severely restrict the ability of independent groups to plow money into advertisements that attack or endorse candidates proponents of such regulations say they are necessary to lessen the influence of wealthy interests in campaigns opponents like mr mcconnell say the regulations would restrict free speech and unfettered participation by americans in the political process it s an utter disaster , mr mcconnell said that kind of bill is not going to pass the senate just because it 'll pass the house it is precisely that kind of resolve that the democrats hope to overcome by beginning a petition drive earlier this year and inaugurating it with such a dramatic flourish they gathered by the dozens outside the capitol this morning , then marched up the steps and onto the floor of the house , forming a dense , snaking line as they waited to sign the petition representative turner s petition would force debate of the shaysmeehan bill and would also allow the republican and democratic leaders to offer substitute measures and compel discussion of those , too once members' votes indicated which bill had the most support , that legislation could be debated for no more than 10 hours before a decisive vote but if republican leaders decide to bring the shaysmeehan bill to the floor before the petition gathered enough names to compel them to , they would not have to abide by the petition s rules guaranteeing a limited debate

this morning some coaches around the national football league woke up from their two hours of sleep , gulped their caffe latte and broke out the calculators if it s late december , it must be time for playoff possibilities oh , those dizzying and annoying postseason scenarios the quality of the play in the nfl has taken several steps back , mostly because of expansion diluting the talent pool the league has average teams falling apart at the finish line instead of fighting valiantly for a postseason spot in the national football conference , four 78 teams are scrambling for the playoffs this is n't parity so much as it is survival of the least fit which team from that second tier of playoff hopefuls dallas , the giants , carolina and green bay deserves to get in \? none have earned a playoff paycheck but some say that is n't the point if we get in , people are going to say we do n't deserve it , giants safety percy ellsworth said but look around the league there are a lot of mediocre teams does dallas deserve to get in over us \? they lost to new orleans does green bay \? no , they 're not that good does carolina \? does detroit \? a lot of teams are struggling that s just the way the nfl is now even good teams are having problems jacksonville was beaten badly by tennessee on sunday , 4114 , meaning the jaguars have lost to the titans twice this season washington won the nfc east , but was unimpressive against a bad san francisco team on sunday night what does this all mean \? it means pass the coffee and call the math professor afc east indianapolis the colts have clinched the division and a firstround bye they can clinch homefield advantage throughout the playoffs with either a victory at buffalo , a jacksonville loss or tie against cincinnati or by beating the jaguars in net points in conference games they can also clinch homefield advantage with a jacksonville loss and a tennessee loss at pittsburgh the jaguars will probably hold on , barely , and get homefield advantage , but the sprained knee of quarterback mark brunell is making the team nervous he will miss this week s game the colts are still the best team in the conference buffalo with miami s 3831 loss to the jets last night , the bills have clinched a playoff berth the bills are playing fairly well , especially the defense they could be dangerous in the postseason miami the dolphins' loss to the jets was their fifth in seven games but they can still clinch a berth with a victory at washington and either a kansas city loss or tie or a seattle loss or tie , or either a kansas city loss or a seattle loss afc central the most interesting aspect of jacksonville and tennessee making the playoffs is that both will probably meet in a later round the titans have beaten jacksonville twice how will that affect the jaguars' psyche \? afc west seattle the seahawks can clinch the division with either a victory or a kansas city loss or tie they can get into the playoffs with a tie and a miami loss seattle is fragile if the seahawks do get in , and that s probable , they wo n't go far kansas city the chiefs can still make the postseason , and even win the division , but need a lot of help nfc east washington the redskins won probably the weakest division in the nfl offensively , they 're solid dallas if the cowboys beat the giants , they are in but last friday s loss to the saints was one of the most embarrassing for the organization this decade giants at first glance it seems they have a decent chance to get in but that is not so one part of the giants' equation is that they need arizona to beat green bay , but the cardinals are terrible in cold weather , and the game is at lambeau field new york has a 30 percent chance of making it nfc central tampa bay in and dangerous because of a great defense , but with a rookie quarterback in shaun king , it will be difficult to win the conference championship minnesota coach dennis green has done some smart coaching , such as calling for the randy moss pass play to cris carter for a touchdown against the giants they 're in and are the team no one wants to play green has coached the vikings to seven playoff appearances in his eight years as head coach detroit the lions backed into the postseason after three straight losses they are destined to lose in the first round green bay still alive , but the packers are no threat if they get in nfc west st louis the rams have homefield advantage throughout the playoffs and will be almost impossible to beat because they are remarkably fast and all of their playoff games will be on the fast artificial turf carolina long shot to make the playoffs
washington , feb 11 as the fiveweeklong impeachment trial drew to its close , the senate today debated president clinton s fate behind closed doors , certain to acquit him but passionate in condemning the behavior that one democrat said had led to a sordid spectacle with the final verdict set for friday and senators sure that they would not muster the 67 votes that would be required to convict mr clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice , the only question remaining is whether even one of the two articles of impeachment , obstruction of justice , will draw a simple majority the perjury charge against mr clinton appeared virtually guaranteed to draw less than a majority , and it looked likely that the obstruction article , too , could receive fewer than 51 votes perjury will be way under 50 , said senator james m jeffords , republican of vermont , and he predicted that at least five republicans would vote to acquit the president of obstruction of justice the votes on the articles are expected by noon on friday senator richard c shelby , republican of alabama , told colleagues he would vote against the perjury count at least several senators said senator susan collins , republican of maine , had also indicated in the chamber that she would vote to acquit on both counts and senator olympia j snowe of maine became the fourth republican moderate to announce that she would vote to acquit mr clinton on both counts make no mistake about it , ms snowe said in a statement , i find the president s behavior deplorable and indefensible but , she continued , i determined that the only way i could approach this case was to ask myself , 'if i were the deciding vote could i remove this president under these circumstances \? ' the answer , i conclude , is no if none of these republicans waver before the final votes , at least eight republicans would vote against perjury and five against obstruction of justice the democrats , who number 45 to the republicans' 55 in the senate , held their ranks in support of the president today only the judgment of senator robert c byrd of west virginia remained unknown we should be outraged that william jefferson clinton s personal failings debased himself and his office , said senator bob graham , a florida democrat whose final position had been considered uncertain but they did not cause permanent injury to the proper functioning of our government , mr graham said , coming out for acquittal with senators determined to explain their thinking on a vote many considered one of the most significant of their careers , senator trent lott of mississippi , the majority leader , said he expected the final rollcall on guilty or not guilty to come on friday at noon or earlier only a handful of speakers were left for final debate we 've done our duty , mr lott said at an afternoon break we 've done it the constitutionally required way once the senate ends the trial , a certified record of its final judgment is to be submitted to the secretary of state as required under the senate s impeachment rules with a move to censure the president now appearing all but dead , its proponents were working toward a procedural vote on friday , that would demonstrate some bipartisan support for such a rebuke opponents , mostly republicans , said the votes were not there for censure censure s dead , declared senator phil gramm , republican of texas some republicans oppose censure as a bad precedent that could weaken future presidents while others accuse the democrats of only wanting it to gain political cover for their votes to acquit the president because the constitution requires a twothirds vote of the senate to convict a president , mr clinton will be acquitted on friday whether or not a mere majority votes against him on either article but the numbers are politically significant for how the impeachment effort is likely to be ultimately judged opponents of conviction from both parties said that if house prosecutors failed to win 51 votes on either charge against mr clinton , it would signal that they had been too zealous in pursuing a case that had not won bipartisan backing or public support i think it sends a very loud message to the house of representatives , said senator tim johnson , democrat of south dakota do n't ever , ever , send to the senate again articles of impeachment that are this weak and partisan mr jeffords , who said he would vote to acquit mr clinton on both articles , said he wished the house had recognized that a proposal floated by former presidents gerald r ford and jimmy carter to censure mr clinton had been a pretty good idea senator christopher j dodd , democrat of connecticut , scoffed at the vote counting , saying if republicans think they can celebrate because it s 50 and democrats can celebrate at 49 , then i 've missed something this does not have great value outside the senate chamber , the day s solemn mood was somewhat tarnished by reports that mr clinton planned an allout drive to help democrats win back the house in 2000 and topple the republicans who had voted to impeach him the vote was largely along party lines it is deeply troubling that the president views closure of this constitutional process as an opportunity for revenge , mr lott said in a statement

if ever there was a neighborhood to inspire a fashion crisis , it s the meatpacking district between leather bars and honkytonks , rockandroll grottos and techno dens , it is nearly impossible to find a single outfit that will please everybody doormanguarded establishments like fressen and oriont are looking for signs of disposable income and designer labels but you 've got to be careful wear a tie to hogs and heifers , and they 'll cut it off around the corner , at the cozy dance hall baktun , revelers might prefer club attire \( boys dress baggy , girls dress tight \) but next door , at the music club the cooler , many listeners sport a kind of secondgeneration grunge look , complete with tshirts , goatees and facefuls of studied apathy and then there is mother , where on a recent saturday night i was warned in no uncertain terms that if i was n't in black all black , headtotoe black , as the organizers said i would n't be getting in to click drag , a weekly cyberfetish party \( more on this later \) they were n't kidding a friend dressed in dark gray recently spent an hour arguing his case on the sidewalk and never made it past the velvet ropes but such are the sacrifices , sartorial and otherwise , gladly suffered by visitors to the meatpacking district , currently home to some of manhattan s most eclectic and electric night life in less time than it takes to take a company public , this redblooded , bluecollar neighborhood has become the city s it social scene , with enough new restaurants , chic bars and smoky clubs to occupy even the flimsiest of attention spans that s not to say it s userfriendly many of the area s establishments are tucked away , without signs or outside windows , on streets that , it should be noted , are often slick with animal grease and its attendant odors depending on when you catch it , any given block can be dark , deserted or downright putrid i do n't particularly like tripping over meat carcasses , said eugenie hanmer , 26 , a fashion stylist from britain , who was seen at oriont recently but this is really what the city s about , is n't it \? that rawness and thrill of discovery , visitors say , gives the neighborhood much of its appeal , especially as places like the east village and soho have become gentrified , and the city s night life has become more sanitized food and drink run the gamut , from the polite french sensibility of le gans to the brazen booziness of the village idiot , whose rotund owner is prone to biting the heart out of beer cans and bearhugging patrons there is also a distinctly catchall aspect to the area geeks , jocks , metalheads , suburbanites , urbanites , gays , straights and bicurious all have a place to go , as do artists and musicians , hepcats and hipsters , punks and preppies heck , even cyberfetishists can get their clicks in the meatpacking district that diversity is all the more impressive when you consider that this is packed into an area roughly the size of washington square park bounded on the east by ninth avenue and on the west by the hudson river , the meatpacking district is only four blocks deep , running from west 14th street to gansevoort street until the early 1990 s this was almost exclusively the domain of overnight laborers , primarily the beefandpoultry movers who gave the area its name , and the transvestite prostitutes who gave it its seedy reputation nowadays those oldtimers are giving way , taking with them , say some resident meatheads , the area s reputation as the last gritty outpost below 14th street i knew it was going to happen , just not this quickly , said mick mcgee , the longtime manager of the bar hogs and heifers this is the last neighborhood it s the last frontier it s a frontier that is rapidly being settled a new restaurant from keith mcnally , the owner of balthazar , is under construction at the corner of little west 12th street and ninth avenue , within sight of graffiti reading disgusted with commerciali \( s \) m swank condos have already risen along the western end of 14th street , and recent zoning changes allowing for new buildings as high as 12 stories may be an indication of things to come already the street s galleries are side by side by side , as one resident put it still , this remains a neighborhood very much in flux claimed by many groups , owned by none and while partiers may rule the weekends , the wholesale meatpackers still crowd the streets till dawn during the week then again , on a sunday afternoon , when the sun streams over the low buildings and brick streets , the area can seem remarkably sleepy , as still as the dust inside of the abandoned meat warehouses on 10th avenue apetizers alfresco it could take a week to experience the two dozen bars and restaurants here , not to mention the spacious new shopping emporiums like jeffrey new york , where pellegrino evening bags barely big enough for a pork chop go for 395 i opted instead for a party platter , trying some of the old and some of the new , or as much as my appetite would allow in one weekend and like my limited wardrobe , coordinating it all would prove to be the biggest challenge

lexington , mass across the street from first parish church lies this town s historic green , where the clash between colonial militiamen and british soldiers 224 years ago ignited the upheaval that led to american independence on may 23 , within the picturesque church , a symbolic moment in a revolution of a cultural kind will take place in this community just west of boston rebecca cohen will be ordained a minister in the unitarian universalist church that her mother , the rev helen lutton cohen , serves as pastor afterward , the younger ms cohen will seek her own pulpit in the small unitarian universalist association , which has about 200 , 000 members for one generation in a family to follow another into the ministry is an old story , which can be told with reference to men like cotton mather , jonathan edwards and martin luther king jr , sons following their fathers but for a daughter to follow her mother in this way represents a new trend emerging in american religion , and striking evidence that the movement of women into positions of religious authority is entering its second generation it feels like a huge wave swept over , helen cohen said recently of the influx of women into the ministry since she undertook theological studies two decades ago statistics suggest that the wave is still building the number of women studying in christian seminaries for a master of divinity degree increased eightfold since 1972 , to 8 , 203 students in 1997 , the last year for which figures are available among denominations , the episcopal church did not ordain women as priests until 1977 but now women make up nearly 1 in 7 of its clergy members they also make up about 1 in 6 pastors in the evangelical lutheran church in america , formed from the merger of three churches , none of which ordained women before 1970 the jewish theological seminary s rabbinical school , which serves judaism s conservative movement , graduated only men until 1986 women now make up onethird of its enrollment reform jews ordained their first woman in 1972 since then , 29 percent of those ordained for the reform rabbinate have been women \( a proportion that has risen to 45 percent in the 1990 s \) but it is within the unitarian universalist association , historically the nation s most liberal religious body , that the process has moved the furthest the association will soon announce that for the first time , women outnumber men among its active clergy members , making up 51 percent of the total , up from fewer than 3 percent in 1968 the changes reflect feminism s influence on organized religion , a process that has had visually arresting moments until last year , the world s anglican bishops gathered as an entirely male body in their onceadecade lambeth conference but when they met in july 1998 in canterbury , england , the bishops included 11 women , who gathered for a group photograph on a sunny hillside with cathedral spires in the distance but the entry of women into leadership positions has also sharpened differences among religious groups women s ordination separates mainline protestant denominations from many of the evangelical churches , and from the roman catholic and the eastern orthodox churches , whose priesthoods are restricted to men women serving as rabbis are a dividing line between orthodox jews , which do not allow them , and the reform , reconstructionist and conservative movements in the denominations that ordain them , women still encounter significant barriers a recent survey of female clergy members in 15 denominations found women to be paid less on average than men , even when the levels of education and experience were similar adair lummis , a professor of the sociology of religion at the hartford seminary and a coauthor of the study women clergy an uphill calling \( westminster john knox , 1998 \) , said of the better positions , i still think men are being called more than women i mean , the bigger churches with the higher salaries another expert , paula d nesbitt , director of the carl m williams institute for ethics and values at the university of denver , said that while some women had reached senior church positions , others had found openings only in parttime or associatelevel jobs my concern is for fulltime , viable employment , said ms nesbitt , the author of the feminization of the clergy in america \( oxford , 1997 \) still , she said , she expected the new generation of ordained women to find inspiration in those who had attained prominent positions when discussing their paths to the ministry , helen cohen , 56 , and rebecca cohen , 27 , speak from the perspectives of different generations as an adolescent in a unitarian congregation in cincinnati in the 1950 s , a congregation with a male pastor , helen cohen felt that she wanted to be a minister but the idea seemed unthinkable , she said , and she told no one instead , she embarked on an academic career , obtaining a doctorate in old english literature and teaching , until she left to devote herself to rearing the two daughters she had with her husband , don , a business writer she also became involved in a small unitarian congregation , which rekindled her old sense of calling i did n't see a woman minister until i was 34 , she said , when she had one as a professor at the harvard divinity school after graduating in 1980 , she was hired by the lexington church , its first female pastor in a succession of ministers stretching back to 1691 , among them john hancock , whose grandson and namesake signed the declaration of independence ms cohen was also 1 of only 2 women in the 20member lexington clergy association , an interfaith body \( its membership is now onethird female and she is president \) her daughter s experience has been different when i was growing up , most of the ministers i knew were women , rebecca cohen said i never had to wonder , could women be ministers \? her challenge , she said , came when members of first parish asked her whether she planned to follow in her mother s footsteps she said no but she found the ministry attractive , long before she entered the meadvillelombard theological school , in chicago part of it was how fulfilling it seemed to be for mom , she said watching her , it seemed like important work only recently , she said , did she learn that her mother had felt that it was a struggle to be among the first generation of women in church leadership for her part , helen cohen said she has sometimes wrestled with the question of when she , as a woman , should speak up and how loudly she confessed to feeling some envy , and satisfaction , at her daughter s sense of assurance about the roles open to women rebecca cohen s ordination service will include a traditional feature , when a senior clergy member offers her a handclasp , the right hand of fellowship , signaling her entry into the community of ordained ministers daughter asked mother to take that part she has been my main model and inspiration , rebecca cohen said and i have felt very welcomed into the ministry by her photos rebecca cohen , in the tradition of her mother , will be ordained in the unitarian universalist church , in which women clergy outnumber men \( cynthia howe for the new york times \) the rev helen lutton cohen s daughter will become a

if east enders have the impression that they are in their own little world out there , this time they may be right while the rest of the country is enjoying gasoline prices that , adjusted for inflation , are the lowest since the 1950 s , on the east end prices are among the highest in the nation state assemblyman fred w thiele jr , republican of sag harbor , said so many people on the east end have complained to him about the prices that he has asked the state consumer protection board to investigate the national average retail price for regular unleaded gasoline is about 935 cents a gallon and has been steadily declining for three months , according to the department of energy on the island , the average price in nassau county is 106 , while suffolk county s average is 109 but mr thiele has found that prices are from 15 to 20 cents per gallon higher in the five east end towns of riverhead , southampton , easthampton , shelter island , and southold those lofty prices can be found consistently in only one other place in the continental united states california , mainly around san francisco , where the lundberg survey , a california company that tracks gasoline prices , says the average price is 120 a gallon the cost of living here is high , but it s not enough in my mind to justify differences of what may be as much as 35 cents a gallon , mr thiele said people have a right to know why their gas is so expensive good luck finding out a mobil station in southampton is selling regular gasoline for 119 a gallon in bridgehampton , a bp station is selling it for 129 , and it s 125 at a sag harbor getty station none of the east end gasoline stations contacted for this article would comment about their prices mobil oil , which has several stations on the east end , would n't explain the higher prices except to say that they are affected by real estate costs , taxes , salaries , transportation of gas from terminals , and competitive conditions in the area duncan mackenzie , a spokesman for the new york state petroleum council , a trade association representing the major oil companies and a division of the american petroleum institute in washington , said local gas prices were indicative of the cost of living for each area it s unfair to single out gasoline , mr mackenzie said all consumer goods in that area are going to be higher consumers have a much simplier explanation they 're really milking the public , said robert callendar of southampton , who has complained to mr thiele about the prices it s always been this way and there s no business logic for it mr thiele said that major oil companies may be operating under the impression that east end residents are affluent and can pay more we know that the median income on the east end of long island is lower than the rest of long island , he said tim ryan , a spokesman for suffolk county executive robert gaffney , said east end prices were in some cases lower than western suffolk , pointing to a survey completed last month by the suffolk county executive s office of consumer affairs of 52 retail gasoline stations in suffolk if we 're talking about the five east end towns being higher than the rest of the county , that s simply not true , mr ryan said , referring to a consumer affairs survey of gasoline prices the new york and long island region are subject to federal epa regulations requiring an additional process called reformulation , by which gas is made to burn cleaner , according to steve lafever , a spokesman for the state consumer protection board the reformulation process is required because of poor air quality in the region , adding to cost of retail gasoline prices , he said however , mr ryan said the reformulation regulations apply to the entire region , not just to the east end , so they affect prices equally there is absolutely no correlation between any environmental rules and prices on the east end he said everything just costs more on the east end although the consumer board can investigate the pricing , it has no enforcement powers but the state attorney general does , who mr thiele also plans to notify scott brown , a spokesman for the attorney general s office , said it could only act if there was evidence that stations were colluding on prices , and no one is accusing gas dealers of that otherwise , there is little the attorney general can do i think there s a lack of competition here , but to me , there s an element of gouging in that , mr thiele said if you 're charging higher prices just simply because you think you can get away with it , that s unfair federal and state taxes account for about 50 cents per gallon of retail gas prices , but there is no standard markup for gas dealers , mr mackenzie said if they want to charge 5 a gallon and they can get it , that s their prerogative , he said ed lincoln , assistant manager at the southampton mobile station on route 27 , agrees that gasoline prices on the east end average 20 cents higher , but said he could not explain why once you pass the shinnecock canal , there are higher prices , he said i do n't know why people are commenting , but not complaining we 're selling a lot of gas , so we must be doing something right photo a getty station on route 27 in east hampton was selling regular unleaded gasoline for 129 a gallon , 20 cents above the average in suffolk county \( chris maynard for the new york times \)

philadelphia ask a philadelphian to name the most beloved building in the city , and chances are , the answer will be the academy of music an elegant brick edifice on broad street , the academy opened in 1857 and is the oldest continuously operating music hall in the united states it has a passionate following among music lovers , many of whom regard it as virtually synonymous with its oldest resident company and landlord , the philadelphia orchestra yet love can be blind , or in this case , deaf the hall s acoustics are poor , at least for orchestral music built as an opera house , the academy has a proscenium arch that traps the sound , which comes across in the auditorium as dry as a result , said peter dobrin , a music critic for the philadelphia inquirer , philadelphians have never really heard the philadelphia orchestra he is not the first to notice an emphatic article in a newspaper here stated that the philadelphia orchestra , the only major american ensemble to play on a proscenium stage , should have a proper hall of its own that was in 1908 successive generations have taken up the cry plans for a new hall were drawn up during the music directorships of leopold stokowski , eugene ormandy , riccardo muti and now wolfgang sawallisch finally , a plan may be realized ground was broken last november for a new regional performing arts center , with a 2 , 500seat symphony hall and a 650seat recital theater , scheduled to open in 2001 the current project has also served to spotlight some of the orchestra s difficulties as it approaches its centenary season and tries to keep pace with the modern world in fact , the center , in its final form , is not an orchestra project at all the philadelphia orchestra will move into its new home as a tenant , not a landlord and the orchestra was ultimately glad to be rid of the responsibility the question remains whether the center s new administration , will be able to repeat the success of other performing arts centers , from lincoln center in the 1960 s to the new jersey performing arts center more recently , in revitalizing the community none of this was quite what the orchestra had in mind when it announced plans for a new hall in 1986 it purchased a site on broad street , a block south of the academy , and commissioned the philadelphiabased architect robert venturi to design the building , assuming that philadelphians would flock to donate the 140 million needed to realize the project but fundraising efforts , marred by a degree of hubris , soon slowed we raised 25 million and hit a plateau , said joseph h kluger , who has since become the orchestra s president there was a latent emotional resistance from those attached to the idea of the academy and the orchestra in it among them were the leading philanthropists walter h annenberg and r anderson pew , who also sat on the orchestra s board the annenberg foundation refused to give any money to the new hall project , and the pew charitable trusts offered 15 million , which the orchestra undiplomatically rejected as being too low indeed , mr pew and mr annenberg did have funds for another project , proposed in 1994 a thorough overhaul of the academy , at a projected cost of 44 million renovation was certainly overdue the building s technical facilities were outdated , and its very structure proved increasingly unsound yet the renovation initially planned was so hightech that it would have compromised the building s architectural integrity the unspoken goal was to turn the academy into such a modern hall that the orchestra would have no reason to leave the pew trust chipped in 75 million and the annenberg foundation 10 million for the project the renovation is still in progress , although the plan was ultimately scaled down to focus on restoring , rather than transforming , the academy , to the tune of 31 million plans for a new hall , meanwhile , seemed to have ground to a halt the orchestra was having problems of its own , culminating in a debilitating 64day strike in 1996 the strike ended with both sides working on constructive changes , like instituting a range of players' committees to give musicians a more active role in the orchestra s business life at that point , philadelphia s colorful , charismatic mayor , edward g rendell , assumed a major role since taking office in 1991 , mr rendell has overseen the transformation of a sleepy philadelphia , a conservative city that abhorred change , into a more active place center city , as the downtown area is called , is dotted with construction sites , including 15 new hotels to accommodate visitors to the fiveyearold convention center all of this has bolstered the city s morale , and both mr rendell and willard g rouse , the developer responsible for the convention center and other major buildings , enjoy widespread popularity one of mr rendell s pet projects is the avenue of the arts , which has basically redefined south broad street by developing its theaters and other arts facilities mr rendell is motivated less by a great love of the arts he prefers sports than by his idea of the changing definition of a city in today s world no longer a necessary hub of commerce and industry , in an age of telecommunications , which have effectively decentralized business activity , but a destination , a place for tourism

calcutta , india this great and grotesque city has been called many things , some of them not so nice to kipling , calcutta was the city of dreadful night and while such a literary moniker may have seemed acceptably poetic to calcutta s storied intellectuals , there is one name they will no longer tolerate calcutta is never again to be called calcutta a determined clique of the intelligentsia recently proposed that the city henceforth be known in english as kolkata , which is how the name is pronounced in the bengali language in july , the west bengal state assembly unanimously agreed our city is pronounced in two ways , and i prefer it to be one , and if it is one , why not in the language of the local population \? said badhan das , a wellknown sculptor to many , this may all seem so much silly and unnecessary tampering , the way some dutch undoubtedly regard the changing of new amsterdam to new york but in india , the changing of various municipal names has become a matter of postcolonial pride a current map , if made here , will have mumbai but not bombay , chennai but not madras , kochi but not cochin , thiruvananthapuram but not trivandrum the new names are slowly overtaking the old in common usage india , far more than america , is an amalgam its billion people speak in 17 major languages and more than 22 , 000 distinct dialects many here resent the evercreeping influence of english , the mother tongue of british imperialists and satellite television , and hindi , the language of the big shots in new delhi and most of the indian cinema bengalis argue that the name calcutta was certainly none of their ancestors' doing while its origin is a matter of some dispute , it was most likely coined by marblemouthed english overlords who could not get their tongues around kolikata , the name of a village near where the british laid anchor 300 years ago in a malarial swamp whatever its derivation , calcutta has become one of the world s most evocative of names , a threesyllable conjurer of images that takes the mind by handpulled rickshaw from glorious whitecolumned country clubs into the path of wretched onelegged beggars to bengali intellectuals , of course , the city is so much more than that indeed , to them , calcutta has the wondrous and unrivaled virtue of being home to the bengali intellectual himself by culture and selfassessment a person of superior brainpower and spirit , adept at debating all the isms and wasms of political thought he is the indian who effortlessly quotes marx and marcuse and mcluhan , all the while sipping coffee and scribbling poems on a paper napkin and he has yet to tire of sharing credit for the nobel prize in literature awarded to the bengali poet rabindranath tagore in 1913 we bengalis have set the standard in all the arts , said sunil gangopadhyay , an admired poet and novelist we are an emotional people we love to create and we love to talk some would say we talk too much whenever two or three people get together , they stop all work and begin talking for hours buddhadey bhattacharya , a playwright and the home minister for the state s communist government , is similarly boastful intellectually , i humbly proclaim we are more advanced than anyone else , he said , smoking imported cigarettes , with a portrait of lenin hanging behind him we discuss the great questions what is postmodernism \? what does noam chomsky have to say about this or that \? to the bengali intellectual s ear , however , too little of the city s incessant talk is now being done in the mellifluous , cultured bengali language so many outsiders have poured into calcutta in recent decades that only half of its 11 million citizens are bengali most advertisements and store names are written in those two interloping tongues , english and hindi mr gangopadhyay , who writes in bengali , heads a movement that wants to hold down this linguistic trespassing the city s name change is just an opening gesture there are also demands that bengali be made a mandatory subject in elementary schools , that television stations broadcast more shows in the language , that every worker who serves the public from bureaucrats to shopkeepers speak some asyetunspecified minimum of phrases to some here , bengalis and nonbengalis among them , this business of changing names seems born less from affection for a language and more from resistance to the handwriting on the wall that the bengali is on the down slope in his own backyard this comes from fear of marginalization , said chittabaram panda , the curator at victoria memorial hall museum calcutta or kolkata , who cares \? bengalis are trying to recover with symbols what they have lost in so many other ways it used to be said that what bengalis think today , the rest of india will think tomorrow but that adage has long been passe the names of bengali authors no longer sit on the tip of the indian tongue and bengali political thought is widely seen as something to be denigrated rather than emulated after 22 years of communist rule , the state has pursued a utopia for its workers only to end up frightening off the employers who hire them marwari businessmen , with roots in the state of rajasthan , dominate commerce here and they , and others , frequently regard the bengali worker as someone who likes to come in late , go home early and devote the hours in between to extraneous chatter if there are 10 bengalis , there will be 11 opinions , said b g gupta , a retired bureaucrat originally from uttar pradesh the bengali may have no food on the table , but he s off arguing somewhere about the vietnam war or the last book he has read or whether it is a good idea to change every signboard in the city from calcutta to kolkata the official change of the name still awaits approval from the indian government s home ministry a second planned alteration , changing the state s name from west bengal to bangla , will require a vote by parliament soon , i assure you , we will be kolkata , and this will be how the world will know us , mr bhattacharya said it is what we want and it is inevitable these days , does anyone have the guts to say peking instead of beijing \?

traverse city , mich , aug 7 cherry trees , like wealthy vacationers , are choosy about where they will put down roots they prefer the high ground , where warm air rises to protect their springtime buds from late frosts because they hate having wet feet , they favor sandy soil where water can drain quickly from their roots so they have settled on the scenic rises here in northern michigan , where they stand 20 feet apart in acre after acre of orchards , like soldiers massing across hills but they are losing the war to people who covet their land cherry orchards and other scenic land along the northwest michigan shore is definitely under pressure for development into housing , said daniel j wyant , director of the michigan department of agriculture people and cherries prefer the same rolling hills and lake views michigan , with 312 million bearingage cherry trees , grows more cherries than any other state but 30 , 000 cherry trees were taken out last year alone , most of them yanked out by their roots to make room for retirement or vacation homes the welloff who live in the midwest have summered in this region for a century , and even now , people from factory workers to auto executives have dachas here on lake michigan or around the many sparkling inland lakes nearby they like the relaxed routine , where farmers at roadside stands charge 250 for a bag of fresh cherries that will stain fingertips red in minutes by now , they have filled in most of the shoreline with cottages , and summer homes have begun crawling up the hills here in view of the lakes one of the most sublime spots is old mission peninsula , a long stretch of land poking up into lake michigan s grand traverse bay , so skinny in parts that from high ground there is a view of water on both sides for years , that peninsula had the state s largest concentration of cherry trees , but not anymore a presbyterian missionary who settled in michigan in 1839 brought the first cherry trees to the state from europe , and he started planting them on the peninsula by 1845 the cherry farmers on the old mission peninsula were wooed by the real estate developers , and a lot of the prime cherry orchards that sat on the high ground overlooking both bays were sold and have been developed into residential areas , said m ann hoopfer , 53 , the director of the local history museum here , who grew up on a cherry farm some cherry farmers embrace the changes , some are ambivalent and some are reluctant to abandon the way of life their families have known for more than 100 years standing on a hill on the peninsula with a breathtaking lake view , a farmerturnedrealtor , robert l underwood , 61 , watched a halfmilliondollar house rising where a cherry orchard once stood and defended his decision to sell his farm with more than 25 , 000 cherry trees to help develop 89 vacation homes here there s a perception that farmers or developers are just raping the land to make money , mr underwood said you have to look at the opportunity to provide the people with a nice place to live nice indeed each has a view of the lake , and prices range from 350 , 000 to 750 , 000 a silver mercedes glided by one lot , where owners are building a tennis court that can be flooded in winter to make an ice rink somehow or other , people forget that farmers are businessmen , mr underwood said his three children have not followed him into farming , and he is glad northern michigan has boomed and provided jobs for them if it was not for growth in this area , he said , my kids would not be able to live here they 'd be down in chicago or in new york city other longtime farmers are concerned that too many orchards are disappearing about 10 miles south of mr underwood , state senator george a mcmanus grew enough cherries on his 400acre farm this summer to fill about a million pies he is so concerned that farms are giving way to houses that he has held eight hearings across the state , where more than 250 people have testified about the plight of farmers and how the land should be used michigan grows about threequarters of the nation s cherries , and leads the nation s production of tart cherries , the kind used in baking the michigan agricultural statistics service estimates that this year the tart cherry harvest will reach 192 million pounds , about 20 percent below the fiveyear average the smaller sweet cherry harvest is expected to be up 7 percent martha m jamieson , 63 , has 70 acres of cherries on old mission peninsula , but half of her land is for sale i feel like i should n't sell it , said mrs jamieson , who farmed the land with her husband until he died four years ago i'm farming alone and it has been tough it is n't just farmers who are wistful taxpayers on the peninsula voted to spend nearly 7 million to buy the development rights to about 3 , 300 acres of cherry orchards , preserving open views of lake michigan but that is a small chunk of the cherry orchards here , and the taxpayers' preservation money has been spent gary d warren , 48 , said that his family had grown cherries for 134 years , but that none of his six children wanted to gamble on cherry farming selling out to developers is always in the back of your mind after a bad year like this , mr warren said even mr mcmanus , sitting at his kitchen table with a plateful of cherry cookies , has no illusion that his children will follow him into farming but he still believes that the cherry farm will provide for their future if they sell the land to developers we have one subdivision going in at one end of the farm and another subdivision going in at the other end of the farm , he said , so they wo n't have any problem map of michigan shows location of traverse city
amarillo , tex , jan 5 on the very cold morning of sept 7 , 1804 , meriwether lewis and william clark climbed to the domed top of a 70foot nebraska mound overlooking the missouri river , where they discovered a village of small animals , their journal records in their travels all the way to the rocky mountains , they saw millions of the little yapping things , which they first called ground rats , then barking squirrels and eventually prairie dogs almost two centuries later , seated behind the battered metal desk in his office on old route 66 just west of amarillo , george carlisle , an exterminator who has been fumigating grain and poisoning prairie dogs for more than 40 years , rolled a small gray disk of aluminum phosphide between his thumb and forefinger what we do , you see , is we take three or four of these and we just chunk 'em down a prairie dog hole and then cover it up with dirt or crumpled newspaper , he said they 'll sit down there and the moisture will cause them to give off the poison prairie dogs are cute , but they 're a nuisance they eat up the grass , create all these holes that livestock can step in , carry disease almost any day now , the united states fish and wildlife service will announce , in response to a petition from the national wildlife federation , whether it sees sufficient cause for a ninemonth study to decide if blacktailed prairie dogs , whose numbers once ran into the billions , should be listed as a threatened species that designation would provide them with protection on public land and give the government some power to protect them on private lands people either hate these animals or they love them , kevin mote , a texas state biologist in lubbock , said of the prairie dog i happen to work with those who love them but it s probably the most controversial conservation issue that we have in this state to many private landowners especially in places , like the texas cattle country , where the governing ethos is do n't tell me what to do with my land prairie dogs are more numerous than the trees and are regarded as nothing but pests the notion of declaring such creatures threatened , and giving the government another lever to dictate the use of private land , is greeted by most ranchers and farmers with the same sort of incredulity that might greet declaring cockroaches a threatened species in new york these days , the prairie dog has few friends out there on the prairie , and many enemies , said thomas france , chief counsel for the national wildlife federation conservationists say two centuries of human encroachment have brought the species close to a crisis urban and agricultural growth have cut their habitat , once more than 100 million acres scattered between the dakotas and the escarpments of central texas , by more than 99 percent , down to an estimated 700 , 000 acres individual prairie dog villages , which once covered as much as 100 miles and had more than a million residents , have become small , isolated and endangered none of the states that are home to prairie dogs have a policy to protect them , though each has policies regarding their control or extermination hunters can shoot as many prairie dogs as they like , and routinely use them for target practice there are still considerable populations of blacktailed prairie dogs in montana , south dakota and wyoming but in other places , including kansas , colorado , nebraska , oklahoma , texas and new mexico , their numbers have dropped sharply in arizona , they are extinct there is no doubt that the prairie dog does need some additional conservation , said tim heron , a spokesman for the texas parks and wildlife department but , he and others ask , does that mean they need federal protection \? these animals are a serious hazard to agriculture and potentially human health , because of the danger of a cowboy s horse stepping into one of these holes and breaking a leg , said state senator teel bivins of texas they eat the grass , nub it down to nothing , which takes food away from livestock and during droughts , like this summer , they can actually kill the plant conservationists say such fears are based on misunderstanding the impacts to ranching are not supported by science , and the kind of poisoning campaigns that are conducted are based on myth and anecdotal information , mr france said despite the oftrepeated warning that livestock and horses might step into a prairie dog hole and break a leg or throw a rider , conservationists say , there is not one verified incident of that ever happening and while prairie dogs do eat grass , no study has ever concluded that their consumption has any effect on livestock of particular concern , mr france said , is that entire miniecosystems are built around prairie dogs the holes in prairie dog villages provide shelter for rabbits , snakes , salamanders and other creatures and the animals themselves provide food for numerous predators , including the bald eagle and the blackfooted ferret , an endangered species the wildlife federation filed its petition last summer , asking the fish and wildlife service to issue an emergency declaration putting prairie dogs on the threatened list specifically , the federation wanted a moratorium on poisoning and hunting prairie dogs on public land , plus some sort of governmental oversight on private land in september , the federal government declined the request for an emergency declaration , but it agreed to a 90day review to decide whether the ninemonth study should be conducted the 90 days were up in late november conservationists said they expected a ruling fairly soon , probably in february the delay , they said , is probably due to a desire to make the decision as scientifically sound as possible i think certainly the fish and wildlife service regards this as a sensitive petition , mr france said if they do n't have a firm position , carefully thought out , the politics of the situation will overrun them some state officials are hoping to forestall federal protection of the prairie dogs by creating a voluntary regional plan to conserve them our hope is that we can develop a regional conservation plan as opposed to a listing of the species as endangered or threatened , state senator bivins said i personally think that the endangered species act is rife with problems and real unenforceability in many instances , there are serious policy questions about who is god here is it the us congress or is it a higher power \? a compromise plan might involve strict management of prairie dogs on public lands and something more voluntary on private lands in the meantime , many state officials and landowners are waiting to see what happens some ranchers who were contacted said they did not want to go on the record acknowledging the presence of prairie dogs on their land because they feared becoming a target for regulators we 're kind of in a no man s land regarding regulations or no regulations , said mr mote , the state biologist so for the moment it s still business as usual , poison at will photo a prairie dog at the fence that protects its habitat in the wichita mountains wildlife refuge in oklahoma \( associated press \) map shows the range of the prairie dog the historic range of prairie dogs extended from canada to mexico
he can barely bend his legs , and his neck hurts , too it s 98 degrees , he has just come from practice , and peter warrick is n't feeling well he plops into a couch in the lobby of florida state s moore athletic center in tallahassee a room ringed with the retired jerseys of seminole greats as he sits down , the back of his head bangs against the concrete wall crack ! meet your heisman trophy frontrunner the usually nimble wide receiver laughs , but ca n't hide a wince then he tries to explain a day last january when national football league executives , agents , even some of his coaches , thought he must have fallen and hit his head he had called a news conference in this building to announce what \? that he was entering the nfl draft \? he was a certain top 10 pick , he had a 2yearold daughter , a'lyric , and a jersey destined for the wall of fame but warrick did not know what to do he paced he prayed with strength coach dave van halanger i did n't know what i would do until it came out of my mouth , warrick said once i said i was going to stay , a peace came over me warrick , a native of bradenton , fla , added this state is my home this place is my family i do n't know what it is , but florida state has a powerful pull on me i figured i could delay sitting in a hotel room in cleveland or detroit for another year his impulsive decision means the seminoles begin this college football season as the favorite to win the national title its logic , however , means more and is reflected in the hometown category on the rosters of the sunshine state s three powers of the 272 players listed on this season s programs for florida state , florida and miami , 175 nearly twothirds come from within the state they grew up near its south beaches , on its gulf coast , in the central horse country or along the panhandle they played football under palm trees or near swamps they are talented , and they win let s see , you got the weather , the outdoors to run in , reasoned florida state coach bobby bowden , who is an alabamian this state s so dadgum big , so there s a lot of boys they have passion for football and mostly , i do n't think they like to leave their mamas i do n't know how scientific you need to get we got a lot of good football players in this state and we try to keep them here if pennsylvania forged its football tradition from the sons of coal miners and steelworkers , and texas honors its history beneath the friday night lights of high school football , floridians celebrate their football blessings each week when the national college rankings are released by keeping florida s ample talent at home in the nation s fourthmost populous state , the seminoles , gators and hurricanes have combined to win 273 football games in the 1990 s each school has won a national title during that period year in and year out , the teams play rigorous schedules that insure they will have a say in who plays for the national championship this year is no different the seminoles are the consensus pick to reach the national title game in the sugar bowl on jan 4 to do so , they will have to beat the hated gators on the road and the hurricanes at home florida also is thinking about new orleans and the title game the gators get tennessee , the defending national champion , at home in the third week of the season and might very well be unbeaten when they face florida state on the last weekend of the regular season finally , there is miami in the 1980 s the hurricanes captured three national titles , but they spent the last three years on probation for major violations that took place while jimmy johnson and dennis erickson were coaching them the sanctions cost the team 24 scholarships in 1996 and '97 , but now the hurricanes are back at full strength and intent on recapturing their form if they do n't make it to the sugar bowl , they want to handpick the team that does they have that opportunity today in the kickoff classic against ohio state , on sept 18 against penn state and again on oct 9 against florida state when the road to a national championship winds annually through florida , it tends to make its coaches and homegrown players alternately good , bad and ugly , but always downright cocky florida state a certain air of invincibility the seminoles have won 10 or more games in 12 consecutive seasons , have posted a 102 bowl record and have never finished the season ranked lower than no 4 in the associated press poll during that span but florida state has brought only one national championship back to tallahassee , in 1993 bowden , warrick the whole team had banked on winning their second last year in the fiesta bowl against tennessee even with his team down by 239 with six minutes left and the backup quarterback marcus outzen having a miserable night , bowden was certain his team was going to win it s got to break open for us sooner or later , bowden remembered thinking he explained , it s the way we believe around here
if there is one thing political observers should have learned in the 90 s , it s to never underestimate the talent republicans have for squandering a big advantage george herbert walker bush was invincible after the triumph of the persian gulf war and yet there was bill clinton , only recently escaped from the gennifer flowers scandal , being sworn in as president on jan 20 , 1993 in 1994 the republicans won control of both houses of congress for the first time in 40 years but newt gingrich and his gang behaved like the leaders of a thuggish revolution rather than the winners of an election they misread the public they shut down the government the advantage shifted back to the wily mr clinton now the republicans have a presidential candidate in george w bush who is on an early roll he may have stumbled once or twice over the kosovoians and the grecians , but he accumulates cash with astonishing quickness , and he s far ahead in the polls if the election were held today , he would win the republicans should be delighted but the radicals are restless a page 1 headline in the times on tuesday said gop s right talks of bolting faithless party the story , by richard l berke , began many politically active conservatives say they are increasingly frustrated and distressed by the early dominance of george w bush in the republican presidential race they accuse their party of sacrificing principle in the name of pragmatism , prompting some to talk of mounting a thirdparty campaign george w is not conservative enough for these folks they 're looking for a lunatic and they 'd rather lose than settle for anything less the republican party is already right wing it s already the party of the megacorporations and the ultra rich it s already the party that opposed a tiny increase of 90 cents in the minimum wage and that tried to eliminate federal nutrition standards for school meals one can only hope the extremists follow through on their threat of a thirdparty challenge anyone interested in what the gop has been up to lately should take a look at the senate for more than a week the republicans and the democrats were locked in a nasty fight over proposals to give patients certain new health care guarantees quick , which party was in favor of substantially strengthening patients' rights and which was on the side of the insurance companies and the health maintenance organizations \? i hope that was n't too tough the immediate fight was not over the merits of the legislation , but over the republican majority s refusal until tuesday night to even allow debate on a series of democratic proposals aimed at curbing abuses by insurance companies and hmo s there is strong support among the public and among health care professionals for the democratic proposals , known as the patients' bill of rights the republicans have offered much weaker legislation and have not been anxious to permit a public airing of the differences virtually all leading patient and medical groups have supported the democratic proposal senator tom daschle s proposal , said senator edward kennedy on the senate floor on monday these groups do not care whether democrats or republicans are on a piece of legislation they just want a strong bill and virtually every single leading medical group in our country supports ours none supports theirs a few days ago i spoke by phone with steve grissom of cary , nc he is 50 years old and suffers from leukemia and aids , which he contracted through a blood transfusion mr grissom is locked in a harrowing dispute with his insurance providers over payment for medical equipment and a continuing supply of oxygen that could determine whether he lives or dies said mr grissom i 've been a republican all my life i do n't think i 've ever missed a vote now is the first time in my life that i 've considered changing my party affiliation , because i see a real lack of compassion in the republican party they 're hearing from the hmo s and they 're hearing from the lobbyists with their fat checkbooks , and they 're not hearing from people like me who are in desperate need of this kind of consumer protection

flowers in the dustbin the rise of rock and roll , 19471977 by james miller illustrated 415 pp new york simon schuster 26 now everyone is to do 'his thing' and thus we are enlightened by lengthy studies of the ethos of the beatles , irving howe wrote sardonically in his essay the new york intellectuals the late 1960 s had arrived , and with them , howe believed , an end to highmindedness and , specifically , to the wideranging form of cultural criticism that had been , from the 30 s into the 50 s , the hallmark of partisan review the critics associated with that small but influential journal , howe wrote , had shared a vocation to align what was radical in the arts with radical politics there was a feeling in the air that a union of the advanced critical consciousness and political conscience could be forged it never happened the political left and the modern movement were never comfortable partners but the ambition to meld them had made for brilliant , bracing critical writing and what would follow \? critics were going to discover connections and tease out paradoxes and work up arguments about the relation of radical politics and rockandroll \? yeah yeah yeah , as it turned out for the serious rock critics who began to emerge at the end of the 60 s , writing for magazines like crawdaddy ! and rolling stone and alternative weeklies like the village voice and boston s real paper , ruminating about pop music s place in the era s political tumult was a lot of what it was about james miller is a charter member of the rock intelligentsia he wrote his first review for rolling stone in 1967 while a student at pomona college , where he also helped to found a chapter of the students for a democratic society in his essential book about sds , democracy in the streets \( 1987 \) , miller the student rebel emerges as something of an anarcholibertarian , and his narrative is one of disillusionment , as sds s leadership turned on to mao and violent provocation he turned away from activism , earning a phd in politics , philosophy and history , but he continued to write about rockandroll in searching essays for new times and the new republic and later , in the 80 s , as a pop music critic for newsweek now , to judge from flowers in the dustbin \( the line is from the sex pistols' god save the queen \) , he s pretty much given up on the music , too the book is organized not as an argument but as a cultural chronicle of the development of rockandroll from its roots in postwar popular music , black and white , through the advent of punk the story is not an unfamiliar one , and miller has done little fresh research , relying in large part on his memories and on the many rock biographies and astoldto s that have been published in recent years but because he thinks harder and more broadly than most pop music writers , and writes more lucidly , especially about the music itself , than those who theorize about rock in cultural studies departments , the result is a book that engrosses and provokes even when it does n't exactly inform consider the beatles , as miller does in five of the 45 taut narrative essays that make up the book he situates the group not only musically but socioeconomically in deadend liverpool , circa 1960 rubble still scarred the landscape , a reminder of the german blitz , and unemployment ran high , leaving plenty of kids with time to kill what was it that made i want to hold your hand sound so new that winter of 196364 \? \( the piquancy of the vocal harmonies , like the freedom you could feel in the unorthodox chord changes , gave the song an irresistible aura of novelty \) and as miller cuts back and forth , docudrama style , between the beatles and bob dylan and ken kesey s acid tests and andy warhol s factory , you can almost feel the wondrously dizzying pace at which rock rose the beatles went from eight days a week \( echoes of the everly brothers \) to a day in the life \( shades of philip larkin and penderecki \) in less than two years ! it is with the release of sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band on june 1 , 1967 , that flowers in the dustbin reaches its apogee miller , like so many others back then , heard the album as a herald everything was going to change for the world as a whole he noted in his preface that the book was an attempt to explore rock s cultural essence and not a comprehensive history of the era s music , and his point now becomes clearer as does , perhaps , the reasoning behind some of his earlier omissions , which include phil spector , almost all of 60 s soul and , most curiously for a thoughtful listener like miller , the pop minisymphonies brian wilson created on pet sounds and for the aborted smile project none of this music was made to change the world but at least as miller understood it back then , however inchoately , the beatles , dylan , the rolling stones and others , too , were revolutionaries of a sort , part of a new world dawning then things darkened , quickly and drastically from the monterey pop festival , held just weeks after sgt pepper moved into the stores , and on through jim morrison s alcoholanddrugs demise and the hyping in 1975 of bruce springsteen as rock s next dylan , or elvis , or whatever , the author sees almost nothing but decadence , hype and death that , say , the doors' noirish first album even now remains fresh sounding and influential , or that springsteen went on to write bluecollar songs that are as spare and heartfelt as raymond carver s stories , is presumably of little interest to miller consumer capitalism in this case , the entertainment industry s starmaking machinery had simply and drastically transformed something profound into a sad , empty spectacle or maybe it had been an illusion all along on assignment for newsweek in memphis in 1987 to gather material on the growing elvis cult , miller not only came to understand how much he despised current pop but also came to wonder if the rock he once embraced had actually been a destructive force in american music , endangering more vital and beautiful forms of popular music , like jazz and gospel he ends the book sounding like a rock neocon the truth is that rockandroll was never really about utopian politics the beatles themselves dismissed the idea in their 1968 single revolution \( which infuriated the paris student radicals \) like modernism , of which rock is in some sense a bastard child drawing on the romantic impulse , embracing the trappings of bohemianism , ever searching for the next thing , and the next the music that mattered was , and is , about artistic expression and not politics similarly , as modernism was not ultimately a subversion of bourgeois liberalism but an audaciously grand manifestation of it \( the new york intellectuals came to understand this , eventually \) , so it was , and is , with great rockandroll \( ask vaclav havel \) the best pop music of the past 50 years will find its place in history because it carries the sound of something straining to be new for this , you might say , freedom s another word , and in flowers in the dustbin , despite miller s disenchantment , that s what breaks on through drawing \( thomas fuchs \)
washington , jan 20 it has been nearly three decades since dr denis p burkitt , a british missionary surgeon who studied the differences in diseases of poor africans and affluent westerners , postulated that the africans' highfiber diet protected them against colon cancer he spread his thesis as dietary gospel , prompting millions to change their diets now , the largest study ever to examine dr burkitt s theory has found that , at least when it comes to preventing colon cancer , all those fruits , vegetables and cereals do not do any good the research , by a team from harvard university and brigham and women s hospital in boston , tracked the eating habits of more than 88 , 000 female nurses over 16 years and found that women who ate a highfiber diet were no less likely to develop colorectal cancer or polyps , which can be a precursor to cancer , than women who ate little fiber the findings , which appear in the thursday issue of the new england journal of medicine , were , for the most part , the same no matter what type of fiber the subjects ate , or how fastidious their habits whether they smoked or did not smoke , whether they dined on fatty steak or lean tofu , whether they exercised regularly or sat on the couch and watched television the researchers and others commenting on their findings noted that the study had its limitations for example , many scientists believe that men and women respond differently to dietary fat and fiber , and the study group involved only women still , the new study adds to growing research that suggests when it comes to colorectal cancer the benefits of fiber have yet to be proved we really ca n't substantiate a protective effect of fiber on the rates and risk of colon cancer , said dr charles s fuchs , a medical oncologist at brigham and women s and the lead author of the study that is not to say that fiber is not a good thing it is still helpful , but not for colon cancer indeed , experts were quick today to urge americans to eat a diet rich in fruits , vegetables and whole grains , primarily because those fiberrich foods protect against the nation s leading killer , heart disease in addition , a highfiber diet has been shown to prevent other types of cancer , including that of the mouth , pharynx , larynx , esophagus and stomach , said dr michael thun , vice president for epidemiology at the american cancer society but none of those are as common as colorectal cancer , which kills more americans an estimated 57 , 000 in 1998 than any other type of cancer except lung cancer while experts say the best way to prevent colorectal cancer is to undergo regular screening , some interviewed today were unconvinced by the findings of dr fuchs and his colleagues they argued that dr burkitt s hypothesis might indeed be true , just difficult to prove through a study that relied , as the boston one did , on participants to recall their eating habits accurately or other factors , like consumption of sugar , which has been associated with an increased risk of colon cancer , could have confounded the study results this is an experienced group , said dr arthur schatzkin , senior investigator in the nutritional epidemiology branch of the national cancer institute it s a study with a strong design , but it is by no means the last word on the subject it is possible that there really is a true relationship between fiber intake and colorectal cancer , but it is just that the epidemiologic tools that we use are too crude to see it the final word , dr schatzkin said , will come after scientists conduct controlled clinical trials comparing cancer rates in patients who eat fiberrich diets against those who do not he is conducting one such study the polyp prevention trial , financed by the cancer institute it began in 1991 and involves 2 , 000 people half have been eating a specially designed highfiber diet , while the other half have eaten as they normally would dr schatzkin said he was currently analyzing the results the findings in the current new england journal article were drawn from the nurse s health study , which since 1976 has been chronicling the health and habits of 121 , 700 female registered nurses the nurses , who were 30 to 55 when the study began , were sent detailed questionnaires about their eating habits the questionnaires were updated every two to four years for their research , dr fuchs and his colleagues broke the women into five groups according to their median intake of fiber in 1980 they then studied only those women who maintained a consistent fiber intake for the next six years , 88 , 757 nurses in all , and tracked them until 1996 while the average american eats 133 grams of fiber a day , the fiber intake among the nurses averaged 98 grams in the lowest quintile and 249 grams in the highest \( a bowl of oatmeal contains about 4 grams \) during the 16 years of the study , 787 , or roughly ninetenths of 1 percent of the study population , developed colorectal cancer an additional 1 , 012 women were found to have benign tumors among 27 , 530 participants who underwent procedures to detect them the percentage of patients who developed colorectal cancer was relatively consistent among the five groups but there was one curious finding when the researchers teased apart the cancer rates according to the type of fiber the women ate , it appeared that those who ate the most vegetables actually increased their risk of colon cancer by 35 percent but dr fuchs said that finding was probably the result of chance the effect was small but statistically significant , dr fuchs said i do n't make much of it i certainly would not tell anybody to be concerned about vegetables
as the cocacola company tries to regain its footing in europe after a contamination scare that caused the biggest product recall in the company s 113year history , executives have made a rare admission mistakes were made in manufacturing such humility is far from routine for the softdrink giant , renowned as it is for superb marketing and a corporate structure that is well oiled from top to bottom but the crisis in europe , in which hundreds of people said they felt sick after drinking cokes , has revealed a different cocacola , one that stumbled repeatedly , making an unfortunate situation even worse when the outbreak began , coke executives took several days to make the matter a high priority an apology to consumers came more than a week after the first public reports that people had fallen ill it was not until june 18 10 days after the first schoolboy became dizzy and nauseated after drinking a coke that top company officials arrived in belgium and when coke did begin to respond , it tried to minimize the reports of illness i am genuinely amazed that they have reacted like this , and i do n't know what has gone on inside the company to make them react like this , said david arnold , a harvard business school marketing professor who has studied coke for years the cardinal rule of consumerproducts marketing is that the customers' perceptions often divorced from the facts are what count , he said , adding that a company like coke , which has built an 188 billion business out of sugar water , should know that better than anyone they should have said yes , there appears to be a problem , instead of arguing the facts , he said it will be weeks before the damage to cocacola can be fully assessed analysts have already knocked a few pennies a share off earnings estimates for the current quarter for both cocacola and cocacola enterprises , coke s bottler in belgium and it is clear that in europe , which accounts for about 26 percent of cocacola s profits , coke must take aggressive steps to restore its image philippe l'enfant , a senior executive with cocacola enterprises in belgium , told a belgian television station on sunday that the company perhaps lost control of the situation to a certain extent while the company had a crisis management strategy , he said , the crisis was bigger than any worstcase scenario we could have imagined cocacola s muted initial approach to its problems appears to have backfired in a news conference in brussels last week , m douglas ivester , the company s chairman , said he had chosen to take a lower profile on this at the request of the belgian minister of health , luc van den brossche , and other officials of the government yet coke had taken a low profile well before any ministers took charge a bar owner near antwerp reported on may 12 that four people felt sick after drinking bottles of coke that smelled strange that incident did not lead to public safety warnings , although samples were tested , and no mention was made of it after other incidents were reported , beginning on june 8 , because , a cocacola spokesman said , there was no clear connection officials in belgium and france complained repeatedly about cocacola s apparent inability to tell them , in timely fashion , what it knew you can say that since the beginning , cocacola has presented real contradictions , said one french official involved in the investigation some of those contradictions were evident within coke itself one spokesman said this week that the may 12 incident was widely known , since it had been extensively covered in the belgian press another spokesman said minutes earlier that he had never heard of it when the first reports of illness were made on june 8 , executives of cocacola enterprises in belgium were called in that day , a tuesday , schoolchildren in bornem who had been sold coke in 200centiliter glass bottles by their schools experienced dizziness , nausea and other symptoms that led to 42 of them being sent to hospitals over the next 24 hours odilon hermans , the director of the st mary school in bornem , a welltodo suburb of brussels , got in touch with the cocacola bottling plant in antwerp that day he said several managers visited the school and the hospital before nightfall while a belgian health official said the bottler had recalled several batches of suspect coke on june 8 , mr hermans said it was not until june 10 that unopened bottles at the school were taken away it was after we had to push them a little bit in the beginning , he said the government decided to get deeply involved on june 10 , after eight children from bruges , outside brussels , had to be hospitalized , said susan grognard , an assistant to mr van den brossche they said they felt sick after drinking cans of cocacola and fanta , a fruitflavored brand owned by coke from that moment , we began following it very closely , said the health official coke executives were summoned to mr van den brossche s offices for a meeting the following day the meeting took place at noon about four hours later , the ministry learned that 13 more children had been hospitalized in harelbeke
conyers , ga , may 20 one month after the deadly shootings at columbine high school in littleton , colo , a 15yearold student armed with two guns walked casually into the indoor commons area of heritage high school here this morning and opened fire , wounding six of his fellow students before surrendering in tears to an assistant principal , the authorities said four of the students remained hospitalized this evening , but none were considered to have lifethreatening injuries three were listed in good condition after suffering superficial gunshot wounds to the lower body one was listed in satisfactory condition after a bullet lodged in her abdomen two others sustained minor wounds and were quickly released from a hospital in this middleclass town about 25 miles east of downtown atlanta as of this evening , the police had not publicly identified the boy being held , who witnesses said was disarmed and restrained after he fell to his knees and placed a handgun in his mouth but a large number of students , including several of the estimated 150 students in the commons at the time of the shooting , described the attacker as a quiet , utterly average sophomore named thomas solomon who plays baseball in a county league , attends church regularly and participates in the boy scouts witnesses said cecil t brinkley , an assistant principal who was described as a hero today , confronted the youngster as he had the gun in his mouth and asked him to hand over the weapon the student complied , the witnesses said , and began to sob oh , my god , i'm so scared i'm so scared in brief remarks at a news conference this evening , mr brinkley said i was just doing my job i did what needed to be done officials did not identify the boy in custody because he is a juvenile and for the time being under the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts but richard read , the rockdale county district attorney , said he would move next week to transfer the case to superior court and to charge the boy as an adult with multiple counts of aggravated assault , cruelty to children and weapons violations the authorities have yet to describe any possible motive for the shootings , the sixth seemingly random assault at an american school in the last 20 months but two friends of thomas solomon , who is known at t j , said in interviews that he was distraught over recent troubles with his girlfriend one of t j s friends , nathaniel b deeter , also a sophomore , said that as recently as wednesday t j had told him he was going to kill himself he said , 'i really do n't have a reason to live anymore , ' nathaniel said i told him he was crazy i mean , a lot of kids say stuff like that and never do anything nathaniel said he did not report the incident to anyone nor did he report t j s remark to him a week ago that he had a lot of guns and planned to take one to school t j s friends said he had ready access to a large collection of guns kept by his stepfather , robert w daniele , in their fourbedroom house on a plot of more than an acre in a manicured , uppermiddleclass neighborhood not far from the school skip morgan , a 16yearold neighbor who lives two doors away from t j and was a regular visitor to the house , said mr daniele stored 12 to 15 rifles in a wood and glass cabinet in the basement the case was kept locked , the teenager said , but t j knew how to open it a cabinet drawer was stocked with ammunition , skip said the shooting began about 7 55 am as students began to gather in the commons before the first class bells were to ring , the sheriff s office said , and was over in about 10 minutes nathaniel deeter said he had noticed t j leaning against a wall in the commons and spoke briefly to him about his troubles with his girlfriend he said he was pretty mad about it , nathaniel said , but he did n't seem mad enough to do something like this nathaniel said that he did not see any weapons but that t j might have hidden the guns in his clothing several minutes later , without warning , witnesses said , the assailant began shooting , indiscriminately spraying the room with bullets holding the rifle in his right hand and bracing it with his left , they said , he fired round after round , pumping the barrel after each shot most of the shots apparently were aimed low several students in the room said they believe they heard 10 to 12 shots it was the last day of classes for the school s seniors , who graduate later this month , and many students were braced for pranks on wednesday , someone had released hundreds of crickets at the school so when they heard the first shots , many students assumed the seniors had struck again i just heard four shots , just pow , pow , pow , pow , said joel l thomas , a 14yearold freshman at first we thought it was just firecrackers but as the students saw their classmates fall and the blood begin to ooze , many hit the floor and crawled under benches others rushed for the doors and hallways , with several getting trampled jordan smith , an 18yearold student , said t j had worn an evil smirk gina l corey , a 15yearold sophomore , described the scene as one of those slowmotion things where you can see the sparks coming off the gun
online brokerage firms are the hot rods of wall street , providing fast and cheap access to stock market investors every trading day now , securities regulators want these firms to install seat belts after months of inquiries into the practices of the nation s online brokerage firms , securities regulators in washington and new york issued weighty reports on the industry yesterday , identifying lapses in investor protection at many online operations and offering suggestions about how to correct them the reports , issued by the securities and exchange commission and the office of eliot l spitzer , the new york state attorney general , are an attempt by securities regulators to bring some order to the fractious online brokerage business , which has transformed the way investors buy and sell stocks until now , much of this change , driven by technological advancements , has been watched by regulators from the sidelines although neither of the reports recommended new rules for the online industry , they telegraph to the brokerage community a regulatory commitment to online investor protection laura unger , the sec commissioner who wrote the report , said in a statement i think it may still be premature for extensive rulemaking in this area , but the report will allow the commission to focus upon and consider the most vital issues concerning online brokerage by the second quarter of this year , investors had opened about 97 million online brokerage accounts , almost three times the number in force in 1997 online trading volume has grown , the sec said , from fewer than 100 , 000 trades a day in mid1996 to more than half a million now this explosive growth , according to the regulators , has made the nation s stock market much more accessible to investors but the popularity of online investing , mr spitzer s report said , also poses unique risks to the public , and presents tough challenges to regulators charged with ensuring the integrity of the trading environment mr spitzer s report , the result of nine months of inquiries into the practices of seven firms in five states , concluded that online brokerage firms hyped their technology and services , contending that they provide direct and immediate trade execution while playing down the risks of computer system breakdowns for example , the report found that many firms do not update customer account information regularly enough to provide accurate readings on investors' margin accounts that has allowed investors to buy stocks using money they thought was in the account when in fact they had none in addition , mr spitzer s investigators reported that online investors were able to buy stocks in their individual retirement accounts that exceeded the value of those accounts both of those findings gave substance to the fears of some market observers that online brokerage firms will do anything to keep investors trading a top concern of the sec is that some online firms may try to escape their obligation to ensure that investments that their customers make are suitable for their circumstances suitability is a principal avenue of protection for investors under federal securities laws almost onethird of the arbitration cases filed by investors with the national association of securities dealers since 1995 involved investments said to have been unsuitable for the investors who bought them in the past , some online firms have contended that because their customers make their own investment decisions , even if based on research taken from the web site , the firm need not consider whether an investment is suitable to the investor glen mathison , a spokesman for the charles schwab corporation , said yesterday that the firm s executives were still digesting the regulators' reports and he could not comment on the specifics but he said that existing regulation adequately covers suitability there s no need to separate out online investing for some sort of differentiated or specialized regulation , mr mathison said nevertheless , the sec s report identifies situations in which online firms would have to meet suitability requirements for example , while an online firm that simply executes orders without providing any research would not need to examine its customers' trades for appropriateness , the report said that a firm that published research should believe that the information is plausible and that the recommended investments may be appropriate for at least some of its customers lewis d lowenfels , a prominent securities lawyer at tolins lowenfels and an expert on suitability , said regulators have now begun to address indepth problems that new technology is raising among investors this is a sensible way to proceed any attempt to set rigid rules when the industry is in such a state of flux would be counterproductive without naming individual firms , both reports maintained that online brokerage firms needed to tone down their promises of instant market access and be more clear about the risks of system failures or delays over the past few years , online trading has revolutionized the investment world , mr spitzer said in a statement with this new technology comes the need for new 'rules of the road' for both investors and brokerage firms
it is canny of the mint theater , at the end of a decade of stock market enchantment , to stage the voysey inheritance , a 95yearold play by the british actor and director harley granvillebarker few theatrical works so shrewdly raise profound questions about the role of ordinary morality in the making of money , and none in english does it with such elegance and wit the voysey family is a collection of willful eccentrics worthy of oscar wilde or george bernard shaw the money they all enjoy comes from voysey son , a solicitors' partnership run by the head of the family and his youngest son , edward at the outset edward discovers that for 30 years his father has used money entrusted to the firm for specified investments to play the stock market and that at no time could the firm survive if all its clients tried to redeem their money the father says this practice began with his father , and he kept it up to save his father s name and to try to achieve a balance at some point but he dies suddenly , and when edward sets out to restore the looted accounts , one client inevitably uncovers the manipulations , with social and legal consequences that make this play an intellectual thriller actually , the dialogue makes it sound like a parlor comedy , and anyone following its arguments might think it is a fabian socialist critique of capitalism a not unreasonable conclusion since granvillebarker was shaw s closest collaborator on productions of his plays and created many of shaw s most memorable leading male roles but little here is didactic the arguments made by most of the voyseys for their cavalier use of other people s wealth carry much more force than edward s doubts , and only one brief episode has a whiff of instruction that the play operates so successfully on many levels is not surprising granvillebarker s prefaces to shakespeare s plays incited a revolution in production that rescued those dramas from two centuries of performance tradition that had almost smothered their intelligence and psychological penetration the lines of the voysey inheritance are so sharp that even if they were read in a monotone a listener would be startled by the depths of character they reveal and there is nothing monotonal here under gus kaikkonen s direction , george morfogen as the senior voysey is a generous , cheerful , guiltless thief trusted by everyone with one exception , the male voyseys , high in society , the army and the law , are so ridiculously confident that they make contempt a pure joy edward \( kraig swartz \) grows almost imperceptibly from a scandalized young prig into a man who finds total loss is salvation , even though he has to be led to that vision by his cousin alice \( sioux madden \) , a selfish socialite transformed by disaster into a wise , tender lover and as for george booth , the family friend who brings down the house of voysey , there is not a sillier , more delightful or vapid ninny in the literature , and chet carlin plays him as though he owns the part as , for now , he deserves to at the end many people expressed surprise that they had been sitting enthralled for three hours a playwright , and a company , ca n't do much better than that the voysey inheritance by harley granvillebarker directed by gus kaikkonen sets by vicki r davis costumes by henry shaffer lighting by willaim armstrong dialect coach , amy stoller original music by ellen mandel stage manager , allison deutsch presented by the mint theater company at 311 west 43d street , clinton with george morfogen \( mr voysey sr \) , kurt everhart \( peacey \) , kraig swartz \( edward voysey \) , jack koenig \( major booth voysey \) , chet carlin \( mr george booth \) , christa scottreed \( ethel voysey \) , sioux madden \( alice maitland \) , arleigh richards \( honor voysey \) , lisa bostnar \( mrs booth voysey \) , sally kemp \( mrs voysey \) and robert boardman \( trenchard voysey \) photo george morfogen , left , and kraig swartz in the voysey inheritance , an edwardian drama by harley granvillebarker , at the mint theater \( barry burns \)
trenton , may 24 gov christine todd whitman s nominee for attorney general , john j farmer jr , was confirmed unanimously by the state senate today , winning the the state s top law enforcement job at a time when the office and the state police are under intense scrutiny because of racial profiling the vote came two weeks to the day after mr farmer s predecessor , peter g verniero , was narrowly confirmed by the senate for a seat on the state supreme court after a nomination that was troubled , in part , by mr verniero s response to reports of racial profiling by the state police i am obviously overwhelmed by the vote today , mr farmer said in a brief speech on the floor of the senate in which he avoided any mention of the controversy that has clouded the office in the last year i am flattered and humbled mr farmer , who has been the governor s chief counsel for the last two years , assumes his new job immediately the attorney general oversees the new jersey state police , which means mr farmer will inherit several contentious issues these include finding a new superintendent for the state police and dealing with low morale among the ranks of state troopers mrs whitman forced the resignation of the previous superintendent , col carl a williams , in february after he said in a newspaper interview that members of minority groups were primarily to blame for drug trafficking in the state mrs whitman , and now mr farmer , are being pressured on one side by those who want the new superintendent to be an outsider , perhaps someone from out of state , and on the other side by those who want the new leader to come from the department during his confirmation hearing this morning , mr farmer got a hint of just how heated an issue that may become i am going to regret my vote here if you go outside new jersey for a new superintendent of the new jersey state police , said senator raymond zane , one of the democrats on the judiciary committee mr farmer said the list for a potential superintendent was down to five candidates , and he said that a selection would be made next month but he told the committee that he would make no assurances about who that nominee would be mr farmer s nomination sparked none of the partisan rancor that mr verniero s did both democrats and republicans praised the nomination during his confirmation hearing before the judiciary committee early in the day and from the senate floor this afternoon mr verniero stepped down as attorney general on may 14 , and is to begin his first term on the supreme court in september upon the retirement of justice stewart g pollock in the last year , the furor over racial profiling put mr verniero at the center of a political firestorm it started in april 1998 , when state troopers shot three unarmed minority men during a traffic stop on the new jersey turnpike that incident highlighted longstanding complaints from black civil rights groups and leaders that state troopers routinely singled out black drivers , especially young men , based solely on race mr verniero waited for nearly a year before beginning a formal investigation into the allegations in april , mr verniero released a report that said officers in at least two police barracks in moorestown and in cranbury had engaged in racial profiling a week later , he announced that the state had agreed to negotiate a settlement with federal officials to avoid a civil rights lawsuit it will fall to mr farmer to complete those negotiations the first in the nation involving a statewide law enforcement agency as well as help in the search for a new superintendent and try to repair some of the damage done to the image of the state police mr farmer , who is 41 , joined mrs whitman s counsel office in 1994 and worked as a senior associate counsel and deputy chief counsel before assuming the top job in 1977 he has also worked in private law practice and as a law clerk for justice alan b handler of state supreme court from 1990 to 1994 , he was an assistant united states attorney photo john j farmer jr was confirmed unanimously by the new jersey state senate yesterday \( associated press \)
jakarta , indonesia , oct 23 having anointed its new leaders this week , indonesia now finds itself facing the even more daunting task of redefining and reconstructing a nation whose institutions , politics , economy and sense of purpose had been bankrupted by the long rule of former president suharto on wednesday the national assembly elected a new president , abdurrahman wahid , ending the 17month transitional leadership of b j habibie , who took the first steps to liberate political discourse , freeing the press and setting in motion a freewheeling electoral process but in his public stature , mr habibie never managed to break free of his close association with his mentor , mr suharto , and his tenure was fixated on political succession now the real transition has taken place to an elected successor and the postsuharto era can truly begin mr wahid , an islamic leader , is one of the few major figures who gained prominence independent of either his connection with or opposition to mr suharto he brings the opportunity for indonesia to start to look forward rather than back now we have a newborn baby , said a prominent economist , emil salim , at a recent conference giving birth involved some pain and some blood but now a new indonesia is born but as with other emerging democracies , the agenda now is almost entirely defined by the need to overcome the legacy of repression and military rule , of corruption and of the devaluation of government institutions during mr suharto s 32year rule suharto is gone but his evil genius is still all around , wherever you look , said james c clad , an expert on southeast asia at georgetown university among other things , mr suharto s repression of political discourse heightened a tendency toward eruptions of violence around the many islands of this huge nation of more than 200 million people two days after the election , in a reminder that none of the old problems have gone away and that new ones continue to emerge , nearly 10 , 000 people demonstrated on the eastern island of sulawesi demanding independence from indonesia already the separation of east timor as an independent nation has sharpened separatist demands in the provinces of irian jaya and aceh , posing urgent problems of national stability for the new president this is going to lead to a perception that balkanization is beginning to take root in indonesia , and that is going to scare away investors , said james van zorge , who heads an economic consulting group in a way , mr wahid s task of reconstruction is comparable to that of the leaders of east timor , which was granted its independence this week by indonesia but only after vengeful antiindependence militias had virtually leveled its towns and villages the most important thing they 've got to do is to rebuild their institutions , said daniel s lev , a professor of political science at the university of washington in bending the nation to his will , he said , mr suharto perverted its basic institutions to serve his own interests , rendering them corrupt and ineffective they 've got to rebuild the bureaucracy , the courts , the police , mr lev said they 've got to do something about the regional bureaucracies and deal with issues of decentralization they 've got to figure out how to begin attracting foreign money again people have to eat economic reforms will involve extremely difficult steps in reforming the banking sector and reducing a huge burden of private foreign debt as well as carrying out structural changes required by international lenders in a larger and much longerterm sense , they will require cultural changes an end to crony capitalism that closes off competition and drives away foreign investors political analysts here see mr wahid as a democrat at heart but whatever his personal leanings , indonesia has demonstrated over the last 17 months a popular momentum for openness and democratization that is likely to continue to influence government policies there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic , said eric bjornlund , who represents the national democratic institute in jakarta this is a different country than it was a year and a half ago mr bjornlund s agenda for mr wahid is similar to that of many other outside observers it includes constitutional reform to build in checks and balances a reform of the electoral system , primarily to institute direct presidential elections a reduction in the overpowering political role of the military the creation of an independent court system along with investigations of past abuses the strengthening of national and provincial legislatures the providing of greater autonomy to the provinces , and , more broadly , the fostering of a more open and democratic civic culture mr wahid s first step as president was to select as his vice president megawati sukarnoputri , forming an alliance with indonesia s most popular politician and the standard bearer for opposition to mr suharto mr wahid , 59 , is frail and nearly blind and many people here say that his vice president could well succeed him before his fiveyear term is up his second and most important step will be to select his cabinet , which will help define the character of his government and which is likely to play a particularly strong role because of mr wahid s frailty he has already made it clear that national reconciliation is his priority and there is an expectation that he will choose a wideranging group that represents a variety of interests in the short run , this could insure social peace after two years of turmoil in the long run , several analysts say , it could lead to infighting and paralysis in addition , mr wahid s desire for reconciliation could cause him not to pursue vigorous investigations into the corruption of the suharto years and the human rights abuses committed by the military both in east timor and elsewhere that would slow indonesia s progress toward an embrace of economic transparency and human rights and would also be likely to reignite some of the anger that brought down both his predecessors the transition from the suharto era also offers a new opportunity to peer into what sidney jones , the asia director for human rights watch , called the dark shadows of indonesia s past if it is truly to liberate itself and move forward , ms jones said , indonesia must examine and shed light on a long list of abuses and mysteries that had been buried as long as mr suharto or his friend , mr habibie , remained in office foremost among these are the massacres of 1965 and 1967 that accompanied mr suharto s rise to power , in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed but in an indication of the difficulty of making a clean break with the past , ms jones pointed out that such an investigation could implicate a youth group closely affiliated with mr wahid photo escorted by military and local officials , president abdurrahman wahid , center , prayed at his father s tomb yesterday in jombang , east java \( associated press \)
the change in the usage shares of internet explorer and navigator in summary , the estimates on which microsoft and aol relied and the measurements made by adknowledge and the university of illinois provide an adequate basis for two findings first , from early 1996 to the late summer of 1998 , navigator s share of all browser usage fell from above seventy percent to around fifty percent , while internet explorer s share rose from about five percent to around fifty percent second , by 1998 , navigator s share of incremental browser usage had fallen below forty percent while internet explorer s share had risen above sixty percent all signs point to the fact that internet explorer s share has continued to rise and navigator s has continued to decline since the late summer of 1998 it is safe to conclude , then , that internet explorer s share of all browser usage now exceeds fifty percent , and that navigator s share has fallen below that mark these trends will continue the cause of the change in usage shares the changes in usage share described above would likely not have occurred had microsoft not improved its browsing software to the point that , by late 1996 , the average user could not discern a significant difference in quality and features between the latest versions of internet explorer and navigator as microsoft s top executives predicted , however , internet explorer s quality and features have never surpassed navigator s to such a degree as to compel a significant part of navigator s installed base to switch to internet explorer an internal microsoft presentation concluded in february 1998 that m any customers see ms and ns as parity products no strong reason to switch , and another internal review three months later reported , ie4 is fundamentally not compelling and n ot differentiated from netscape v ersion 4 seen as a commodity for a time , even among new users , navigator was likely to win most choices between comparable browser software , because most people associated the internet and cuttingedge browsing technology with netscape rather than with microsoft so , if microsoft had taken no action other than improving the quality and features of its browser , internet explorer s share of usage would have risen far less and far more slowly than it actually did while internet explorer s increase in usage share accelerated and began to cut deeply into navigator s share after microsoft released the first version of internet explorer \( 30 \) to offer quality and features approaching those of navigator , the acceleration occurred months before microsoft released the first version of internet explorer \( 40 \) to win a significant number of headtohead product reviews against navigator this indicates that superior quality was not responsible for the dramatic rise internet explorer s usage share including internet explorer with windows at no additional charge likely helped the usage share of microsoft s browsing software it did not , however , prevent oems from meeting demand for navigator , which remained higher than demand for internet explorer well into 1998 moreover , bundling internet explorer with windows had no effect on the distribution and promotion of browsing software by iaps or through any of the other channels that microsoft sought to preempt by other means had microsoft not offered distribution licenses for internet explorer and other things of great value to other firms at no charge had it not prevented oems from removing the prominent means of accessing internet explorer and limited their ability to feature navigator and had microsoft not taken all the other measures it used to maximize internet explorer s usage share at navigator s expense , its browsing software would not have weaned such a large amount of usage share from navigator , much less overtaken navigator in three years the effect on consumers of microsoft s efforts to protect the applications barrier to entry the debut of internet explorer and its rapid improvement gave netscape an incentive to improve navigator s quality at a competitive rate the inclusion of internet explorer with windows at no separate charge increased general familiarity with the internet and reduced the cost to the public of gaining access to it , at least in part because it compelled netscape to stop charging for navigator these actions thus contributed to improving the quality of web browsing software , lowering its cost , and increasing its availability , thereby benefitting consumers to the detriment of consumers , however , microsoft has done much more than develop innovative browsing software of commendable quality and offer it bundled with windows at no additional charge as has been shown , microsoft also engaged in a concerted series of actions designed to protect the applications barrier to entry , and hence its monopoly power , from a variety of middleware threats , including netscape s web browser and sun s

the empire state development corporation is advocating the wrong policy regarding the sale of the 582acre kings park psychiatric center property for psychiatric center , park or development \? april 11 their proposed landuse strategy flies in the face of an integrated plan advanced by local planners , environmentalists , business groups , residents and legislators that achieves the same financial goals set by the state while preserving more open space desired by the community there is little argument that the property should be recycled for current use and that the state needs to generate funds to retire the 38 million debt secured by the property and pay for the demolition and cleanup of buildings but there are very different ways to achieve those goals the state s plan will preserve less than 20 percent of the site as compared with the long island land use strategy , which proposes to keep nearly 80 percent of the property forever green state opposition to keeping more of the property available for a state park providing hiking trails , boating , golf and other recreational activities makes no sense , given that both plans acknowledge the need to retire the underlying debt kings park is part of a pattern of disappointing landuse policy decisions made by the empire state development corporation have we forgotten that the proposed state strategy for the commercial use of the long island development center site in melville , under a previous governor , was met with unified community opposition because it failed to address open space and traffic concerns \? this and two other large state land parcels were recently sold to private developers without having a landuse plan in place opposition to the proposed land uses is already growing among long islanders preservation of these fields will be left to the whims of developers and their peracre profit yield requirements state legislators are concerned assemblyman steven englebright has proposed legislation that would set aside 90 percent of the kings park site as a park , while assemblyman robert wertz would prefer that none of the land be disposed of at all these bipartisan efforts send a message that the bidding process criteria must be reevaluated martin r cantor melville
benny agbayani s storybook stretch appeared to come crashing to an end yesterday , like the coach turning into a pumpkin at the stroke of midnight , even though it was only about a quarter to three in the afternoon at shea stadium agbayani , the mets' rookie surprise , was carted away on a motorized cart after sliding into the rightfield retaining wall and smashing his left knee on its concrete base with the mets down by 50 in the third inning of a game they would lose to the philadelphia phillies , 93 , agbayani chased after a foul ball and ran out of room after he crashed into the wall , he could not get up on his own , and he and most of the 34 , 575 fans feared the worst for a player who had 13 hits in his last 18 atbats when xrays revealed that he had only a bruised left kneecap , agbayani and his teammates felt a sense of relief that feeling was shortlived , because bobby jones who , like agbayani , did not make it through the third inning later said that his pitching shoulder has been aching for the last few days jones \( 33 \) , who allowed five runs and six hits in two and twothirds innings in losing his third straight game , likened the feeling to a deadarm period he said he was hoping that it was nothing more than a case of tendinitis , but yesterday he had no life on his fastball , which he does not throw all that hard even when he is totally healthy he s not throwing that well , obviously , mets manager bobby valentine said he s missing his spots and not changing his speeds other than masato yoshii , and excluding the last outings by rick reed and orel hershiser , none of the mets' starters is throwing well right now to make matters worse for the mets , today reed will face curt schilling , the philadelphia ace if the mets lose , they will finish this homestand with a 34 record , even though they have scored 41 runs in their last six games the phillies \( 2219 \) , behind paul byrd , pulled within a game of the mets \( 2419 \) for second place in the national league east byrd \( 62 \) allowed three runs and six hits in seven and twothirds innings to pick up his second victory over the mets in six days it s not that i'm trying to show anyone they made a mistake , said byrd , who was cast off as a reliever by both the mets and the firstplace atlanta braves i'm just trying to do well over there i was a mopup man , and in atlanta , too when you 're in that situation , you always feel like someone s letting you be on the team byrd did not allow a run until the sixth by that time the phillies had a 60 lead , and the righthander had kept the mets at bay with a steady diet of changeups he retired mike piazza three times with runners in scoring position rickey henderson returned to the lineup yesterday after a stint on the disabled list with a right knee sprain , and was 0 for 4 byrd even helped his own cause by singling in the phillies' second run in a fourrun second inning that began with jones recording two outs on seven pitches it took jones 32 more pitches to record the third out , however , as mike lieberthal and desi relaford hit consecutive triples , byrd flared a brokenbat single to left on a 12 curveball , doug glanville walked and marlon anderson doubled to right scott rolen grounded to second to end the inning it has already been like three seasons in one for jones in his first three starts of the year , jones allowed 3 earned runs in 21 innings \( an earned run average of 129 \) and picked up three victories in his next three starts , jones allowed 11 earned runs in 18 innings \( an era of 550 \) and did not get a decision in his last three starts , jones has been shellacked for 20 earned runs in 13 2 3 innings \( an era of 1317 \) and lost all three games i think location is everything , jones said in order for me to be on , i have to hit my spots consistently , because i do n't have the out pitch i have to put the ball where i want to eight , nine times out of 10 when i miss a little , it means a lot jones is not the only one in pain al leiter has felt soreness in his left bicep , and valentine said allen watson will start monday in pittsburgh to give his other starters some added rest yoshii figures to start tuesday to give leiter more rest , but valentine said he wants to wait before he announces how the rest of his rotation will sort out and that is not only because his starters are sore they are struggling , particularly jones he goes up and down a lot , valentine said of jones but there is hardly anybody who goes out there and maintains it for 33 starts inside pitch benny agbayani s left kneecap was hurting after he crashed into the wall , but the mets think the rookie outfielder may miss only a day or two i just thought it was a little more drastic than i now know it was , agbayani said rickey henderson played in his first game since may 2 my body s sore , but my legs are fine , henderson said to make room for him on the 25man roster , mike kinkade was optioned to class aaa norfolk mike piazza , whose streak of homering in four consecutive games ended yesterday , said the one thing he is most pleased about this season , as opposed to last season , is that now he is asked only about baseball and pennant races , and not his contract situation it s a good thing it s already history , said piazza , who signed with the mets for 91 million over the next seven years during the off season photo bobby jones , the mets' starting pitcher , reacting after allowing a triple to desi relaford , right , in the second inning jones s record fell to 33 \( chang w lee

dutch a memoir of ronald reagan by edmund morris illustrated 874 pp new york random house 35 the first time the author of this memoir of ronald reagan says he encountered his elusive subject was in 1926 , at a high school football game in dixon , ill , where reagan strode with extraordinary grace down the field with his teammates his face irked me , edmund morris writes it had an adolescent coarseness and an air of studied jollity , as if he knew he was being watched who s this fellow \? morris asks his name s dutch reagan , a boy replies , using the future president s lifelong nickname a year and a half later morris runs into reagan again , swimming at nearby lowell park this time , he experiences a cheeverlike epiphany watching him indeed , trying to imitate him helped me understand at least partly the massive privacy of his personality , he writes the swimmer enjoys a loneliness greater , yet oddly more comforting , than that of the longdistance runner reagan s determined isolation from colleagues , friends and family , the book goes on to suggest , helped save the world from communism and americans from economic misery , just as it helped him save 77 lives in his summers as a lifeguard on the rock river as most people surely know by now , these scenes did not actually happen morris s book is not memoir but , in part at least , a reverie the author , the pulitzer prizewinning biographer of teddy roosevelt , was enlisted 14 years ago to write a definitive life based on extraordinary access to the president in the end , the access was of little use , since reagan devoted most of their conversations to tired anecdotes , tall tales and evasions even less informative was the president s private diary whether out of inspiration , writer s block or despair , morris has produced a book unique in the annals of serious biography , a partly fictionalized account narrated by an imaginary contemporary of the former president this is an authorized biography and a work of extensive scholarship , says a publisher s note in the front of the book all the words \( written or spoken \) of ronald reagan , all his recounted thoughts and acts , and indeed those of every historical character in the text , are matters of fact and of record yet the edmund morris who wrote the book was born in 1940 in kenya and grew up in south africa his doppelganger narrator wanders in and out of reagan s life from the beginnings in rural illinois to hollywood , sacramento and washington , introducing several other fictional characters , who comment sardonically on dutch and are cited in bogus footnotes most journalists , historians and nonfiction writers will find this unacceptable the fictional characters are not clearly identified as such often they are unnecessary and distracting , particularly an obnoxious madeup son of the author who becomes a radical in the 1960 s yet a reader who surrenders to morris s selfindulgent blend of scholarship and imagination will be led through a riveting story to a transcendent conclusion with a surprise twist if there is a higher truth justifying the book s technique , it is that ronald reagan lived in a world of his own fictions , far more extensive than the fictions of edmund morris who better suited to plumb a phantom subject than a phantom narrator \? morris is hardly the first writer to notice that reagan came of age in a dream factory but there has never been as complete a portrait of reagan s vanity , passivity , ambition and fantasizing tendencies from such an admiring source the description here of dutch arriving at the walled and gated city of the warner brothers back lot powerfully conveys a sense of a young man meeting his destiny he had , after all , been dramatizing , embellishing and perhaps fictionalizing his life for years an oftentold reagan anecdote recalls his shock at finding his father lying on the doorstep in a drunken stupor morris s research has taken him to an obscure novel loved by reagan , in which just such a scene also takes place the other theme of this book is reagan s isolation the lowest point in his life comes during his divorce from jane wyman , which morris reconstructs in fascinating detail this is a reagan despondent from the death of a premature baby daughter in 1947 and eclipsed by a wife whose career was taking off while his was sinking wyman let her boredom with him and his increasingly conservative politics be known all around hollywood , but morris delicately hints at a sexual aspect of her complaint one that contradicts the reagan who once bragged to an aide that he got tired of waking up in a strange bed and not remembering the name of the woman he had spent the night with \( it was a common problem reagan once forgot the name of his own son \) and his sense of humiliation was not helped by his starring as drake mchugh , the amputee in king s row in the book that inspired the movie , morris notes , the operation was from the hip down reagan s most famous movie line , where s the rest of me \? , was echoed later in his autobiographical confession that he felt like only half a man until he got out of the movies and into politics
sao paulo , brazil , dec 17 banco bradesco sa is among the biggest and most solemn of brazil s banks , with the motto only work can produce wealth chiseled into the entrance of its headquarters in a nondescript suburb of this city bradesco is also one of the hottest stocks at the center of brazil s internet stock frenzy because of bradesco s efforts to strengthen its online banking operations , the bank is one of a handful of companies listed on the sao paulo stock exchange that investors have chosen as a way to bet on the growth of the internet in latin america s largest economy recent gains in these stocks have helped push the benchmark bovespa index up more than 100 percent this year , ranking sao paulo among the world s bestperforming markets in dollar terms , the bovespa has gained more than 40 percent while american investors have grown accustomed to the internet phenomenon on the recordbreaking nasdaq , it is a relatively new trend in brazil , where the stock market has been dominated by telephone companies and electric utilities the rush to make internet investments here is also made a bit stranger by the fact that almost none of the companies singled out as investments are internet companies it s the charles schwab effect , said roque sut ribeiro , a fund manager at sintese , a sao paulo brokerage firm when people saw that charles schwab s move into online trading made it worth more than merrill lynch , it was clear that a stock with a coherent internet strategy could be in the same league as an internet company itself in brazil , this redrawing of the way in which companies in more traditional businesses are viewed means that previously unknown companies have become big hits among investors pao de acucar , for instance , a supermarket chain , has climbed 183 percent this year after investors became enamored of the company s efforts to sell groceries over the internet livraria saraiva , a bookseller , is up 114 percent on optimism over plans to mimic amazoncom s model of selling books online yet it is perhaps bradesco that best typifies this trend bradesco inaugurated brazil s first commercial web site in early 1995 since then the bank , the largest financial institution in brazil that is not controlled by the central government , has sought to draw clients to its site by offering services to pay bills online , for instance , or trade securities last week , bradesco made its biggest splash by announcing that it would offer free internet access to account holders , who now number 84 million although the announcement rattled brazilian internet service providers , which are already engaged in a price war to attract customers , investors greeted the strategy by pushing up bradesco s shares 13 percent in two days so far this year , bradesco has climbed 111 percent we 're doing stuff that even american banks have n't thought of , said odecio gregio , chief of technology at the bank mr gregio , a whitehaired banker with a penchant for dark suits , cited a bradesco service allowing people to communicate with the bank over the internet by using the latest generation of voicerecognition software though investors are impressed with the internet efforts of companies like bradesco , they acknowledge that such online forays have yet to translate into significant revenue or profit increases francisco chevez , for example , an analyst at salomon smith barney who covers pao de acucar , said the supermarket chain s internet sales had yet to account for 1 percent of total revenue nonetheless , it is the hybrid feature of a company like pao de acucar which combines online sales with the bricks and mortar needed as infrastructure that makes it an interesting internet play , mr chevez said the internet in latin america is still largely about potential projections of internet growth in brazil have helped the performance of shares in globo cabo sa , perhaps the only stock on the sao paulo exchange that can actually be classified as an internet company after the microsoft corporation acquired a minority stake in globo cabo earlier this year , the company announced plans to offer internet access over its network of underground cable lines and though other companies have similar plans , including universo online , brazil s largest internet service provider , none are publicly traded on local stock exchanges so , attention has been focused on globo cabo , even though investors were concerned just earlier this year over the stalled growth of its client base after the devaluation of the brazilian real in 1999 , globo cabo is up 473 percent not everyone is certain that the internet craze will continue to translate into impressive gains on the sao paulo market brazil is nowhere near having a dynamic middle class that could be targeted over the internet because income is still concentrated in the hands of an elite in most parts of the country , said pedro guimaraes , an analyst at banco bozano , simonsen , in rio de janeiro when the initial optimism over the internet dies down , the valuations of these companies could go down graph year to remember the surge in the brazillian stock market this year partly reflects investors' bets on the growth of the internet graph plots the 1999 weekly closes of the bovespa from jan to dec \( source bloomberg financial markets \)
to the editor lawrence l langer warns that my book the holocaust in american life \( june 27 \) should be approached with caution because i confess that much of it is based on guesswork an eminent english historian once advised anyone venturing a generalization do not guess , try to count , and if you cannot count , admit that you are guessing wise counsel , which i followed there was little that could be counted , so though my generalizations were based on years of immersion in published and unpublished materials , and much hard thought , they usually remained guesses i would have thought my frank avowal of this a virtue , but langer will have none of it he wants firm proof he makes much of my saying that there s no way of knowing just how many american jews ground their jewish identity in the holocaust he offers his own view that this is true only of handfuls , maybe sizable handfuls langer neglects to mention that in the very paragraph from which he quotes , i present , for those who prefer 'harder' data , the results of an american jewish committee poll , which reported more jews listing remembrance of the holocaust as important to their jewish identity than those who listed synagogue attendance , observing jewish holidays or any other alternative offered i do n't know what the rules are in langer s field \( literary studies \) , but historians take a dim view of ignoring evidence that contradicts one s preconceptions he disputes my view that the memory of the holocaust is often treated by jews as sacred , by saying that he himself has never used the term , nor have the commentators whose work he respects are his personal preferences evidence \? similarly , he denies my assertion that the allied failure to bomb auschwitz is a standard trope of holocaust discourse , by saying that few recent books on the holocaust mention the subject again , a matter of what langer happens to read to cite only the most recent example , can he have failed to notice the repeated invocation of the failure to bomb auschwitz in discussions of the intervention in kosovo \? i do n't have space available to refute all of langer s misstatements regarding the proposal to bomb auschwitz let me just note his remark that i am apparently unaware that the decision of the jewish agency executive in jerusalem , headed by david bengurion , to oppose the bombing was later reversed but there is no documentary evidence of such a reversal the claim that the decision was reversed is simply conjecture , based on a tenuous chain of indirect inferences peter novick chicago
earlier this season , the advance scout for the anaheim angels was in philadelphia when curt schilling was trying to add to his streak of complete games he was going for his fifth or sixth complete game in a row , the scout , matt keough , related everybody was going crazy not to take anything from mr schilling he s a dynamic pitcher but i had to laugh because that would have been a customary month for us keough was a member of the oakland athletics' starting rotation in 1980 when he and his fellow starters pitched the astounding total of 94 complete games , including 20 by keough , 24 by mike norris and 28 by rick langford by that season , complete games were already in decline elsewhere in the major leagues , but the complete game had not yet become an endangered species it is that today just check the mets' total of complete games through 118 games , that total is zero , as in 0 , as in none no team has ever gone through a season without a complete game in 1995 , the colorado rockies , notorious for their inept pitching staffs , had one complete game bryan rekar pitched it in his second major league start , beating philadelphia so far i do n't think it has hurt us in any way , steve phillips , the mets' general manager , said of the team s absence of complete games it does n't bother me that we have n't and whether we get one or not phillips suggested that schilling might have some questions about his eight complete games if he had n't thrown all of the innings needed to finish those games , phillips said , he might be healthy now instead of being on the disabled list with a sore shoulder is that a bigger factor than complete games , the mets' executive asked , that mentality of throwing pitches when you 're tired \? the number of complete games has been in decline since the late 1970 s for six successive seasons and seven of eight in the 70 s , major league pitchers finished what they started from 1 , 009 times to 1 , 089 but the total fell steadily for the most part , reaching a low of 266 in 1997 before rising to 302 last year the national league reached its alltime low in 1996 with 127 , and the american league followed the next season with its alltime low of 123 both leagues are now headed for totals even lower than those the nl had 86 completes games before yesterday , a rate that would produce 121 for the season the al had 72 , which would translate to a total of 101 , less than two handfuls more than the 1980 athletics had i think the tendency is going to be toward fewer complete games , tony la russa , the st louis cardinals' manager , said you have younger starters , and they 're not prepared to get deep in the game you also have just about everybody trying to build a bullpen they put as much interest in building a bullpen as the starting rotation addressing la russa s first point , about young pitchers , omar minaya , the mets' senior assistant general manager , said the industry as a whole is a little bit conservative with young arms and goes by pitch counts that creates a psychology where when the pitcher gets into the fifth and sixth inning , he starts thinking he s tired the last thing player development people want to do , minaya added , is overuse a pitcher you cherish arms when you have them , he said you do n't want to burn them out on la russa s second point , building bullpens , just about everyone interviewed on the subject said teams these days put their best arms in their bullpens concurring that the best pitching prospects are turned into closers , larry dierker , the houston astros' manager and a former major league starter , said , it used to be all the best pitchers were groomed to be starters and the older guys who could n't go nine anymore were put in the bullpen and the best were made the closers phillips readily acknowledged that he deliberately set out to build a strong relief corps for this season , then bolstered it with recent trades we knew last winter we could n't make trades or sign free agents to build our starting rotation to be better or equal to the braves' rotation , phillips said , so we thought we 'd focus on having a competent starting rotation with a very deep and strong bullpen economics also enters into the equation if you 're going to put together a strong rotation or a strong bullpen , it s more cost effective to do the bullpen , phillips said in 1987 the minnesota twins won the world series with a pitching staff that during the season produced 16 complete games , fewest in the al this season the twins have seven complete games , two more than the yankees' strong starting rotation i certainly do n't want to go on the field , tom kelly , the twins' manager then and now , said , meaning he would be happy never to have to remove his starter i think most managers would like to see the complete games then again , the general manager and the owner are paying some people out there to get some people out so if you have the opportunity , why not use him \? i'm not saying use him just for the sake of using him but there s no reason to let a guy just sit out there dierker has gained a reputation for encouraging his starters to pitch nine i like them to finish if they want to , and i want them to want to , the astros' manager said if i can tell there s any hesitation and he s looking down there at billy wagner in the bullpen , i'm not going to try to teach them lessons in completegame pitching at the expense of losing games beyond the existence of the sophisticated and carefully constructed bullpens , which la russa had much to do with inspiring when he managed oakland in the late 80 s and early 90 s , managers have practical considerations there are several factors , la russa said a lot of pitchers take the decision away from you because they 're throwing so many pitches leaving them in in the eighth or ninth , you 're risking that the fatigue will cause them to make a mistake and cost you the game or they 'll reach back for something more and get hurt the second factor , he said , is that the fresh specialist generally gives you a better chance than a tiring starter and three , if you have a horse , you want him firing late in the season when everything is more important you can burn out your starter by pushing him throughout the season you look to save him pitches doug melvin of texas added another factor agents i recently had an agent call me and tell me he did n't want one of our pitchers to go to winter ball because he 'd have too many innings , melvin related he s going to have about 160 the agent thought pitching another 50 innings would be too much dierker , who said he probably never would have wanted to be a closer , nevertheless thinks the existence of the closer has improved the game but , he added , you can fall into the trap of using the guy all the time he cited the astros' experience last week in atlanta , where john rocker , the braves' closer , pitched the ninth inning of each game of the threegame series , preserving a victory each night the first day he threw 96 , then 93 the second day , then 90 , dierker said , referring to the velocity of rocker s fastball i felt sorry for him he was happy he threw a lot of breaking balls and he won but if i had been bobby cox , i would n't have used him the third day i thought they were abusing him , bringing him in that third day photo now on the disabled list with a sore shoulder , the phillies' curt schilling might have some questions about his eight complete games this season \( associated press \)
on a cool evening this fall , sgt first class albert alfalla , thicknecked and eager in his national guard uniform , faced an unusual scene for a military recruiter working in these flush times , when jobs abound and foreign threats lack the cold war s hold on the public imagination gathered around him at his booth in the school of art and design in manhattan were packs of high school students and their parents , reading his pamphlets , waiting for his spiel that s right , he told them i said , 'free tuition go to college tuitionfree' less than two hours later , sergeant alfalla had collected the names and telephone numbers of more than 50 juniors and seniors who were potential recruits , a feat that demonstrated a curious phenomenon in the world of military recruiting young people lining up to join the national guard i could go for this , i might like it , said alkay r waller , an 18yearold senior from mott haven , the bronx , as he thumbed through a guard pamphlet i need it , really these have been challenging years for the armed forces , which have struggled to attract recruits when the fiscal year ended on sept 30 , only the marine corps had managed to enlist the number and quality of recruits it had sought the army fell short of its numbers for the second consecutive year , the navy missed a similar fate by lowering its enlistment standards , and the air force did not meet its recruiting projections for the first time since the fall of the berlin wall , in 1989 but the state s parttime militia has had the opposite experience after a decade of sharp decline in its ranks , the new york army national guard has not only stopped the contraction , it has begun to grow recruitment has been solid , and fewer veterans are quitting some units are even turning qualified people away the primary reason for the turnaround , the guard s leadership says , is simple for three years , new york has been paying the tuition bills for any guard member who is admitted to a new york state or city college while all the activeduty services offer educational assistance , none offer four years' worth of tuition immediately upon every enlistment , or anything close to it potential recruits , like mr waller , have taken notice in many respects this is a buyer s market the young man or woman can choose what he or she thinks is the best opportunity , said brig gen william c martin , the guard s deputy commander we want the best , and we are going to get the best by making this the best offer in town by outbidding the competition , general martin said , new york s guard has stopped its slide down the slippery slope to extinction enthusiasm for the program was clear at sergeant alfalla s recruiting booth after chatting with college admissions officers nearby , parents and students alike found themselves drifting to the guard s booth to hear about the tuition offer i want to see it in writing , said dorothy negron , of park slope , brooklyn , whose 17yearold son , matthew , a high school senior , is considering enlisting but if this is true , i do n't see why every young person does n't take advantage of it another parent nearby agreed i'm telling my boy to go in the guard , said andrea keller , of mott haven this is better than financial aid new york s national guard is a parttime military organization that serves both federal and state roles , as diverse as peacekeeping in kosovo and winter storm relief in buffalo along with units from 53 other states and territories , it forms a strategic reserve for the pentagon in the case of major conflict its members sign up for three to sixyear enlistments , and generally serve one weekend a month , for which they are paid for much of the 1980 s and 90 s , new york s army guard was a struggling organization , drained of strength and morale by erosions in personnel during the 10 years ending in 1995 , the number of members plummeted , to 11 , 356 from 21 , 903 its own projections warned that its strength would dip as low as 6 , 100 in this fiscal year in 1995 , aware that the decline endangered its future as even a parttime fighting outfit , the guard began looking for a solution and after reviewing research that indicated that twothirds of all high school students wanted to attend college , it asked the legislature to enact a program that would underwrite tuition at state colleges for anyone who served if you are competing against a strong economy , and 67 percent of your kids are going off to school , then why is it that they should join your team \? general martin said the answer was benefits guard planners , working with the veterans affairs committees in the senate and assembly , drafted a bill that would provide for full tuition at any college or university in the state university of new york or city university of new york systems , or pay as much as 3 , 400 each year toward tuition at a private school in new york the resulting benefit , known as the tuition incentive program , passed the legislature unanimously and was signed into law by gov george e pataki in the summer of 1996 to date , the program has cost 64 million in state tax dollars , money that is , in its simplest sense , transferred from the state general fund to state colleges the campuses directly benefit from the additional tuition revenue , said jon sorenson , a spokesman for the suny chancellor
washington , jan 16 the defense department has demanded that scott ritter , a former united nations weapons inspector in iraq , turn over advance copies of a book in which he is expected to step up his criticism of the clinton administration and detail some of his work for the united nations mr ritter , who resigned last summer and accused the united states of undermining the inspection program , said through his lawyer that he was unlikely to agree to a prepublication security review his refusal could prompt a court battle with the pentagon that might delay publication of the book , now scheduled for late march the lawyer , matthew l liffland er , said the defense department appeared to have joined in an administrationwide attempt to intimidate mr ritter into silence mr ritter is already under investigation by the justice department on charges that he may have shared classified information with israel while working at the united nations , a accusation that he denies in a letter to the pentagon dated jan 14 , mr lifflander said , we have been reliably informed that certain very senior officials of more than one federal agency have recently gone out of their way to deprecate mr ritter and denigrate his views as a result , it said , we are not inclined to submit unnecessarily to any potential suppression of his first amendment rights the defense department has not said explicitly that it will try to stop publication of the book or to censor parts of it asked whether the defense department was trying to intimidate mr ritter , the department issued a oneword statement on friday no but in a letter to mr ritter dated dec 23 , the pentagon demanded that several copies of the book be turned over to the department at least two months before publication and reminded him of his contractual obligations to the defense department not to divulge material obtained as a result of your work at the united nations special commission , which supervised arms inspections in iraq until late last year mr ritter , a retired marine intelligence officer , had been formally under contract to the defense department as a consultant while he worked at the special commission he was considered to be on loan to the united nations it has come to our attention that you may write a book that pertains to your involvement with the united nations special commission on iraq while performing under contract to the us government , the letter said your contracts with the us government require that you obtain written authorization from the contracting officer prior to the public release of any material obtained as a result of work performed under the contract simon schuster announced last month that it had signed a contract with mr ritter for a book , tentatively titled endgame it said it had no immediate comment on the dispute mr lifflander said the book would provide some details about mr ritter s work as an arms inspector in iraq but would focus primarily on his views about president saddam hussein and how the united states and other nations should deal with him it will deal with things scott learned about saddam hussein because scott was there in iraq , the lawyer said it s information that s all in the public domain he said the book would contain no classified information absolutely none mr ritter has given hundreds of interviews to news organizations about his united nations work to unmask iraq s programs to develop chemical , biological and nuclear weapons since resigning , he has repeatedly accused the administration of undermining the work of the inspectors in answer to questions , the defense department suggested that it was open to negotiations to avoid a court battle instead of repeating its demand to see the book before publication , the department said , we would make ourselves available to review material to avoid the release of classified information mr lifflander , a longtime friend of mr ritter , said it was clear that mr ritter was under a lifelong ban not to discuss or publish classified information that he saw while in the marine corps but he said his reading of the pentagon contracts signed by mr ritter after he left the marines in 1991 and went to work for the inspection team did not impose a similar ban on information he obtained while working for the united nations , when he no longer had a

the whole thing with ice , said will d'ariano , aka chilly willy , is people find out they have none and they panic everybody waits to the last minute then they call up and say 'i need ice ! i need ice ! i need ice ! i need it now ! ' it was 2 pm on sunday , and it was 97 degrees , the secondhottest hour of the thirdhottest day of an oppressively hot summer , and mr d'ariano had been on the road since 6 , delivering ice to bronx supermarkets and manhattan delis , to fruit markets with salad bars to chill , to coffee bars and mall restaurants and to a big picnic in hartsdale , where he was cheered as he dumped the cubes into buckets containing kegs of lukewarm draft lately , mr d'ariano has been putting 150 to 200 miles a day on his 1995 chevy van , which has a refrigerated interior but an airconditioner that has been broken for weeks because he cannot spare it for even half a day if i could get a mechanic to fix it while i'm driving , he said as he headed north to the tappan zee bridge and a seafood restaurant in a mall in nyack , ny inside the van , he has three cell phones and two beepers , setting up appointments without bothering to pull over delivering ice is always wild , crazy busy , during heat waves , said mr d'ariano , 43 , of yonkers , who has been in the business for 22 years but this month , he said , has been the worst he can remember , and power failures during the fourth of july weekend an ice deliverer s busiest and most profitable days caused him the most pressure and frustration of his career there were ice shortages throughout the northeast , and one of the biggest manufacturers , saxony ice company in mamaroneck , ny , where mr d'ariano picks up his ice , lost 350 tons , more than a day s supply , when electricity was lost in the area crazy hell , he said forget about it the past weekend , though , was just crazycrazy , crazybusy , he said ice machines in restaurants and supermarkets slow down when it gets too hot , and high humidity , in particular , cuts down on their efficiency caterers need extra bags to replenish rapidly melting supplies at receptions and parties , and a broken commercial refrigerator is an instant crisis when it is 95 degrees outside people get angry , he said they yell they want their ice now i have to deal with their heat attitude i tell them 'i'm not the pizza man you want that fast , call domino s' last friday , mr d'ariano left home at 5 30 in the morning and returned at 12 30 on saturday morning saturday was the same his last day off was two weeks ago , he said , when he went to philadelphia to an ice sculpture show he does not plan to take any more days off for a while the sad part about it is , i barely see my kids all summer , he said occasionally , he said , he puts his children , who are 4 , 10 and 11 , in the van while he makes his stops i'm thinking about checking out , doing something else , he added the pressure gets to me and by the end of the summer , i have severe back pain but usually , mr d'ariano makes a point of being upbeat and funny about his job , and about the heat his customers know him as chilly willy , the wild and irreverent ice guy it is a role mr d'ariano began to create shortly after graduating from yonkers high school , when he bought his first van and came up with the name chilly willy s emergency ice service since then , he has dispensed figuratively appropriate advice hey , chill out relax do n't sweat the small stuff and the recordings on his answering machine have gained a cult following among his customers it s sweaty out there , but be cool , be calm , we 're on our way , says one recording some are inyourface you need ice now \? hahaha right now \? hahahahaha and some are outright belligerent , like the one he recorded during a pressured period around the time of the mike tysonevander holyfield fight in 1997 just beep me once , and i 'll get to you beep me twice , beep me three times , and i 'll bite your ear off paul d hendler , vice president of saxony ice company , said he has customers that call up just to listen to what the message is that day he s a hustler of unbelievable proportions he s a nut but he works his tail off mr d'ariano now has four trucks and five employees , and has been joined in the business by his brother , cool carl \( it figures that when carl is not dealing with ice , he is dealing with fire he is also a firefighter on oppressively hot days like sunday , mr d'ariano and each of his trucks may drop off five tons of ice on an average summer day , a day s deliveries for a single truck range from two to three and half tons on a winter day , it may be a ton or less by 3 pm on sunday , when the temperature was up to 98 degrees , it was clearly going to be a fiveton day mr d'ariano piled two shopping carts and two other carts with some 500 pounds of ice and wheeled his loads into the back door of the nyack mall , far from the crowds strolling indoors in the cool air then it was back to the bronx , to an international house of pancakes then down to manhattan on broadway and 87th , he pulled over to take a call blue ice , colored ice , dry ice , he tells the caller crystal clear all kinds of ice anything with ice , you want it , i got it photo will d'ariano , right , and ralph soto unloading ice from a van outside a manhattan supermarket mr d'ariano said the heat brought out the anger in people they yell , he said they want their ice now \( jeffery a salter the new york times \)
the mets and the defending world series champion yankees are among only eight teams with winning percentages of 571 or higher this season , but they will have relatively little representation at next tuesday s allstar game in boston no yankee was voted by the fans to the american league s starting lineup , and four were among the reserves announced yesterday the shortstop derek jeter , the outfielder bernie williams , the pitcher david cone and the reliever mariano rivera but rivera withdrew because of a personal issue , meaning the yankees will have three players , or as many as the lastplace baltimore orioles mike piazza , elected as the national league s starting catcher , will be the only mets' allstar because none of his teammates were selected as reserves by the manager , bruce bochy , of the san diego padres steve phillips , the mets' general manager , said he was surprised and disappointed that no mets were picked considering that the mets have the secondmost victories in the national league manager bobby valentine was not happy over the slight either , saying before last night s game with montreal we 'll throw our nonallstar team out there and hope we can thrill our fans bochy could have selected one of the mets' infielders , from the third baseman robin ventura or the second baseman edgardo alfonzo or the shortstop rey ordonez , who finished second to barry larkin of cincinnati in the fans' voting but ordonez was displaced by alex gonzalez , the florida marlins' only representative in a game that requires an entry from each team in the league we should have more than one guy playing in the allstar game , alfonzo said but as managers pick and choose their 30man squads , they sometimes are caught in a web of procedure and circumstance and inevitably , some allstar caliber players are left off the team joe torre , the manager of the yankees and of the american league team , lamented the fact that he could not fit in the baltimore designated hitter harold baines , who was batting 343 through tuesday s games fans selected cal ripken as the starting third baseman , and torre felt he had to recognize the excellence of the oriole outfielder b j surhoff \( 337 , 20 home runs \) and the pitcher mike mussina \( 104 , 361 \) there is simply no room to fit in all the deserving candidates , torre said a total of 23 players in both leagues earned selections for the first time , including kevin millwood , the only atlanta braves' pitcher chosen it marked the first time since 1990 that tom glavine , greg maddux or john smoltz was not picked rivera , who has converted 20 of 22 save chances for the yankees , approached torre before tuesday s game in detroit and told his manager that he needed to address a personal issue in his homeland of panama during the break so torre and the al office replaced rivera on the team with charles nagy , an indians pitcher who is from the boston area since torre had already named omar vizquel as a reserve shortstop , nagy s addition gave the indians , who had four players voted to the team , a total of six players in the game , more than any other team rivera would not be specific about the personal issue when talking to reporters , indicating only that it does not involve his family and that the issue will not prevent him from rejoining the yankees on july 15 , when they are set to begin a threegame series with atlanta at yankee stadium it s an honor being picked , said rivera , but this is something i have to go home for jeff zimmerman of the texas rangers , with an 80 record and an earnedrun average of 089 , became the first middle reliever a pitcher who follows the starters and precedes the established closer to be named to an allstar team torre noted the irony in this because rivera was among the first dominant middle relievers in the current era to demonstrate the potential of that role

president clinton pardoned an 80yearold former sailor yesterday , forgiving a world war ii conviction for mutiny that had become a reminder of the history of segregation in the armed services the former serviceman , freddie meeks , is one of the few survivors of 50 black sailors who were convicted of mutiny because they refused to resume loading ammunition onto ships at a california port after an explosion there killed 320 men on july 17 , 1944 most of those who died were members of black work crews , and the 50 who refused to resume the loading said blacks had been forced to do dangerous and menial tasks by white officers who ignored the risks the lesson is we stood up for our rights , mr meeks said yesterday after learning of the pardon at his los angeles home we stood up to get the same rights the whites had we all should have been treated the same , because we were all in the navy and were going to fight for the same purpose but they thought we should do the dirty work the christmastime pardon was among 37 that mr clinton granted yesterday but none of the others proceeded from anything nearly so sweeping as the role that the mutiny at port chicago , just north of san francisco , played in american race history more than half a century ago the story of the port chicago explosion and the subsequent refusal of the 50 black sailors to obey orders became one inspiration for a civil rights movement just beginning to stir bigcity black newspapers in particular closely followed the 50 as they were courtmartialed , found guilty of mutiny by an allwhite panel and imprisoned long before he became a supreme court justice , thurgood marshall handled an unsuccessful appeal of the convictions the port chicago incident and the focus it beamed on segregation in the navy , some historians say , influenced president harry s truman s order formally desegregating the military in 1948 nonetheless mr meeks s application for a pardon he was the only survivor to file one presented a difficult choice for mr clinton the federal government itself had been divided over the case in recent years at a memorial it opened at the site of the explosion in 1994 , the national park service distributes literature describing the risks faced by the black sailors one brochure acknowledges that for many americans , the events at port chicago became a symbol of what was wrong with american society but when the navy reviewed the case in 1994 , it declined to expunge the convictions sailors are required to obey the orders of their superiors , said william j perry , then secretary of defense , even if those orders subject them to lifethreatening danger in granting the pardon yesterday , the president noted that mr meeks had been one of those who engaged in the extraordinarily difficult job of recovering human remains after the explosion , had completed his military service after imprisonment and had then become a stable , lawabiding and productive citizen as a civilian after conviction , mr meeks , a seaman second class , was sentenced to 15 years in prison but , like many of the others convicted , he was released after serving 17 months the men then rejoined regular navy units and , except for those who committed later offenses , eventually left the service under honorable conditions , a somewhat lesser status than that conferred by an honorable discharge over the decades , memory of the port chicago episode faded some of the men , like mr meeks , later said they had wanted to do nothing to draw attention to what they felt was the shame of having been branded mutineers then , in the 1980 s , the story began reemerging , and scholars and journalists sought out some of the aging sailors the national park service began work on the memorial to the 320 men killed , 202 of them black in march a television movie told the story of the port chicago sailors most of those sailors were dead by the time the law firm of morrison foerster filed a petition seeking a pardon for mr meeks last june the firm said mr meeks was the only one of perhaps three survivors who had wanted to file although he has been suffering from severe health problems in recent years , mr meeks said yesterday that he had always believed he would live long enough to enjoy the pardon and the largely symbolic victory it imparted i knew god was keeping me around for something to see , he said but i am just sorry so many of the others are not around to see it indeed , although the pardon was issued in his name alone , he seemed to want to share it with 49 other men it makes a big difference to know the president gave us a pardon , mr meeks said we 've been waiting a long time photo freddie meeks , pardoned by president clinton , celebrated at his los angeles home yesterday with tiana jackson , his granddaughter \( associated press \)
upington , south africa , may 15 even out here in this arid , desolate part of the country where the polls say the national party now rechristened the new national party will do well , marthinus van schalkwyk does not make a stop without lashing out at the democratic party sure , he hits out at president nelson mandela s party , the governing african national congress , saying it has failed to control crime and to deliver on its promises of jobs for all but his real passion seems to be saved for warning voters about the evils of south africa s once tiny liberal party , known here as the dp the democratic party , says mr van schalkwyk , leader of the party that created apartheid , is flirting with the racist right and they will die of that political cancer , he said somewhere the gods of politics must be howling with laughter if south africa s second postapartheid election campaign has offered any surprise at all , it is the fuss that the democratic party has engendered the party and its antecedents , which traditionally represented wealthy , englishspeaking white liberals , consistently opposed apartheid and were small but nagging irritants to the whitesupremacist afrikaansspeaking former rulers but even the african national congress , which is expected to coast to victory , perhaps with a twothirds majority , has turned its guns on the democratic party it began a poster war suggesting that the party , which even fought to upgrade conditions in the prison where mr mandela was held , is now running a racist campaign tony leon , the boardingschooleducated chief of the party , shrugs off the accusations he is gaining in the polls and could even displace mr van schalkwyk as south africa s official opposition leader but the contest for that seat has been bitter , laced with assertions of racism and deceit and exposing the deep racial lines that still divide south african society despite public statements that they are looking for voters of all races , the democratic and national parties , running virtually neck and neck , are engaged in a fierce fight for the allegiance of the nonblack vote \( a majority of blacks remain loyal to the african national congress \) in luring supporters , they are both playing on the fears of south african minority groups whites , coloreds and indians who still have most of south africa s wealth but worry about having no say in the government though mr leon s party won just 17 percent of the vote in 1994 , giving it only 7 of the 400 seats in parliament , it has been hugely successful during the last five years as a burr under the seat of government by leaking stories to the press , harshly questioning cabinet ministers during public debates and filing lawsuits when it could not stop legislation , the democratic party has become the chief watchdog on government corruption , incompetence and cronyism all seven of its members of parliament are nimbletongued , but none more so than mr leon , who is a walking sound bite when mr mandela recently sneered that white parties were mickey mouse , mr leon instantly shot back that mr mandela was running a goofy government he has consistently pushed a liberal agenda more accountability in government , less interference with private enterprise , more power in local hands and he has been particularly visible in opposing affirmative action without quotas or time limits , which he calls apartheid in reverse on the campaign trail , mr leon suggests that giving the african national congress a twothirds majority , which would allow it to change the constitution , would be a catastrophe thabo mbeki , who almost certainly will replace mr mandela as president , could decide to make it a job for life , mr leon says or he says , hitting south africa s affluent whites squarely in the wallet , he could fool with the property clauses in the constitution , which prevents the government from expropriating property without paying fair market prices do n't let it happen , mr leon told white farmers near pietermaritzburg recently not because the anc is the evil incarnate they are n't but because no government in this country with our history should ever have that kind of power his pitch is clearly hitting home polls show that his party is the fastestgrowing one , with as much as 10 percent of the vote now not much , perhaps , but maybe enough to beat the new national party , which got 20 percent in 1994 , but has been sinking in the polls ever since at the moment , polls show them about even political analysts say they believe that a large chunk of mr leon s support is coming not from liberal afrikaners , but from conservative ones , a traditional national party power base they deem the old rightwing parties like the conservative party and the freedom front ineffective , and resent the old national party for handing over the reins of power to blacks in 1994 they see the democratic party s fight for individual rights and minimal government interference as the best protection for themselves
detroit other companies may be shying away from olympic sponsorships after the bribery scandal involving the winter games in salt lake city , but the general motors corporation is stepping up its advertising and marketing plans gm , which had already committed to a 10year sponsorship worth roughly 900 million , is now concentrating on getting the biggest bang for its big money yesterday it announced new marketing efforts on several fronts it will give cars and trucks to aspiring olympic athletes , then advertise the gifts it has committed to olympic sponsorships with all nbc ownedandoperated stations through 2008 , and it plans to link specific vehicles with certain sports for promotional purposes some promotions will begin as early as next month , and all are intended to take advantage of the sponsorship deals not just during the two weeks of the games but for the months running up to the summer games in sydney , australia , next year and the years before the winter games in salt lake city in 2002 in fact , general motors is running the longterm sponsorship and advertising campaign much like a political campaign its marketing decisions have been based on nearconstant telephone polling about its customers' interests , said philip guarascio , vice president for advertising and corporate marketing at gm those polled after the bribery scandal told gm that the company s olympic sponsorship would not taint their view of the company that is mostly because the scandal did not involve athletes gm felt comfortable moving forward because its polls found that people differentiated between the business side and the sports side of the olympics , mr guarascio said other companies have been more concerned about the scandal several corporate sponsors met to discuss the subject , and one longtime sponsor , the john hancock mutual life insurance company , demanded a number of changes from the olympic committee johnson johnson , which had been considering spending 30 million on a sponsorship , decided to stick with donating some products and advertising while the scandal was not the company s main concern , it was more than likely part of the backdrop of the decision , said john mckeegan , a company spokesman olympic officials conceded that the scandal had hurt their efforts to sell the games to corporations certainly it has slowed down the sale of some of our sponsorships , said john krimsky jr , deputy secretary general and managing director for business affairs for the united states olympic committee however , he said things were picking up again we have put that behind us network television said it had no problems we 've been pretty much untouched , said dick ebersol , chairman of nbc sports , who along with mr krimsky was on hand here for gm s announcement yesterday we 've continued to sell because the olympics are such a highprofile and oneofakind marketing platform , marketing experts agreed , the games will have no trouble raising enough money from companies olympic sponsorships are not going to go begging , said paul a argenti , a corporate communications professor at the amos tuck school of business administration at dartmouth college even though some companies , particularly those that go to great lengths to emphasize squeaky clean corporate images , might worry about being tainted by association with the scandal , forgoing an olympic sponsorship poses problems , too there is no other event quite like it anywhere in the world , mr argenti said you 're there because your competitors will be there if you 're not others believe that the olympics stature has temporarily been diminished when something like the bribery scandal rocks the very core of what this event stands for , said c b bhattacharya , an associate professor of marketing at boston university what gm is counting on is that come the excitement of the olympics , nobody will remember the bribery scandal and the sports will take over because the scandal involved those wearing suits , the effect for companies considering sponsorships is not as strong as it might be this particular scandal does n't involve athletes , said clive chajet , who runs chajet consultancy , a corporate identity firm based in new york if races were fixed , if big countries were favored over small countries , then people would care there are some lingering effects , but none are keeping the olympics from reaching their financial goals , said david w ogrean , the united states olympic committee s new deputy executive director for marketing there are a lot of folks who have been in the pipeline who have just decided not to move the conversations forward for a while until the dust settles , mr ogrean said still , three years before the salt lake city games , corporate sponsors have already committed to twothirds of the 850 million fundraising goal , mr ogrean said a big chunk of that came from general motors , which announced in july 1997 that it would sponsor the next six olympic games , through 2008 , and would contract with nbc to spend about 500 million in ads during that time the company displayed its resulting influence yesterday not only mr ebersol of nbc and mr krimsky and mr ogrean of the united states olympic committee were called to detroit to sing the company s praises , but bob costas , the nbc sportscaster , was the master of ceremonies of gm s news conference announcing the developments the designer joseph abboud was summoned to the motor city because he will be customizing the cars to be given to olympic athletes most strikingly , the olympic medalists dorothy hamill , evelyn ashford , kristi yamaguchi and carl lewis were on hand to praise gm for giving away cars the olympians will help choose which aspiring athletes get the free cars the campaign will give away 100 cars worth 35 million in preparation for the sydney games an advertising and marketing campaign worth about 30 million will promote the donations the advertising , carrying the slogan the team behind the team , will begin during the nba finals next month and will continue for the 15 remaining months before the summer games in sydney the ads will show gm and its union , the united automobile workers , supporting olympic hopefuls by giving them cars to help them get to workouts and practices athletes will be given brands of gm vehicles whose buyers most closely relate to the athlete s sport , whether it is archery , swimming or wrestling in addition to its previously announced purchase of the national sponsorship of the official domestic car and truck for the united states olympic team , gm has also locked up sponsorships sold by the 13 nbc ownedandoperated local tv stations broadcasting the olympics agreements go until 2008 gm is also negotiating with other local stations to cover more markets with local sponsorships to further help concentrate its advertising so that viewers will associate individual gm models with specific sports , gm has become the official car and truck of the olympic s 37 different sports other auto makers will thus be prevented from associating their products with individual sports gm is not waiting for the olympics to begin to start associating its vehicles with the olympic sports , and its marketing executives think that will help the company s cars and trucks cut through the clutter of other olympic advertisers

peter pellegrino , who became so skystruck growing up in the lindbergh era that he devoted his life to aviation and pursued his interest back to the very dawn of manned flight , died on march 26 at a hospital near his home in newtown , pa he was 82 and had been a founder of the balloon federation of america a native of manhattan who grew up on long island , mr pellegrino was hardly the only child of the 1920 s to be captivated by charles a lindbergh s solo flight to paris others managed to outgrow their fascination mr pellegrino , who haunted roosevelt field and thrilled to the sight of the graf zeppelin , did not his mother , an italian immigrant with old world notions about careers , persuaded him to study business at new york university and get a job on wall street but he soon bolted , taking a 75 percent pay cut to join the army air corps in the late 1930 s learning to fly in a world war i jenny , mr pellegrino earned his pilot s rating , but a ruptured eardrum kept him out of combat he spent world war ii training military air traffic controllers after the war , he joined the forerunner of the federal aviation administration , working as an air traffic controller in philadelphia and eventually becoming tower chief at the north philadelphia airport his job qualified him to fly in the cockpits of commercial aircraft , and in time he earned pilot ratings for numerous aircraft and even acquired his own small plane but a newspaper article about ballooning took him in new directions and put him in the forefront of sports ballooning in america mr pellegrino took his first flight in 1952 and before long had become a mainstay of the balloon club of america , a grandiosely named group of philadelphia enthusiasts who flew gas balloons very much like the one that had been used for the first manned flight , in france in 1783 as president of the club , mr pellegrino was in the thick of the sport s development but his stint as a technical adviser for the balloon sequences in the 1956 movie around the world in 80 days was a lowaltitude task for even the most spectacular scenes aloft , the balloon was suspended from a crane mr pellegrino eventually became a balloon pilot examiner for the faa and validated ballooning records for the national aeronautic association , the american arm of the world governing body of the sport of aviation , the international aeronautical association , which is based in paris when the american organization sought to form a balloon division , mr pellegrino played a key role in creating the balloon federation of america in 1961 the philadelphia group and the balloon flyers of akron , the only other such club in the country , were the federation s initial members mr pellegrino was its first president the balloon federation is now made up of about 100 clubs across the country and more than 4 , 000 individual members , almost none of whom fly gas balloons that is partly because the hazards of hydrogen , a flammable gas , have led to prohibitive insurance costs partly because the inert alternative , helium , is so expensive that a single flight can cost several thousand dollars , but mainly because of the development of hotair balloons fueled by propane when hotair ballooning was perfected by ed yost in the 60 s , gasballoon purists turned up their noses but largely through the efforts of mr pellegrino , the international aeronautical association eventually recognized it as a legitimate competitive category he became the first american delegate to the association s ballooning committee and , later , its first american president for mr pellegrino , attending annual meetings in paris had an added attraction the opportunity to go ballooning in europe , something he did with great regularity after becoming the first american to pilot a balloon across the alps , in 1966 known mainly as a ballooning official , mr pellegrino had his moments aloft , notably in 1959 when he and a friend , seeking a distance record , took off from denver high winds thwarted the record , but when their balloon knocked out the power lines to colorado springs , they had the satisfaction of watching from the air as the entire city went dark after retiring from the faa in 1976 , mr pellegrino gave up ballooning , studied art in new york and turned out abstract paintings while indulging a longtime subsidiary interest in fast cars mr pellegrino , who was divorced , is survived by a son , peter jr , of fogelsville , pa photo peter pellegrino , who helped develop ballooning as a sport in the united states , working on the rigging of a balloon
imagine dialing an area code to call a new nextdoor neighbor picture installing a second telephone line at home and being assigned an area code different from your first number envision reprogramming your cellular phone and pager as well as changing the letterhead on your stationery because like it or not you have been assigned a new area code one or more of those scenarios is likely to happen by next year because 914 the only area code westchester has ever known has begun to exhaust its assignable numbers technology is to blame skyrocketing demand for additional phone lines for fax machines , modems and cellular phones has rapidly depleted the roughly eight million numbers available under each area code and increased competition in local phone service has added to the crunch as new companies are assigned large blocks of the remaining available phone numbers the county is facing what new york city , long island and parts of new jersey and connecticut have already grappled with giving up the comforting familiarity of an area code established for decades , in westchester s case since the early 1950 s the county is not the sole proprietor of area code 914 , and therein lies part of the problem as well as a good part of the current debate over a solution besides westchester , which had 914 first , the 914 region includes all of putnam , dutchess , rockland , orange and ulster counties as well as parts of sullivan , columbia , delaware and greene counties not one of those areas is eager to say goodbye to 914 either the solomonic decision of dividing the area for a new code is in the hands of the state s public service commission a decision is expected this fall and implementation could occur by the middle of next year , said edward collins , a spokesman for the commission historically , the commission has handled the problem in two ways one approach , the overlay , would superimpose a new area code over the entire 914 region new customers would be assigned numbers from either the old or the new area code , depending on availability the other method , a geographic split , would divide the area currently using 914 into two geographic regions , one of which would get a new area code rates would remain the same no matter which option is adopted , the commission said both approaches have benefits and disadvantages the chief advantage of the overlay plan is that none of the current residential and business customers would be assigned a new area code it would also spare those who own cellular phones and pagers from having to have them reprogrammed to accept the new code moreover , an overlay is easy to replicate once the new area code is exhausted , which the public service commission estimates will be in 2006 , a third area code could be superimposed the overlay plan poses problems , though people living or working in the same building could have different area codes conceivably , two numbers in the same household or office with more than one line could have different area codes over time , half of the calls now made in the 914 area code would require dialing 10 or 11 digits \( depending on whether it is necessary to dial 1 for numbers outside the area \) the geographic split has the advantage of allowing people in the hudson valley to retain their sense of identity keeping one area code for a specific designated locale moreover , it would not require so much dialing for local telephone calls but the split would make many people unhappy , primarily those who get the new area code as well as those cellular and pager users who must change with the change and once the newly carvedout region outgrows its area code , it would then have to be divided into smaller and smaller pieces of course there is the delicate issue of how to carve up the geography in westchester s case , the staff at the state department of public service , which reports to the commission , has considered two options one alternative cuts through central westchester roughly along the route 287 corridor under this plan , southern westchester would be assigned one area code , and northern westchester as well as all the other counties would receive another another possibility for a geographic split would divide westchester county from the rest of the counties now using 914 the division would begin roughly at the westchesterputnam boundary and also along the hudson river the proposal keeps all of peekskill , purdys , croton falls and the north salem area in the westchester portion of the split and puts all of putnam valley and mahopac in the northern and western portion both options are still under consideration , but the public service staff is recommending that if a geographic split is used , the plan that splits westchester from the rest of the counties should be adopted federal guidelines require that a geographic split offer similar relief for both areas , but cutting the 914 region in two would result in the part east of the hudson running out of numbers in two or three years , while the area on the west side of the river would not need a new code for more than a decade
somerset , ky , april 21 the last time some 60 , 000 people saw jason watts , most of them cheered lustily for him and his university of kentucky football team in commonwealth stadium in lexington it was last nov 14 , a beautiful fall afternoon in bluegrass country fans waved their blueandwhite banners , and the wildcats walloped vanderbilt and were joyously headed for a bowl game , their first in several years watts was the starting center , snapping the ball to tim couch , the allamerica quarterback and eventual no 1 pick in the national football league draft watts , a senior , was playing his last game before the home crowd , in front of his proud family and friends there was a lot to celebrate and that night , watts and two of his closest friends did that was five months ago on tuesday afternoon , the day after his 22d birthday , watts shuffled into the small , gray courtroom in the pulaski county courthouse here on main street in this quiet southcentral kentucky town his walk was impeded because his ankles were chained he also wore handcuffs with a chain that wound around his back and glinted under the fluorescent lighting when he took his seat three weeks before , on march 31 , watts had pleaded guilty to two counts of reckless homicide and asked to begin his jail term immediately his celebration with his friends that november night had turned tragic drunk , and on a whimsical predawn hunting excursion , the young men were involved in a horrific crash that sent all three flying out of watts s black pickup truck only watts survived so this week watts was back in court for sentencing , facing a maximum of 10 years in prison , reduced in plea bargaining from 20 years even with head bowed and wearing navy blue jail garb , jason watts , at 6 feet 3 inches , 270 pounds , still appeared imposing his dark hair was cut short , and his features clean and freshfaced genial and seemingly big enough to lift the front end of a bus , he sat at a table with his lawyer , james lowry , and faced the bespectacled judge , daniel venters the cheering of a football crowd was not even an echo now the only sounds were the scraping of chairs and an occasional low sob from the nearby visitors' bench , where watts s mother , debbie , and older sister , laura , sat holding crumpled tissues in their fists alongside them was watts s father , jim they had driven 12 hours from their home in oviedo , fla , to attend the sentencing absent were the parents of christopher scott brock and artie steinmetz , the two friends who were killed in the crash on highway 27 in the gray , early morning some 12 hours after the 5517 victory over vanderbilt watts was behind the wheel none of them wore seat belts blood tests showed that all three of them were drunk at the time of the crash , with watts having a bloodalcohol content of 015 percent , well above the legal limit of 010 lowry made an appeal to the judge for leniency because watts had shown profound contrition , accepted responsibility from the beginning and agreed to speak to high school students in alcohol and drugprevention programs the prosecutor , ed montgomery , acknowledged all this nonetheless , two people were killed in an accident he caused , montgomery said we have to make clear the severity of the offense , and a lesser sentence would depreciate the seriousness of it the judge asked watts if he had anything to say i just want to say , he said , eyes lowered , words coming slowly , that that i'm sorry again for all the people i let down the judge acknowledged the various positions , said he was somewhat skeptical about watts s talking to students implying that obtaining a lighter sentence might have been an ulterior motive but said that if it had done some good , then it was , ultimately , good ten years , he decreed jason watts s mother let out a low moan , and his sister sobbed and buried her head in her mother s shoulder his father had reached over and was holding their hands , tears welling behind his glasses , as watts was led out of the courtroom and back to the pulaski county detention center a history of abuse leads to disaster it began , said watts , hands selfconsciously in his pockets , on what was the greatest day of my life i could never have imagined that 12 hours later it turned into the worst day of my life this was in midapril , and watts was in the russell springs high school gymnasium , talking to 1 , 200 students as part of a state drive smart campaign he noted the victory over vanderbilt after the game we were screaming and yelling and we were all on cloud nine , he continued nothing could bring us down after i showered and changed clothes , i went outside and there was a big crowd of people waiting for the players one of those waiting at the gate was brock , 21 , whom everyone called scott , a highschool teammate of tim couch s who attended eastern kentucky but who still visited couch and watts a lot they went back to watts s apartment and were eventually joined by artie steinmetz
highland lakes samantha the bear came from the wawayanda state park into susan and vincent kehoe s woodsy backyard and acted outrageously cute , lolling on her back , eating from their hands and , over the years , bringing about 15 cubs to visit the kehoes keep a framed 8by10 photograph of samantha in their kitchen samantha is a real new jersey black bear fat and healthy , prolific and willing to charm humans this last quality has been , for bears , a very useful trait as human habitat has grown and sprawled in new jersey , bear habitat has grown and sprawled faster a population of fewer than 30 in the 1970 s has grown to about 650 , and is spreading from its base here in the state s northernmost reaches of sussex county but the humans , by and large , do n't mind and while december was to have brought the state s first bear hunt since 1970 , under recommendations that the division of fish , game and wildlife made last year , public opposition headed it off the result is a break for bears and a standoff among people with the hunt opposed even by the head of the department of environmental protection , the division s parent agency , wildlife officials abandoned their proposal for a oneday bear season when they drew up the annual hunting and fishing code at the same time , legislation that would protect bears by banning hunting is stalled in committee in both the assembly and senate we think that at some time the public will decide what s enough , said bob mcdowell , director of the fish and game division , who said nuisance complaints about bears were rising quickly while wildlife officials were hardpressed to find places to relocate the problem bears bob eriksen , the department s supervising wildlife biologist , said last week that the unofficial count for 1998 was 900 , up from 547 last year none involved serious threats to people there are no reports of black bears in eastern states ever killing a human , and injuries are minor and rare but farmers are irate about damage and livestock kills , and mr eriksen said there had been about a dozen incidents of bears breaking into houses you ca n't tell a 400pound black bear he ca n't go in , he said blueberry muffins smell real good to a bear walking by the potential for conflict is aggravated , wildlife officials say , when people attract bears by offering food or garbage and then complain when a few of the foragers , having lost their fear of humans , behave badly ms kehoe agrees , which is why she stopped the backyard feedings and started working with a group that encourages homeowners to keep bears away from their property you really do n't do this , she said wistfully while watching a videotape from the days when her husband would dip into an entenmann s box and hand cookies to a cub for one thing , ms kehoe said , feeding is now forbidden by ordinance in her township , vernon , as in neighboring west milford and since several new houses were built nearby , there are kids , she said , and you ca n't have them hanging around finally , she agrees with the wildlife biologists that for their own good bears should be frightened of humans but ms kehoe , who works as a secretary in boonton and lives on a dirt road near a mountain lake , is appalled by the idea of a bear hunt these guys walk around with loaded guns and fuzzy brains , she said , looking apologetically at her husband , who hunts rabbits and birds but cannot bring himself to shoot a deer ms kehoe added that there would be a lot of injured bears , especially since hunting would take place just before hibernation , when the animals have grown thick coats and layers of fat even as wildlife officials report increasing complaints from lakeside communities like this one , a survey cited in its bear management plan found this vicinity to be overwhelmingly hospitable to bears of 300 residents in northern sussex and passaic counties , just 28 said the local bear population should be reduced and 15 favored a hunt when asked if they had had encounters with bears , 217 said yes , and of those , 185 said the experience was positive at ariane s restaurant here , the owner , steve imbarrato , said bear sightings in the area had become common only in the last four or five years i think they 're cool , he said people who want to hunt bear that mystifies me well , a lot of people will shoot bambi , too theodore muller , a semiretired carpenter and handyman who had stopped for coffee , said he heard recently about a bear breaking into a house and polishing off freshbaked pies but when asked if he could support a hunt , mr muller , who moved here in 1947 , said , oh , i hate to see anything get killed this sentiment is persuasive to the commissioner of environmental protection , robert c shinn jr when the fish and game division proposed the hunt in its bearmanagement report in 1997 , mr shinn responded with a letter saying that that was not the department s plan i did n't think we had exhausted other solutions , mr shinn said in an interview in the department s subsequent hearings on the issue , he said , the public was very significantly against hunting i'm not closed to a hunt , he said in an interview , but i think it has to be a last resort animalrights advocates would rather limit development than bears they do n't overpopulate , said angi metler , director of the new jersey animal rights alliance we do since bear hunting was prohibited in 1971 , the bear and human populations have burgeoned in the same places sussex , warren , passaic and morris counties the wildlife agency projects that by 2006 the state s bear population will exceed 900 a number that it says can be supported by the environment but not by human neighbors the agency places the ideal bear population at about 300 mr eriksen said bear country had already spread south from interstate 80 to interstate 78 one bear was recently knocking at the door of trenton , on the rider university campus in lawrence , he said , and another was sighted in hamilton township , south of route 1 the black bear s recovery follows a nationwide pattern bears are found in 42 states while hunting is allowed in most of those with bear populations over 1 , 000 , including pennsylvania and new york , it is prohibited in 14 of the 15 states with fewer than 550 bears but for bears , wildlife officials say , there s no place like new jersey these are the biggest bears in north america , mr mcdowell said they reproduce more rapidly here than anywhere else mr eriksen , whose small staff must corral and relocate bears that wander into urban areas , said one advantage of a hunt would be to make them more wary of people there s not likely a bear alive in new jersey today , he said , who really has had to live in fear of his or her hide photos the kehoes no longer feed samantha , and would not welcome bear hunting susan and vincent kehoe in their backyard in highland lakes samantha , a black bear ,

the talented mr ripley ripley under ground ripley s game by patricia highsmith 877 pages everyman s library alfred a knopf 26 tom ripley , the hero of these three novels by patricia highsmith , is an american arriviste who reinvents himself as a continental gentleman , a smalltime con man who evolves into an urbane serial killer by the end of these three novels \( reissued in a single volume for everyman s library \) , ripley has murdered more than half a dozen people acts that barely cause a ripple in his conscience or genteel lifestyle he is at once a less bizarre , more bourgeois version of hannibal lecter and an illustration of highsmith s deeply cynical view that all human beings are corruptible , that as one of her characters in hitchcock s adaptation of strangers on a train remarks , everyone is a potential murderer although this volume is decidedly uneven , it can serve as an introduction , for readers unfamiliar with patricia highsmith s crime fiction , to her chilly , misanthropic world it is a world in which murderers are rarely caught , much less brought to justice a world in which identity is permeable and the macabre and the banal , the insane and rational , live serenely side by side over the years tom ripley has been portrayed on screen by such disparate actors as alain delon , dennis hopper and now matt damon \( who stars in anthony minghella s forthcoming adaptation of the talented mr ripley \) , and he emerges from highsmith s novels as the consummate quickchange artist a wouldbe actor who delights in disguise and impersonation a novelist manque who uses his gifts of fantasy and imagination to lie , manipulate and elude his stories were good , highsmith writes , because he imagined them intensely , so intensely that he came to believe them when we first meet tom in the talented mr ripley \( 1955 \) , he is still a smalltime con man living in a shabby apartment in new york and eking out a living with smalltime scams an encounter with the wealthy father of an acquaintance , however , abruptly alters the course of his life dickie greenleaf s father asks ripley to go to europe and persuade his prodigal son to return home , and like lambert strether in henry james s ambassadors \( a book highsmith pointedly alludes to \) ripley soon finds himself in europe , acting as a family emissary dickie resists ripley s entreaties to return to the states , but the two men , who look like mirror images of each other , quickly become best friends much to the irritation of marge , a young american woman in love with the handsome and worldly dickie in fact , ripley himself harbors an infatuation with dickie , an infatuation made up in equal parts of sexual attraction , narcissism and envy on a holiday trip those emotions erupt into murderous rage , and after killing dickie , ripley assumes his identity a scenario seemingly borrowed from this novel by the 1975 antonioni movie the passenger and a recent novel called stealing lives by michael pye ripley eventually discards dickie s persona and passport but not before killing another man , and concocting an ingenious ruse to thwart the police and acquire dickie s estate henceforth , with dickie s money , he settles down to a comfortable life in the french countryside with a wealthy wife like dickie , he takes up painting and acquires a taste for fine art and clothes and antiques he learns several languages and takes frequent trips abroad in short , he adopts dickie s life of a gentleman dilettante the talented mr ripley not only demonstrates highsmith s gift for using the genre conventions of the mystery novel to explore the existential ambiguities of identity , but it also attests to her keen gift for psychological insight by chronicling the ordinary details of ripley s life and the logical workings of his mind , she forces us to reevaluate the lines between reason and madness , normal and abnormal , while goading us into sharing her treacherous hero s point of view unfortunately , the two ripley sequels in this volume are decidedly flimsier , more perfunctory productions although ripley under ground \( 1970 \) gets off to a promising start , immersing ripley in the messy fallout of an art forgery scam , it soon devolves into a series of grisly set pieces and a hasty ending that improbably frees ripley to appear in yet another novel as for ripley s game \( 1974 \) , it tries to resurrect the theme of doppelgangers featured in the talented mr ripley and strangers on a train by pairing ripley , the veteran killer , with a firsttime murderer named jonathan trevanny trevanny is manipulated by ripley and one of ripley s friends into believing that he is dying and then is induced to pull off a mob hit in return for a large sum of money there is lots of hokey talk in this novel about the mafia and guns and garrotes , and several bloody shootouts none of which play to highsmith s psychological forte worse , ripley seems to have become an outandout madman a sadist who will play a cruel joke on an ailing man simply because he dislikes the man s manner a thrillseeking murderer who likes to celebrate his kills with a fine dinner or an expensive purchase his marriage to the zombielike heloise feels like a thorough sham she is not the least bit nonplussed by his dabblings in murder and is equally unconcerned about the frequent threats to his safety and their selfindulgent existence in the french countryside begins to feel like a lame parody of upperclass life because it s increasingly difficult for us to care about ripley , the sense of complicity highsmith wants to create between the reader and her characters dissolves instead of being immersed in their shadowy , venal world , as we were in the talented mr ripley , we are invited to feel smug and morally superior a fatal flaw in just about any novel photo patricia highsmith \( knopf \)
chicago , monday , july 5 the man suspected in a twostate shooting rampage against jews , blacks and asianamericans fatally shot himself on sunday night after police pursued him in rural southern illinois , an fbi spokesman in salem , ill , said today the suspect , benjamin nathaniel smith , 21 , abandoned his blue car at a truck stop in salem and stole a van , said doug garrison , a federal bureau of investigation spokesman mr smith was driving south while being chased by police and shot himself , mr garrison said the van crashed off the road and he was pronounced dead at a hospital fbi officials said they planned to check fingerprints to make certain the body is mr smith s , but jim kennedy , police chief in bloomington , ind , said two guns found with the body were consistent with two of the shootings in bloomington and chicago a light blue taurus sought by police was also at the scene mr kennedy said the body had a tattoo on the chest that said sabbath breaker , which mr smith was said to have mr smith had been the subject of the twostate search after shootings that began friday in chicago police also said shootings on saturday in springfield and urbana as well as a killing on sunday in bloomington appeared to be related the latest victim was a koreanamerican graduate student who was killed on sunday morning as he entered a church in bloomington , ind that followed an incident late saturday in urbana , in which an asianamerican student at the university of illinois was shot in the leg in an hourlong series of shootings in the chicago area on friday night , a former basketball coach at northwestern university , a black man , was killed as he walked with his children in his neighborhood , six orthodox jews were injured as they walked home from sabbath services and two asianamericans were shot at as they sat in their car at an intersection this man is on a spree , said chicago police cmdr william hayes he s shooting people all over in most of the shootings , a white man slowly drove a blue car , apparently prowling the streets for victims , and said nothing as he fired , first one handgun , then another while he reloaded the original , said patrick t camden , a chicago police spokesman in indiana , the police there said , the man waited in his car and fired as people entered the church the police have found matching shell casings at all the sites of the shootings mr smith , whose last known address was in bloomington , matched the general description of the killer , and owns a light blue ford taurus with a license plate matching the car that was seen leaving the indiana shooting , mr kennedy said a similar car was used in the earlier shootings , although no witness saw the license number the police said the crimes did not yet fit the legal definition of a hate crime , because they had no expression of hatred or motive from the shooter groups that monitor racial violence say the ku klux klan , white supremacist churches and other groups with similar ideologies have increased their membership dramatically in the midwest in the 1990 s mr smith had been a member of the world church of the creator , an antiblack , antichristian ,

people as being raped we 're losing our culture a lot of people do n't realize how angry the average white person is we 're told to be ashamed that we 're white we 're trying to choose the legal path , but occasionally some people take a violent course the church , which does not worship any god , is opposed to other organized religions and has faith only in the white race mr hale said it

kukes , albania , april 25 for the first time since nato began bombing yugoslavia , leaders of the rebel kosovo liberation army in northern albania spoke openly today with western reporters , detailing what they said were crippling shortages of ammunition and food in kosovo , and confusion within the rebel force itself although the guerrilla force openly has a base in this town , its representatives have growled at reporters and refused all requests for interviews or photographs for weeks today , the rebels produced a military spokesman who calls himself leopard ii , and a representative of the kosovo albanians' underground government like rebels who have previously met reporters in albania s capital , tirana , or commanders reached in kosovo by telephone from macedonia , they described fierce fighting between the rebel army and serbian troops across many areas in kosovo the underground government spokesman , gani sylaj , who said he is a former schoolteacher who spent 11 years in yugoslav jails for advocating freedom for kosovo , also accused the serbian security forces in kosovo of a list of massacres and rapes there was no way to confirm their accounts independently the sudden openness of the rebel organization in kukes appears to represent a new strategy organizing a meeting with reporters may have been the rebels' way of mitigating reports of thuggish acts by adherents of the guerrilla group , who had for a time appeared to take civil control of kukes , pulling people off the street for questioning , and enforcing order young refugees here often voice the fear that they will be grabbed by rebel army soldiers and forced to enlist the establishment of an office here also raises questions about the effect the rebels' activities will have on the political landscape of albania , whose northeast is the political stronghold of former president sali berisha his government lost control of this rugged , mountainous country before he lost election in june 1997 the current albanian government openly backs the rebels' aim of independence , but unlike mr berisha , whose family property in the northeastern albanian town of tropoja has served the rebels as a weapons depot in the past says it does not back the rebels militarily the rebels' representative would not say whether support was coming from mr berisha , or that he has designs on using the conflict to return to power leopard ii , who said he had served in the yugoslav army until 1990 and attended the military academy in zagreb , said the rebels currently are strongest in northeastern kosovo , where he said civilians are unable to flee because the region abuts serbia proper the commander said the rebels control about 70 percent of that area the rebel leaders expressed unlimited support for continued nato bombings and a planned oil embargo of yugoslavia and called for ground troops who they said could be guided by rebel leaders , thus reducing allied casualties citing terrible conditions , they also renewed calls for airdrops of food nato has been reluctant to lend open support to the rebel organization , which last winter was seen as violating the ceasefire in kosovo almost as often as the serbs founded in the early 1990 s , the rebel group developed slowly and unsteadily then , in 1997 , chaos in neighboring albania provided a windfall mr berisha s government fell after crooked pyramid schemes collapsed armories were looted and the country was flooded with one million cheap automatic rifles many got into rebel hands the murder of a leading rebel organizer , adem jashari , in march 1998 encouraged many kosovo albanians to switch support from the pacifist tactics of their political leaders to the rebels , who were fighting for independence but have appeared unprepared to assume political leadership mr sylaj , the underground government representative , conceded today that the rebel army has yet to mature recruits from the albanian diaspora have been streaming into albania , the rebels say it is unclear how many of them have actually been sent to fight the rebel group has been running a recruitment campaign on albanian television in one spot , videotape of civilians wounded in a serbian attack is shown over footage of rebel recruits being trained at the end of the spot a voice sings , in english , that s why we are here the spokesmen insisted that all the recruits are volunteers , denying that young men are being picked up off the streets and forced to join and they denied that the rebels received financial support from drug trafficking or other illegal activities there is no money laundering , no drug money , none at all , said mr sylaj he said the bulk of the army s funding comes from contributions sent by more than 100 , 000 kosovo albanians living abroad there have been independent reports of more than 50 rebel soldiers being brought to the albanian hospital at bajram curri , near the border north of here leopard ii would not confirm the number of casualties but did say soldiers had been wounded in border skirmishes and in fighting within kosovo photo gani sylaj , of the kosovo albanians' underground government , addressing reporters with him is leopard ii , a rebel spokesman \( edward keating the new york times \)
great neck when they first came here they went to waldbaum s , said rabbi marvin tokayer , spiritual leader of the cherry lane minyan in kings point at the checkout counter the bill was 8354 and the response was , 'what do you want for cash \? ' they would start bargaining in the old country , you bargained you bargained over everything here , there is no bargaining you either pay the cashier or you 're not buying it frequently they walked out because they did n't get a discount they are the iranian jews who fled to the united states at the time of the khomeini revolution two decades ago many settled in great neck , where years earlier a small beachhead had been established in the last 10 years , as persian synagogues , restaurants and shops opened , thousands more iranians moved in and this upscale community became the biggest center of iranian jewish life on the east coast but becoming part of a liberal north shore suburb has not been easy a rift lingers in the iranians' relations with the longestablished , more assimilated jewish communities that still predominate on the peninsula despite an increase in cooperation , collaboration and friendship between old and new residents , the grumbling and the negative preconceptions have not gone away as in the five towns area in the southwest corner of nassau county , where an influx of orthodox jews has produced resentment among longtime secular jewish residents , the tension in the county s northwest corner is between jews but in addition to the religious differences found in the five towns confrontation , the discord in great neck also has ethnic overtones the persians speak farsi , tend to be darkerskinned and come from the sephardic , or mediterranean , branch of judaism , while most american jews are of ashkenazic descent , originally from eastern or central europe the sum of their linguistic , religious and cultural differences is big enough to set up an usversusthem mentality when people around here discuss this cultural and ethnic divide , the newcomers are the persians the oldtimers are the americans the rumor on the street is that these people are cheap , that they do n't spend money , rabbi tokayer said of the persians there are a lot of jokes about being parsimonious paradoxically , however , it is the persians' wealth that may be the biggest source of resentment they are not just moving in , but moving up persians are responsible for much of the housing boom on the great neck peninsula , where palatial homes are being built on lots where ranches and cape codstyle cottages once stood according to the stereotype , rabbi tokayer said , the gaudiest of these new houses belong to the persians rabbi tokayer , whose orthodox congregation of 100 families is the only halfpersian , halfashkenazic synagogue in the area , finds the stereotypes offensive from my perspective , it s xenophobic , he said we say this , and we do n't realize it , about every immigrant community it s the same story and in one generation it all changes the stories may well be apocryphal , but the illusion persists , said william helmreich , that we have gone from the gilded ghetto to a persian bazaar the problem is , the stories are made up after the opinions are formed , said dr helmreich , a 16year resident of great neck and a sociologist specializing in race relations who was hired as a consultant to one of the local persian organizations about five years ago to help the community acculturate when people decide they do n't like the persians , they can find all these stories that make the rounds the woman who goes to waldbaum s and bargains , nobody has met this woman nobody has verified the story , but it s a great story to tell but at eilat prime meats , a persianowned butcher shop on middle neck road , a sign written in farsi and posted as recently as last week warned shoppers against bargaining , and rabbi tokayer said he had seen it done elsewhere i saw that as late as three months ago in the cleaning store , he said they got away with it they brought a lot of cleaning and they were bargaining and they paid less like the rest of long island , great neck has become an increasingly diverse community hispanics , asians , indians , israelis , russians and south africans jews and gentiles have also settled here in the past year , an iraqi group built its own synagogue and a syrian congregation is building a house of worship there has also been a flow of more observant jews who frequent the same kosher butchers and sabbathobservant shops as the persians but when a newcomer does something that an more established resident finds frustrating , it is the persians who tend to get dumped on and when a persian s plan for his dream home is refused by the local architectural review board , it s all the americans' fault the oldtimers complaints about 'bazaar mentality' henry yusen , 73 , moved to great neck in 1929 back in those days , he said , there were very few jews but everyone got along his mother ran a store in town , gertrude yusen stationery
vincent jones cannot forget the first time he saw the homeless man , so skinny he was holding up his pants with one hand and holding onto the wall with the other a police officer was rousting the man from his regular square of sidewalk on 39th street near seventh avenue and mr jones walked past as he had walked past so many men like him over the years , men drinking and drugging themselves into the grave in the dismal orbit of the port authority bus terminal but something mr jones still finds it hard to explain drew him back the look on that man s face , he says now the man , raymond lawrence , asked mr jones for a quarter mr jones gave him two he bought him a cup of coffee and a baconandegg sandwich he asked the man please not to spend his money on alcohol , and then he walked away , sure he would never see him again that was three years ago late last month , mr jones pulled his battered gray minivan up to a tiny , white , shingled house in portsmouth , va , where he and mr lawrence stepped out then mr lawrence s 73yearold mother , alberta , walked slowly onto the lawn with her arms in the air , crying she had not heard any word of her son since 1996 , and , despite her prayers and those of every member in two virginia baptist churches during that time , she had given him up for dead the act of charity that brought about the reunion that october evening was unlikely enough but in its details , the story of the bond that developed between a stocky , easygoing 56yearold garment district delivery man from queens village and a troubled , 51yearold alcoholic becomes even more unlikely in the months and years after that chance encounter on 39th street , mr jones began to slowly and doggedly work his way into mr lawrence s life he discovered several things that the homeless man who usually had trouble opening a bottle of thunderbird had once been an accomplished jazz pianist and attended the berklee college of music in boston that one of mr lawrence s sisters worked in midtown and regularly took the bus from new jersey to the port authority , never knowing that her lost brother was usually lying on the sidewalk one block away and he discovered that mr lawrence s mother , still working as a nurse , lived only five miles from where mr jones himself had been born and raised in norfolk , va to mr jones , a deeply religious man , few of these things were particularly surprising and none were coincidental i truly believe that god led me to raymond , he says sometimes i would even say to him , 'lord , why do i keep running into this man \? ' and yet , with his faith and scriptures at the ready , even mr jones finds it hard to believe that today , the same raymond lawrence he knew on the streets will sit down with his mother and his nephew s family in newport news , va , for his first family thanksgiving dinner in years in truth , mr jones said , there were times when i said to myself 'i am going to watch this man die out here' over the last month , the story of what the handtruck delivery man did for the homeless man has spread slowly through the garment district like a kind of urban legend mr jones has taken on the dimensions of a samaritan too good to be believed paul mcdonald , a homelessoutreach worker who had struggled to help mr lawrence for three years , said , i was suspicious at first barbara randall , executive director of the fashion center business improvement district who heard about the story from the agency s security guards and later mentioned it to a newspaper editor said she had decided that mr jones must be totally crazy she described mr lawrence as a fixture in this district for so long , and he was not just a nuisance he was offensive she added that he was often covered in urine and feces , and bellowed at passersby when he was drunk we were always kind of hoping that something would happen to him we did n't think it would be anything good but when people who have heard the story stop mr jones to express wonder at what he did , he will usually only pause for a moment and concede , i guess it is a little unusual , is n't it \? over the last three years , that never seemed to occur to him at first , he would seek out the homeless man in the middle of his fabric deliveries and offer a dollar here and there and food whenever he asked for it on a couple of occasions , when he could not stand to see mr lawrence shaking so uncontrollably , mr jones would break down and buy him a bottle of cheap wine but he soon vowed never to do that again and he stopped giving money altogether , because he knew it would end up in the athens liquor store on 40th street near the port authority but alcohol was all mr lawrence wanted , and it was often not easy for mr jones to refuse him when he saw the frail man beaten by fellow homeless men or crying because they had robbed him in the night mr lawrence s shoes were stolen so often that , through the winters , the toes on his left foot became unbearably painful one night in 1998 , he said , i guess i dialed 911 because i could n't walk no more
the ball rose off todd pratt s bat with one out in the bottom of the 10th inning yesterday and carried with it the mets' increasingly startling season the team has endured a near fatal losing streak , a onegame playoff just to get to the playoffs , a meeting with randy johnson and a manager s remarkably illtimed comments and that was all within the last 10 days but could the mets endure the long wait for pratt s ball to come down at the centerfield wall , in a game tied at 33 \? when he hit it , i saw steve finley going back real slowly , shawon dunston said of the diamondbacks' center fielder he timed it he s not a gold glover for nothing when he came down calm , i thought he had it then he came down too calm , and i knew it was gone it was gone finley at first thought he had it and the mets continued to spin their throughthelookingglass tale with a 43 victory over arizona that propels them into the national league championship series that begins tuesday against them again the atlanta braves but for a moment yesterday , atlanta was a distant figment as the mets' fairy tale went surround sound with mike piazza watching from the bench for the second day with a thumb swollen almost as big as his catcher s mitt , pratt his littleused backup stopped dead between first and second , until he saw finley put his head down then , the umpire twirled his finger and the mets galloped onto the infield grass , the hysterical crowd shaking shea stadium the mets tried everything from saying novenas to blowing smoke on their bats in an attempt to pull their season together after their disastrous sevengame september collapse , instigated by the braves and something they did must have worked they are the first mets team to win a playoff series since the world series champions of 1986 , and the first wildcard team to advance out of a division series since the florida marlins in 1997 and the marlins went on to win the world series with you can practically see the planets lining up , ca n't you \? al leiter pitching game 7 there was so much talk about piazza being out , said leiter , who pitched seven and twothird innings of threehit ball yesterday and left with the mets leading , 21 obviously , we miss mike a great deal , but having todd come up it s just a great story it s so fitting of what s going on with our season , to have the ups and downs of the season , and have it work out the way it did maybe something special is going to happen something special has already happened to a team that is collapse and redemption all wrapped into one this game was that theme writ small , a lead lost and then a game salvaged through a collection of contributions from some of the team s least heralded players along with some of their more famous teammates together , they produced an extraordinary game of dramatic swings when it was over , someone asked mets manager bobby valentine if he had ever been involved in a more thrilling , emotional contest well , yes , he responded , flipping through his mental daytimer this , he said , is standard operating procedure for this time it began predictably enough with an edgardo alfonzo home run in the fourth inning to give the mets a 10 lead alfonzo hit two home runs in game 1 of this series , so his shot to left was hardly out of the norm meanwhile , leiter , pitching marvelously for the third straight game , mowed down arizona for the first four innings , but greg colbrunn tied the game in the fifth with his own solo home run then came the bottom of the sixth , when it looked like the mets might pull away rickey henderson , the catalyst for much of the offense during this series , led off with a bloop single that the former met bernard gilkey slid for , but dropped one out later , john olerud lined a shot into the leftcenter gap and henderson went to third with olerud stopping at first benny agbayani , batting cleanup behind olerud because piazza was on the bench , then smacked a double to rightcenter that scored henderson to give the mets the lead , although the mets were unable to capitalize further why was agbayani batting cleanup in the first place , both yesterday and friday night \? because in triple a , i batted benny fourth from the first day i had him , valentine offered by way of explanation that would have made a great story in itself if agbayani s run batted in had stood up as the gamewinner but with two out in the eighth , valentine said he began to sense that leiter was losing his concentration first , leiter walked the pinchhitter turner ward then tony womack hit a bouncer to second alfonzo , normally surehanded , tried a backhand stab , but bobbled the ball and now there were runners on first and second leiter was out of the game , and he tipped his cap to the crowd of 56 , 177 as he departed but he was n't going far he sat sweating in the dugout with the team s fireball closer , armando benitez , who had not allowed a hit in his last four appearances , trying to finish off the game but benitez had trouble just finishing off the eighth on a 21 pitch , he gave up a double off the leftfield wall by jay bell that scored two runs , stunned the crowd and put arizona ahead , 32

connecticut s theater artists take refuge in regional theaters to shut out the allaboutmoney mentality of broadway turning to films and television and voiceovers can no longer be scorned or resisted as the means to high visibility and good living , especially in hard times when life , as oscar wilde said of his , is reduced to the barest luxuries though mass media may be the means to the plush life , live performance remains the end , a renewing workout sustaining for the soul , essential for the brain the best actors are those whose art and craft arise from stage training and technique , and the most professionally centered and generous return to live theater for replenishment and reaffirmation moviegoers are still discovering the dramatic resources of meryl streep , but they know little of her reserves yale drama school s illustrious graduate was acclaimed for her onstage comic performances on and off broadway and in two musicals , not to mention two shakespearean roles , years before hollywood anointed her with a supporting role although ms streep , who lives in connecticut , has yet to return to her roots , even for a limited run , as jane alexander did on broadway last year , she regularly takes part in unpublicized readings in connecticut and in westchester county indeed , ms streep read the role ms alexander played in honour on broadway last year and who recalls ms alexander s promising hedda gabler in stamford , more than 15 years ago , the same season dianne wiest played the same role at yale rep \? other stars with connecticut or westchester addresses travel with ease to western massachusetts where in the summer , theater flowers just as it fades in connecticut even though hartford stage has been expanding activities this summer on an experimental basis \( though not with new productions \) , summer shows in connecticut are evermore sparse , mostly retreads as even summer stock dwindles in contrast , the adventurous , significant and glittering connect most famously in the berkshires at the williamstown theater festival there , such actors and directors as joanne woodward , james naughton , eileen heckart , maureen anderman and jeffrey demunn and do n't forget a connecticutbased playwright named arthur miller emerged with new honors just these past two weeks when illness forced ms heckart to withdraw from the waverly gallery , a work in progress by the excellent kenneth lonergan , who wrote this is our youth , one of the best off broadway plays of the past two seasons , ms woodward , script in hand , took over in the production that closed last sunday at williamstown s nikos stage on the williamstown main stage , mr naughton , a renaissance man of theater , directed the price , a more than 30yearold , still underrated play , by mr miller that was right after mr naughton wrapped up his oneman popular song and talk fest , street of dreams , which moved from manhattan theater club and off broadway to the westport country playhouse and no observer of the living history of avantgarde drama can responsibly overlook the appearances of joseph chaikin in texts for nothing by samuel beckett , on thursday at 8 pm and friday at 2 pm at the berkshire theater festival in stockbridge , where lives of the saints , the newest collection of plays by the wild and crazy david ives , is to run through saturday mr naughton s production , which closes after today s 2 pm matinee , is the most gripping realization of the price in this theatergoer s memory , which goes back to the play s opening night at the morosco theater , home to the original production of death of a salesman the theater was demolished , along with two other theaters to make way for the marriottmarquis hotel in 1985 and symbolically , a new broadway a 30yearold theatergoer from new york went on about the price and its impact to three people she met at a party back home one theater student and two teachers of english , none of whom had ever heard of the play need one say more about the new broadway , the state of arts education in new york city or the sense of theater history , perhaps everywhere \? mr miller s play was last seen in connecticut in 1991 when stefan schnabel \( who died in march at the age of 87 in italy \) played the registered , licensed , even vaccinated furniture appraiser at the nowdefunct rainbow theater in norwalk the story is as much a reflection of the contemporary family in crisis , as it was , in the first place , about the still smoldering fallout of the great depression some 30 years later the price is also a reminder of character complexity , dense plot and unresolved conflicts that drove traditional theater and involved audiences , before agenda theater gay theater , ethnic theater , feminist theater dismantled a collective ideal of the stage , diminishing its identity in the name of reinvention , crying out for inclusion while fostering exclusivity and coining the evermore meaningless cliche , political correctness
the young californiaborn baritone rodney gilfry is best known for creating the role of stanley kowalski in andre previn s operatic version of a streetcar named desire last year , a san francisco opera production that was broadcast on public television he was a hunky and volatile stanley vocally , however , the underwritten role did not serve to reveal the range of mr gilfry s gifts a better indication came on friday night at weill recital hall , where the baritone presented his new york debut recital with the pianist grant gershon mr gilfry is a refined singer and a thoughtful musician the allfrench first half of his program was unusual and interesting , with a set of baroque arias and works by rameau , lully and pierre de la garde as well as a felicitously selected group of songs by faure and ravel mr gilfry studied for six years with the french baritone martial singher and has acquired an idiomatic sense of style and language from his revered teacher mr gershon s accompaniments were musically sensitive and rhythmically crisp that said , on a purely vocal level , mr gilfry would seem to have a fine but not exceptional baritone voice though essentially a lighter lyric singer , he produced a robust sound when called for and sang high , soft phrases with sweet , poignant tone there was a grainy quality to the sound in the lowertomiddle range , and his bottom notes sometimes bottomed out the second half of his program was devoted to music by 20thcentury americans vernon duke , paul bowles and ricky ian gordon all the songs , in various ways , draw from american vernacular musical styles mr gilfry sings english clearly no texts were provided , and none were needed but his taste in american music is not mine bowles wrote some exquisite songs , but the only ones singers seem to program , as mr gilfry did , are the blue mountain ballads , to texts by tennessee williams , which ineptly incorporate musical elements from jazz and blues mr gordon is understandably popular with singers his songs are well gauged vocally and hover between popular and contemporary classical styles in a way that many listeners respond to but the songs lack distinction and are sometimes cloying for fresh and transforming use of vernacular musical materials , one of mr gilfry s encores , ives s charlie rutlage , clobbered the other american works mr gilfry has expressed interest in acting as a profession given his looks and charisma , he could probably be successful but it would be a shame to lose him to music , for he has much to offer photo the baritone rodney gilfry in his new york debut at weill recital hall \( steve j sherman \)

hazard , ky , july 5 the clinton years have been lush for lawyers , investment bankers and internet explorers but some pockets of america remain largely untouched by the prosperity of the 1990 s , and president clinton is devoting much of this week to bringing them compassion and the hope of new jobs here in eastern kentucky , where poverty and unemployment run two to three times higher than the national averages , the president today presented a package of proposals intended to spur investment among the idle coal fields mr clinton hopes to use federal tax credits and loan guarantees to inspire private companies to build plants and stores in appalachia to serve a population that the economic boom has largely passed by it is a familiar strategy for this administration , except that the proposed new markets are in economically distressed regions of the united states , not in zimbabwe or ukraine the administration has aggressively used government tax breaks and loan subsidies to encourage investment by american corporations in developing countries , but it has never focused similar efforts in a systematic way on struggling communities in the united states even though this is a blessed time for america , not all americans have been blessed by it , mr clinton said before a heatwilted crowd in this mountain town this is a time to bring more jobs and investment and hope to the areas of our country that have not fully participated in this economic recovery we have an obligation to do it he picked the right place to make his point david deal , 58 , a laidoff medical supply worker from the depressed coalmining town of cumberland , about 40 miles away , said that government officials always talked about bringing jobs and investment to this region , but that the waiting continued lyndon johnson was here in '64 but all the things he was talking about have n't reached down to the people here , mr deal said clinton keeps talking about wanting us off welfare , but he has n't brought us any jobs one of his neighbors , darlene hall , 41 , said that she was organizing a prayer rally in cumberland next week to try to enlist god in the search for employment and ms hall said she had a message for industrialists looking for a stable work force we are not pickandshovel uneducated people in the mountains , she said we are hardworking people , used to working in the mines we are educated and we want to work with an entourage of corporate executives , members of congress , cabinet officers and the rev jesse l jackson , mr clinton is embarked on a fourday , sixstate tour of islands of poverty among the general prosperity he plans to visit clarksdale , miss , a poor town in the mississippi delta east st louis , ill the pine ridge indian reservation in south dakota a barrio in phoenix and the watts neighborhood of los angeles he takes a briefcase full of what he hopes are tools to create jobs , including community development financial institutions , empowerment zones and enterprise communities , america s private investment companies , smallbusiness investment companies , newmarkets venture capital firms and newmarkets lending companies taken together , the new and existing programs are intended to prompt as much as 15 billion in privatesector investment in poor urban and rural areas over the next five years most of 1 billion in federal subsidies to underwrite the programs would require congressional action , but mr clinton has not sent all the specific legislation to capitol hill critics have questioned the timing of the initiative , coming in the seventh year of mr clinton s presidency , when he longer has need for the votes of suburban soccer moms or the financial support of wealthy donors he has spent countless days canvassing the prosperous precincts of the nation over the last six and a half years , bringing comfort to the comfortable and shoveling up campaign contributions from equityrich democrats in beverly hills , silicon valley , manhattan and palm beach presidential aides said that mr clinton spent his early years in office insuring the general welfare through fiscal discipline and targeted tax cuts that had cemented the fortunes of the middle class now he can turn to the 35 million americans who remain mired in poverty as the tide of prosperity lifts the boats of others around them , they said the fact that the country is doing so well right now may , indeed , provide a better atmosphere for the president to put this challenge to the private sector , said gene sperling , the white house s chief economic adviser in a period of prosperity like this , a presidential message of bringing everybody along may be more well received , and you may be able to do more good now than if you were trying to do that at a time when the country , when everyone around the country , was hurting today mr clinton announced 15 million in housing and economic development grants to five eastern kentucky groups from the department of housing and urban development the money is intended to provide improved housing for migrant workers , job training and subsidized mortgage loans , the department said before he spoke here in hazard , mr clinton stopped in tyner , an eastern kentucky hamlet of mobile homes and 100 souls in jackson county mr clinton sought refuge from the wicked heat under a spreading walnut tree and spoke with jean collett , 48 , who recently left her job as a cook at a dairy queen to care for her father , ray pennington , who suffers from emphysema and breathes with the aid of a portable oxygen tank mr clinton sipped from a can of mountain dew and held mr pennington s hand as mrs collett explained the hardships of life in their pocket of appalachia bank loans are hard to come by , she said , because lenders demand collateral , of which she has none we do n't even apply for them , she told the president photo with shane harrison in the lead , president clinton

ever since receiving our new jersey saver rebate claim packet in the mail , we have begun to see illogic everywhere the packet tells us how to claim the rebate the state has decided to give us on the property taxes we just paid this causes us to ask , why were the taxes collected in the first place \? also , the governor brags in the packet that there will be further rebates in years to come , causing us to wonder , if we can already see that in 2002 we 're going to be passing out rebates , why not collect less in 2001 \? we know that different entities are doing the collecting and the rebating , but it would seem a simple matter for one to send a note to the other stop ! you 're collecting too much ! we have had lots of time to mull such things while waiting to get through on the tax rebate phone line and , as mentioned , we have begun to see illogic everywhere like in supermarkets and spelling bees we recently read that a few supermarkets in our state have installed machines that enable customers to check themselves out , in the grocery sense they can scan their own groceries , bill themselves on a credit card and escape without having contact with another human we had no idea such machines existed , although apparently they have been around for a decade we were so fascinated by the concept that we spent several hours looking at web sites about one of them , the uscan here is what we learned the uscan ranked no 5 on adams communications' list of the top 10 new products shown at scantech 1996 , some sort of convention we would not have thought there were 10 new products in the scanning field in 1996 , much less a convention celebrating them the slogan of psc inc , which makes the uscan , is , when you need to read a bar code we rank this no 3 on our 10 least inspired company slogans list a company official once said of the uscan , our throughput is accounting for onethird of the customers on a volume basis we think this comment speaks for itself at least we hope so , because we have no idea what it means john t niccollai , president of local 464a of the united food and commercial workers in little falls , says selfscanners have n't caught on yet , but he knows they 're going to ultimately replace some workers when i get up at a membership meeting , i tell the members quite candidly there s no way you can stop technology , he said mr niccollai tries to insure that any such job losses are by attrition even so , it s a gloomy prospect , for two reasons a lot of the people who work at groceries are young parttimers , summer help and no machine will ever be able to answer groceryrelated questions what s the freshest aciniform produce today \? where do i find ingredients for my roux , and how much saccharinity is there in these oranges \? we need to have interaction with the checker and the customer , mr niccollai said if that s not there , it s kind of a cold , callous way to get your groceries indeed , cold as a prairillon during plenilune that s all very well , you 're saying , but why have we suddenly started using 10 words in a 5cent column \? because one of our least favorite events is coming up the national spelling bee we are sorry for proselyting , but we have never liked the contest , never found it remotely anodyne there is something freakish about celebrating a child s ability to spell words that no one ever actually uses to underscore the point , we have just sprinkled in some of the words from last year s bee that eliminated new jersey contestants indeed , misspelling prairillon a small prairie cost a 12yearold from howell the title and this brings us to the illogic the invention of spellcheck has made beerelated skills obsolete , yet shortly we 'll be celebrating some kid s ability to spell ravigote or ankylosaur meanwhile scanning machines will be slowly making youthful supermarket checkers obsolete , and no one will give a hoot we would like to point out that plenty of grocery store executives can say , i started out 30 years ago working the checkout line , but almost none can say , i started out 30 years ago by walking into a grocery and spelling 'filipendulous' we think this conclusion speaks for itself at least we hope so drawing \( nancy doniger \)
new york you walk past a catalogfilled vitrine into a room with somber red walls , dark wainscoting and heavy benches all around are paintings of happy peasants and plentiful harvests , along with a disconcerting scene of a man spying on a picnic from behind a 1940 s car the style is cezanne plus socialist realism water drips from the ceiling into scattered buckets and tarpaulins you feel as if you had strayed into a derelict eastern european museum and , a block from broadway , you have sao paulo you walk into a room as big as a manhattan skyscraper lobby the walls are covered with dabs of sootstreaked wax like the surface of a vast jasper johns painting thousands of numbered copper tokens that click under foot tile the floors in the middle , a mountain of limp church candles fills a huge metal trough an adjacent room is centered on two glass cases containing the remains of large birds whose bones are being picked clean by live beetles the acrid smell of decay mixes with the sweet odor of wax you feel as if you have discovered relics in a holy place , though the modern building housing this timeless chamber is smack in the heart of the world s third largest city venice you walk into a room as big as an indoor tennis court the walls are brick the floor is a cracked sheet of mud at the far end of the dim interior , a grilled window gives out onto another brick wall bathed in blue light midway a blindfolded man , head bowed , is buried up to his shoulders in the mud as you approach him , his lifeless features and uncanny immobility become apparent , heightening awareness of your own body and those of other , shadowy spectators out of nowhere a voice , interrupted by screams , recites t s eliot s wasteland you are left to mill about in an elegant , antique bedlam strange and extravagant , these three environments are among the most memorable of the early 90 s , heralding a decade of boldly theatrical installation art none can be seen today , surviving instead only in memory or documentation despite their grandeur , they are , like theater pieces , ephemeral an art of temporal experiences rather than of permanent things contemporary installation has , in fact , been performancebased from the beginning and it has been that theatrical quality that defenders of modernist painting have always held against it the first of the three , incident at the museum or water music , was by the nomadic russian artist ilya kabakov , who , in the decade since his emigration from the soviet union , has conjured fantastic versions of that lost civilization in dozens of exhibitions around the world the second installation , parallel lines , was made for the 1992 sao paulo biennale by ann hamilton , who also represented the united states in last summer s venice biennale the third , memory loss , was created by the allaround theater man robert wilson , who won the sculpture prize for it at the 1992 venice biennale and in 1997 conceived a similar but even more elaborately symbolist project for the villa of the turnofthecentury german painter franz von stuck typical of the medium , each of these installations was a trap for the imagination as soon as the viewer entered , the trap was sprung and each in its exaggerated artificiality was a sign of the medium s problematic maturity installation has come of age in the last three decades and is plainly here to stay still , recognition that it is more than a periodic fad or an avantgarde indulgence has been slow in this country , where painting was dominant for so long worse , some resentfully fear that this new art form has altogether eclipsed painting it has n't , of course , and it wo n't but while installation aspires to the condition of theater , it originated in a crisis in painting that crisis , and the fertile misconceptions about painterly means and ends it engendered , began with jackson pollock s expansive paintings of the 50 s and the physical drama of their creation hans namuth s famous photographs of pollock at work , and harold rosenberg s equally stirring account of action painting , inspired artists around the world to think about gestures beyond the canvas in the 1950 s , the japanese gutai group were the first to make events or environments out of pollock s process , followed in the 1960 s by yves klein in france and the viennese actionists in america , credit goes to the inventors of happenings , a term coined by allan kaprow , who showed how painting pollockstyle could be acted out in real time and real space with or without paint mr kaprow s 1958 manifesto , the legacy of jackson pollock , was speculative but on the mark his art gives the impression of going on forever pollock ignored the confines of the rectangular field in favor of a continuum going in all directions simultaneously , beyond the literal dimensions of any work in an older work , the edge was a far more precise caesura here ended the world of the artists beyond began the world of the spectator and reality thus , mr kaprow imagined the traditional picture plane unfolding into the gallery like a popup book , making gallerygoers part of the action along with the artist

kukes , albania , may 2 it lasted no more than three minutes , three minutes of savagery unleashed without even a word they just started shooting and i got hit in the shoulder the dead bodies behind me pushed me over the cliff and into the stream i was lucky because all of the dead bodies fell on top of me isuf zheniqi , who said he survived when 58 men died in a massacre near bela crkva in southwestern kosovo more than a month ago , speaks out hesitantly , fearing serbian forces might take revenge on members of his family still in kosovo but after crawling out from under the bodies of his relatives , neighbors and friends , with a bullet from a serbian automatic rifle embedded in his right shoulder and horrors filling his head , he has carried around the names of almost all the men who died that day in crimped handwriting he puts them down on the pages of an address book , name after name of old men , young boys , teenagers and men , like himself , who were suspected by the serbs of belonging to the kosovo liberation army , which is fighting to make kosovo independent from serbia he remembers the names of all but one but he knows there were 58 because he helped bury them , each one with a written name as refugees from kosovo continue to flee across the border , the accounts of atrocities committed by serbian forces in kosovo multiply a killing spree in the village of velika krusa , the rampage of troops through the streets of djakovica , the slaughter of up to 100 men in the village of meja accounts from different refugees are consistent enough to lend a great deal of credibility to some but eyewitness accounts by survivors like mr zheniqi are rare , either because the killing was done efficiently enough to prevent survivors , or because the sheer terror of minutes like those on the embankment at bela crkva prevents survivors from recounting their ordeals mr zheniqi said that when he was brought across the border by relatives he told human rights investigators what had happened at bela crkva but until now , he has not given journalists a full account his experience human rights watch separately interviewed mr zheniqi and four other witnesses , who corroborated parts of his account mr zheniqi was the only one who testified that he saw the actual killing , human rights watch officials said four women who were separated from the men at bela crkva heard the shots as they were walking to zrze and later returned to see the bodies and other refugees told human rights watch that they were among the group of 20 or so people who returned the day after the killings to bury the bodies all the witnesses gave us highly credible and unusually consistent accounts of what happened at bela crkva , said fred abrahams of human rights watch they corroborated what the eyewitness told us the other witnesses appear to have left kukes since they were interviewed it was impossible to confirm the killings independently , beyond the refugee accounts , since reporters and independent investigators have been unable to visit that area of kosovo since the bombing started today mr zheniqi lives in a kukes pool hall , with his daughter and her family he cannot use his right arm because of the bullet wound , and during the days he can often be seen dozing in the sun outside the pool hall , trying to steal some moments of the rest that eludes him every night because of his terrible dreams my daughter tells me 'father , sleep , why do n't you sleep \? mr zheniqi said but i ca n't all those dead bodies on top of mine when i meet someone from kosovo and they ask me what happened , i cry i'm embarrassed , because i'm 39 years old and i'm crying the slightly built farmer , who worked for eight years in switzerland before returning to the fertile soil of southwestern kosovo , said that before the turmoil in kosovo began over a year ago , he had almost no contact with serbs living nearby but the area was a known stronghold of the kosovo liberation army , and the serbs were advancing ruthlessly on rebel positions , including the area of bela crkva mr zheniqi said that he was not a member of the rebel force and that none of those killed had any connection to the kosovo liberation army about 3 30 am on march 25 , on the first night of nato bombings in yugoslavia , serbian forces started their operation , mr zheniqi said he said he saw about a dozen serbian tanks take positions in bela crkva one was in front of my house , he said anticipating violence , he took his family and his brother s family 17 people in all and ran to the nearby mountains to hide when the streets again fell silent , they returned , thinking the tanks had moved on but they had n't smoke soon rose from the houses of bela crkva that were closest to the road from prizren to rahovec mr zheniqi and his family fled again , this time scrambling down the deep banks of a large nearby stream it was about 4 30 am the people from the whole village started to collect there in the stream , he said they went to a place he called ura e bellase , where a train trestle crossed the stream about 800 villagers tried to hide beneath the bridge

scientists working with mice have developed a vaccine that has proved highly effective in both preventing and reversing one of the primary brain abnormalities associated with alzheimer s disease it remains to be seen if the compound will produce the same effects in people indeed , it remains to be seen if it improves cognition even in mice , which is difficult to measure it is also unknown if the abnormality is a cause of the ailment s devastation in the brain or simply one of its symptoms but the researchers' report of their work , being published today in the journal nature , is being hailed by scientists as a landmark achievement in the battle against alzheimer s , the fourthlargest cause of death in the united states the vaccine was developed by researchers at elan pharmaceuticals of south san francisco , a subsidiary of the elan corporation of dublin the company s researchers worked with mice that the researchers had genetically altered so that they developed the plaquelike deposits commonly found in the brains of alzheimer s patients these deposits , amyloid plaques , are believed to cause cell death in the brain when the scientists vaccinated healthy young mice , the mice grew up without developing the plaques , the researchers said in diseased mice , they said , the treatment eradicated the plaques , improved the condition of damaged neurons and reduced inflammation in surrounding tissues as well elan officials said they would seek permission from the food and drug administration to begin safety trials in humans within the year they said preliminary discussions with the agency had been encouraging anticipating a flood of calls about this development , both elan and the alzheimer s association have set up tollfree telephone numbers elan is at \( 800 \) 8947308 the association is at \( 800 \) 2723900 alzheimer s , characterized by progressive dementia and incapacitation , affects four million americans and costs the nation 100 billion a year , according to the alzheimer s association the longer people live , the more likely they are to develop symptoms of alzheimer s only a handful of drugs have been approved to treat alzheimer s and none provide more than slight , temporary relief of symptoms for many patients the drugs are ineffective this is the first time anyone has demonstrated the ability to either totally prevent plaque deposition , or to make the deposits remove themselves , said dr steven dekosky , chairman of the scientific and medical advisory board of the alzheimer s association and head of the alzheimer s disease research center at the university of pittsburgh this finding is really exciting on a couple of levels , dr dekosky said the biggest issue is the use of immunization it s very clever to have tried that this is the first time the association has expressed optimism about any pharmaceutical development in treating or preventing the disease it is a radical innovation , a creative approach , said roger rosenberg , a professor of neurology at the university of texas southwest medical center in dallas , and past president of the american academy of neurology i do n't remember anyone proceeding with an immunization the elan scientists said they had been concerned that an immunization might prompt inflammation in the brain , giving rise to conditions like encephalitis or multiple sclerosis , but that no such symptoms had been observed in the mice to their surprise , they said , not only did the immune system mount antibodies against the amyloid protein , but scavenger cells also appeared to clear the accumulated plaque from the brains of the diseased mice it s better than anything we had hoped for , said dr dale schenk , elan s vice president of neurobiology we actually think the vaccine is stimulating the immune system to come in and take up the plaque dr ivan m lieberburg , senior vice president of research at elan pharmaceuticals , said the company was moving forward to clinical trials aggressively the elan researchers immunized the mice with a synthetic form of the betaamyloid peptide , which is the predominant compound found in the plaques in patients' brains they linked the peptide to an immune system stimulus , or adjuvant , that is commonly used in mouse studies the adjuvant prompts the immune system to attack the amyloid plaques it would otherwise ignore the adjuvant used in the mice is not tolerated by people , though the researchers said that designing one that was tolerated was not regarded as a major hurdle the mice had been implanted with a mutated human gene that prompts the overproduction of amyloid , but that mutation is only found in a minority of actual alzheimer s patients , those with socalled familial alzheimer s , rather than the more common sporadic form people with sporadic alzheimer s do not overproduce amyloid , but instead seem to have a problem clearing it from the body the only way to determine whether the vaccine is effective for them would be through clinical trials moreover , some scientists believe that the amyloid plaques are a symptom rather than a cause of alzheimer s and that the primary pathology of the disease is actually manifested in twisted proteins inside the brain cells of alzheimer s patients that look like tangled wire the mice do not develop such tangles , so there is no way of gauging their relative significance from this experiment nor is it possible to assess accurately memory loss or cognitive ability in the mice if a human form of the vaccine can be developed and proved safe , further studies should answer these questions if this can be commercially developed in humans without untoward effects , i think we may have our first crack at treating people , said dr leon thal , an alzheimer s specialist at the veterans affairs medical center at the university of california at san diego dr thal has been an adviser to elan on other studies the elan laboratory in south san francisco is part of athena neurosciences , a small biotech company acquired by the elan corporation in 1996 founded in 1987 , athena first achieved scientific renown in 1995 with the development of the transgenic mouse , the first laboratory animal for the study of alzheimer s athena and elan have also been pioneers in the development of screening tests using genes or proteins that can help diagnose or show a familial predilection for alzheimer s elan plans to recruit a small group of alzheimer s patients for the safety trials should the vaccine prove safe , it would be subject to at least two phases of clinical trials with larger groups of patients before it could be submitted to the fda for approval , which is about a fiveyear process tests on healthy patients whose genetic makeup shows a strong likelihood of alzheimer s would follow
two months ago today , mets manager bobby valentine glumly sat in the lower depths of yankee stadium and made a prediction if his underachieving mets did not improve over their next 55 games , valentine said he fully expected to lose his job that was june 6 the mets were 2728 , under 500 for the first time since opening day and had lost their seasonhigh eighth consecutive game the day before valentine was speaking at an uncomfortable news conference one day after general manager steve phillips had fired three of his coaches , who also happened to be three of valentine s closest friends tonight marks the 55th game since valentine made his remarks and the mets whose 6643 record is a few percentage points short of being the best in new york , after the yankees' 74 victory in seattle last night , but is a game and a half better than the atlanta braves' in the national league east have been the hottest team in the major leagues since valentine spoke his thoughts there is still no guarantee that the mets will make it to the postseason for the first time since 1988 but there is certainly no question that this season s mets are better than they were a year ago , when they went 8874 for the second consecutive season under valentine and missed out on the wild card by one game there are a number of reasons why they are better , and some of them are not as obvious as the team s impressive batting average and home run output there is , for instance , the strength of the infield s defense , which is the best in the national league there is the team s increased ability to work the pitcher deeper into the count and draw more walks and the mets are dramatically better at stealing bases than they were a year ago , or the year before that none of these factors draw as much attention as robin ventura s surprising 25 home runs or edgardo alfonzo s 323 batting average but all of them are important and have helped the mets win games even when other things have n't been going well start with team defense the mets lead the league in fielding percentage , a category in which they ranked a respectable fifth a year ago last season , the mets' starting infield of john olerud at first base , carlos baerga at second , rey ordonez at shortstop and alfonzo at third was one of the strongest defensive units in the league then they made one key change they added the fivetime gold glove winner robin ventura at third and switched alfonzo from third to second robin is better than fonzie at third , valentine said and fonzie is better at second than carlos was to date , alfonzo has been better than just about anyone in the major leagues at second , even though he had not played there on a regular basis since he and ordonez formed a great doubleplay combination in class aa ball in 1994 in 106 games , alfonzo has made 2 errors his last was may 20 , which was 66 games ago he and ordonez who has won two consecutive gold gloves at short have sparkled in their reunion the two turned a secondtoshorttofirst out in milwaukee this week with no runners on ventura is less spectacular than ordonez who is n't \? but no less steady than alfonzo i knew he was a gold glove , mike piazza said of the player who is clearly the best of the many third basemen who have made a musical chair out of the position in the mets' oftenfrustrating 37year history but you really do n't know what he s capable of doing until you see him play as for olerud , he had joked in spring training that he was the weak link of the infield but he has actually been a surprise on defense ever since joining the mets in 1997 , a player who turned out to be far more wellrounded than advertised in fact , it is one of olerud s more subtle attributes his ability to work the count that has become more of a teamwide virtue this season , with the addition of rickey henderson probably having the biggest impact the 40yearold henderson is one of baseball s great leadoff hitters and is on his way to becoming the career leader in walks his impact can be seen in these statistics mets' hitters are now taking 383 pitches per atbat , compared with 371 a year ago and their leadoff hitters , are hitting 306 with a 416 onbase percentage , compared with a 237 average with a 321 onbase percentage a year ago suddenly , the team ranks first in the league in walks and onbase percentage after being seventh and 10th , respectively , in those categories a year ago with henderson and without butch huskey , with ventura and without carlos , we have improved in that regard , valentine said of the team s ability to take pitches , a tactic the yankees mastered en route to a world series championship a year ago but everyone on our team does it it was stressed three years ago as a form of offensive attack and it was always talked about but not everyone bought into that when it comes to pitching , the key area where the mets have improved over last season is their bullpen , which is fortunate because their starters a problem area have plummeted from fourth to 12th in the league in earned run average and are the only group in the majors without a complete game it is the deepest and best bullpen we 've had since i 've been here , said john franco , who joined the mets in 1990 and is currently disabled with a strained finger ligament , which is why phillips got two veteran relievers billy taylor and chuck mcelroy before the trading deadline i think my view of things has evolved over the last two and a half years , seeing what types of teams have been successful , phillips said the day after he made the two deals , which will lessen the burden on armando benitez , turk wendell and dennis cook i think the bullpen is a lot more important than starting pitching over 162 games the bullpen is first in the league in saves , second in era and second in opponents' batting average \( 222 \) the relievers have struck out 373 batters and walked 159 , which is considered an excellent ratio on the basepaths , the mets were last in the national league in stolen bases last season , with 62 this season , they have already stolen 110 , with roger cedeno leading the way with 52 and henderson adding 29 it is one reason why the mets , who scored 706 runs a year ago , are now on a pace to exceed 850 this season score runs and win games and win enough games , and you get to play in october after a decade of futility and frustration , the mets would like that feeling photos defense robin ventura has been stellar at third base dugout manager bobby valentine is sitting pretty basepaths roger cedeno lads the team in stoln bases
east rutherford , nj , sept 30 keith hamilton does n't stay awake at night worrying about it , but the giants' paltry sack total is beginning to be a nagging problem the giants' defense has registered three sacks in three games this from a unit that led the national football league last season with 54 hamilton is the team s only defensive lineman to drop the opposing quarterback for a loss this season defensive end michael strahan , a pro bowler who led the team with 15 sacks last season , has none we talk among ourselves we keep giving the effort and keep playing hard , they 're going to come , said hamilton , who had seven sacks last season i could give you 1 , 000 excuses why but the bottom line is they pay us to get to the quarterback and sack him that s what we need to do two years in a row we 've been no 2 or no 1 at getting to the quarterback we did n't get sorry all of a sudden we just have n't done it we need to do it asap when you 're losing , everything is under the microscope a cure could be right around the corner on sunday , the giants will face the philadelphia eagles \( 03 \) , who have had major problems protecting the quarterback philadelphia s offensive line has given up 15 sacks , and it will be starting lonnie palelei , a former jet and giant , at right tackle for this game palelei will start in place of jermane mayberry , who injured his hamstring against the bills last week the giants' defensive linemen are n't salivating , primarily because it s not polite to do it in the face of a division opponent i'm not going to take philadelphia for granted , hamilton said they 've got a couple of people nicked up i'm not going to get my hand caught in that buzz saw i'm going to approach it like any other game they 're in the nfl and they 're going to come to play hard you ca n't take anybody for granted in this game hopefully , this will be the game we can get back on track if not , then we 're going to keep working until we do get back on track strahan , who will line up against palelei , has a similar attitude about the veteran tackle , who started 14 games at left guard for the jets in 1997 but did not start for the giants last season he s a hard worker and a good athlete , strahan said i guess people think that because lonnie did n't start here , he s not a starter there and it s an easy day for me if that were the case , then i would n't be practicing i went against him in practice if the guy could n't play , he would n't be in the nfl the eagles will probably give palelei some help with strahan , sliding a tight end over to help out or keeping a running back to aid with a double team it s nothing unusual , and it is one reason strahan and the giants' defensive line has had trouble getting to opposing quarterbacks this year it s nothing that we did n't see last year , said the giants' defensive line coach , denny marcin teams have been keeping six or seven guys back to protect we 've seen a lot of bootlegs , misdirection stuff to slow us down , quick passes , play action and screens we 've seen an abnormal number of screen passes the giants lost 11 sacks when defensive end chad bratzke went to indianapolis as a free agent hamilton does not believe bratzke s departure has meant that much of a difference if you think bratzke could help us win the washington game , that s not so , hamilton said if you think he could have helped us win the game last week , i do n't think so he was definitely a good player , but if you think he s the reason we 're in a slump right now , he has nothing to do with that he was n't the guy getting double teamed coach jim fassel said the defense has played strong up front this year and he empathizes with strahan i think michael s been a marked man for some time , fassel said i do n't think people took him for granted last year it gets harder you make it to the pro bowl , you become a marked man you have to continue to find a way to put those numbers up it gets harder getting sacks has not been michael s problem getting sacks from our defense has not been our problem we need to get going and we need to start getting some pressure coverage helps sacks a lot , too strahan said he does not believe he has an s on his chest or a bull seye on his back he believes the team s lack of sacks has more to do with willpower than anything else two games we got a lot of pressure and got some hits on them , and one game we did n't , strahan said that s just a matter of our mindset
dear diary i was on a crowded 96th street crosstown bus early one recent evening when several passengers got on at the fifth avenue stop , including a couple carrying several large framed pictures in bubble wrap as the bus was about to cross the park , the male half of the couple reached into a bag he was also carrying and pulled out a small blue tiffany box , tied with a white ribbon the woman had a giant smile on her face at first i thought they had bought whatever was in the box together , but the young man handed the little package to his companion and she began opening it expectantly nestled on velvet was a diamond ring , and it went right on her finger the two were smiling as they gazed into each other s eyes we met on this bus , the woman explained to her fellow passengers taken with the moment , all the other riders applauded shelley ann hainer another crosstown bus glenda and ira copperman were recently seated next to two men in stained work shirts and jeans to their surprise , they heard the man in blue jeans say to his colleague in offwhite jeans you know , you 're not supposed to wear white after labor day you know that , do n't you \?

when it comes to issues of sexual identity , european films can be difficult for american viewers to talk about or even understand fully we assume that europeans , whose leaders can carry on extramarital affairs without falling from grace , are more sophisticated , more laissez faire about sex in general and , specifically , about the blurring of hetero , bi and homosexuality but we ca n't quite figure out how they achieve this nonchalance in the last few years , as heterosexual and gay americans have used movies to discuss our sexual differences and how they still matter , we 've mainly chatted about a string of hollywood romantic comedies my best friend s wedding , in and out , as good as it gets , the opposite of sex and the object of my affection we may object to their glossy , pictureperfect unreality , their need to wink and underline their own hipness on matters sexual but it s probably these very qualities that help us talk so freely in the object of my affection , jennifer aniston is a heterosexual mothertobe who wants her gay roommate \( paul rudd \) to rear a child with her we can make this up for ourselves none of the old rules apply , she says we may groan , but deep down we 're cheering on the unlikely couple , because making this up for ourselves is just what most of us are trying to do as we adjust to the vagaries of relationships sexual , racial , familial in 1999 america except for a rare exception like the delightful 1997 ma vie en rose , in which a young boy disrupts a belgian suburb because he knows he should be a girl , european films offer little of the playful unreality that lets viewers laugh , identify and scoff at once instead , a european film often plunges americans into a spare , hyperrealistic world that seems almost futuristic because labels like gay or straight are rarely mentioned and the old rules really do n't apply such hyperrealism works by forcing viewers to feel unsettled , threatened and inarticulate while deciphering psychosexual situations they might never have envisioned this sort of creative disruption is certainly achieved by three european films that americans will have a chance to see in the next several weeks two of the films , anne fontaine s dry cleaning and benoit jacquot s school of flesh , are french the trio , directed by hermine huntgeburth , is german although they are by no means equally accomplished , all of these films use coupling across the sexes and within the sexes to make particular questions of sexual identity and sexual courage resonate more broadly becoming , simply , questions of identity and courage as unalike as they are in tone , dry cleaning , which opens on friday , and the trio , which will open feb 12 , start with a similar , fairly unoriginal dramatic premise a stranger falls into the midst of a troubled domestic arrangement and acts as a catalyst for reassessment in dry cleaning , which is set in a small city in eastern france , the stranger is loic \( stanislas merhar \) , a scruffily handsome young man who performs with his sister marylin in a transvestite singing act , the ladies of the night when marylin decides to retire , loic befriends and goes to work for nicole kunstler \( mioumiou \) and her husband , jeanmarie \( charles berling \) , who operate a drycleaning business and lead a highly conventional life but had been intrigued by the ladies on a rare night out at first , loic is intent on notsosubtly helping nicole regain a sense of herself as a sexual being and as a misfit \( those who remember mioumiou in bertrand blier s anarchic going places of 25 years ago will wince at the irony \) gradually , however , as he learns the business , his attention turns to jeanmarie , and the film takes on a darker mood as the two men try to parse currents of friendship , mentorship and passion dry cleaning at times feels too much like a psychology experiment the director , ms fontaine , has said that her film is about decontrolling in the face of mutation of identity but it becomes something more just as loic jars nicole and jeanmarie into questioning convention , mr merhar , a powerful newcomer , seems to draw mioumiou and mr berling , two fine veterans , into the sort of ensemble performance that is incidentally insightful greater than the material itself the ambisexual interloper in the trio , an altogether more amiable movie , is rudolf \( felix eitner \) , an altogether more amiable young man who is invited to join a fatheranddaughter team of con artists , zobel \( gotz george \) and lizzie \( jeanette hain \) , after their partner karl \( christian redl \) is incapacitated zobel is an aging , flamboyant homosexual who has reared lizzie while loving and browbeating karl lizzie is a cute , cynical observer , ready to strike out on her own as a woman the elements of the sexual equation are clearer here than in dry cleaning the competition between father and daughter for rudolf s affections is outright , occasionally comic and almost sentimental but again , the fact that the story unfolds naturally , without selfconscious references to the designations or assumptions of sexuality , means that the gamesmanship can serve a deeper purpose in this case , that purpose is to examine how trust between two humans survives beyond the bedroom trust is also at the center of the school of flesh , which opens feb 26 but in mr jacquot s experienced hands , the subject is dissected in a much more complicated manner adapted from a novel by the japanese master of sensual brinksmanship yukio mishima , this movie stars isabelle huppert as a welltodo parisian divorcee named dominique who is a powerful but lonely fashionindustry executive late one evening , she and a

trenton , dec 18 robert menendez remembers the first time he went to bat for bill bradley , defying the hudson county political machine in 1978 to support a retired basketball star who had never held elective office mr menendez , who is now one of a number of prominent democrats in new jersey who have publicly rebuffed mr bradley and endorsed vice president al gore in the presidential race , even guided the candidate through a political tour of the county that took place on the day that mr menendez s father died of a heart attack and he remembers what happened when he asked mr bradley to go to bat for him 14 years later mr menendez , who went on to become union city s mayor and later a state assemblyman and state senator , was making his own run for congress but when he asked mr bradley to support him in the democratic primary , he was turned down it was a very disappointing moment , said mr menendez , who nonetheless won that election and still serves in the house of representatives i asked him to support me in the primary , and he would not he said it was his policy not to get involved in races where democrats were fighting each other i said , 'two things you do n't know him , and remember what i did for you and , if i did n't have a primary opponent , i would n't need your endorsement' the pain in mr menendez s voice sounds undiminished by the intervening years as he tells this story , though he has been telling it often lately and when senator frank r lautenberg of new jersey campaigned in new hampshire with mr gore on friday it was a vivid reminder that mr bradley cannot count on political support from his homestate colleagues considering mr bradley s popularity during his three terms in the senate , one might have expected to find democrats throughout the state uniting behind the first new jerseyan to take a credible shot at the white house since woodrow wilson but while the roster of mr bradley s supporters in his home state includes dozens of officials at the local and county levels eager to attach themselves to the coattails of a favorite son , there are some striking omissions and not one member of the delegation in which he served for 18 years mr lautenberg , who endorsed mr gore months ago , drew attention to his support before friday night s debate between mr gore and mr bradley representative frank e pallone of long branch , who does not speak ill of mr bradley , nonetheless is backing mr gore and representative donald m payne of newark , who has not formally endorsed mr gore , has praised the vice president while describing mr bradley as somewhat distant representative bill pascrell jr , who has not endorsed either mr gore or mr bradley , said he and other new jersey representatives had been asked by congressional leaders to endorse mr gore but had not been lobbied by the white house still , mr bradley s popularity among new jersey s voters is widely acknowledged , and he would be expected to beat mr gore easily in the state s democratic primary in june , although backers of both men believe the race will be decided well before then but aides to mr gore suggest that mr bradley s problems in new jersey are reminiscent of senator john mccain s frosty relations with his fellow republicans in arizona , among them gov jane dee hull , who has endorsed gov george w bush of texas for president her remarks about mr mccain s temper set off a wave of speculation about his emotional fitness in mr bradley s case , however , what seems to have alienated many new jersey democrats , or at least left them with mixed feelings about him , is not so much a perceived character flaw as some of the same choices , convictions and experiences that he has tried to turn into selling points for a national audience mr bradley makes much in his campaign speeches of his threeyear hiatus from politics , for example , when he traveled the country giving speeches , consulting and teaching but his absence from the political scene won him few friends at home victor scudiery , chairman of the monmouth county democratic committee , recalled asking mr bradley to attend a party function after his retirement from the senate he stated to me that he does n't do those things anymore , mr scudiery said those are the exact words , and they still ring in my ears everybody talks about our favorite son my father said , 'if you leave the nest and the family , you better start apologizing when you come back' mr bradley s 1995 retirement speech , in which he declared politics is broken and blamed democrats as much as republicans mr gore has seized on it to call mr bradley a quitter appears to have done the most lasting damage to his reputation in his home state it seemed to me , representative menendez said , that he was painting a lot of people whom i consider good people , the housewives and people like myself who had helped his campaigns for all those years , as part of a broken system , where their participation was part of the problem
havana , nov 19 tension shot through the crowd as fidel castro confronted his latest international standoff he huddled with his closest advisers and watched his venezuelan opponents flick away the cuban projectiles it had become a missile crisis worse yet , it was only the top of the first , and the cuban pitcher was throwing duds that put two men on base with no outs the cuban president became the maximo manager on thursday night , guiding a cuban team against a venezuelan lineup whose leader and pitcher was none other than president hugo chavez in this baseballcrazy country , the game drew 25 , 000 spectators to the latin american stadium , to cheer , clap and beat drums whenever either side punched a hit or scored a run of course , it did n't hurt that the cubans won , 54 , in a game that was anything but a pitching duel , with a combined total of 28 hits the teams were composed of former players from both country s national teams , playing a game that they learned decades ago in dusty towns and crowded city streets castro , himself a boy of many summers , was what one magazine had dubbed the lion in winter , older and grayer , but outlasting his enemies he appeared enthralled with chavez , smiling paternally and hugging the charismatic leader who was elected president last year after leading a failed military coup in 1992 chavez traveled here for a meeting of the leaders of 21 latin american nations and spain and portugal the two leaders spent much time together discussing mutual concerns , including the possibility of venezuelan help in rebuilding a cuban oil refinery that is a sovietera holdover never mind about history absolving either man , their meeting conjured up the words of yogi berra it s deja vu all over again here we are , 4 years , 10 months and 27 days since i last visited havana , chavez had said in a speech earlier at the university of havana fidel and hugo cuba and venezuela more alive than ever at the game , the crowd appeared to be enamored of the solidarity between the two countries , waving the venezuelan colors like it was visiting team flag day even the scoreboard was a revolutionary reminder emblazoned with the name che , although in this case that was purely coincidental , because the letters stood for carreras , hits and errores , spanish for runs , hits and errors a guaguanco rhythm , the percussive heartbeat of cuban music , echoed in the stadium as the spectators slapped congas and rang cowbells this is about brotherhood between chavez and fidel , rene pinton , a retired welder , said the cuban revolution and the venezuelan revolution the north americans are against that they do not like anything that helps the little guy they only want to live well and let the others fall cuba could benefit from being friends with venezuela the game itself had been the talk of havana for days , with people wondering who would win and what political implications it would have cuba has always been the macho of baseball , mr pinton said the world comes here to see us and some of the best players leave to see the world the defections of top players like orlando \( el duque \) hernandez , who now plays for the new york yankees , was a sore topic among some in the stadium he has a debt to cuba , vladimir rives , a college student , said he had a free education they taught him baseball here , even though nobody knew then if he was going to be good or bad now he is not grateful in this world , a lot of people lose their mind when they see dollar signs they lose their shame in what would be the pregame show , chavez gave a speech at the university , peppering his remarks on his rise to power with jokes about how the cubans were trying to psyche him out before the game he said that on wednesday night , defense minister raul castro told him that he had to climb 10 flights of stairs to an appointment because an electrical line had a shortcircuit when i got to the top , the power was restored , chavez said i do n't know why with a smile , he suggested that he took a page from castro s playbook , delivering a 90minute speech intended to keep castro from eating lunch and discussing strategy with the cuban team every hit that i allow , he ended , will be received with great affection each step , swing and play will be a golden grain in this mission to unite our two people so , cuba and venezuela will both win for six innings , it looked like that would happen in the game , too , as the score was tied at 4 chavez scored a hit in his first atbat , stopping the game for a minute as he hugged the pitcher , and later advanced to second on another hit , but did not score as a pitcher , chavez threw somewhat weakly and out of control he almost beaned several cubans but his delivery improved for the five innings that he was on the mound before switching to first base earlier in the day , castro had hinted that he had a few surprises in store , and he revealed them in the bottom of the sixth , sending in a string of substitute batters who were simply introduced as reserves from the cuban team within moments , the crowd roared as several men , bearded , whitehaired and carrying cantilevered beer bellies , limped to the plate and scored some hits the men were active members of the cuban national team , sluggers much admired by chavez , who happily watched as the cubans pulled ahead by one run in his dugout , castro laughed as he saw his nation s top players fake being over the hill that one run won the game for the cubans as the players took pictures of one another and castro signed baseballs , one cuban ringer watched from the sidelines this was exciting for both of us , said orestes kindelan , 35 , who has hit 550 home runs in his career i did not bat against chavez but those who did said that although he threw it slow , it got around and his team s manager \? excellent , kindelan said he is always planning something and luckily , it always turns out good photos on the mound for venezuela , president hugo chavez , top the 25 , 000 fans in havana cheered both sides , even waving venezuelan flags \( associated press \) \( reuters \)
in neighborhoods throughout the upper west side , police officers have left countless tickets this week on cars that were doubleparked outside bustling stores , crowded schools and stately highrise buildings but in their aggressive new crackdown , the police have not staked out the one place where dozens of cars are routinely double and tripleparked in plain sight outside the 24th precinct station house at west 100th street between columbus and amsterdam avenues yesterday afternoon , 21 sedans and sport utility vehicles stretched down the street , sometimes blocking drivers who had legally parked next to the curb the doubleparked vehicles all belonging to police officers were identified with limegreen placards or police union cards displayed on the dashboards none had an orangeandwhite parking ticket stuck to the windshield even though doubleparking outside a police station is just as illegal as anywhere else in the city should they be doubleparking there \? the answer is no , said lieut stephen biegel , a spokesman for the police department , who added that he would contact the commanding officer of the 24th precinct to look into the matter capt leonard roppa , the commanding officer , was not at the precinct station house yesterday and was unavailable for comment , a precinct officer said nearby residents said that police officers have doubleparked their cars outside the station house for years without being ticketed , effectively narrowing the relatively wide , twolane street to one and creating a private parking lot in the midst of a bustling commercial district anthony ferrando , who lives at columbus avenue and 97th street , said he often drives up onto the sidewalk to get out after being blocked by the police officers' cars one time , i got really mad , he said i even wanted to hit the car because they blocked me in and there were empty spots on either side in fact , the problem of police cars clogging traffic by doubleparking has been a sore point near other station houses but the outcry has been particularly loud in the 24th precinct because of a police crackdown on doubleparking that some residents and officials say has focused on their part of the upper west side this week , hundreds of car owners received tickets for doubleparking their cars across from the side of the street that was being cleaned a longaccepted practice throughout the city clearly , there s a double and triple standard being used at the expense of the people , said new york city councilman bill perkins , who represents the area between 92d and 123d streets west of broadway he said the standard was unfair in light of the new aggressive campaign on parking police officials have denied that they focused their efforts on any single area , but they have been unable to provide a breakdown of the tickets by neighborhood during the first two days of the crackdown that started on tuesday , 17 , 309 tickets were issued for traffic offenses in the five boroughs , including 4 , 708 for doubleparked cars and 2 , 130 for doubleparked trucks the police were unable last night to provide figures for the rest of the week , or the numbers of tickets that were typically issued before the crackdown lieutenant biegel said police officers who doublepark their cars may find themselves ticketed just like anyone else fines start at 55 for illegal parking and run up to 280 if the police place a clamp on a tire and tow the vehicle although there are parking lots and reserved spaces outside station houses , several police officers said privately that the overflow often winds up in the street they said that they have also received tickets , and in a few cases , had their cars towed police officers all over the city are complaining that they are getting tagged , said joe mancini , a spokesman for the patrolmen s benevolent association , the union that represents police officers they have to abide by all the rules outside the graybrick station house on west 100th street , a steady stream of traffic slowly weaved around the double and tripleparked cars yesterday afternoon the crowded block also has a fire station , health office , highrise apartment building , church , day care center , library and a grocery store arben broqi , a restaurant owner who was taking a certification class at the health office , said he had asked his father to drop him off and pick him up every day this week because there was no parking on the street every single day we see the cars doubleparked , he said , pointing to the police officers' cars it s not fair for nobody if i do this , i'm going to get a ticket if they do it , nothing happens but at least one neighbor did n't seem to mind the daily police lineup israel blum , who owns ajo lumber home center at west 100th street and amsterdam avenue , said that police officers should be allowed to doublepark outside the station house even though he pays at least one 55 ticket a week because his drivers cannot find curb spaces while making deliveries i think they should have benefits , he said of the police officers this precinct is very cooperative and they would move the cars at any time they are doing so much for the community , the community should do something back for them photos police officers double and triplepark private cars outside the 24th precinct station house on the upper west side , despite a crackdown on residents' doubleparking \( ruby washington the new york times \) \( pg b1 \) israel blum , owner of ajo lumber home center at west 100th street and amsterdam avenue , said police officers should have benefits , including the right to doublepark outside the precinct station house \( ruby washington the new york times \) \( pg b5 \)
i remember thinking during a meeting last fall with the district attorney of travis county , tex , and several of his top aides that their minds were closed , that they would do anything in their power to keep a teenager named lacresha murray in prison , that they had so much invested in the case , and had reaped so much positive publicity from her arrest and conviction , that they were incapable of admitting they might have been wrong the case no longer was about justice but about public officials saving face that meeting was in austin in early december lacresha was some 60 miles away in the giddings state home and school , where she was serving a sentence of 25 years for the beating death in 1996 of a 2 1 2yearold girl named jayla belton i had written in a series of columns that lacresha , just 11 years old when jayla died , had been the victim of a colossal miscarriage of justice there was no legitimate evidence against her , no witnesses , no forensic evidence , not so much as a drop of blood or a speck of body fluid of any kind the absence of such evidence was an indication that someone else , somewhere else had inflicted the fatal injuries all the prosecution had was a statement taken from lacresha after a lengthy police interrogation in which she repeatedly insisted she had done nothing to harm jayla an officer told her , we are going to stay here until you tell us the truth isolated , and without the help of a lawyer , lacresha eventually came up with a fantastic scenario that even prosecutors said would not have accounted for the injuries that killed jayla at the meeting in december the district attorney , ronnie earle , told me that lacresha s statement was basically a lie but he insisted that it pointed to her guilt his office used it to get a conviction against her not once , but twice \( the first conviction was thrown out by a judge who said , i had a question as to whether justice was done \) last week the third circuit court of appeals overturned lacresha s second conviction the court s three judges ruled unanimously that her statement had been obtained illegally under texas law a child who is alone in the custody of the police must be taken before a magistrate to insure that the child s rights are protected and that the child understands the proceedings that are taking place and the penalties that might ensue the level of lacresha s understanding of what was going on can be gauged from a tape of her interrogation a statement in effect , a confession had been typed up and handed to lacresha by the police what s that word \? she asked homeaseed \? when she was told the word was homicide , she asked , what s that \? no one answered the police and prosecutors tried to explain away their failure to follow the law and get a magistrate to look out for lacresha s interests by insisting she was not in custody when she was interrogated the appeals court would have none of that she was not free to leave , wrote justice lee yeakel in his 28page opinion he described lacresha as isolated and alone during the interrogation , adding that at a minimum , we cannot say that appellant s statements were not the product of fright or despair from the beginning prosecutors tried to portray lacresha as a monster , a maniacal juvenile who inflicted a savage beating on a 2yearold they referred to her in private as la creature the injuries to jayla were compared to those that might occur in an auto wreck but investigators could never come up with any of the forensic evidence that usually accompanies such a frenzied attack the blood , the soiled clothing , the bits and pieces of human tissue , the fiber evidence all they had was the statement that resulted from an unconscionable police interrogation of an 11yearold and now an appeals court has said they ca n't even use that no one knows what will happen next last week s ruling can be appealed or lacresha could be tried a third time her lawyers are trying to arrange her release but for the time being , she remains locked up at giddings , a victim of prosecutorial zealots more interested in saving face than seeking justice
this season dr kate austin on chicago hope joined nasa and planned to go into outer space \( many of us thought this annoying character belonged there in the first place \) nypd blue resorted to dream scenes about detective andy sipowicz s father and acted out the plot of a noir detective novel and er gave dr mark greene his very own stalker this was the season in which dramas that had once been television s grittiest , most gripping and most realistic turned bland or ridiculous and as the writers cooked up their desperate schemes \( maybe they were bored too \) the dramas continued to lose much of their kick and part of their audiences the television season officially ends tonight , with a twohour episode of law and order \( nbc at 9 \) the best and freshest drama on any network but such freshness has become a glaring exception among longrunning shows two things that did n't happen recently may illuminate the fate of network drama cbs decided not to schedule falcone , a mafia series it had planned for fall the network had reportedly been high on the show , but said that after the school shootings in littleton it seemed too violent and nbc decided not to renew the tepidly rated homicide until this year homicide had been extraordinary in its power and honesty by the time it was canceled , it was an aging series being put out of its misery though homicide is the only one of these series not returning , the end of a cycle seems near the new season is loaded with mushbrained dramas in the mold of the sugary nbc hit providence , about a woman who returns to her hometown and finds that family love can conquer anything \( including death and disease for pets and humans \) wishfulfillment fantasies are beginning to squeeze out volatile shows attached to reality part of this shift is simply old age catching up with established shows chicago hope and er have been through five seasons and nypd blue six how many more times can mark greene \( anthony edwards \) yell stat ! or andy sipowicz \( dennis franz \) say skell \? just as important , 24hour news channels and news magazines have taken over more of television s time , making fictional dramas seem that much more fake and in the face of violent world events , viewers may be longing for good news and escapism but the nineyearold law and order , with its focus on headlinerelated stories , has remained compellingly near reality and its revolving door of characters has helped shelter it from the aging process \( socalled reality shows are in a lurid category all their own \) this season , several aging shows lost their most intriguing characters the emotionally wrenching death of bobby simone , jimmy smit s character on nypd blue , was a high point of the series , which fell apart soon after george clooney s character walked away from er this season , which was also the first without andre braugher s intensity on homicide yet those losses were n't the only reasons the shows went flat the characters who filled the voids were featherweights giancarlo esposito s character , the son of the homicide squad s lieutenant , was always underwritten on nypd blue , bobby was replaced by rick schroder as young detective danny sorenson but mr smits s character had carried a note of unrealistic glamour \( he wore that trench coat as if he were modeling for gq \) and mystery \( he was more seductive and enigmatic than anyone else on tv \) mr schroder is surprisingly convincing , but his character is another bluecollar , hardworking cop , who volunteers to interview a child because , he says , he s familiar wid my mug \( ca n't one character on that show speak english instead of tv cop talk \? \) danny is not a star , something even the grittiest dramas need for balance letting a cad be a cad and one glance at er reruns reveals that mr clooney s doug ross was more fascinating in the early years , when he was a womanizing cad the sensitive doug who left was no great loss even when a character starts out a hero , he runs into longterm problems how many trials can he endure before dramatic events seem stupidly melodramatic rather than tragic \? on nypd blue andy had already recovered from alcoholism and prostate cancer and faced the shooting death of a grown son last week his wife was shot and killed , giving him first place in any job lookalike contest these shows seem trapped inside hermetic bubbles of recycled plots and romances \( danny falls for bobby s widow , but so far she s not interested \) law and order has never existed inside that bubble of stale air tonight s finale , which involves the russian mafia and a moneylaundering scheme , is not one of the year s best but is still more absorbing than most other dramas though the show may look formulaic , with its detectives rounding up suspects in the first halfhour and lawyers prosecuting them in the second , the writers skew their stories off the headlines in a way that keeps viewers guessing one twisty murder plot involved the theft of frozen embryos another , about a teenager who kills her baby at the prom , kept shifting suspicion about who got rid of the body was it the young woman , her boyfriend , or her own father \?

a fantasy for those stuck in traffic and a convenience for corporate executives , the helicopter is the ultimate freedom machine unencumbered by flight plans or runways , these air taxis can take off at a moment s notice and land a few steps from a passenger s final destination but in recent years that freedom has been reduced on long island as more and more towns have passed regulations restricting where they can take off and land and in some areas where helicopters can still operate on private property , neighbors are becoming more vocal about the noise there have been three or four helicopters at bistrian gravel in east hampton , flying back and forth to construction projects on long island and in connecticut , but now there are none we used to be able to land anywhere , said barry bistrian , the company s president but the town made restrictions on that ken kurrass , an officer of norman kurrass construction , used a helicopter to get to job sites from his east patchogue office in the 1970 s and 1980 s we would land in empty lots or an empty field , he said but now there are more restrictions on where you can land if i have to land at an airport and then have to drive or provide transportation , then it s not worth it there was more helicopter activity on private property five or six years ago , according to mike brazill , the chief operating officer for summit aviation in farmingdale , one of the island s largest air charter companies we would land around the oyster bay area , on the horse farms in old westbury and on private estates in the hamptons , he said but there is less of that now , because local homeowners complained federal regulations allow helicopters to land wherever permission is granted by the property owner , including a parking lot or front yards , requiring a landing area of only 40 feet square or less but most long island towns have prohibited helicopters on private property except in emergencies , such as police or hospital use in some cases , special use permits can be issued in december , cablevision applied to the town of oyster bay to operate a helicopter from its newly acquired property in bethpage , which it purchased from northrop grumman while the application is under review , the company continues to fly in and out of the property , to the chagrin of some nearby homeowners we do n't want these things flying over our houses , said julio gonzalez , who lives across the street from the cablevision site mr gonzalez , a retired pipe fitter who has lived in his ranchstyle home on stewart avenue for 37 years , helped collect more than 600 signatures on a petition opposing the use of the cablevision helicopter in his neighborhood grumman had once tested a variety of aircraft at its bethpage site , including the f14 fighter and the awacs radar plane however , 105 acres of the 645acre property is owned by the navy , which exempted the flights from local government control the awacs did come in here , said mr gonzalez , but grumman was responsive to our concerns they were a good neighbor cablevision is just using it for the pleasure of running around here they 're very arrogant about it cablevision flies a 1986 twinengine sikorsky 76 at the site and said its use is appropriate and consistent with the rich aviation history at the grumman site they added we are happy to communicate with any interested parties in a constructive fashion town supervisor john venditto urged cablevision to stop its bethpage helicopter operations pending the hearing on its specialuse permit it s critical that we maintain the delicate balance between business and the people who live here , he said but with the density of population that we have in the town of oyster bay , helicopter travel is something i would look at with a jaundiced eye ever since thomson industries established its headquarters in a port washington sand pit in 1962 , the company used helicopters on the site , mostly to shuttle back and forth to its plant in lancaster , pa now a ninepassenger sikorsky and a fourpassenger astar make the trips for the company , which has since added three plants in connecticut an ordinance passed by the village of port washington north in the early 1970 s allows thomson to use of helicopters on its property , but the current village attorney , stephen limmer , said that the special use would not be given again that use was grandfathered , mr limmer said today we would n't permit any helicopters even though thomson s sevenacre property is in a commercial zone , there are several homes nearby , and according to mr limmer , there have been complaints about noise gould ryder , general manager of thomson s aviation division , has dealt with most of those complaints because of community concerns , the company has a selfimposed curfew on its helicopters it will only fly from 8 am to 8 pm on weekdays , with no flights on the weekends we go out over abandoned property , then over mill pond and manhasset bay , mr ryder said we might be going over three or four houses a helicopter pilot for 25 years , mr ryder said advancements in rotor systems have made aircraft quieter
brussels , jan 28 the nato allies warned today that they are fully ready to take military action to stop further violence by both sides in serbia s ravaged kosovo province , and britain and france said they are willing to send in ground forces if they are needed to reinforce a political settlement the allies acted after the united nations secretary general , kofi annan , told them today that the threat of force was essential to enable diplomats to impose peace on kosovo , where serbian security forces and armed rebels from the province s ethnic albanian majority have been battling with varying degrees of intensity for almost a year allied governments expect an international political ultimatum to be issued on friday in london by the foreign ministers of the united states , russia , germany , italy , britain and france , urging both the kosovo albanians and president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia to begin negotiations swiftly in washington , the clinton administration s top national security officials are to meet on friday to decide whether the united states will commit troops to kosovo after any settlement with the public commitment of france and britain today , the administration is feeling strong pressure to be part of a nato peacekeeping mission the united states and its european allies have all agreed that the two warring parties must be forced to accept a political solution but whether or not the kosovo albanians and mr milosevic accept a solution peacefully or after force is used , the europeans are adamant that american and european ground troops go into kosovo together to monitor a settlement clinton administration officials say they understand that the situation is moving quickly and hope a decision can be reached on friday no nation has said exactly how many troops might be needed to enforce an eventual agreement in kosovo , but both european and american diplomats said today that the allies are willing to contemplate sending tens of thousands of troops as peacekeepers allied and associated soldiers , including russians , have been keeping the peace in bosnia since the end of 1995 european diplomats said the six nations meeting on friday in london , members of the contact group coordinating international policy in the balkans , would give the leaders of both yugoslavia and the ethnic albanian rebels fighting for kosovo s independence a short deadline to negotiate ways to restore autonomy to the southern serbian province and stop the violence , and a longer deadline to reach a longterm political solution the allies warned the appropriate authorities in belgrade and representatives of the kosovo albanian leadership must agree to the proposals to be issued by the contact group for completing an interim political settlement within the time frame to be established later tonight , after president jacques chirac of france and prime minister tony blair of britain met in london , mr chirac s office in paris issued a statement saying france and britain are ready to consider any military action , with their partners and in the framework of the atlantic alliance , including sending ground troops required to accompany a negotiated settlement earlier , the german foreign minister , joschka fischer , said in bonn that talks would be held in france within a week , but french diplomats here said they could take place in vienna or in italy the rival parties would be given two weeks , he said , to agree on a transitional solution nato diplomats said the allies would meet again this weekend to back up that ultimatum with a credible threat to use force i think we are at a very important turning point , the alliance s secretary general , javier solana , said after reading out a 10point warning he said he had also sent to president milosevic and to an ethnic albanian leader , ibrahim rugova in 1989 , when he was president of serbia , mr milosevic rescinded autonomy in kosovo , which is 90 percent populated by ethnic albanians although it is part of serbia the alliance s statement was part of a complex international choreography demanded by france and other european allies to give diplomacy a chance to enlist russian support in putting pressure on mr milosevic in their warning , the allies insisted that mr milosevic live up to promises he made last fall to withdraw serbian special police and military units and heavy weapons used on attacks against kosovo villages those promises , which diplomats said had never been kept , were made after nato authorized wide bombing unless yugoslavia , which now consists of serbia and montenegro , agreed to negotiate peace with the rebels the albanian guerrillas , too , kept fighting , and thus talks never got off the ground , despite a framework negotiated by the american envoy , richard c holbrooke the massacre of 45 civilians in racak two weeks ago , french diplomats said , made the allies realize that they must make a fresh attempt to halt the violence , or risk seeing more massacres weaken their own credibility secretary general annan , visiting nato allies at their headquarters here today , said the bloodshed in the former yugoslavia carried some lessons the bloody wars of the last decade have left us with no illusions about the difficulty of halting internal conflicts by reason or by force particularly against the wishes of the government of a sovereign state , mr annan said but nor have they left us with any illusions about the need to use force , when all other means have failed we may be reaching that limit , once again , in the former yugoslavia the alliance warned , nato stands ready to act and rules out no option to insure full respect by both sides of the demands of the international community mr solana said later , the next few days will be decisive if the united states had had its way , according to some diplomats , nato could have issued an ultimatum of its own today , giving the alliance s military commander , gen wesley k clark of the united states , or mr solana authority to order military action if the serbs or the albanians refused to negotiate but diplomats said the french prevailed with the view that with russia opposed to the use of military force against fellow eastern orthodox slavs in serbia , it was better to wait until after secretary of state madeleine k albright and other foreign ministers met with russian officials on friday none of the allies , diplomats said , are insisting on explicit authority for military action from the united nations security council , as france urged last year before the united states and britain bombed iraq in moscow , russian officials said today that they opposed nato s move to step up military preparations they said no nato air strikes should be carried out without the explicit authorization of the security council , where russia holds a veto foreign minister igor s ivanov said military strikes would be counterproductive french diplomats said the major question was how to exercise military pressure on both the serbian and albanian sides while nato has had plans to attack serbian military targets in kosovo and elsewhere in serbia since last fall , it has had more trouble coming up with ways to use force to get the kosovo liberation army to negotiate european diplomats said nato could impose naval blockades around albania , which the rebels use as a staging area , and even deploy forces along albania s border with kosovo to stop rebel infiltration photo javier solana , nato s secretary general , sees a turning point \( agence francepresse \) \( pg a6 \)
in the lockoutshortened regular season , san antonio and the knicks never crossed paths now they will , and here are some factors to consider by selena roberts maintaining the magic the spurs have more depth , two allstar big men and homecourt advantage and they benefited from sean elliott s miracle 3pointer in game 2 against portland on memorial day the knicks have leaned on a few miracles of their own , but are the underdogs in this final , which is just the way they like it if there is a chance to steal momentum , it s in game 1 the spurs could be stale after 10 days off and the knicks have a way of seizing the moment , having won game 1 on the road in the first three rounds of the playoffs foul management the knicks' last big men standing kurt thomas , marcus camby and chris dudley have to watch themselves or else the 41year old herb williams will be at the mercy of david robinson and tim duncan thomas is especially prone to the silly foul , which means he has to do a better job of controlling his emotions dudley has to be smarter with his coverage , too larry johnson s health even a gimpy l j is better than none johnson gives the knicks a lowpost threat to score and create foul trouble for the spurs' twin towers and when the knick guards drive and kick , johnson s ability to hit the 3pointer will help the knicks stretch the spurs' defense if johnson is forced to wear a brace , his moves could be limited , but his presence is vital protect the perimeter the knicks did well to take away the 3point shooting of the pacers and will need to protect against the outside presence of mario elie , elliott and jaren jackson , who comes off the bench latrell sprewell is especially vulnerable he tends to lose his man in transition and needs to shadow elliott , who is shooting 459 percent from 3point range during the playoffs create transition chances the knicks are facing the best defense in the league not only do the spurs block shots in the half court , they get back in transition defense still , the knicks have to force the issue by turning steals and defensive stops into easy baskets to run , chris childs and charlie ward are also going to have to rebound while sprewell leaks out on the break guard protection when the knicks are in the half court , allan houston has to remain aggressive , even in the face of the spurs' tenacious defender , elie elie will try to funnel him into robinson and duncan , so houston will also need to stop and pop a good fadeaway the knicks desperately need ward and childs to shake their offensive woes and take advantage of avery johnson for some points camby s impact marcus camby became the most valuable player for the knicks against the pacers but this is a greater challenge robinson and duncan are bigger , more agile and show no signs of weakness camby s path to the basket for rebounds and tipins wo n't be as clear , but he ca n't get frustrated also , it might be the right time for camby to have some plays run for him , as well experience factor the spurs have players who have been to the finals before , like steve kerr , elie and will perdue the knicks' remaining holdovers from the 1994 finals are patrick ewing and williams ewing and williams will be important to prepping their team for the kind of intensity and pressure is ahead both teams have handled it well , thus far but the finals are different photos larry johnson steve kerr chris dudley
as far as i'm concerned , every new yorker is born with the inalienable right to ride the d train , shout hey , lady ! with indignation and grow up going regularly to the theater after all , if a city is fortunate enough to house an entire theater district , should n't access to the stage life within it be what makes coming of age in new york different from any other american city \? i am certain that i became a playwright because every saturday my parents picked me up from the june taylor school of the dance and brought me to a broadway matinee of course at the time , i had no idea that i would even remotely have a life in the theater no adult said to me , oh , wendy , darling , do n't become a doctor , a lawyer , or certified public accountant please do us a favor and consider the notforprofit theater but watching those plays while i was still in high school first put into my mind the idea that the work you grew up to do did n't have to be entirely separate from your real interests as the 199899 theater season officially ended with the recent tony awards , and as the attendant hoopla is replaced by the weary question of where will the new audiences come from , i have some good news from the front perhaps there is even a glimmer of hope for the new season from eight new york city high school students who have decided to make theatergoing a habit sadly , a new york adolescent s life as a regular theatergoer is becoming the exception to the rule ticket prices have made a family habit like mine almost an impossibility moreover , those against government subsidy for the arts have marginalized theater as elitist and solely for the upper middle class wellpaid moviemarketing experts have endless figures and charts to fondly demonstrate that teenagers would far rather sit through 10 things i hate about you , the movie remake of the taming of the shrew set at a high school , than the shakespeare play itself while i was on a recent trip to congress to lobby for the arts , a senator asked if i was serious that theater was as important as health and education i was tempted to say , yes , let them eat plays ! but instead i hatched an idea to personally bring new york high school students into the theater i mentioned my plan to roy harris , who was the stage manager for my last three plays roy was quick to jump on board best thing you can do is get those kids in here this is audience development at the grassroots level ! stage managers are wonderfully organized people one day , i'm daydreaming and the next thing i know we 're at a meeting at the theater development fund among its many functions , the nonprofit tdf runs the halfprice tkts booth on broadway and works to develop new audiences you get me eight smart high school students from the new york city public school system and roy and i will take them to plays for a year , i proposed to marianna houston weber , the fund s director of education just make sure it s no one who is looking to get an agent or meet drew barrymore i want students who have never been to the new york theater , and let s see if it s at all still relevant to them being a brooklyn girl , i was hoping to include students from every borough but marianna said that the development fund already had a playwriting program set up with dewitt clinton high school in the bronx she offered to get in touch with patricia bruno , a popular english teacher there , who would pick eight candidates from the accelerated math and science program dewitt clinton high school , named for the 19thcentury new york mayor and governor , is the alma mater of the comedian robert klein , the designer ralph lauren and the writers james baldwin and avery corman over the years , the mix of the school s immigrant population has changed , but the commitment of teachers like mrs bruno to opening worlds for their students has remained constant in september 1998 , with the help of our educational advisers , roy and i mapped out a more precise academic plan we would see seven matinees , a potpourri of broadway , off broadway , musicals and straight drama after each , we would go out for pizza and talk about the show the students would be selected based on an essay about why the project interested them those chosen would keep a yearlong journal , for which they would receive high school credit on a cold sunday in early november , the dewitt eight and mrs bruno meet us for the first time in front of the gershwin theater to see george c wolfe s production of the musical on the town as our three boys and five girls ride the escalator upstairs , all in blue jeans with backpacks , i see adolph green walking across the lobby that man wrote this show with his partner , betty comden , 55 years ago , i say , pointing him out to manuel nunez and omar mendez he s the local talent , too we sit in the upper balcony , and as the orchestra begins to play new york , new york , the eight students lean forward i feel a lump forming in my throat immediately , i think of kenesha johnson s essay she , like most of the others , mentioned wanting to have a sense of why it is good to live in new york before she left for college
a republic , not an empire reclaiming america s destiny by patrick j buchanan 437 pp washington regnery publishing 2995 like other republican conservatives , the presidential candidate patrick j buchanan opposed united states intervention in kosovo and wants to limit or eliminate american participation in the united nations and other multilateral institutions but in a republic , not an empire , buchanan justifies these stands by presenting a grand theory of american history and foreign policy while he rejects the term isolationist , his foreign policy recalls that of the conservatives who dominated the republican party from 1919 until 1952 he adopts an extraordinarily narrow criterion for american intervention abroad , which leads him not only to oppose stationing troops in south korea or participating in nato but also to question american intervention in world war i and in the war against hitler s germany buchanan wants american foreign policy based squarely on a territorial concept of vital interests advocates of enlightened nationalism like him , he writes , see our role not as a knighterrant that sets out to right the wrongs of a sinful world , but as the coiled rattlesnake that threatens none so long as it is not threatened and its domain is not intruded upon buchanan contrasts his enlightened nationalism with liberal internationalism , which he says originated with the woodrow wilson administration and is currently embraced by the multilateralists who have held power under clinton liberal internationalists advocate global government through yielding sovereignty to supranational institutions like the un , the world bank , the international monetary fund and the world trade organization they support intervention in places like kosovo , iraq and somalia and commitments to countries like south korea and poland , where the united states , in buchanan s view , has no vital interests he concludes rather than squander american wealth propping up failed foreign economies , or spilling the blood of america s young in foreign wars , let us restore the political , economic and military independence that was the dream and purpose of washington , hamilton , madison , clay and the republican party from lincoln to world war ii buchanan s enlightened nationalism would not only constrict american action today but also would have ruled out most american diplomacy and military intervention in the 20th century a former reagan aide , buchanan takes the most extreme and diabolical view of soviet intentions during the cold war , but he takes the most benign view of hitler in a new wrinkle on appeasement , he criticizes britain for declaring war on germany after hitler invaded poland in 1939 even after hitler conquered france and began bombing britain , buchanan insists , the nazis were not a threat to american vital interests the war itself , buchanan declares , made europe safe for stalinism and asia safe for maoism of course , it also saved the lives of millions of people who would have been victims of nazi genocide and japanese brutality , and it laid the basis for functioning democracies in germany , japan and italy buchanan s strict , but also vague , definition of vital interests may have been appropriate in the early 19th century , but is not now the united states emerged from world war ii the most powerful military and industrial nation in the world and inherited the responsibilities that had accrued to britain in the 19th century if washington had not taken on this role as the ultimate guarantor of peace and prosperity , the international system might have reverted to world war and economic depression it was in america s national , even vital , interest to assume world leadership that , and not the need to pursue a fictive independence , was the lesson that american policy makers drew from the two world wars and the great depression buchanan misrepresents what he calls liberal internationalism wilson , franklin d roosevelt , harry s truman , john f kennedy and clinton saw american participation in multilateral institutions as a means of pursuing american national interests they were instruments by which the united states could get other countries to share the burden of world leadership some of these efforts , like the disarmament conferences and treaties of the 1920 s , were foolish , but others , like nato , the international monetary fund , the world bank and \( dare i say it ! \) the united nations , have benefited us there is a dark side to buchanan s politics and view of history he claims to be speaking in the great tradition of american diplomacy , but a chasm separates buchanan s convictions from those of the men who led america from 1776 to 1865 buchanan cites approvingly john quincy adams s rejection in 1821 of american intervention on the side of the greeks , who were trying to throw off turkish domination but in rejecting intervention , adams also made clear where his own sympathies lay wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled , he said , there will america s heart , her benedictions and her prayers be adams opposed intervention not out of indifference to the greeks but out of an accurate understanding of american capabilities by contrast , buchanan glosses over the fate of the german and east european jews and poles , just as in rejecting intervention in bosnia and kosovo , he underplays the fate of the victims of ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia as a presidential candidate , buchanan has sometimes appeared to be a tribune of the populist left he began his presidential campaign this year championing the cause of west virginia s endangered steelworkers but this book is the work of a rightwing crank it is full of the old saws of the american right he describes the soviet spy alger hiss as an fdr confidant he extols america first , which opposed united states intervention in world war ii , without acknowledging the antisemitism of its most famous spokesman , charles lindbergh he warns that without stemming the flood of immigrants , america will cease to be a first world nation by 2040 a statement clearly equating capability with race and national origin of course , america has always had its share of political cranks , even ones like buchanan , who can write and speak extraordinarily well but that a major presidential candidate could now take such positions suggests that we may not have learned as much as we should have from the last 100 years
jerusalem , dec 7 as secretary of state madeleine k albright was about to land in israel tonight , prime minister ehud barak was seeking to defuse growing tensions with the palestinians by pledging to halt further expansion of jewish settlements in the west bank mr barak stopped short of baldly declaring a freeze on construction , partly though unsuccessfully to avoid provoking the rightwing members of his coalition but in an unexpected change of approach , he called a moratorium of several months on new settlers' neighborhoods to avert confrontation in a delicate period , as the parties seek to reach a framework final peace agreement by february there will be nothing on the ground , mr barak s spokesman , gadi baltiansky , said in an interview , expressing the decision more bluntly than the prime minister no bulldozers will work on the ground there is no point in embarrassing or provoking the palestinians still , mr baltiansky acknowledged that work already in progress , which was approved by the previous administration , might continue if there are four floors of a school built , i am not saying that the fifth will not happen , he said israeli peace advocates say that thousands of units are in the construction phase on the eve of dr albright s visit , a minor crisis brewed between the israelis and the palestinians the palestinians walked away from the negotiating table on monday to protest what they saw as mr barak s expansionist settlement policy the israeli government initially described the walkout as a stunt to lure the americans back into a salvage role in the twoway talks but shortly before dr albright arrived here , mr barak apparently decided that the palestinian concern was deep seated and needed to be addressed we , in the course of the next three months , are in a critical political struggle , and therefore wisdom is needed and this government has that wisdom , he said in a brief news conference yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , and his aides were caught by surprise and did not know quite how to react to the declaration or even what it meant they received no direct explanation from the israelis and followed the story on the local news , they said we did not receive anything , so it is difficult to comment on things i have no knowledge about , said saeb erekat , a senior negotiator but the settlers' leaders , with whom mr barak has tried to build a cooperative relationship , immediately understood that he had drawn a line and expressed their disappointment it turns out that barak gives in to pressure and extortion and he has succumbed to the pressure of arafat and the americans , said benny kashriel , the moderate leader of the yesha council , the settlers' umbrella organization dr albright is scheduled to meet mr barak on wednesday at his house for breakfast , to meet mr arafat in ramallah later and then , perhaps , to return to mr barak for a second meeting after spending the day in damascus today , dr albright emerged from a threehour meeting at a hilltop palace with president hafez elassad proclaiming to be more optimistic about the possibility that israelisyrian negotiations could be revived she declined to spell out why , and a senior administration official later said dr albright needed to talk to mr barak first discussions about negotiations are very much like mushrooms , dr albright said at a news conference in damascus they do much better when they are not in the light the issue of jewish settlements in the disputed territory of the west bank is always a sore point between the israelis and the palestinians but when the palestinians stopped the negotiations on monday , they were irked by a particular development the israeli housing ministry , controlled by the settlers' national religious party , had just published tenders , the bid specifications , for 500 apartments in the settlements that meant that , depending on whose count is used , mr barak s government had authorized the construction of 1 , 800 to 4 , 000 units in the west bank since taking office in july mr barak s office uses the lower tally , and the palestinians the higher count all the approvals were for expanding existing settlements mr barak has said no new settlements will be allowed the pace of housing starts has been accelerated by housing minister yitzhak levy , leader of the national religious party mr barak has not stood in his way until now mr barak has contended that the publication of tenders for the 1 , 800 units completes a process of authorization that started under the rightwing government of his predecessor , benjamin netanyahu i really think that mr levy as the housing minister has been doing exactly what he wants to do without asking anybody , said mossi raz , a spokesman for peace now , an israeli peace group barak does n't want to confront him , because he thinks in two months he will have an agreement , and then he needs levy and the settlers behind him mr barak has also repeatedly said the tenders were irrelevant , even though they deeply upset the palestinians because it takes four to six months for construction to begin after a tender has been published , nothing will proceed until after the february deadline for a framework peace agreement , he has said therefore , mr barak has insisted , israeli authorizations will mean nothing in land that is to be given to the palestinians , and it will be none of the palestinians' business in settlements that will become israeli the reasoning , so apparent to mr barak , has eluded the palestinians and sounded like a runaround to them , and some members of mr barak s own labor one israel party complained to him about the seeming expansion policy on monday night in the first sign of a change , the prime minister s office said earlier today that no new housing starts would be authorized the palestinians did not think that went far enough by this evening , though , mr baltiansky said in an interview that no new construction would start , including on those tenders already approved but mr barak s words were less precise he said this evening i feel that at this stage , in these months , when we are in the midst of negotiations with the palestinians on the final status agreements , there is no point , and to a certain extent it hinders the policy of israel , to begin housing starts that have no chance of being finished in any event a senior adviser to mr arafat , nabil aburdeineh , responded late tonight he refused to utter the word , 'freeze' so what does this mean \?

washington , april 5 nato officials released a surveillance photograph today that showed yugoslav forces herding residents from a village in kosovo , and said other photographs depicted their homes being destroyed , in what they described as concrete evidence of president slobodan milosevic s campaign to remove ethnic albanians from the province the photograph taken on sunday and shown at nato s headquarters in brussels today was one of three that officials said showed the yugoslav forces clearing the village of glodane with grim efficiency nato bombed areas near the village this morning , saying it had aimed at a concentration of armed forces nearby nato s military spokesman , air commodore david wilby of britain , called the photograph damning confirmation of the terror that has driven thousands of ethnic albanians from their homes this was harrowing evidence of how the serbian military units are being employed to force villagers from their homes , he said at a briefing today in recent days , the united states and nato have turned more of their significant aerial surveillance ability to trying to photograph evidence of the atrocities being described by the columns of kosovar refugees reaching albania and macedonia , military and intelligence officials said so far , none of the photographs have revealed mass graves or concentration camps , as some refugees have reported seeing , the officials said but intelligence officials cautioned that most of the surveillance so far had been devoted to finding targets and assessing damage , not seeking evidence and the aerial surveillance , like the bombing campaign , has been hampered by clouds and rain , which have blocked clear views of events on the ground in kosovo the village of glodane is no more than 10 miles from kosovo s border with albania , an area with some of the most intense fighting in recent days the photograph released today bore four circles indicating armored vehicles arrayed through the village in fields across a main road , there appeared to be large groups of people and civilian vehicles , apparently in preparation for deportation air commodore wilby said the second photograph showed that the people and cars had left , while the third showed the village s buildings in flames however , he did not release those photographs , citing security considerations without elaboration in the bosnian civil war , the clinton administration used aerial photographs to show the world evidence of the massacres of muslim men that took place at srebrenica in 1995 officials here in washington said nato would do all it could to provide similar evidence to the international war crimes tribunal in the hague , which is investigating reported atrocities throughout yugoslavia and its former republics we are going to make arrangements to make whatever information we have available to the tribunal , the state department s spokesman , james p rubin , said in an interview photo in a photo released yesterday of the kosovo village of glodane , nato experts circled what they said were yugoslav armored vehicles the inhabitants appear to have been herded across the main road from the village \( reuters \)
hollywood , nov 12 anthony ruiz was celebrating his 8th birthday at the cineplex beverly center here , joining the hundreds of children and parents taking in pokemon the first movie on four screens at the center , one of 3 , 000 theaters that presented this animated film on its opening day , wednesday , and have n't had a quiet moment since the 90minute feature earned 101 million its first day , a school day \( pokeflu , it was called \) , the largest wednesday opening of any animated film , ever , and the biggest wednesday opening for any film in the history of warner brothers on thursday it made 9 million by monday , its earnings are expected to exceed 50 million nearby toy shops sported prominent pokemon displays children clutched their precious pokemon figurines and many wore pokemon tshirts no doubt , some had pokemon video games in their knapsacks anthony struggled to explain what all the fuss was about it has these characters , he said they come from a different world people collect them and they have these different battles finally , he gave up it s just cool , he said the pokemon craze can seem impenetrable to those adults , for instance who are not conversant with its intricate fantasy world even those who are promoting the phenomenon , and reaping the astonishing rewards , are a little stunned by how deftly it has attached itself to the hearts of millions of american children , especially boys aged 5 to 12 but while luck has certainly played a role , pokemon mania is also a result of a calculated series of creative and marketing decisions aimed at learning the lessons of previous toy fads like beanie babies , teenage mutant ninja turtles and mighty morphin power rangers the idea is to use the lessons to build something that will not only resonate with children but also survive longer than the 18 months to three years that these crazes normally last , perhaps even attaining the holy grail of toydom , legs as long as barbie s we put a considerable amount of attention into that , said gail tilden , vice president for product acquisition development at nintendo and the queen of all things pokemon , responsible for shepherding the pokemon brand through its many american manifestations when pokemon was initially rolled out in japan , beginning with the introduction of the video game in 1996 , it was a much slower process the movie did not open in japan until the summer of 1998 , two years after the video game was introduced and the second film \( yes , there is already a second , and it is to open in the united states next summer \) opened in japan just three months ago ms tilden is responsible for making sure that all the pokemon products adhere to the basic theme , that none of the products are marketed to preschoolers or toddlers \( because if babies play with it , older children will want nothing to do with it \) , that pokemon characters are attached to compatible toys \( a waterrelated pokemon on a water toy , for instance \) packs of trading cards featuring the characters go for 7 to 9 a pop and there are dozens of related consumer items from clothes to toothbrushes even before the movie s release , toy industry analysts were estimating that pokemon in all its various commercial forms would sell 6 billion worldwide by the end of this year ms tilden monitors the rolling out of new pokemon characters in a deliberate way to stimulate the collecting side of the craze not so few characters that they are too easily collected nor so many that collecting them all , the goal of all true pokemoners , seems unrealizable we are trying to mirror the property very well , not just put the pokemon theme on anything , ms tilden said for those unacquainted with pokemon , it is a series of products that revolve around a fantasy world created by japanese animators and game creators in which there are two kinds of creatures , humans and pokemon the pokemon , or pocket monsters , are 151 animaltype creatures \( three new ones are introduced in the new film , bringing the total to 154 \) , each with its own personality and powers and the ability to evolve into other creatures with enhanced powers the 12yearold hero of the story , ash , yearns to be a master pokemon trainer , and to do so he vows to capture all the creatures \( gotta catch 'em all is the pokemon tag line and the anthem of all pokemon enthusiasts \) children can imitate ash and try to capture pokemon , as well , either in the video game or by buying their plastic figures or trading cards it is very difficult for any franchise to come into prominence in the kid world , to be forefront in their minds , said gene del vecchio , the author of creating evercool a marketer s guide to the kid s heart \( pelican , 1997 \) and president of coolworks , a consulting company that helps companies invent and build brands for children there are thousands and thousands of competitors for that honored slot , he said even more difficult is trying to keep within a kid consciousness for more than the 18 months or three years these things normally last how do you create a mechanism whereby you can reinvent yourself

the proposed merger of three japanese banks into a behemoth with 13 trillion in assets poses little competitive threat to american or european banks , bankers and analysts said yesterday , nor will it do much to disrupt the push by foreign banks into japan s home market combining daiichi kangyo bank , fuji bank and the industrial bank of japan would create a powerhouse in assets alone not in global reach , profitability , technology or productivity none of the banks is known abroad as an innovator facing loan losses at home , the three have been scaling back their international presence in recent years even if these banks consolidate their operations the way a us bank would , which is not likely , they have pulled away from international markets , and a likelihood of a revived international push is low , said diane glossman , banking industry analyst at lehman brothers the subdued reaction to the planned merger contrasts sharply with the wariness toward japanese banking power in the 1980 s , when those banks financing corporate japan s sweeping international expansion seemed poised to do to world banking rivals what japanese electronics makers did to american television manufacturers even as recently as 1996 , when the bank of tokyo merged with the mitsubishi bank to form what was then the world s largest bank in terms of assets , some rival bankers saw a rising competitive threat japan s prolonged recession and troubled real estate loan portfolios have radically changed that image most foreign bankers say they are more concerned that a japanese banking implosion might cause a world financial panic than they are about japanese banks stealing customers from them this is a purely defensive merger , said a senior executive at a leading american bank they are trying to protect themselves at home the banker said that none of the three banks were considered a soughtafter partner for foreign banks he also said that he did not expect the merger to curb the ability of foreign banks to lure customers away from japanese banks some american bankers view japan s banking sector these days as handicapped , even crippled the japanese government in recent years has continuously increased its estimate of bad loans in february , the government put the figure at 76 trillion yen \( 600 billion \) , more than double a prevailing japanese banking industry estimate all banks must set aside capital to cover failed loans , so every new yen in bad loans requires that almost that much be added to a loan reserve taking away money the banks might have been able to deploy profitably for japan in recent years , it has been a vicious cycle several leading japanese banks have flirted with falling below a widely accepted international standard for the amount of capital they have to support their loans , risking exclusion from international markets most japanese banks now promise that they will seek to reach american levels of profitability but they have a long way to go some of the most profitable japanese banks earn a 2 percent return on equity , a standard way of measuring profits , analysts say top american banks earn 5 to 10 times as much measured by assets , many of the largest banks in the world are still japanese though the recent combination of deutsche bank of germany with the american company bankers trust made that the no 1 contender but sheer asset size does not really measure financial strength or sophistication leading american banks now often serve corporate customers by helping them get access to stock and bond markets , rather than making loans and recording them on their books traditional ways of making and recording loans build assets quickly , but are not considered highly profitable when american banks make corporate loans , they are often syndicated , or sold off to investors you simply cannot equate asset size with financing power or skill sets , ms glossman said american banks would be much larger than the japanese banks if they did things the same way chart assets of a trilliondollar institution three japanese banks will merge to form the world s largest financial institution dollar figures are in billions figures are for the fiscal year ended march , except where noted daiichi kangyo bank history created by the merger of daiichi bank and nippon kangyo bank , it was the biggest bank in japan before the 1996 merger of the bank of tokyo and mitsubishi bank in 1997 , the bank was engulfed in a scandal for paying off racketeers to avoid disruptions of its annual shareholder

havana , march 28 they would n't be expected to say anything else or have a different view , but to a man today , members of the cuban national team that played the baltimore orioles were critical of the cuban players who have defected to the united states and the major leagues juan moreno , the team s shortstop , used the spanish word bravo to describe his feelings he did not use it meaning the connotation the word has in english in spanish , bravo can also mean something akin to teed off , although stronger i'm angry , moreno said , because they started in sports here in this country we want to show the whole world that a cuban team can win against any other team the players were asked how they felt about the absent players , who include the hernandez halfbrothers , orlando of the yankees and livan of the florida marlins rey ordonez of the mets , rolando arrojo of the tampa bay devil rays and osvaldo fernandez of the san francisco giants the players were also asked if they were envious of the major league status and major league money the defectors have attained and if they ever considered the move none of them replied to the last question one , andy morales , did n't reply to any of the questions do n't ask me that , he said we 're just players here oscar machado answered firmly i'm 100 percent a revolutionary , he said i could n't have done what they have done because i want to play with my team all the time and defend the colors of the cuban flag i like baseball that s why i play , not because of the money i get asked how much he earns , machado said , all players have their own workplaces where they get their money according to where they work he said he receives 200 pesos a month , which is less than 20 cuban players , however , also receive perks from the government , like free housing , free education and , in some instances , free cars yobal duenas won the cuban league batting championship this season , but he did n't indicate any interest in learning if he could do that against competition like tony gwynn or bernie williams they have taken their own road , he said of the defectors i feel sorry for them for myself , i'm here with my country and my people and my family i do n't worry about money michel abreu said the subject really does n't interest us , adding that they have taken that road and that is their problem omar linares , a fivetime batting champion and one of the best players cuba has produced , is one player who could most likely have become a good major league player but he wanted no part of it , he said he did n't seem comfortable discussing the issue but said those who have gone have gone they are products of the revolution
washington russia issued an ultimatum on monday to the citizens of chechnya s capital leave before saturday or die true , after stern words from the united states and the rest of the world , russia backed off one day later but yesterday president boris yeltsin was rattling his saber again , this time issuing an ominous reminder to president clinton that russia has a full arsenal of nuclear weapons such bluster deserves a quick and firm response but the clinton administration , in typical fashion , is waffling although the president himself warned earlier this week that russia would pay a heavy price for its conduct in chechnya the warning that apparently ignited mr yeltsin s outburst mr clinton has been unwilling to put the teeth in that rhetoric why \? the united states , senior administration officials claim , has few levers to push and they say that if we use the levers we have , like suspending financial aid to russia , we will undermine our larger national interest in helping russia build a democratic , freemarket society and safeguarding its nuclear materials this stance is wrong the war in chechnya is itself a grave threat to democracy in russia it is fueling ethnic hatred among russians , and siphoning financial support to an unreformed military and militaryindustrial complex it provides cover for the successors to the kgb who are emboldened to harass russian citizens most important , by soaking up russia s scarce resources , the war weakens the response to the nation s socioeconomic crisis , which is a much graver threat to longterm security than anything that has happened in or around chechnya in the past few years if the united states backs up its oratory with action , will the russians listen \? there are several reasons to think they will the most important is that russians respect strength prime minister vladimir putin has become phenomenally popular largely because he has demonstrated toughness with the chechen rebels likewise , we need to demonstrate resolve in defending our values and principles if we ever hope to persuade moscow to negotiate with chechnya also , for all their antiwestern talk , russians fear isolation from the west most members of the elite have their savings and investments in western institutions capital flight remains unabated russian elites need to understand that by continuing the war in chechnya they are isolating themselves from the west and jeopardizing their investments moreover , support for the war is not as great as many in the west have been led to believe onethird of russians are opposed to russia s involvement , according to recent public opinion polls some critics are looking to the west for support i spoke to a number of these people , including leading businessmen , when i was in moscow last month they wanted the united states to take a tough , principled stand on chechnya the pressure , they thought , would have impact over time and encourage more russians to speak out in addition , the majority that supports the war is beginning to waver a recent poll by the russian center for public opinion suggests that close to half of all russians would support negotiations with the chechen leadership the polls also show that getting tough with russia would not , as the clinton administration fears , help the communist and ultranationalist parties in the parliamentary elections nine days from now virtually every major political party in russia already supports the war , even the reformist union of rightwing forces the only parties to register a rise in the polls as a result of the war are the reformers and the progovernment bloc of regional governors support for the communists has not budged over the past few weeks ultranationalists are faring poorly nothing the united states says or does is likely to change the situation how do we get tough with moscow \? suspend all loans from the international monetary fund and the exportimport bank , and explicitly link the suspension to the war in chechnya in no way should these loans even indirectly finance the military operation along with our allies , review all technical assistance to russia suspend any aid provided directly to the russian government except those programs dealing with nuclear weapons and material continue the assistance that directly benefits regional governments , private business and individuals , thereby encouraging democratic and market reforms warn that continuing the chechen war will jeopardize russia s invitation to the meetings of the seven most industrialized countries step up our support for georgia , the caucasus nation that has come under increasing pressure from moscow for its alleged support of chechen rebels granted , none of these actions will persuade moscow to move immediately toward a political solution in chechnya but over time , the pressure , along with inevitable battle fatigue among russians , will nudge moscow toward a negotiated settlement resolving this dispute peacefully is the best thing the clinton administration can do , if , of course , it still believes democracy has a chance in russia drawing \( boris kulikov \)
lessons in life , love , forgiveness , racial tolerance and global economics are delivered with comic flair by an expert cast in the winning new revival of a majority of one at the jewish repertory theater as nostalgic as its references to the bygone era of b altman , the albee theater and fox stoles , this 1959 comedy by leonard spigelgass at playhouse 91 \( 316 east 91st street in manhattan \) is nevertheless as up to date as the latest dispute with japan over free markets although its story of a jewish widow from brooklyn and a wealthy japanese manufacturer and widower who develop an attraction aboard a ship bound for yokohama remains basically unchanged , this production of the 25th anniversary season of the jewish repertory theater is noteworthy for its casting unlike the popular 1959 production , in which cedric hardwicke portrayed the industrialist , koichi asano , opposite the inimitable gertrude berg as the widow , bertha jacoby , or the unexceptional 1962 film version , in which alec guinness costarred with rosalind russell , this revival gives the pivotal male role to an actor of asian descent , randall duk kim and mr kim delivers an altogether captivating performance characterized by warmth , dignity , charm , comic spirit and intelligence none of this is to slight phyllis newman as mrs jacoby , who , favoring character over caricature , is always wise , staunch , decent , funny and , when called upon in act ii , as good company as someone drunk on sake is ever likely to be set 40 years ago , this comedy rakes over the scars of war to come to grips with a changing world the sideboard in mrs jacoby s brooklyn apartment still bears two little american flags and a photograph of her son , david , who died of wounds inflicted by the japanese in the battle for attu in the north pacific sixteen years may have passed since david s death , but as mrs jacoby says , by me , it s like yesterday to complicate matters , her married daughter , alice \( julia dion \) , and soninlaw , jerry black \( danny gurwin \) , arrive with news jerry , rising in the foreign service , has been assigned by the state department to tokyo as a junior economics officer , and major trade negotiations are coming up you 're going to live with the people who killed your brother \? the distressed mrs jacoby asks alice but mrs jacoby also realizes that the world is in flux , and soon she is bound for japan with alice and jerry aboard the ship that carries mr asano and his memories of a son killed aboard a japanese destroyer and a daughter , a nurse who died in the atomic bombing of hiroshima as soon as mrs jacoby begins to overcome her antipathy toward mr asano , jerry and alice suggest that he may have ulterior motives for his attentions , because he will be a participant in the impending trade negotiations in time , matters will sort themselves out under the direction of richard sabellico , the performances are deft and the proceedings savory the sets by todd edward ivins possess a sharp cosmopolitan eye that extends from the dark , heavy furnishings of mrs jacoby s place on eastern parkway to the light , simple furnishings of the asano home in tokyo , premises enhanced by the lighting of richard latta and the costumes of gail baldoni in addition to the principal players , actors like mio takada as mr asano s baleful servant , konrad aderer as the blacks' manipulative houseboy , elaine grollman as mrs jacoby s neighbor , and ako as mr asano s daughterinlaw make significant contributions to the evening s considerable pleasures a majority of one by leonard spigelgass directed by richard sabellico sets by todd edward ivins costumes by gail baldoni lighting by richard latta sound by joshua benderdubiel production stage manager , jonathan bradley presented by the jewish repertory theater , ran avni , artistic director michael lichtenstein , managing director at playhouse 91 , 316 east 91st street , manhattan with elaine grollman \( mrs rubin \) , phyllis newman \( mrs jacoby \) , julia dion \( alice black \) , danny gurwin \( jerome black \) , randall duk kim \( koichi asano \) , mio takada \( jiro tanaka \) , konrad aderer \( eddie \) and ako \( ayako asano \) photo randall duk kim and phyllis newman in the jewish repertory theater s production of a majority of one at playhouse 91 \( carol rosegg a majority of one \)
science fiction once held the franchise on space travel the first moon landing turned decades of let spretend into breaking news but the dream of sending people to explore nearby worlds seems no closer to reality today than it did in 1969 with the future of manned space exploration on hold for lack of funds or lack of vision science fiction writers have moved to recapture one of the genre s central themes kim stanley robinson s recently completed mars trilogy drew on the latest scientific knowledge to imagine what might happen if we transformed our closest planetary neighbor into a lifesustaining replica of earth in return to mars \( eos avon , 25 \) , ben bova picks up the story he began in mars , about the men and women who prod humanity into taking the next giant leap into space bova , a fervent advocate of an expanded space program , is not above propagandizing for handson exploration of the solar system he integrates information about mars so smoothly into the narrative that readers may find themselves nodding in agreement whenever one of the characters analyzes an apparently insuperable problem and suggests an ingenious solution which of course is precisely what people can do so much better than machines find ways around unforeseen obstacles but people are also adept at creating new obstacles , and it is here that bova runs into trouble jamie waterman , the partnavajo mission director of the second mars expedition , feels unaccountably at home on mars he has convinced himself that the curious rock formation he glimpsed as a member of the first expedition is actually an ancient cliff dwelling , proof that mars once harbored intelligent life c dexter trumball , son of the billionaire backer of the mission , wants to win his father s approval by demonstrating that mars travel can be made profitable even if it means turning the planet into a tourist destination the six other members of the expedition have their own personal and professional quirks one cannot imagine them emulating the robotically efficient teamwork of the apollo astronauts and in fact the mission is rent with conflicts of all sorts from tactical arguments to scientific disputes to a love triangle involving waterman , trumball and vijay shektar , the beautiful but hardly circumspect medical officer unfortunately , dramatizing human discord is not bova s strong point the duel for dominance between waterman and trumball never strikes sparks even the mystery of who is willing to commit murder in order to sabotage the entire mission remains an intellectual puzzle , less compelling than the question of whether life on mars ever attained the level of civilization where bova shines is in making science not only comprehensible but entertaining , as when he explains why explorers on mars will not have to send their laundry home to be cleaned it seems that when clothes are left out in the near vacuum on the martian surface , the dirt flakes completely off the fabric and the unfiltered ultraviolet light from the sun sterilizes everything the stone war \( tor tom doherty , 2395 \) , by madeleine e robins , is hard to read , hard to love and hard to forget new york city has suffered a disaster so comprehensive it combines the worst aspects of earthquake , hurricane , plague , climatic change and nuclear holocaust not only are most of the city s inhabitants dead and rotting in the streets , but many of the survivors have been changed into monsters , physically appalling creatures with a taste for human flesh of those who retain their wits and humanity , the most resilient gather around john tietjen , an ordinary man who discovers in the ruins of his beloved city new courage , new skills and a new purpose in life only someone who lives in new york , as robins does , could write with such relish about the destruction of all the landmarks , both physical and cultural , that make the city what it is with all the horrors to be glimpsed in the streets , none is more chilling than the insistence of a curator at the metropolitan museum of art to go on practicing his profession with the only materials at his disposal as one might expect , the question of what , or who , could have caused such dreadful devastation propels the story a strange little boy who lives alone in a tunnel in central park obviously holds a key to the enigma , which robins unfolds at an agonizingly slow pace she also writes with rare conviction about the efforts of tietjen and his compatriots to rebuild a semblance of normal life in a world gone mad curiously , no one sees the disaster as divine retribution for the sins of a 20thcentury gomorrah , and no one wastes time calling upon god to put things right selfreliance is the theme throughout and then , just when you begin to realize exactly what has happened to new york , you also begin to understand that what you are reading is not a proper disaster story at all , but a love story about love lost and found , and the price to be paid when people ignore the human disasters in their midst i approach any new book by bruce sterling with high expectations a good oldfashioned future \( spectra bantam , paper , 699 \) does not disappoint the short stories reprinted in this volume , all written and first published in the 1990 s , show sterling at his best known as the coinventor , along with william gibson , of the noirish style of nearfuture fiction called cyberpunk , sterling has a knack for imagining futures that feel familiar even as they turn conventional wisdom upside down in an era of information overload , when the very concept of common sense is under fire , he writes about the appeal of what used to be called senseless violence his heroes and villains , often indistinguishable from one another , risk everything for what seem like scant rewards , but their enthusiasms are contagious , and you may find yourself sharing dreams and desires you would usually deplore what could be more subversive than the dream of an international terrorist \( in a story called the littlest jackal \) to rule over an island state whose national spirit is mirrored in jimi hendrix s rendition of the starspangled banner at the original woodstock festival try to imagine a country where that music truly was the national anthem not weird , not farout , not hip , not a parody , not a protest against some war , not for young yankees stoned on some stupid farm in new york where music like that was social reality that is how i want people to live
scarsdale generations of scarsdale residents have put family members on the high school downhill ski teams here that have known little else than success in the last dozen years , for example , the lawrence matlick family has had 5 members on the teams , susan cohen has put 4 of her children on teams , and 20 other families have had 2 siblings each on the teams frequently simultaneously and occasionally , both are captains this ski season , which ended in late february , scarsdale s three teams girls' , boys' and coed junior varsity have a combined record of 30 wins and no losses , and for the first time , all 3 won section 1 which includes westchester and rockland team championships there are 11 high school sections in the state the girls' team , undefeated for the fifth consecutive year , has three captains emily levine , liz shvetz and mindy watts they did not lose a race during their entire high school ski careers the junior varsity s record is even more impressive a single loss in 12 years the man who has coached scarsdale during this period is michael menna , who said he believes it is the love of the sport rather than a burning desire for an individual victory that culminates in such achievement maroon and white banners , scarsdale s colors , on the walls of the high school gym attest to the many teams' successes on the playing fields they proudly record victorious seasons in skiing , tennis , golf , lacrosse and soccer boys' tennis , since 1970 23 rocklandwestchester league titles girls' tennis , since 1980 16 league championships golf , since 1973 10 league championships , and girls' soccer , since 1978 15 league championships the girls' soccer team had a 170 record in 1997 , so perhaps the ski team s unblemished 199899 season did not call for a special celebration there was none jacqui thorpy , generally finished first in 199798 races , and her brother andrew , 16 , a junior , has done the same this year their father , dr michael thorpy , started skiing at 3 in new zealand , but his children both started when they were 2 1 2 by 4 they were in race competition at sterling forest unlike others who expressed an opinion , dr thorpy said he believes the success of scarsdale skiers is a reflection of their parents' drive , even though they might be unaware of it they are persistent in the things they do , he said they have goals in sports and out his children also competed in swimming , and both have black belts in karate the theme of enjoyment of the sport rather than pursuit of honors , however , was repeated in conversations with susan cohen , barbara matlick and coach menna mrs cohen , the mother of three former team members , greg , josh and andrew , who were all captains , and a current team member , allison , 15 , a sophomore , said the family routinely skied together and all four always attended ski camps before their high school days it was part of their growing up since they were 3 years old , she said mrs matlick said that the family always took winter ski vacations and that they all started skiing around the age of 4 even those who are now adults , erik , 29 , and the twins nicole and jessica , 23 , skied together at breckenridge , colo , in february while their father , lawrence , skied with the twins andrew and james , 15 , sophomores , in utah all five children were , or are , on the high school team , and erik and jessica were team captains of his successful teams , coach menna said we do not talk about winning we foster camaraderie we encourage working hard as an individual and supporting teammates we know we have a lot of talent at the school , and if each skier challenges themselves to ski the best they can , success will take care of itself mr menna added , always do what s best for the team fred and evie shvetz have four children who are skiers and snowboarders two of their triplets , liz and brendan , 17 , seniors , are on the team and both are captains my wife and i both work , so a weekend of skiing brings the family together , mr shvetz said he added that he feels the teams' success is the result of frequent skiing as well as enjoying the sport he thinks that the drive to win does not become a factor until high schoolers get into competition at the state level the desire to ski is seen in the determination of some team members andrew thorpy , for example , races for scarsdale high midweek and then races for the whiteface mountain ski area in the adirondacks nearly every weekend of the winter somewhere in new york state allison cohen was at the tripp lake summer camp in portland , me , last summer when she took a 10day leave to fly to portland , ore , to attend a summer ski camp at mount hood when camp was over , she flew back to portland one winter when the ski team was having tryouts for prospective members , her brother josh had a 104degree fever and the flu making the team was important to josh , so we doctored him up and he got to the tryouts , where he made the team , mrs cohen said ron bouchier , the athletic director at the high school , has been teaching there for 32 years our kids do n't play any sports with the hope of getting a scholarship to a division 1 college , he said they are doing it for the fun and the experience sure , the skiers dream of being on a winning team the saddest thing in life is to underdream our skiers seem to be dreaming pretty good photos kevin garvey , above , and allison cohen , both of scarsdale , took part in recent ski meet in patterson in putnam county at left ,

mike nichols is thinking about the early days with elaine may what we did when we started was based on our student life at the university of chicago , so it was all so referential , he said , in the droll , precise purr that makes him sound like the world s smartest cheshire cat there were the 100 greatest books and everyone was reading dostoyevsky and listening to mozart operas , and our work was all about references and context the interesting and strange thing about life now is that there s no longer any context , because there s not much of a past the past is forgotten i plan to do 'titanic' again in a couple of years and everyone will say , 'how awful ! so many lives lost ! ' our cultural life may no longer have a past , but mr nichols certainly does , having moved from comic duologues with ms may to theater \( winning seven tony s as a broadway director and one as a producer \) to film certainly does he will be honored by the film society of lincoln center on may 3 with an annual lifetime achievement award that first went to charlie chaplin in 1972 and was given to martin scorsese last year it s a recognition of 33 years of filmmaking that began with who s afraid of virginia woolf in 1966 , earned him an oscar for the graduate in 1967 and included films like carnal knowledge , silkwood , working girl and primary colors characteristically , mr nichols thinks of the lincoln center event more in terms of its stagecraft than anything else you run out of geezers very fast if you do those honors things , said mr nichols , now 67 , elongating chosen syllables like stretched taffy elaine made a brilliant and famous speech at one of them she got up and said , 'i love michael because when we split up , he always sent me a little money every month , and it made a big difference recently , i 've been able to make a little money on my own by having sex with some of the guys in my building nothing big but just enough to get back my selfrespect' still , the award is a convenient marker for one of the more iconoclastic careers in popular entertainment mr nichols , after all , is the consummate new yorker in a world defined by los angeles , an intellectual who has been a success in popular culture , and an immigrant outsider whose great gift has been to get to the heart of american life mr nichols , in a customary locution that skips from a small personal observation to a big elusive thought , recalls his surprise recently when a friend gave him a letter that mr nichols wrote him back in 1954 i was amazed at that letter because it was me already , me like i am right here , mr nichols said maya angelou says this really good thing , 'when people tell you who they are , believe them the first time' 'i did n't inhale' what the hell were we thinking \? he told us who he is , and we paid no attention if you pay attention , people are telling us who they are all the time you do n't have to judge , but you should pay attention and an overview of his career is a reminder that mr nichols s life and work reflect so indelible a genetic fingerprint that the far bigger surprise would be if the mike nichols of 23 and the mike nichols of 67 did n't seem so much the same mike has always thought in terms of 'what is it really about \? ' said ms may , long since reunited with mr nichols as a screenwriter , most recently on primary colors whatever he does , he makes about something 'working girl' was a wonderful little comedy , but it was really about something 'the graduate' was about something his peculiar way of looking at the world , his own tilt of the head , is always his ability to find what things are really about mr nichols was born michael igor peschkowsky in berlin in 1931 his father was a russian internist his mother was part of a distinguished german literary family the family fled the nazis , mr nichols coming over in 1939 when he arrived , he spoke only two english sentences , i do not speak english , and please , do not kiss me he had no hair because of a rare reaction to a shot for whooping cough , and found everything in america , cocacola , chiclets , rice krispies foods that made strange noises or were meant to be chewed , not swallowed as alien as moon rocks on top of that , his father died of leukemia a few years later when he was 12 he was , in short , the ultimate outsider looking in at american life i think there is an immigrant s ear that is particularly acute for 'how are they doing it here \? what must i do to be unnoticeable , to be like them \? ' he said at its highest and most extreme form , it leads to great artists like joseph conrad and stoppard and nabokov they 've somehow both digested a new language and culture and made it more expressive in some way you 're forever looking at something as someone who just got here he went to private schools , dalton and the cherry lawn school in connecticut , and was then given a scholarship to the university of chicago he began as a premed student , planning to become a psychiatrist , until he soon found he could not be in the same room with a cadaver
could you use 10 , 496 \? that s what the average household in new york state would get back through the tax cuts approved by congress , according to the tax foundation , a research group in washington because so many new yorkers , including middleclass ones , are in high tax brackets , the average windfall in new york would be 3 , 000 higher than in the rest of america yet new yorkers do not especially want the money , according to the new york times cbs news poll released today the tax cuts \( vetoed by president clinton \) were favored by only 14 percent of the respondents statewide , and just 13 percent in the city almost twothirds preferred using the budget surplus to preserve programs like medicare and social security you could quibble with the question s wording , which presumes that current taxes can finance future benefits that may be like presuming that you can give a crack addict money for his child s college education the question could have been worded differently is your retirement money safer in a 401 \( k \) account or in the hands of politicians up for reelection next year \? but new yorkers would probably still give politicians the money no matter how many studies come out showing that the city s residents pay more than their share of taxes to albany and washington , and get back less in return , they keep voting for taxes gov george e pataki , elected against the wishes of the city s voters , did manage to cut state income taxes in 1996 but even that did not change much with pataki s 25 percent cut , we went from being the highesttaxed state in the nation to being the highesttaxed state in the nation , said brian backstrom , vice president of the antitax group changeny and as soon as the cuts began taking effect , the city s democratic legislators vowed to undo the damage in most places , politicians do not call a news conference to come out for higher taxes but that is what hillary rodham clinton did in september to announce her opposition to federal tax cuts and it seemed such a brilliant stroke of public relations that she was joined by all four of the leading democratic contenders for mayor why do new yorkers like paying taxes \? the aberration has never been explained there are various theories , none fully satisfactory new yorkers are realists we have a flintyeyed understanding that it takes money to operate the government , said manfred ohrenstein , the former democratic minority leader of the state senate that may be , but why do the most flintyeyed new yorkers the ones who sit up late fretting over the household budget so often end up fleeing to new jersey and connecticut \? new yorkers are dreamers they have been fleeced year after year , but new yorkers continue to hope that they will get back more from albany and washington than they send we always think the taxes are being paid by someone else , said senator daniel patrick moynihan but , of course , they never are new yorkers are spendthrifts everyday costs here are so high that taxes do n't seem so bad by comparison , said mitchell moss , the director of the taub urban research center at new york university new yorkers are used to spending 8 for a bowl of ice cream we tolerate high taxes because we tolerate the high price of ice cream new yorkers are generous new yorkers pride themselves on paying for expensive government programs to help the needy residents of the upper west side may be the only people in america to describe themselves the conscience of the nation but their innate moral superiority is not always obvious to others , especially those who have tried to reach the salmon counter at zabar s new yorkers feel guilty maybe taxes are the atonement that new yorkers pay for their everyday rudeness and greed lee m miringoff , the director of the marist college institute for public opinion in poughkeepsie , ny , has noted a correlation between his polling data and a recent incident at a stoplight in new hampshire , a state with no tax on income or sales i was looking at a map and did n't realize the light had turned green , he recalled i probably sat there for 20 seconds , but not a single car behind me honked can you imagine the chorus in new york \? people elsewhere are much more kindhearted and gentle in dealing with each other , but they 're not as likely to support government social programs new yorkers are the reverse
for years women have told me , my husband fell in love with you in summer of '42 , ' said jennifer o'neill , who played the 22yearold older woman who seduces the 15yearold boy in the classic 1971 film now they say , 'my husband is in love with you and so is my son' she smiled goodnaturedly jennifer o'neill is 51 now and possibly the most stunning grandmother in america \( yes , grandmother three times over \) you can see why she was the spokeswoman for cover girl cosmetics for 30 years that job , she says , and her role in summer of '42 have been professional highlights in a life filled with so much turmoil and unhappiness , so much of it caused by ms o'neill herself , that she has just published her aptly titled autobiography , surviving myself \( william morrow \) here s what she s survived eight husbands and nine marriages \( she married one twice \) , nine miscarriages , a suicide attempt at 14 , shock therapy after her daughter , aimee , was born and a broken back after a riding accident \( i did precisely what christopher reeve did , she said god had his hand on my shoulder \) her fifth husband sexually abused aimee , and ms o'neill accidentally shot herself in the stomach with a gun he kept in their home \( the bullet missed my spine by a fraction of an inch , she said \) there s more , including loads of illconsidered career moves , but those are the highlights as it were when i first thought about writing the book , i went back and forth between 'who would be interested \? ' and 'it s nobody s business , ' ms o'neill said recently , sitting at a corner table at aureole all my life i was a person on a treadmill of drama and trauma , trying to fill up a hole inside my daughter encouraged me to explore the tough issues in the book , starting with the issue of sexual abuse , with the idea that the truth will set you free but as i reviewed my life , i was horrified i realized so many issues had not been healed so i 've been revisiting them and trying to understand as ms o'neill spoke , she ate a threecourse lunch and sipped a glass of cabernet sauvignon tall and still modelthin , she was dressed in a black pantsuit with a flowered blouse and a purse to match she seemed like a placid outoftowner , murmuring how unusual about the lemon custard and peering at the menu through oversize glasses the only hints at a darker side came with questions she did not want to answer , like one about a stepdaughter her easy manner changed instantly her face darkened , her mouth tightened and the song i 'll be hard to handle came to mind and stayed but despite the glimpse of inner turmoil , ms o'neill seems to remain philosophical about getting older the triple rows of pearls at her neck did n't entirely hide the lines there neither did she try to camouflage her crow s feet i do n't think anything is wrong with plastic surgery , she said , but i have n't had it it s such a cliche to say that the inside is what counts but when i feel peaceful and happy , that s what s important certainly on the surface of ms o'neill s upbringing , everything seemed as it should she was raised in new rochelle , ny , and wilton , conn , by her mother , irene , and her father , oscar o'neill jr , who owned a medical supply company they moved to new york city , and their daughter enrolled at dalton by 15 , she had been signed by the ford modeling agency , appeared on the cover of vogue and was earning 80 , 000 a year in 1963 the outside seemed marvelous , exciting and perfect , and it was none of the above , ms o'neill said my parents and i are great friends now , but my initial need for them to love me was very painful parents need to love their children unconditionally that s where selfrespect is born she said she had tried psychotherapy unsuccessfully therapy would always interest me , but i could n't connect my mind to my heart it left me mentally stimulated and emotionally disconnected what reconnected her , she says , was becoming a bornagain christian in 1988 she is careful , however , not to proselytize i do n't want to preach to anybody i only want to say what happened to me , she said i was approached by a christian publisher , but i did n't want this book to sit only on a christian shelf i hope i wrote it with my arms wide open to everyone she is in her ninth marriage , to mervin louque , a music producer in nashville i know i 'll be with him forever , she said , then smiled as she heard herself speak you know , it s amazing , she went on with every single one i was sure it was it i ca n't understand how i'm sitting here and not the biggest cynic with each marriage it was almost like doing a new character and going on location , setting up house with a new extended family , new stepchildren looking back , i do n't know how i did it i was so determined i just wanted to be happy , to be loved and that is not an attractive package , someone who wants to be loved so much what does she think she did wrong \? i chose people who put me down , she answered immediately it was what i was accustomed to nothing i did was good enough
in the month since announcing her interest in a united states senate seat from new york , hillary rodham clinton has discussed her potential candidacy with more than 50 influential democrats in the state , most often in lengthy telephone calls she placed from the private quarters of the white house mrs clinton , over the last few weeks , talked about her possible political future with labor leaders , elected officials and democratic party chairmen from suburban and upstate counties crucial to winning a race she also recently entertained powerful new york democrats and public figures at the white house , including dennis rivera , the labor leader several of those who spoke with mrs clinton said she did not hint at her ultimate decision , but was systematically studying the politics and issues of a state where she has never lived a number of them said she told them that she planned to do polling and was looking for ways to raise money even before she made a decision on the race many of the county officials , who seem stunned and pleased by the first lady s attention , described their conversations about local issues with mrs clinton as lengthy and very detailed she s obviously been doing her homework , said steve pigeon , the democratic chairman of erie county , the state s largest democratic stronghold outside of new york city mr pigeon said he spoke by phone to mrs clinton for an hour on monday night i have to explain to a lot of candidates who come to me that you ca n't view upstate monolithically , he said she already knew the vast differences mr pigeon said mrs clinton told him she did not want her delay in making a decision to undercut the ability of other potential democratic candidates like representative nita m lowey of westchester to raise money largely because of the possible impact on other likely candidates and their ability to raise money if mrs clinton does not run , many democrats have been irked by her announcement that she will not decide until later this year , perhaps as late as the fall the election is in november 2000 in an apparent response to that concern , the first lady and her advisers are exploring fundraising options she said they 're looking for vehicles to raise money to be used for whoever the candidate is , mr pigeon said i think as long as she s raising money that can be used no matter who runs , whether it s her or nita , that can buy some time election law lawyers said yesterday that such a vehicle might be a committee , allowed under federal election law , that would raise money for an unspecified senate candidate in donations of up to 1 , 000 in making her calls , mrs clinton works from a list of 200 names provided by harold m ickes , a former white house official and a veteran of new york politics mrs clinton s advisers say she has methodically made her way through the democratic power structure in new york state , reaching out not only to labor leaders and local democratic leaders , but to fundraisers , members of the new york congressional delegation and leaders of black , jewish , hispanic and women s groups she has also had meetings at the white house yesterday with the new york city comptroller , alan g hevesi , and last friday with new york s assembly speaker , sheldon silver mr hevesi said that he and the first lady spoke for more than an hour , half of which he said was spent discussing the case of amadou diallo , the unarmed african immigrant whose shooting death by the new york city police has led to protests against mayor rudolph w giuliani , a potential opponent of mrs clinton mr hevesi said mrs clinton brought up the case herself , but made no comment on mr giuliani s handling of it mr silver said he met for an hour and 45 minutes with the first lady in another indication that mrs clinton may be positioning herself as a candidate , mr silver said that she elaborated on her remarks last year that a palestinian state was very important to middle east peace mr giuliani has called her comments a very big mistake , and political analysts have said her remarks could give him a chance to cut into any support she has among conservative jewish voters mr silver said mrs clinton told him that her remarks were a reflection of her discussions with yitzhak rabin , the late israeli prime minister , and that rabin had told her that 'it was very difficult to negotiate with a nonentity' mrs clinton also said her remarks were not inconsistent with american policy , the speaker added most upstate and suburban democratic party officials said they came away from speaking with her believing that she would be a candidate i thought i was talking to a political pro , said steve paquette , the onondaga county democratic chairman , who spoke to mrs clinton for a halfhour last thursday i honestly think for her to be taking the next broad step of calling folks like me , that s more than sticking your toe in the water mrs clinton often calls at the end of the working day , sometimes after mr ickes who now has his own washington consulting firm has paved the way
at a time when joblessness has fallen to just 43 percent of the work force and employers are loudly complaining about labor shortages , companies are also announcing record numbers of layoffs it does n't seem to make sense , does it \? yesterday , for example , eastman kodak disclosed plans to cut up to 2 , 500 more jobs on top of the 17 , 700 it had already planned to eliminate by the end of the year not long ago , procter gamble announced a mass layoff of about 15 , 000 , with 2 , 400 in north america , as it reorganizes its worldwide operations and levi strauss , fighting off competition from makers of cheaper jeans , said this year that it would close half of its manufacturing plants in the united states and canada , moving work overseas and laying off 5 , 900 workers indeed , according to the widely followed monthly surveys by challenger , gray christmas , an international outplacement firm , layoff announcements in the first half of this year are running about 40 percent higher than 1998 , which was a record year why are the challenger surveys picking up rising layoffs at a time that unemployment hovers near a 30year low \? on the surface , it seems paradoxical but economists and labor market analysts , including those at challenger itself , say it is not contradictory at all job creation will far outdistance automation and job destruction , explained john challenger , the firm s chief executive sometimes a company must take a step backward by cutting part of its labor force in one area in an effort to move two steps forward into more profitable areas of development so , though layoffs tend to attract more attention during periods of economic stress , they can often signal economic vitality and longterm willingness to create jobs , even as they temporarily victimize some workers take the case of att , which announced in early 1996 that it would lay off 40 , 000 workers not long afterward , the company ended up hiring enough new people in providing wireless and local telephone services and running telecommunications systems for major corporations that by the end of 1996 its total employment had hardly budged att continues to lay off workers in some of its divisions even as its adds workers to others , like its new cable operations a tip that layoffs are not necessarily sinister or a sign of weakness comes from looking at the industries that have been hit hardest in april , the computer industry hardly anyone s candidate as a troubled sector announced the most job cuts that month , more than 10 , 000 electronics , another hightechnology star , was second , with 8 , 900 according to the challenger survey , between 1993 and 1998 the computer industry announced almost 273 , 000 job cuts , about the same as retail trade and second only to the aerospacemilitary industry more broadly , the challenger data need to be put into the context of a labor market that is constantly churning challenger says announced layoffs are running at about 60 , 000 a month that might seem like a lot but set it against another , truly startling , number 13 million workers change their employment status in a typical month , according to the bureau of labor statistics on average , that means that 13 million americans leave home or school to enter the labor force , exit the labor force without looking for new work , find new work after a spell of unemployment or search for work after they quit or are dismissed or laid off every month seen in the context of that enormous number of job changes that take place every month , the challenger numbers barely register as a blip actually , the 13 million figure is an underestimate of labor market churning for it takes no account of workers who manage to change employers within a month nor does it include workers who change jobs within the same company officials at the labor department estimate that 40 percent of the work force , or roughly 50 million workers , changes jobs within a year in manufacturing alone , prof steven davis , a labor economist at the university of chicago , estimates that 10 percent to 12 percent of jobs disappear in a typical year , a number that has not changed in decades finally , careful scrutiny of government data suggests that challenger s surveys might not accurately track the number of actual layoffs taking place throughout the economy the challenger surveys draw rapt attention because they are the only data available monthly , providing the only instant barometer of corporate layoffs the question is how representative the announcements of layoffs are of actual layoffs for one thing , the surveys might be biased toward large companies , since they are the only ones that are required by law to announce plant closings and large layoffs ahead of time further , some job cuts are achieved through attrition rather than through actual layoffs the labor department does collect data every two years on displaced workers workers who lose their jobs because plants close or move , or because sales fall once collected and analyzed , the government s data , drawn from the entire economy , have shown that the actual number of job losses was significantly greater than those picked up by challenger s more limited surveys that is unsurprising
auction fatigue set in at sotheby s last night on the week s fourth consecutive evening auction the atmosphere in the york avenue salesroom reflected tired buyers' determination to control the proceedings and not get carried away the tightly edited hourlong auction ended with strong results , but not as strong as the auction house had hoped sotheby s managed to sell 1442 million worth of impressionist and modern art , less than its low estimate of 1503 million diana d brooks , sotheby s chief executive worldwide , said it was sotheby s highest total since 1990 of the 45 works offered , 36 sold the sale s star painting was modigliani s nude sitting on a divan \( the beautiful roman woman \) , a 1917 portrait in which the sitter is provocatively sitting with her legs crossed three bidders vied for the painting , which sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for 167 million , just above its high estimate of 16 million the price was a record for the artist , eclipsing his portrait of jeanne hebuterne , sold at christie s last year for 151 million last night s sale was a true test of the art market , experts said , since it included more works expected to bring at least 5 million than any other sale at either sotheby s or christie s since the peak of the late 1980 s but as prices rose , the number of bidders grew noticeably thinner several times , the evening s auctioneer , tobias meyer , seemed just to squeak past a work s reserve \( the secret minimum price agreed upon by the seller and the auction house \) to make a sale everyone was keeping a tight top on what they were prepared to bid , said james roundell , a partner of dickinson roundell , which has galleries in both london and new york david norman , head of sotheby s impressionist and modern department in new york , noted that this season people do n't want to jump in they have a more reserved approach to bidding while the sale lacked the single blockbuster painting that both christie s and sotheby s had on tuesday and wednesday nights with their 40millionplus picassos , some of last night s offerings came with particularly interesting provenances the owner of the modigliani , and several other works in the sale , was prince jefri bolkiah , brother of the sultan of brunei , whose wellpublicized financial troubles forced him to sell some of his prized collection the trouble is , he had bought all of the works on offer at the top of the market still , they were among the best works being auctioned besides the modigliani , he was selling in the meadow , an 1876 monet that depicts the artist s wife , camille , reading in her garden the painting was estimated at 16 million to 20 million cheap , considering that the prince had paid 24 million for it at sotheby s in london 11 years ago only two buyers bid on the painting , which ended up selling for 154 million the prince was also selling degas s young dancer at 14 , a posthumous cast from 1922 of a dancer with a creamedcolored grosgrain silk bodice and a tulleandgauze tutu in 1988 , prince jefri bought the sculpture for 101 million from the collection of william mayer goetz , a founder of 20th centuryfox , and his wife , edith at christie s in new york last night , the sculpture carried an estimate of 9 million to 12 million five bidders tried to buy it before it finally sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for 123 million the price was a record for a degas sculpture another cast of the same sculpture , sold at sotheby s by the shelburne museum in vermont in 1996 , brought 119 million \( final prices include the auction house s commission , 15 percent of the first 50 , 000 and 10 percent of the rest estimates do not reflect commissions \) a cezanne became the evening s second most expensive painting earthenware jug , a still life of fruits and a pitcher from 1893 , sold , but barely estimated at 18 million to 25 million , it went to an unidentified bidder for 165 million the cover art on the sale catalog was monet s three poplars in gray weather , an 1891 landscape painted at the artist s home in giverny it is one of a series of 24 poplars paintings estimated at 10 million to 15 million , it sold for 11 million seven picassos were up for sale none were of the quality of the portraits that sold for 45 million at christie s on tuesday and 495 million at sotheby s on wednesday , and they produced mixed results one of the evening s biggest disappointments for sotheby s was boy in a circus costume , a 1905 gouache portrait of a boy in a circus costume with his hand on his chest , estimated at 10 million to 15 million mr meyer opened the bidding at 75 million , and when few bidders responded , he stopped at 92 million the work was on the market not so long ago it brought 121 million at christie s in 1995 the sculpture market has been strong this season last night , henry moore s draped reclining woman , a bronze cast in an edition of six in 1957 and 1958 , was expected to fetch 25 million to 35 million it brought 27 million from an unidentified telephone bidder at christie s on tuesday night , an earlier draped reclining woman from 1969 sold for 4 million , 1 million above its high estimate a smaller moore sculpture , mother with child on lap \( 1985 \) , had several interested takers last night mr roundell bought it for 838 , 500 , above its 700 , 000 high estimate asked why the bidding so often seemed thin , charles s moffett , codirector of sotheby s department of impressionist and modern art worldwide , said if the stakes are high , people wait to bid many of them said they never got a chance to put their hands in the air because the bidding went right by them photo modigliani s nude sitting on a divan \( the beautiful roman woman \) , which was sold for more than 167 million last night at sotheby s \( sotheby s new york \)
washington , april 21 as heads of nato countries began arriving here today for the 50th anniversary of the alliance , they were embarking on a summit meeting transformed from a celebration of triumph to a war council on the balkans the future of the alliance which successfully stood up to the soviet union and its communist allies in the warsaw pact but which has been grappling for a new role since the collapse of the soviet bloc has unexpectedly come to hinge , nato leaders say , on the outcome of the battle against president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia simply put , senator joseph r biden jr said in remarks at the senate foreign relations committee this week , if we do not achieve our goals in kosovo , nato is finished as an alliance administration officials say the allied leaders are hoping that the talks here will demonstrate the utility of nato and show that the alliance , rather than being an obsolete ornament striving for a new mission , is alive and acting our message is that the nato of the future is as good as the nato of the past , said ronald d asmus , deputy assistant secretary of state for european affairs for the alliance to be meaningful , he said , it must be able to deal with crises outside its member states , and kosovo underscored the fact that nato had come together on such a mission thus the war against mr milosevic has become the first example of nato as a regional policeman rather than a body of collective defense , as intended 50 years ago but this new position is one to which the alliance is totally unaccustomed , officials and analysts said in contrast to its sudden war against a balkan dictator , nato spent its first 40 years as an alliance bound by a mutual defense treaty , and did not fire a shot after its enemy evaporated with the fading of communism , the alliance methodically expanded by selecting three former satellites of the soviet union hungary , the czech republic and poland as new members it also extended its mission to include peacekeeping operations outside its membership , as happened in bosnia there were other programs planned in the past year that were intended to bring the alliance into a more forwardlooking mode before kosovo came onto the horizon , for example , the administration was pushing nato to address the spread of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons this was a way , the administration argued , for the alliance to become a modern , postsoviet organization secretary of defense william s cohen said today that as planned , a center aimed at eliminating such weapons will be presented this weekend but these plans will pale next to the immediacy of preventing a debacle in kosovo and the humiliation that would entail for the alliance the last thing the administration wants to come out of this weekend is the notion that a balkans dictator can stand up to nato air power and wreak havoc with the alliance , officials said but it will be difficult to avoid the fact that president milosevic has drawn the alliance into turbulent waters kosovo has brought nato into the nevernever land , said david gompert , the vice president of the rand research and consulting group and a member of the national security council in the bush administration it has brought us into a situation where a regime that slaughters its own people is no longer sovereign and where the united nations security council is no longer a requirement the stakes are so high in kosovo that mr gompert outlined two stark outcomes assuming nato does n't shatter , he said , something positive will emerge from this tragedy the most important result could be a stronger relationship between the united states and its european allies if nato cracks and as a consequence fails in kosovo , mr gompert continued , there would be a realignment of the western allies in essence , he said , an unprepared europe would be left to take care of the defense of europe , and the united states would turn almost exclusively to the defense of asia before kosovo , the centerpiece of the summit meeting was to have been the adoption of a new strategic concept now , as the leaders confront what amounts to the fourth balkan war of this century and discuss the scope of the atrocities against ethnic albanians , they will also be finetuning the wording of the strategic concept the concept talks of crisis management and partnership with nonnato countries this is an idea that can be broadly interpreted to cover the war in kosovo , officials said but even so , they added , it stops short of asserting that the allies should go to war over an ethnic conflict perhaps most telling is what will not be stated in the new strategic concept one of nato s most cherished descriptions of itself will be dropped these lines , which were at the heart of the previous statement of purpose , written in 1991 when the soviet union was still alive , will disappear the alliance is purely defensive in purpose none of its weapons will ever be used except in selfdefense to deal with new responsibilities outside its territory , nato set up several institutions under the allied umbrella one will be prominently on display here another will be conspicuously absent the permanent joint council , established as the place where russia would be informed on allied matters , is now suspended because the russians walked out in protest against the kosovo air campaign but suddenly more important is the euroatlantic partnership council , founded in 1997 for the 25 countries that belong to the partnership for peace , a sort of auditioning hall for alliance membership these countries include several on the edges of the kosovo war romania , bulgaria , croatia and slovenia as part of its search for a new mission in the early 1990 s , the allies these 25 countries to join the partnership the program , conceived by les aspin , then the secretary of defense , was intended to encourage nonnato members to develop civilian control of military ministries and to start joint planning and joint military exercises with nato by broadening its principals and methods across europe to such former communist states as ukraine , slovakia and georgia , and as far afield as tajikistan , the allies found new participants for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations for example ukraine , which joined the program , is part of the peacekeeping force in bosnia some of these countries , most notably albania and macedonia , have become what the administration calls front line states in the kosovo war , places where president milosevic is generating turmoil by expelling hundreds of thousands of refugees onto their territory these countries now need as much help as they can get from nato in recognition of this , a special session of frontline states was hastily added to the schedule this week , yet another reminder that the once ceremonial meeting has been transformed by mr milosevic to deliberations about war
the 25yearold plaza at the foot of the world trade center has reopened after an 18month renovation to give it what its designers say is a warmer and more inviting look the fiveacre austin j tobin plaza , the largest of its kind in the world , was long viewed as a civic disappointment , with cracked marble paving , an assemblage of tree boxes and few places to sit the new plaza , however , designed with an italian piazza in mind , was remodeled to lure the downtown resident and tourist alike , said cherrie nanninga , director of real estate for the port authority of new york and new jersey , which owns the world trade center a celebration featuring several concerts will be held today to mark the reopening of the plaza other performances will be held there throughout the summer the 12 million refurbishment has brought food kiosks featuring such upscale items as portobello mushrooms and goat cheese with outdoor tables and chairs , claycolored benches spiraling out from the vast central fountain and elegant lighting atop high metal stanchions most significant is the flooring , said ms nanninga 40 , 000 pieces of north american granite in two tones , pink and gray , replacing the white italian marble that weathered poorly in the harsh city climate the plaza , open and intended for use 24 hours a day , attracted curious visitors yesterday , some of whom work in the area and had been waiting for it to reopen a surprising number , however , found the plaza still lacking , and seemed more pleased with the weather than the space the plaza had originally been designed as a contemplative space or zen garden , where harried businessmen could find some tranquility during a busy workday , world trade center officials said the result , they said , was a sterile space the new plan , however , was to inject a sense of vitality into the 233 , 000squarefoot plaza , which is actually the roof that covers a large shopping mall , six subway lines and the path trains to new jersey and consultants for the project said that it was completed in a hurry , under a 22 , 500squarefoot airsupported tennis bubble to allow for winter work one unfinished project is the globelike statue by fritz koening in the center of the black marble fountain designed to rotate once an hour , it has sat dormant for a decade a consultant for the renovation said it would be moving again soon despite such marvels of urban architecture , new yorkers and even some tourists still found the plaza short on sun umbrellas and espresso the restaurant that serves it was closed and long on empty space by the cosi sandwich bar , geraldine noon , a british tourist , sat in one of the chairs , sipping poland spring water it s brilliant , it s just lovely , to sit here , she said , though she added that she was desperate for an espresso and there was none to be had an italian piazza with no espresso \? i do n't really think they can make it a piazza , she said not in new york , with these huge buildings looming she went on to propose some shade umbrellas and a slight redesign for the cosi awning dale beach , a merrill lynch employee who lay sprawled on a bench with his shirt off , said that he was just glad the plaza had reopened as to the renovation , he said , it s not much different than before derrick benjamin , who works at the world trade center , was pleased with the new granite floor as well as the sandwich shops and chairs but as his 3yearold daughter sat by the fountain , mesmerized by the play of water , he laughed about the italian piazza notion i would n't go that far , he said to me , it s still work photo workers built a stage friday for today s reopening celebration of the renovated plaza at the world trade center , and for a summer concert series \( billy smith 2d the new york times \)
the jail sentence was not merely punishment for the offense it was also an attempt to avoid more carnage mike tyson has done more damage with his incisors in the ring than he did to a couple of older motorists after a minor traffic accident last year he punched one man in the face and kicked another in the groin , and they lived to settle out of court they were lucky , because tyson s fists are a lethal weapon by definition , and so is his temper , by empirical evidence tyson has been heading in this direction since he was a child in the brownsville section of brooklyn he has acknowledged mugging neighborhood women trudging home with a few worn bills tucked into their frayed purses , perhaps lugging all the groceries they could afford or carry he did not just grab the purse or the groceries but inflicted damage upon them next time he might kill somebody , so it is necessary to give him a rematch with the heavy doors that give an ominous clang when they are locked tight behind a prisoner tyson s anger is still ticking in his next round behind bars effectively , six months before parole might kick in perhaps he will avail himself of the counseling and the sedatives that did not do the job the first time he has been used badly by the promoter don king and other mercenaries in his life , but he has also had treatment for anger and chemical help for depression nothing has worked perhaps this time it will at the moment , he is a menace to society , an oldfashioned term perhaps but totally appropriate in this case there are no political ramifications here mike tyson is an equalopportunity menace none of this is about boxing , by the way who cares if mike tyson , now 32 , ever fights again \? it does not matter what his physical condition might be in six months , assuming the state of indiana does not call him back for parole violation the real concern is what happens to random strangers , motorists or women who run afoul of his random anger by the way , mike tyson s terrible state is not the fault of boxing yes , this brutal business should be abolished , because society should not be paying two human beings to injure each other however , as ugly as it is , boxing did not create the demons that make tyson lose control and attempt to hurt other people boxing does , in fact , help turn some tough kids into decent adults , although the ultimate physical damage is far too high to justify its existence tyson was heading for a life of violence , and boxing did not help him most athletes who break the law get off easy a few are given harsh sentences because a judge works up indignation that these people are , you should pardon the expression , role models , and somehow let society down nobody expects mike tyson to be a role model , not with his long and frightening rap sheet it is impossible for anybody judges included to forget that tyson is a prominent athlete , once the heavyweight champion of the world everybody knows about the chunks of ears he chewed from evander holyfield in the ring everybody knows about the first prison sentence , for rape the sentence tyson received yesterday was necessary to put a dangerous and troubled human being back under the control of the state he was already on parole when he was riding in a car driven by his wife , monica , and it was hit from behind in what is normally described as a fenderbender unfortunately , there is little normal about this sad and angry man , who reacted physically to the two men it could have been much worse after the childhood muggings , he was said to have struck his first wife then he was convicted of assault toward women who spurned his advances , and he was sent to prison in indiana for the rape of a young woman who had foolishly gone to his hotel room this is all public record , part of the history that the judge in maryland had to consider yesterday beyond the legal history , there are the recorded observations of tyson , sullen and cynical and withdrawn one moment , then visibly angry the next moment a few people who stand to make money off tyson criticized the sentence yesterday they are the latest in a long line of apologists who needed him mike tyson was not getting better in their company assault is frightening rape is hideous the next incident could very well be lethal mike tyson badly needs help , but it must start in a secure place photo mike tyson \( lauren shay \)
it s the freedom on snow , says kevin murray i 've asked him why he skis freedom must mean a lot , i think , to be out on a bitter day like this we 've been riding the chairlift through a gray sky the snow guns are pounding ice into the air to cover the trails the machines are as loud as jet engines , and a gusting wind hurls the crystals against our faces we 're almost at the top mr murray lifts the safety bar the wind swirls our skis touch down on the snowcovered ramp and we glide off the lift , me on a pair of kneissls , mr murray strapped into his monoski he s sitting in what is basically a bucket , with four heavy straps cinching his body down the bucket is connected to a single ski by a complicated contraption of springs and levers mr murray slides down the ramp and turns gently to the left in his hands he holds outriggers , which are like ski poles that end in miniature skis instead of sharp points he glides to a stop and waits for his instructors to join him born with spina bifida , kevin murray has never walked but for the last two years this 20yearold college freshman has been skiing , mainly where we are , at ski windham , in windham , ny , where the adaptive sports foundation runs the country s increasing number of programs for disabled skiers there are three instructors devoted to mr murray today , led by kirsty digger , who has limited use of her legs because of a spinal cord injury she , too , is strapped into a monoski , while the other instructors stand on their skis we ski down when mr murray falls , the instructors haul him upright again occasionally it s a struggle when he falls headfirst down the hill , they have to wrestle him around until the ski is angled slightly downhill his body , and sometimes his face , scrape the snow it looks like skiing at its worst cold , dispiriting yet mr murray says on the chairlift after the run i have a lot of patience for things it can be frustrating , but i keep getting back up that s all you can do some runs are better than others on our next trip down , mr murray swoops in graceful arcs down the slope , hardly falling at all on a monoski , it seems , there s no such thing as sloppy technique either it works beautifully , or you crash ms digger coaches quietly and frequently skis ahead to demonstrate her instructions she is a highly ranked instructor in the eastern division of the professional ski instructors of america she works full time as a nurse in pennsylvania she receives no pay for teaching the disabled how to ski none of the instructors do later ms digger and mr murray are wheeling through the ski lodge at the base of the mountain , both in light , narrow , maneuverable quickie designs wheelchairs they 're sports cars in comparison with the clunky chairs you see in hospitals ski equipment adapted for those with disabilities is just as innovative and advanced in addition to the monoskis , there are biskis , which have two skis instead of one in the program s equipment locker i see a walker outfitted with skis and both standing and sitting skiers can use outriggers in a wide variety of sizes some people need more than special equipment to learn how to ski several students have down syndrome or cognitive disorders emily solarsh , 14 , is autistic she s outside with her instructor , pounding out endless fast runs on the mountain the weather is too bitter to lure her father , larry solarsh , from his table in the lodge emily loves the sensation of going down the mountain , mr solarsh says it calms her down skiing is the first activity emily s family has discovered in which they can all have fun together , he said it made possible their first family vacation , to a ski area in vermont skiing is the rare sport in which the disabled can participate side by side with other athletes emily and her instructor come in , crusted with ice and snow she is now a gungho skier who makes unbroken highspeed runs down windham s slopes but learning was n't easy at first emily was afraid two instructors held her as she skied it was several winters before she was able to move independently emily does n't acknowledge the instructor as she leaves with her father but she 'll be back , probably a dozen times this winter there are about 120 instructors in the adaptive skiing program they are a mix of nurses , engineers , firefighters , physical therapists , teachers and others they refuse to consider themselves dogooders these teachers do n't have bigger hearts , says an instructor , wynn englisbe we just have our eyes open ski teaching is such a lowpaid occupation that it s virtually a volunteer enterprise no matter what , he reasons and unlike many patrons of standard ski schools , the disabled students are rarely whiny , impatient or poorly motivated , he said there s so much to learn about courage from these students and their parents , he says nevertheless , signing up for a season of teaching takes commitment instructors go through 11 days of training and then promise to teach at least 16 days given that the ski season may last four months , instructors need to commit most of their winter weekends
often this week i found myself wondering how saddam hussein would celebrate aug 5 , the first anniversary of his spectacular victory in my mind s eye i saw magnificent stomping and feasting in the great halls of his palaces , and in my ear was the contemptuous slapping of thighs about the un and its top bureaucrats who worked so hard to give iraq this wonderful victory certainly no dictator has more reason to rejoice eight years ago he was ground into the desert sands by a coalition of nations , americanorganized and led parades were held in the us coalition leaders drank toasts to each other none were so smallminded as to comment on saddam s refusal to show up to sign iraq s surrender document nor , almost a decade later , do they stoop to mention his failure to appear at any of the meetings where saddam s victory has taken place uniraq meetings in baghdad or the elegant chamber of the un security council , created half a century ago in new york for the cause of peace and freedom , as it is still put with a straight face the meetings last year were to try to find the exact words of chamberlainism that would persuade saddam to permit the un to carry out inspections in iraq for nuclear , bacteriological and chemical weapons when he lost the gulf war he promised the inspections would be satisfactorily finished in 15 days early last year , despite his relentless daily effort to block inspection teams , they found that iraq could become a nuclear power within a year or two if inspection ceased , and could mount a chemical and bacteriological war after three months but most council members except america and britain sabotaged the inspection teams and their chief , richard butler , one of the most staunch and skillful un officials i have known in the un s lifetime in conspiracy with saddam , russia led the council members who fought inspection their goal was to lift the commercial sanctions against saddam , which prevented them from doing billions in business with iraq never do these nations speak the truth that sanctions , which hurt the ordinary iraqi , would be lifted almost instantly if saddam lived up to his inspection promises forbes magazine estimates he is the sixthrichest man in the world , so we can assume he has plenty to eat when mr butler s inspectors drew too close to iraqi weaponry , last aug 5 saddam curtly told the un no further inspection would be allowed what the un did about saddam s tearing up of the gulf peace agreement was exactly nothing the us , acting outside the un later , did mount an air campaign against iraq it lasted just four days because of the advent of the muslim holiday of ramadan , which apparently took washington by surprise iraq and other muslim states attacked israel in 1973 when yom kippur and ramadan came together mr butler s contract expired about two months ago neither he nor the un s top bureaucracy wanted any further part of each other now he is a fellow at the council on foreign relations , writing in the first issue of talk tina brown s loving gift of heartburn to the magazine world the australian butler is a hard fast bowler , or whatever they call it in cricket he pays his respects to secretary general kofi annan , who had boasted that he could do business with saddam he did , straight to bankruptcy mr butler accuses mr annan of handing saddam the greatest possible prize destruction of the un inspection commission , the only barrier to iraq s achievement of weapons of mass destruction so by another aug 5 , possibly the next , iraq will be resurgent with the combination of massdeath weaponry and saddam s passionate commitment to control the mideast , including all western roads to it one strategy , only , will block this the us should inform all its allies real or pretended that helping iraq continue to refuse inspection , or in any other way , will be considered an act hostile to america s high national interests and we will no longer regard them as allies or true friends , real , pretend or wouldbe i do not think us leadership is wise or strong enough to adopt that strategy saddam will be allowed to follow his own , with consequences we are afraid even to consider , yet
microsoft general electric ibm walmart stores cisco systems these are the companies that have led this decade s bull market the next time a shareholder report for your stock mutual fund comes in the mail , take a look at its top holdings you may find a lot of these big names if your fund has held such stocks for a long time , chances are that it has beaten most other funds in performance and that may lead you to believe that you have lucked into a superior fund manager but not everyone may come to that conclusion some will tell you that instead , you are actually a victim of an increasingly common and expensive trend toward closet indexing , in which mutual fund managers essentially mimic a benchmark index and it is a practice that provokes some strong responses a big ripoff , said robert sanborn , who manages the oakmark fund john c bogle , the founder of the vanguard group , calls the practice horrendous closet indexing works like this a fund manager invests most of a fund s assets in stocks that comprise the bulk of a particular index the manager invests the rest in other stocks or to double up on a few from the index despite the lack of significant stockpicking , the fund still charges fees that are 3 to 10 times as high as those of a basic index fund , which simply tracks a benchmark though shareholders pay a lot extra for such active management , the fund , over time , is unlikely to beat the index by any significant margin more likely , it will lag behind it largely because of the higher fees and it will bring higher taxes , because it trades stocks more often that is not good for investors but because so much of the actively managed fund is tied to an index , it will probably not trail the benchmark by much , thus avoiding the huge underperformance say 10 percent or more that prompts investors to withdraw their money that is good news for the fund company closet indexing is not new but new figures crunched by morningstar inc , the chicago financial publisher , show just how strong the trend has become to get your arms around the idea , it helps to understand a measure called rsquared , which gauges the correlation between a fund and whatever index usually the standard poor s 500stock index it is measured against if a fund has an rsquared of , say , 90 , that means that 90 percent of the fund s movement can be explained by movements in the component stocks of the index morningstar found that for the three years ended in august , the rsquared of the average actively managed united states stock fund was more than 74 , up from 58 in the three years ended in december 1994 and among largecapitalization funds where stock fund investors keep 2 out of every 3 the average offering had an rsquared of more than 86 , up from 71 over all , the numbers mean that more and more of the return of united states stock funds is tied to changes in the s p 500 in fact , five years ago , only 1 in 12 largecap funds had an rsquared of 90 or higher that compares with 2 out of 5 today as of august , the percentage of such funds had declined somewhat from yearend 1998 , but researchers say that there is a strong seasonal factor to the rsquared phenomenon , with managers making their portfolios more like those of their indexes as the year comes to a close even so , 1 of every 7 largecap funds including a number of the biggest funds in the country still score 95 or higher most of these are virtually indexed portfolios but with far higher expenses than an index fund , mr bogle said if it looks like a duck , walks like a duck , quacks like a duck , it s probably a duck , mr bogle said you 're paying a ton more , and you 're getting more turnover , which is a horrible tax expense , and you 're getting fees that are extremely difficult to justify of course , you might expect mr bogle to cry foul , because it is his company s flagship offering the vanguard index 500 fund that is the subject of the rampant imitation the mimicry springs from a number of factors , according to fund managers , executives and recruiters fund companies used to be far more willing to tolerate swings in performance , allowing managers to act on their convictions now , more fund families are singlemindedly focused on the bottom line and have found that hewing closely to a predictable investing style is a good way to attract new customers and to retain old ones and in corporate america , the executives who choose funds for their employees' 401 \( k \) plans , which now account for onethird to onehalf of fund sales at many larger fund families , put a high premium on performance that is consistent with popular benchmarks such consistency means that corporate officers , often human resources executives , can avoid the embarrassment of trying to explain why the largecap growth fund they selected for the 401 \( k \) is badly trailing the overall market but individual investors have helped to spur the development , too increasingly , they want to make their own decisions on market timing and asset allocation , and so resent managers who take these decisions out of their hands they do n't want to wake up and find , for example , that their largecap equity fund has put its assets into cash , bonds or small stocks
prompted by several flawed executions in florida s electric chair , the united states supreme court has agreed to review for the first time whether electrocution violates the constitution by taking the case , legal scholars said yesterday , the court will inevitably refresh its definition of cruel and unusual punishment the electric chair was introduced in 1890 in new york as a more humane method of execution but has been abandoned by most states as less humane than lethal injection several bloody malfunctions of the florida electric chair have drawn public attention , but have not moved the state s legislature to adopt other methods of execution the high court s decision to review a case challenging the constitutionality of florida s electric chair , announced on tuesday night , stays the executions of two murderers who were scheduled to die this week in florida the decision could temporarily bar executions in florida and three other states alabama , georgia and nebraska where electrocution is the only method of execution and the ultimate decision could bar electrocution in three other states ohio , south carolina and virginia that allow it if the condemned person chooses it florida legislative leaders said yesterday that they would consider calling a special session of the legislature to add an option for lethal injection so that executions could continue florida ranks third in the nation in the number of executions that have taken place in recent decades , behind texas and virginia gov jeb bush of florida , a republican , called the court s decision disappointing because families of victims would have to wait for justice to be served he said he was exploring all options to keep the death penalty alive in florida bloody photographs of allen lee davis , who was executed in florida in july , have been posted on the internet and will be part of the evidence reviewed by the supreme court mr davis , who killed a pregnant woman and her two young daughters in 1982 , had a nosebleed just before he was electrocuted blood seeped through his shirt and the buckle holes of the chest strap in two earlier executions in florida , in 1990 and 1997 , flames shot out from the masks of the inmates and the smell of burned flesh filled the witness room similar malfunctions have occurred in other states , not only with electrocutions but also with lethal injections in alabama , opponents of the death penalty said they were surprised that the supreme court agreed to take the case the method of execution has been a tangential part of the legal and legislative battles over the death penalty , which have focused in the past decade on procedures for appeals and the minimum age at which capital punishment can be applied if the state of alabama embraced lethal injection , this would n't be a fairer place , said bryan a stevenson , director of the equal justice initiative , which represents inmates on alabama s death row but when the legislature says , 'we want to see people burn , we want to see people suffer , ' it becomes more of a concern in atlanta the georgia attorney general , thurbert baker , a democrat , said the state would continue to execute inmates in its electric chair while the supreme court considers the case it is still the law of the land here in this state , he said in nebraska , which already is reviewing the fairness of its death penalty , gov mike johanns , a republican who supports the death penalty , said he would not instruct the state s attorney general to change its procedures in death penalty cases but nebraska has not executed anyone in the last two years , and is already reviewing the fairness of its death penalty in a study ordered by the legislature the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment , contained in the eighth amendment to the constitution , has been described by the supreme court as an evolving standard of decency throughout most of the nation s history , hanging was the popular method of execution in most states in 1890 , as public hangings were increasingly considered barbaric , new york state used the electric chair to execute william kemmler , who had hacked his lover to death kemmler s case went to the supreme court , but the court did not decide whether electrocution was cruel and unusual instead , it found preemptively that the eighth amendment did not apply to the states it was not until 1962 that the court reversed course , making the eighth amendment the last of the bill of rights to apply to the states the supreme court has never reviewed evidence whether any method of execution violates the eighth amendment , said deborah w denno , a professor of law at fordham university who has written extensively on capital punishment electrocution was ultimately adopted by 26 states , but none after 1949 lethal injection was first used in texas in 1982 it has now been chosen by 34 of the 38 states that have death penalty laws , either as the only method or as a choice given to the condemned if the court sets a new standard of what cruel and unusual means , it could set terms for other attacks on the death penalty is it cruel the way the death penalty arbitrarily strikes in one city and not another , that those with good lawyers are spared and those with bad lawyers are n't \? said richard c dieter , executive director of the death penalty information center , a washington nonprofit group that opposes the death penalty that analysis could be overly hopeful for opponents of the death penalty , said professor denno of fordham , who testified as an expert in the florida cases at the state court this court spent a lot of time developing standards of cruel and unusual punishment , relatively generous standards , particularly in the area of prison conditions , professor denno said but the court has never seen pictures of an inmate sitting on a chair with blood on his face , he continued the state of florida always says , 'it s a fluke , an unforeseeable accident' the court might say 'it s no longer a fluke it s a pattern' photo florida s electric chair in the death chamber at the

as an art gallery scene , the upper east side may have an identity problem the phrase itself lacks the cuttingedge hipness of those charmed double syllables , soho and chelsea and the actual area less a neighborhood than an aggregate of them is amorphously vague of border and devoid of geographical cohesion in addition it is chockablock with museums small , large , rich , poor that stretch 35 blocks from the frick collection to el museo del barrio , in a socalled museum mile that is closer to two without much logic , the conditions contribute to a downtown prejudice that sees the upper east side as both diffuse and monolithic the land of museums , museum trustees and private dealers , not galleries and artists but these days , when soho is dotted with stores as chic as madison avenue s and chelsea is dotted with galleries as chic as museums , a change of attitude seems to be in order it should be remembered that 20 years ago , before soho s rise , there was plenty of new art to be found above 72d street leo castelli s gallery , representing the pop and minimalist artists , was on east 77th street , around the corner from sotheby parkebernet , the city s leading auction house ronald feldman , who gave first new york shows to joseph beuys , chris burden and hannah wilke , was on 74th , in a building since swallowed up by the whitney at 24 east 81st , the bykert gallery \( a fusion of the surnames of its partners , jeffrey byers and klaus kertess \) introduced the painters brice marden , chuck close and joe zucker , as well as alan saret , dorothea rockburne and peter campus , who created \( gasp \) installation pieces in the small rooms of a onceelegant brownstone these days new art is still more likely to appear downtown , but at the moment , the upper east side s galleries and alternativetype institutions contain a great deal of interesting work by artists living , dead , bluechip , emerging or struggling in obscurity and its quiet , treelined streets are a pleasant change from the congested sidewalks of soho and 57th street and the wideopen desolation of chelsea for limbering up , consider three shows at alternative spaces clustered near 68th street and lexington avenue at the bertha and karl leubsdorf art gallery at hunter college , nature is not romantic features eight fairly wellknown artists , most in their 30 s , including alexis rockman , paula hayes , alyson shotz and gregory crewdson their views of the natural ranges from dim to dimmer to downright caustic charm and manmade artifice prevail at the new york school of interior design , where the watercolors and drawings of the designer and amateur artist mark hampton , who died last year , cover the walls of a renovated carriage house tiny renderings of

helen kennedy , the daily news s reporter in the balkans , is heading home onthespot coverage of the war and refugee crisis in kosovo is more than her newspaper can afford right now its newsroom budget has just been trimmed by 5 percent she is returning to a newsroom where no raises will be given this year and where reporters must get approval before taking a source to lunch the daily news , the inyourface tabloid that in the early 1990 s survived union confrontation , revolvingdoor ownership and bankruptcy , has been knocked back on its heels by a series of financial reversals just when the newspaper was ready to print a snazzy new color edition , balky pressroom equipment scuttled the attempt the newspaper s owners , fred drasner and mortimer b zuckerman , have had to pay more than 2 million for replacement parts and overtime by its pressmen in the last few months just when the news had amicably reached terms with its eight craft unions , a labor arbitrator a month ago gave a ninth union , representing the drivers , a far more expensive settlement since the craft unions are entitled to the same raises , the paper faces unexpected costs of 185 million in 1999 alone , executives say , and millions more in the future just when the paper was unveiling its expanded sunday edition , in which it is investing about 2 million , the new sunday staff finds itself coexisting with colleagues who are on a severely restricted financial diet no , this is not a reprise of the paper s neardeath experience less than a decade ago but the pinch is making the paper s owners testy , its journalists angry and its union leaders nervous if you 're asking , is the timing exquisite , mr drasner said dryly , the answer is no mr drasner and mr zuckerman said they would ask for help from all the newspaper s constituencies from employees to advertisers to suppliers but such assurances do not resonate in a newsroom already bruised by cutbacks , low raises and the departure in the last 18 months of enough colleagues to make up a baseball team , as one reporter put it the newspaper s editor , debby krenek , says the problems are manageable now , the key is to be very judicious about what you spend your money on , she said you can do that it s not fun but it s just managing things a little tighter and if you do that , you do n't have to make the major cuts none of us want to make there will be no layoffs , she said , and no cuts in the space that the paper devotes to news but no amount of explanations can dispel the suspicion and resentment the latest cutbacks bring for nine months , the monthly budgetary bulletins from the daily news have seemed an exercise in mathematics spend cut spend cut look , we are really investing in the sunday paper look , this labor arbitration award is going to cost a lot we will have to make some real cuts a newsroom buffeted by financial reversals and while all newsrooms are roiled about something at any given time , roiled is too mild to describe the feelings at the daily news , the country s sixthlargest newspaper , where anger and financial unease have made the place seasick in part , the nausea has been provoked by unforeseen reversals or , from a less forgiving perspective , failed gambits the paper might have gotten more relief from the pressroom labor and equipment bills if it had not lost a lawsuit against goss graphic systems , which supplied the 62 million press equipment it might have faced lower labor costs if it could have reached accommodation with the drivers' union two years ago now , it is appealing the march award to the newspaper and mail deliverers' union of new york , which represents 418 drivers who ferry 723 , 000 copies of the paper across the five boroughs and into the suburbs every day these unexpected bills come on top of significant investments the owners have made in the paper over the years a new unisys newsroom computer system is costing at least 4 million , and hundreds of thousands of dollars are supporting two extra reporters and seven extra pages a week devoted to brooklyn and queens the newspaper s most heralded investment an expanded sunday section , for which the newspaper hired a marquee editor , edward kosner , a former editor of newsweek , new york magazine and esquire , was upstaged by the most stinging reversal , the labor arbitration agreement the sunday expansion

chronic discontent far worse , some on the staff say , is their belief that the pain is not being shared equally for all the demoralizing cuts in the rest of the newsroom , mr kosner s sunday budget

employees interviewed extensively , spoke on the condition of anonymity the cutbacks send an extremely unfortunate psychological message , the executive added it suggests that we do n't have the money

in the 1992 presidential election , a struggling national economy was the big issue , as summed up by that year s democratic catch phrase , it s the economy , stupid in 1996 , the big issue was still the economy an economy rolling along so well that president clinton was able to coast to reelection so what s the big issue for election 2000 \? not the economy , says the pew research center for the people and the press according to a new poll conducted by the nonpartisan study group , based in washington , the economy is now rolling along so merrily that it ranks no 11 with voters as a pressing political issue the current most worrisome issue is health care , the poll found , followed , in order , by social security , medicare , education , taxes , the national debt , crime , gun control , foreign policy , national morality , the economy and , finally , welfare reform but as andrew kohut , the pew center s director , sees it , none of those issues is likely to dominate the 2000 campaign as the economy dominated the 1992 and 1996 campaigns none are so overriding , he says
cartagena , colombia , feb 24 attempts to forge the world s first global treaty to regulate trade in genetically modified products failed this morning when the united states and five other big agricultural exporters rejected a proposal that had the support of the rest of the roughly 130 nations taking part in the talks the treaty would have required that exporters of genetically altered plants , seeds or other organisms obtain approval in advance from the importing nation the talks broke down over the question of whether this requirement would also apply to commodities like wheat and corn proponents of the treaty , especially european and many developing nations , have resisted genetically modified products , worried that not enough is known about the possible effects on human health and the environment but washington and its allies have argued that such regulations would entangle the world s food trade in red tape from 25 percent to 45 percent of crops like corn , soybeans and cotton grown in the united states are genetically modified , according to united states industry estimates , and american negotiators feared that the proposal would have blocked or stalled some of the 50 billion in annual farm exports blearyeyed delegates from many nations , who have been negotiating day and night for more than a week , expressed fury at the united states , accusing it of intransigence and of putting the interests of its worldleading farming and biotechnology industries above the environment it s five nations against the world , said dr joseph m gopo , the delegate from zimbabwe , referring to washington and its allies , which actually number six there could be no greater injustice than that , he said the united states , he added , is holding the world at ransom the allies are canada , australia , chile , argentina and uruguay the delegates agreed to suspend the talks and resume them no later than may 2000 the united states had urged this , saying there were too many unresolved issues to achieve a consensus by the deadline , which was tuesday such agreements are generally done by consensus , not by an explicit vote it would be much better to get a sound instrument a year hence than to get a flawed instrument today , said rafe pomerance , a deputy assistant secretary of state but delegates from some other nations feared the process would now lose momentum even without a treaty , countries can limit the import of genetically engineered seeds or foods under their own law , subject to challenge under world trading rules some countries , particularly in europe , are doing this the treaty was mainly meant to help developing countries , which now lack the expertise and the legislation to regulate biotechnology the united states has often taken a stance different from much of the rest of the world on trade and environmental matters it has not ratified the convention on biological diversity reached at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 because some senators fear that american interests would be jeopardized the current talks on the biosafety protocol are an outgrowth of the biodiversity treaty the biosafety protocol would require exporters of genetically modified organisms , such as seeds into which new traits have been added by genesplicing , to obtain prior approval from the importing country some scientists worry , for instance , that if a plant were given genes allowing it to produce a drug , insects could be exposed , with unknown results some fear that a gene conferring insect resistance or drought tolerance on a crop could spread to weeds , creating super weeds washington and its allies were willing to have seeds covered by the treaty but they argued that commodities meant for eating and processing did not enter the environment developing nations and the european union argued that commodities should be included because they have seeds that can be planted also , there is much more concern in these countries than in the united states about possible health effects from eating genetically modified food some developing nations even wanted the treaty to cover products made from genetic engineering such as cornflakes made from modified corn , or blue jeans made from altered cotton , but this was dropped from the final draft another point of dispute that could not be resolved was that washington wanted world trade organization rules to take precedence over the biosafety protocol , to prevent other nations from using biosafety as an excuse to erect trade barriers the developing nations and europe wanted the biosafety protocol to be equal to or take precedence over wto rules michael williams , a spokesman for the united nations environment program , said this was the first environmental treaty he could remember in at least 20 years in which an agreement was not reached by the selfimposed deadline but officials here said the big stakes involved for industry made this difficult it s the first time that you have really possibly a legally binding instrument dealing with trade and the environment at the same time , said veit koester , a danish environmental official who headed the working group that drew up the draft of the treaty
two straight super bowl victories , trademark offense , glimmering endorsements and a striking transformation from being that team in the mountains with the funky orange jerseys to becoming the football franchise by which all others are judged yes , everyone in denver agrees life with the broncos is so royal , so regal fire up that jacuzzi sip another glass of champagne wait ! the plug has been pulled the bottle dropped the star quarterback john elway retires after january s super bowl linebacker john mobley drives his jeep off the road and is slapped with a charge of driving under the influence elway s successor , bubby brister , is benched and walks out of camp brian griese , who has thrown all of three regularseason passes , is named the starting quarterback linebacker bill romanowski is accused of fraudulently obtaining prescription drugs all before the first regularseason snap against miami tomorrow night at home in mile high stadium no elway , plus controversies like these , further reduces the chance that the broncos will become the first team to win three consecutive super bowls right \? people around here have had it pretty good , and there has been little controversy here in the last couple of years , broncos coach mike shanahan said so , what s wrong with that now \? it can be good i'm not trying to create it but i embrace it take our quarterback position i made my decision based on minicamps , preseason games , practices and summer camp bubby is better coming off the bench brian quickly came up now , i could have done it the easy way i could have let bubby start , just play the whole thing out , but that was not best for our football team our players do n't know the position like i do as far as bubby or any of them , i'm not trying to be popular i'm doing it for the team i told bubby that if he could not accept it , if he could n't work with me , let me know so i could trade him none of this bothers me what bothers me is not winning every team in the national football league is coming after the broncos now , full steam , especially the jets from the american football conference east and jacksonville from the afc central national football conference powers on the denver schedule this season include green bay and minnesota it is open season on the broncos shanahan knows he and his team are the hunted so , rather than quiver or shake , shanahan shook his team up the initial results were promising after a relatively listless preseason , denver s final preseason game was a 343 rout of san francisco in griese s debut i saw guys finishing plays , the veteran broncos end alfred williams said of the game i saw guys turning it on that s what we 'll have to do to defy the odds ominous odds remaining energized and eager after consecutive championships winning with a firsttime starting quarterback who is only 24 replacing the leadership and playmaking of elway handling controversy meeting the leaguewide , fullcourt press of attention and competition if you are not paying attention , rest assured that everyone else is , pat bowlen , the broncos' owner , said when you 're up , you 're not well liked i know that because for the last 10 years , i respected the 49ers and the cowboys but i did n't like them much we lost our first three super bowls they both won two straight that s where we are now with griese shanahan liked him from the start he drafted griese from michigan in the third round of the 1998 draft the trait he admires most about griese is his intelligence the wunderlich test is given to players in the draft , shanahan said an average score is 15 to 20 a real smart quarterback scores a 28 brian scored a 39 he has picked up the offense in total better than any quarterback i have been around and shanahan has coached not only elway , but also joe montana and steve young there is a coolness and calmness and great poise there , shanahan said of griese at michigan , he went undefeated his senior season and won the national championship now , that was n't a great offensive team he played on how many of those players are star pro guys now \? and given that he is the son of bob griese and his dad is a hall of fame quarterback , you put a kid around a man like that and it has to be an infectious environment blah , blah , said brister he thought the starting job was his because shanahan anointed him as elway s replacement soon after the super bowl and brister believed the job was his to lose during the regular season , not the preseason , although brister led the broncos to just one touchdown on 18 offensive possessions in the preseason the number that mattered , brister said , was that he was 40 as a regularseason starter when elway was injured but shanahan and bowlen believed brister was crumbling under the pressure of replacing elway the grind , the baggage and the responsibility seemed overwhelming , stifling and near impossible for brister , bowlen said if brian had carried that baggage for four months , i do n't know if we would be talking about him being the starter brister , initially emotional , said shanahan had lied to him and had made an unjust decision things have calmed , apparently i would imagine that there are guys on this team that i have to win over and earn their respect because they wanted bubby to be the starter , griese said but i am more concerned about not rushing things and being myself i do n't do a lot of talking people have compared my game to my father s , but i was 5 years old when he retired they say i play a lot like him , but it is not intentional my concern is getting this offense to score touchdowns that s how quarterbacks should be judged i saw the relationship , friendship , respect and trust that mike and john had for each other that s the kind of trust that leads you to the super bowl i do n't have to have the same kind of friendship but i like being in the game and knowing how my coach calls a game i like to get into his head and be able to anticipate what the next play call will be that s the kind of relationship that wins championships defensive end alfred williams said of griese he s so young miami is going to bring the house against him but i still see a party happening a seasonlong party , denver hopes , even with romanowski s situation hovering local and federal authorities are recommending that he , his wife , julie , and two others be charged with fraudulently obtaining prescriptions for phentermine the drug is primarily used for severe cases of obesity but is also a stimulant this whole thing has no legs , bowlen said i'm in the weight room with our players we had 45 guys make 100 percent of all offseason workouts and the rest made more than 80 percent it is a part of our program we emphasize i 'd have to be deaf and blind to not know there was some serious drug abuse going on are the broncos deaf and blind about a firsttime starter at quarterback possibly winning a super bowl \? about the drug charge and controversy eventually swallowing them \? that they are on the verge of possibly being embarrassed \? shanahan believes that his offensive line is improved that sensational running back terrell davis can produce even more the defense added a star in dale carter from kansas city , one of the league s premier singlecover cornerbacks shanahan expects more from his defense , especially until griese finds his way he said this team is his deepest , even without elway we have to prepare and get mentally connected or we are going to get embarrassed , he said , his eyes full of intensity controversy \?

washington , july 22 republicans in the house put down their marker today in the debate over how to allocate projected federal budget surpluses , passing the largest tax cut in nearly two decades despite a veto threat from president clinton the republican plan , which would cut taxes by 792 billion over the next decade , passed on a largely party line vote of 223 to 208 four republicans voted against it and six democrats voted in favor the outcome averted a major defeat for speaker j dennis hastert of illinois and the rest of the republican leaders , who scrambled throughout wednesday to keep the bill from being derailed by objections from a dozen or so moderates within their own party the moderates said the tax cut was too big and left none of the surplus for debt reduction and needed spending , but most of them voted for the bill in the end after adding a complex and hastily written provision that makes a portion of the tax cut contingent on reducing the interest payments on the national debt alan greenspan , the federal reserve chairman , infuriated some house republicans today by characterizing their drive for a huge tax cut as premature and economically unwise page c1 the republicans' bill calls for personal income tax rates to be cut gradually by 10 percent over the next decade , and for the top rate on capital gains to be reduced to 15 percent from 20 percent immediately it would also phase in a repeal of the tax on large inheritances , create a deduction for health insurance expenses , cut a variety of business taxes and reduce the socalled marriage penalty , which leaves many twoincome couples paying a bigger tax bill than if they were single so mr president , we say , what s wrong in letting american taxpayers keep more of their hardearned money , mr hastert said at a republican pep rally after the vote we trust them to spend it right , and we think you should , too the house bill stands almost no chance of becoming law but it represents the opening bid by conservatives as they head toward negotiations with the senate , which is moving toward passage of its own , somewhat less partisan tax cut , and with mr clinton , who despite his veto threat has opened the door to a smaller tax reduction the issue is among the most ideologically charged and politically potent facing congress and the clinton administration this year not since the 1920 s has the federal government had a realistic prospect of taking in more money than it spends over a sustained period current estimates show the government running a surplus of 29 trillion over the next 10 years , permitting both parties the luxury of setting out wish lists that reflect their basic philosophies about the size and role of the federal government , their approaches to longterm challenges like assuring the solvency of social security and their strategies for the 2000 elections beyond ideology and politics , there is also economics mr greenspan , usually one of washington s most outspoken proponents of tax cuts , suggested that congress should concentrate instead on paring the national debt big tax cuts typically stimulate economic growth , and the federal reserve is already concerned that the economy is overheating the timing is not right , mr greenspan said in response to a question at the house banking committee a few hours before the vote on the tax bill i think we will need a very important reduction in marginal tax rates , mr greenspan said , and in the capital gains tax rate at some point in the future when this economy inevitably falters on the house floor , republicans swept aside criticism of their taxcutting plan sending excess revenues back to the taxpayer , they said , was the best way to advance their goals of reducing the power of the federal government and increasing prosperity if the surplus is not used for tax cuts , they said , democrats would inevitably use it for new spending programs even with a big tax cut , republicans said there is already more than enough federal money to pay for domestic and military spending and deal with the longterm problems in medicare and social security despite polls showing that most voters rank tax cuts behind social security , medicare and debt reduction as the best use for the surplus , republicans said a broadbased tax reduction would help the party recapture the conservative fervor of ronald reagan s first term as president , when democrats in congress acceded to an even bigger tax reduction the democrats believe they know best how to spend money by spending it with government , said representative bill archer of texas , the author of the republican bill we believe the people know best how to spend their own money and what this debate is really all about is downsizing the power of washington and upsizing the power of people democrats replied that the republican plan was built on assumptions about future surpluses that might never materialize , risking the return of budget deficits and higher interest rates
detroit , nov 10 a federal judge today temporarily halted michigan s unusual program to test welfare applicants for drug use under a pilot program that started last month , michigan had been requiring welfare applicants at three sites , including one in detroit , to pass a drug test or be denied benefits michigan is the first state with such a program the american civil liberties union sued the state to stop the drug tests , arguing that they violated the privacy of welfare applicants and the constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure today , judge victoria a roberts of federal district court for the eastern district of michigan , northern division , granted a temporary restraining order that stops the tests until at least dec 14 , when another hearing has been scheduled the judge said she granted the order because the drug tests were probably unconstitutional kary l moss , executive director of the michigan office of the aclu , said the ruling means that for the time being , welfare applicants will not be forced to choose between their constitutional rights and providing for their families the state said it would comply with the court order but believes it will ultimately prevail we look forward to returning to this program , which was allowed by federal legislation , enacted by the michigan legislature and supported by our customers and the general public , douglas e howard , director of michigan s welfare agency , the family independence agency , said the drug testing pilot is an opportunity to help individuals find employment and to strengthen families we believe it is the right thing to do karen smith , a spokeswoman for the agency , said 81 percent of the applicants tested positive for drug use no one refused the test , ms smith said of the 258 tests analyzed , 237 tested negative while 21 tested positive of the positive results , three were for cocaine , and the rest were for marijuana while the state had results for only 258 tests , a total of 379 applicants had been tested at the three sites tests were required in alpena and presque isle counties in northeastern michigan , in berrien county in southwestern michigan and in one urban area , a part of western detroit michigan has been one of the early leaders in the effort to end traditional welfare , initiating programs intended to put recipients into the work force the state s caseload has dropped about 60 percent since october 1992 , when changes in welfare rules and the booming economy lowered the unemployment rate michigan s caseload stands at slightly more 80 , 000 , down from about 240 , 000 in the mid1990 s , said john truscott , a spokesman for gov john engler , a republican who has championed the welfare changes we know that drug abuse is a barrier to employment , mr truscott said our whole approach to welfare is helping people find a job and keep a job those who tested positive under the pilot program were required to get drug treatment in order to receive a welfare check anyone who refused treatment would have been denied benefits in the first month , none of those who tested positive refused treatment , mr truscott said other states have considered requiring drug tests but have backed away both florida and louisiana require applicants to answer questions about drug use and then use the answers to determine whether to administer a test new york and maryland had planned to require tests but found that other types of screening , like questionnaires , were cheaper new jersey , south carolina , wisconsin and minnesota randomly test welfare recipients with felony drug convictions
everything i know about casino gambling comes from old james bond movies from a distance , i have admired the magnificent casino buildings at monte carlo and badenbaden , but never ventured into one casinos seemed to me places reserved for upperclass playboys with unlimited amounts of money to throw away , and beautiful women who are anxious to help them but , at the port jefferson ferry office , i picked up a flier with a brazen invitation to come to the mohegan sun casino in connecticut the fare of only 30 , incuding the ferry and the bus , was impossible to resist i purchased a ticket , and took my old tuxedo out of mothballs james bond always wore a tuxedo in the many casinos he visited but my wife advised that , first time out , i should dress down a bit and rent a tuxedo in connecticut if necessary my fellow players on the tour were not quite the reckless young aristocrats i had imagined before leaving , i thought that i might be too old for all this excitement now i began to worry that i might not be old enough the majority of the group consisted of very elderly people , and there was not a tuxedo anywhere in sight watch your step , said the driver kindly , as i climbed laboriously on to the bus at bridgeport somehow , i had acquired arthritis on the ferry after a long drive , we arrived on the casino grounds , excitement rising on the bus , and pacemakers working overtime we were so deep in the woods that we might have been anywhere , or nowhere escape was obviously impossible the casino itself looks not unlike a prison or a mall , a huge blank building with no windows we were greeted by marlena , who gave us a 10 ticket to gamble on the wheel of fortune and another 10 voucher towards a meal thus \( at least in theory \) bringing the total cost of the trip down to 10 my plan was to use my voucher to win a couple of hundred dollars on the wheel of fortune , spend my winnings on some other games , and then retire to the bar with a martini \( shaken , not stirred \) until the bus came to take me away at 4 30 inside the entrance , most of the long island group vanished into the restrooms , and i continued alone into the mysterious interior of the place there was no mohegan sun , or any other kind of sun , to be seen inside the hall on this brilliant summer day , but a subdued twilight zone effect the strangest thing was the noise , a continuous , penetrating tone about the key of a , which may be intended to generate a sense of tension and excitement nobody else seemed to notice the decor was meant to be evocative of american indian themes plastic rocks , animated wolves and abstract trees in different seasons the visual effect was quite soothing but this was canceled out by the overwhelming impact of 3 , 000 slot machines , all being played at once obviously , in order to understand the casino experience , i had to play the slots to get my stake , i took the 10 voucher to the wheel of fortune , placed it on number 13 , and lost it immediately this forced me to finance my own downfall , and i purchased a plastic bucket full of quarters the machines were covered in words like slotopoly , bonus wild , lucky , bonanza and barbarbar , but none of them had simple instructions i chose one that seemed slightly less garish than the rest , and started feeding quarters into it my bucketful vanished in what seemed like seconds even when i won something , i could n't figure out why , although kindly ladies on each side took time out from their own efforts to explain credits , bars and triple plays after my second bucket of coins had been swallowed , i decided that these slot machines were for suckers , and i 'd better get serious between and around the slots were almost 200 gaming tables for poker , roulette , blackjack and more exotic games here the players were younger , the atmosphere more sociable , but the dedication just as intense my ignorance of these games was so obvious that i was quickly taken in hand by judy , a member of the long island contingent , who obviously felt that i should never have been let out on my own as we stood watching a baccarat game , the cards flashing out and vanishing like a conjuring rite , she explained the rules to me as far as i could understand , this was a game of pure chance , depending on which cards happened to be dealt out i was shocked , but somewhat encouraged anyone can win at a game of chance a man stood at the table with an impressive pile of chips assuming that the chips were worth 25 cents each , he was doing quite well can we join your game \? i asked sure , he said , do you know it s 100 a chip \? thank goodness the casino provided a selection of pleasant restaurants away from the racket of the floor taking my 10 meal ticket , i gambled on the fish of the day it was excellent , and only about 9 above the usual price but this is no place for people who believe in economy fortified by lunch , i headed for the roulette wheels i had always wanted to play roulette , which seems extraordinarily glamorous in the movies , the hero always scoops up a fortune in chips , and is immediately surrounded by incredibly beautiful girls in slinky dresses who want to give him financial advice it did n't work quite like that for me i purchased a cautious 20 worth of blue chips , and placed them on random numbers my attention tended to drift to decor , the colorful outfits worn by the other players and reflections on the last days of roman empire i was amazed when the croupier pushed a whole stack of chips back at me had i ordered these by mistake \? no , it appeared that i had won them by placing one or more of my chips on the correct number i tried to pay more attention to the game , listening for the cries of faites vos jeux , mesdames et messieurs , neuf a la banque and rien non va plus , so familiar from a hundred movies but the young female croupier said nothing at all , running the game in complete silence , with hand gestures i suppose that sometimes they must get foreigners into the casino , from the remoter regions of connecticut , or even rhode island , who are unable to speak french the wheel spun , and my mind drifted off again next time i looked down , all my chips were gone and the croupier was giving me the old raisedeyebrow look i gave her my best james bond shrug and left drawing \( p c vey \)
paris , dec 16 france , which has delayed a vote in the security council on a new armsinspection system for iraq until friday , is hoping for an agreement that all five permanent council members can support a text that not everybody on the security council votes for is a great victory for saddam hussein , president jacques chirac said in an interview a unanimous resolution would be a real defeat for saddam , and it would create real pressure on him france , which had close diplomatic and commercial ties with iraq before the war in the persian gulf in 1991 , would prefer a resolution that both china and russia could support rather than merely let pass by abstaining , he said the united states has strongly resisted watering down the inspections france has been trying for months to have washington agree to soften conditions to lift the trade embargo against iraq , in hopes that mr hussein would agree to let inspectors return they were expelled more than a year ago , prompting a relentless bombing campaign by the united states and britain although there is no indication that mr hussein would let the weapons inspections resume even if the embargo were lifted , the french say even partial international supervision of compliance with a united nations ban on producing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons would be better than none at all french officials also say they believe that iraq has no way to resume its quest for nuclear arms i do n't think there s much to be worried about where nuclear weapons are concerned , mr chirac said but there could be for other kinds of weapons of mass destruction that are smaller and easier to conceal i think that the situation as it exists is one that is advantageous to saddam his people have been reduced to a condition in which they no longer have political reflexes people are worrying about what they 're going to eat that evening and how to take care of a sick child without any functioning hospitals or what to do about a grandfather who s dying , and when people are in that state , they do n't think about much else if there s a possibility of suspending the embargo , and people are better treated , then there would probably be a reaction , and people might start to ask where saddam had taken them and why they had all become victims there s a lot of money coming into iraq , because it is exporting a lot of oil illegally and saddam is n't using it to buy milk for children so i think we have to find a solution that in some way forces saddam to accept a resumption of inspections and the only possibility of doing this would be a resolution adopted unanimously by the security council i think we are not far from one and i hope we can get there foreign minister hubert vedrine said earlier this week we think the embargo is a crude and cruel tool that hurts civilians we need to agree on how to suspend it , what criteria to use for such a suspension , and we have n't got agreement on that yet mr vedrine plans to discuss the issue with secretary of state madeleine k albright and the russian and british foreign ministers in berlin on friday , before the security council vote dr albright is expected to travel later in the day to paris
chicago , june 16 rain was whiplashing downtown chicago , and in a patch of land near windraked lake michigan , all that could really be seen was a herd of citrus yellow backhoes , along with mounds of fudgy dirt but in the imagination of the architect frank o gehry , who was seeing the site for the first time , the picture was altogether different you could make it a dining facility in the winter and open it up in the summer , flip up the front , mr gehry mused the other thing that would be fun to do is to integrate film mr gehry was spying out the possibilities for his chicago debut , a twoacre space at the heart of the city s jewellike lakefront that he has been asked to turn into a music pavilion complete with proscenium arch , pedestrian bridge and central parklike great lawn by the end of the quick tour , mr gehry was toying with the idea of launching fireworks from the top of the music shell and salting the great lawn with thousands of earlevel speakers they do it indoors in the russian parliament , he said do n't know if it s ever been done outside and whatever he comes up with will have to be flexible enough to embrace everything from a bach fugue to the rolling stones , he said especially if we do something spectacular , he said , everybody will want to be here after the stunning success of his guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain , everyone , it seems , wants frank gehry to do something spectacular he has received calls from all over europe , from china , from south america , he said , all from people who want to do the bilbao thing but in chicago , the cradle of american architecture , home of the hancock building and the sears tower , font of such illustrious creators as louis sullivan , frank lloyd wright and ludwig mies van der rohe , the prospect of a frank gehry production has even greater significance and , in architecture circles it is generating a burst of controversy many architects and civic leaders relish the chance for chicago to capture the creativity of a worldrenowned architect like mr gehry , acclaimed as he is for his sculptural technique and ability to bend lines , tilt angles and play with light some architecture aficionados feel that the city has lost some of the inventiveness that spawned the skyscraper , the cantilevered house and those glass and steel boxes and it has hardly escaped city officials that enlisting mr gehry to build part of chicago s 200 million millennium park project just might give tourism a boost but in the birthplace of the skyscraper , a city where architecture is venerated , some architects worry that mr gehry s fragmented style would go against the grain on top of that , other architects consider handing such a plum commission to an outsider a celebrity from california , no less almost a slap in the face to chicago s homegrown talent it s as if the french started importing wine , said laurence booth , who designed a dormitory for the school of the art institute of chicago what do they think \? nobody can do something here \? daniel p coffey , who recently redesigned chicago s prized oriental theater , cited a string of outsider projects like the navy pier and the museum of contemporary art in recent years that have hit the city with an uninspiring thud it s chicago s millennium , and what do we do \? he said we go get somebody from los angeles who s a great architect i'm not saying he s not but i think the millennium is supposed to be a time for surprise and thrilling and all that stuff , a time to regenerate it s disappointing we ca n't regenerate here in the city by ourselves there is also some skepticism about the project mr gehry has been asked to create his pavilion and accouterments will not stand off by themselves , a selfcontained gehry showcase rather , his project will be part of a much larger city park whose other elements are being designed by architects with markedly different styles the bulk of millennium park will be designed by the chicagobased firm skidmore , owings merrill it will be a conscious continuation of the beauxarts style that characterizes much of grant park , the sprawling front yard of chicago to which millennium park will be attached there will be antique street lights , formal garden paths and fluted columns in a grand peristyle , none of which bear much resemblance to anything frank gehry does his design will also have to mesh with an underground music and dance theater with a greenhouselike entrance to be designed by thomas beeby , a chicago architect and mr gehry has been asked to consider design seating on the great lawn somebody exotic' on the scene at first glance , it s like asking wolfgang amadeus mozart and jimi hendrix to perform a duet , wrote blair kamin , the architecture critic for the chicago tribune mr booth said , this whole business of bringing on somebody exotic i'm not sure the strategy is architectural as much as promotional he added , with so many different materials and no consistent school , we can be overcome by novelty and lose the spirit of the city mr gehry , a slightly rumpled 70yearold who exhibits none of the slickness or ennui that one might expect to accompany fame , believes that kind of thinking is misguided , to say the least if you ca n't take different ideas in chicago , then where can you \? he said read carl sandburg get a life what happens when philip glass comes to town you do n't let him in \? adrian smith , a partner of skidmore , owings merrill who asked mr gehry to design the pavilion , said it was the architect s adventurousness that prompted him to extend the invitation
officials from the baseball commissioner s office and the league offices held a long meeting yesterday to discuss contingency plans in the event the umpires strike next week the prevailing feeling , one official said , was that the umpires would have to be stupid to walk out over the imminent loss of jobs by 22 umpires on the other hand , another official said , some people feel they have nothing to lose he meant the 22 umpires whose resignations the national and american leagues have accepted , effective next thursday however , the umpires who will still have jobs beyond that day would be risking their jobs because the labor agreement between the umpires and the leagues bars them from striking as part of the contingency plans , the leagues had earlier directed clubs to line up substitute umpires to work games in case the regular umpires walked out we have replacements all lined up , an official said circumstances in the two leagues , though , are different the umpires , in fact , have engendered a serious split in their labor ranks along league lines if the umpires strike some time next week has been rumored , if they walk at all the national league would bear the brunt of the work stoppage the american league would most likely suffer little loss of the umpires' services thirteen of the 22 umpires scheduled to lose their jobs are nl umpires they were selected from a list of 33 umpires who resigned and subsequently changed their minds but too late as far as the league was concerned if the umpires decide to strike , the other 20 presumably would walk out , as could 8 or 10 of the 13 new umpires the league has hired who have decided to join the union katy feeney , the national league s senior vice president , said yesterday that the league instructed the clubs some time ago to have replacements lined up and more recently told them to make sure their lists are updated in case replacements are needed the american league has nine umpires who are losing their jobs , and three of them have not worked recently ken kaiser and dale ford are recovering from knee injuries , and drew coble has been caring for his wife , who is ill none of the league s other 21 umpires who are union members have indicated a willingness to support the union s position , and they would be unlikely to join a strike the critical time for them , in the event of a strike , would come if the umpires who walk out were to picket games the working umpires would have to decide whether or not to cross picket lines and incur the label of scab i think lot of al guys will cross picket lines , said one supporter of richie phillips , the union s chief negotiator i think they 're set on that course phillips again yesterday declined to discuss the possibility of a strike , saying his focus was on trying to resolve the jobs issue peacefully i'm into peace initiatives , he said i'm not into saber rattling phillips said he would n't discuss those initiatives but said i 've had a number of conversations with people our lawyers have had a number of conversations with people we 're attempting to find a resolution he added that he had not made substantive progress baseball officials , on the other hand , said no discussions are continuing he s telling his members that s going on , but it is n't , one official said
melbourne , australia , friday , jan 22 what started on thursday with the stanford man paul goldstein and the austrian baseliner barbara schett continued today with the mountain man marc rosset and the spanish baseliner maria antonio sanchez lorenzo seedings no longer have the same power to intimidate the men rid themselves of their inferiority complexes long ago , and the women are rapidly acquiring the same attitude it s not so easy for the 10 , schett said the 20yearold schett had just proved her point with a straightforward 62 , 62 defeat of no 4seeded arantxa sanchez vicario in the second round the victory would have been a lot more surprising if schett had not already beaten the spaniard just last week in sydney on her way to the semifinals sanchez lorenzo s 63 , 60 victory over the reigning wimbledon champion jana novotna in the third round was not nearly as predictable it has been a disastrous tournament for spain none of the 13 men who came to melbourne , including no 2seeded alex corretja and no 4seeded carlos moya , reached the third round but now the spaniards have some consolation novotna , seeded third , had not come to australia since 1995 , but changed her plans late last year clearly , she should have stayed in the northern hemisphere novotna routinely struggles in the wind because of her slice backhand and highrisk attacking game but the wind could not have been the only explanation for her absentminded , errorfilled performance i am just still in a state of shock , really not knowing what went wrong , and it was just a nightmare , said novotna , who could not remember when she had last lost a set at love the american chanda rubin , a semifinalist here in 1996 before wrist problems pushed her career off track , reached the fourth round with a 76 \( 73 \) , 46 , 64 victory over no 15seeded natasha zvereva of belarus rubin is ranked 30th , but she has played much better than that in 1999 , winning a warmup tournament in hobart last week while rubin was still trading ground strokes with zvereva , marc rosset of switzerland was finishing off no 6seeded tim henman of great britain , 76 \( 75 \) , 63 , 75 , in the third round the 6foot7inch rosset , with his thick beard and shaggy hair , looks these days as if he just returned from a very long walk in the woods , but he is actually a banker s son from geneva and at last year s united states open , he and his coach , pierre simsolo , booked seats and then changed their minds the day of departure on the swissair flight that crashed into the atlantic ocean , killing all 229 passengers aboard that the 31stranked rosset should beat one of britain s tennis heros in a grand slam event is no surprise he is a former member of the top 10 and , though consistency has seldom been his forte , he possesses one of the most wicked forehands and first serves in tennis but few would have expressed confidence that goldstein , a qualifier ranked no 187 , would upset britain s other tennis hero , greg rusedski , in the second round but the 22yearold from rockville , md , who turned professional after graduating from stanford last june , topped the no 8seeded player , 64 , 67 \( 911 \) , 76 \( 75 \) , 62 though rusedski , who has been struggling so far this season , was hardly in rare form , goldstein served cleverly , covered court well and lobbed and returned very well he s probably one of the best guys i 've ever played in terms of returning my serve , said rusedski , the 1997 united states open finalist who has the fastest and one of the finest serves in the game goldstein attended high school and stanford with president clinton s daughter , chelsea at stanford , he was a human biology major and the first player to be a member of four consecutive national collegiate athletic association championship tennis teams not surprisingly , he talks nearly as good a game as he plays it s a pretty humbling place , he said of stanford , as john mcenroe said when he came the summer after he got into the semis of wimbledon at 18 years of age and was 30 in the world he shows up on campus as a freshman and he thinks all the women will be all over him , and he left after a year because it was like , 'i was nothing there' i might have misquoted him a little bit , but i think that s the general gist of it
as the smoke clears from the communications industry s latest takeover battleground , the companies that recently fired so many billiondollar salvos global crossing , frontier , qwest and u s west have left unresolved questions scattered like so many shell cases judging by the news releases , it all looks fairly simple a winwin web of deals that leaves each company in a stronger position to profit from the expanding demand for advanced communications u s west inc , the smallest of the bell local phone giants , is to merge with qwest communications international inc , the longdistance upstart , while global crossing ltd , an undersea cable company , acquires the frontier corporation , which owns an advanced national communications network beneath the surface , however , the resolution is not nearly so neat qwest and u s west have a lot of work ahead of them in the executive suite , in the marketplace and in washington before they can make their deal a success at the same time , while frontier may have come away with a lot of money in its pocket , it has also emerged with a bad taste in its mouth one of the more revealing tidbits to come out of the deal was a handout distributed on sunday by qwest and u s west , summarizing the businesses of several companies somewhat selectively , the handout , titled global telecommunications comparisons listed att , mci worldcom , sprint and qwestu s west together with u s west , qwest would certainly like to be thought of as a member of that tier of the industry if anything , qwest s lusty pursuit of u s west was about trying to win a spot at the head table of telecommunications , even if that meant shoving some people to get there but even after this deal , qwest has not quite achieved that scale that is why the companies yesterday announced they would soon expand into 25 additional united states markets , including new york the plans were somewhat vague , with no firm timetable on building or acquiring local fiber optic networks and no firm figures on how much the combined company would spend on the plan but as the company faces threats mostly from att and sbc , it is a logical and strong expansion of its strategy , one that could generate many benefits for consumers curiously , perhaps , none of those 25 markets are in the territory served by bellsouth , which has invested in qwest all the better , perhaps , to minimize the antitrust concerns were a combined qwestu s west to leap fully to the top tier in the next few years by merging with bellsouth \( no such deal appears to be in the works \) not so fast antitrust regulators are not likely to have many concerns about the deal , but the federal communications commission is another story the problem is that u s west is not allowed to sell longdistance services and qwest sells somewhere around 200 million worth of them in u s west s territory every year qwest has said it is ready to sell that business , and if it does , the merger will probably go through but until u s west wins longdistance permission , it will be unable to exploit the main driver of the deal integrated local and longdistance services for millions of customers regulators and consumer advocates should hope that this problem will encourage u s west to open its local networks quickly to help it win longdistance approval in any case it is going to be years perhaps only a couple , perhaps more than a few before u s west has fully satisfied the fcc on that score can we all get along \? the most intriguing question to emerge from the qwestu s west merger may be what will solomon d trujillo , currently u s west s chairman , be doing two years after the deal closes \? mr trujillo lobbied hard to win a place for himself in the combined company s top ranks he will be a member of a newly formed office of the chairman and will run the company s local and wireless operations nonetheless , he has been candid about the fact that the hand on the daytoday tiller will belong to joseph p nacchio , qwest s chief executive looming over both of them will be philip p anschutz , the secretive denver billionaire who will remain chairman of the company mr anschutz has come to resemble dark matter , that elusive cosmic substance that cannot be seen directly but can be detected by its intense gravitational effects mr anschutz works hard to avoid the public eye , but it was he , as the largest shareholder in qwest , who negotiated the side deal between qwest and global crossing that made the weekend agreements possible all of which means that mr trujillo will not be running the show , which may not remain to his liking mr nacchio and mr trujillo seem to enjoy each other s company , but it would be a great surprise if mr trujillo outlasted mr nacchio that said , mr nacchio has never run a significant local phone operation , and if mr trujillo and too many members of his senior team leave the combined company , that would greatly set back the process of integrating the two operations maybe not so it was all smiles yesterday at the headquarters for qwest , global crossing and u s west but not in rochester , ny , home of frontier choose the word manipulated , used , jobbed frontier declined to comment , but it was crystal clear that frontier s top executives felt that they had been mistreated by qwest over the last few weeks and that they were not happy about it the details are somewhat tawdry , but the point is that from frontier s perspective , qwest failed to negotiate in good faith after making a public bid to acquire frontier for more than global crossing had offered frontier s suspicion was that qwest had made its bid for frontier only as a tool to get u s west u s west s earlier deal with global crossing was contingent on global crossing s also acquiring frontier this is all part of deal making , was mr nacchio s response yesterday , pointedly denying any absence of good faith on his part we came out with the crown jewels a lot of my shareholders did not like the frontier move as much as they liked u s west he added the fact that frontier thought they could get more money than they did is all part of deal making they should have agreed to some of what we offered earlier
the financier martin r frankel , who fled the united states and is now in a german prison , was indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday on 36 counts of fraud , money laundering and racketeering in what prosecutors said was a scheme that siphoned more than 200 million from a group of southern insurance companies for use for his own benefit the indictment , sought by the united states attorney s office for the district of connecticut , is the latest turn in a bizarre tale in which mr frankel , 44 , is accused of masterminding a complicated financial plan that for more than eight years drained millions of dollars from insurance companies and their policyholders those activities ended in may when mr frankel s greenwich , conn , mansion caught fire and mr frankel fled the country the subject of an international manhunt , mr frankel was captured in a hamburg , germany , hotel room by local police officers and a federal bureau of investigation agent in september and was imprisoned there on charges of carrying a false passport meanwhile , german authorities have been waiting for american law enforcement officials to prepare more serious charges against him those charges came yesterday in the form of the indictment , which lays the groundwork for a formal extradition process to begin it is not known whether mr frankel will fight extradition his financial assets have been frozen and he is now being represented by thomas dennis , a public defender , who would not comment yesterday hugh f keefe , mr frankel s former lawyer , said yesterday that mr frankel was currently facing two lousy options , either remaining in the german prison or returning to america for trial mr keefe said he was no longer mr frankel s lawyer because of the freeze on mr frankel s assets he added , however , that mr frankel s condition varies from day to day clearly , he continued , this is not a terrific place to be for anyone and he is in a tough german prison mr keefe added that until this indictment , one of the grounds for mr frankel to oppose extradition had been that he had not been formally charged with a crime but yesterday s indictment lightens the government s load , mr keefe said he will eventually be extradited to america unless he waives it lawyers with the united states attorney s office declined to comment the indictment offers some new details in how mr frankel conducted his operations and where the money under question might have gone in two pages of singlespaced type , the indictment contends to show how mr frankel , using a swiss bank account , converted the money from the insurance company into his multimilliondollar greenwich mansion , and into diamonds , gold coins from the vienna philharmonic , traveler s checks , automobiles and at least one aircraft frankel converted , stole and embezzled the majority of funds for personal use , the indictment said in total , in excess of 200 million was converted , stolen and embezzled by frankel through the scheme and artifice to defraud the indictment also outlined how prosecutors say mr frankel did business he created a trust , thunor trust , that he used to acquire stakes in a number of insurance companies and then took the assets of these insurance companies by saying that the money would be invested in safe assets , primarily united states government securities instead , the indictment said , he kept the money he also provided the insurance companies with false profit and loss statements and , in some cases , returned enough cash to the companies to prevent detection of his activities by state insurance regulators , the indictment stated the indictment also accuses him of controlling the st francis of assisi foundation , which was to be used to acquire insurance companies and put the profits to charitable causes as part of this fraud , mr frankel even persuaded a highlevel retired priest at the vatican to unwittingly back this charity the indictment also lists some wall street firms where mr frankel had accounts they include the dreyfus corporation , bear , stearns company and prudential securities , along with banque scs alliance in switzerland none of these firms are named in the indictment and were listed simply as places where mr frankel did business a native of toledo , ohio , mr frankel in 1992 agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities business in an outofcourt settlement with the securities and exchange commission this came after he ran afoul of financial regulators when a small investment fund he ran generated steep losses for retirees who had entrusted their savings to mr frankel but even before that agreement was final , he began the activities that led to yesterday s indictment along the way , he lived a lavish life , operating from inside his fouracre greenwich property , complete with walls of computer and trading equipment which was rarely used and operated by women he recruited through the internet and helpwanted ads to be his personal assistants about the time mr frankel fled the country , his house caught fire while there , greenwich firefighters found smoldering documents and a to do list in which item no 1 said launder money mr frankel was in his hamburg hotel room with a female companion , diamonds and cash , when arrested sept 4 up to that point , he had traveled through europe , often openly , with several female friends and lived in apartments and hotels arranged for him by contacts in rome if mr frankel returns to the united states , he will be brought before united states magistrate judge holly b fitzsimmons in bridgeport mr keefe , mr frankel s former lawyer , said german authorities had not allowed mr frankel to meet with his american lawyer yet it is important , mr keefe said , to remember that this man is presumed innocent and has not yet had a chance to give his side of the story photo martin r frankel was arrested in germany last month
bret michaels of poison was a bit peeved when he saw his band s episode of behind the music like most installments of the vh1 series , this one went straight for the traumas it dealt with the fact that mr michaels , poison s lead singer and an icon of 80 s heavymetal debauchery , has been a diabetic since he was 6 years old no problem there it talked about the guitarist c c deville s lifethreatening cocaine addiction and his subsequent 100pound weight gain but that was to be expected it quoted a former groupie on the band s sexual escapades and flashed dozens of fuzzedover images of women s bare breasts true , all true no , what got under mr michaels s skin was something that always gets under his skin critics i always thought poison were a bit of a joke , because the whole thing is , they could n't play , says a photographer , ross halfin the saddest thing about poison is that they really thought they were the beatles mr michaels and the rest of the band were on their tour bus watching when poison behind the music had its premiere on july 11 and at that moment , mr michaels almost managed to provide fodder for poison behind the music ii , should vh1 ever care to make it ross halfin is a friend of mine i thought , mr michaels ranted the guy has been on the road with us for , like , months at a time why did he make all this money off our band taking photos if he hated our guts \? he s the hypocrite , not me you did n't even want to be on the bus when i went on my ross halfin tirade if he knew half of what i thought i was going to do to him after i watched that show , they would have just put me in jail then and threw away the key other than that , he had just one worry we did n't come off too sappy , did we \? he asked um , no good that s important close call , but count another convert to behind the music mr michaels is n't the only person who s a fan in spite of himself in the two years since it was first broadcast , behind the music has become the music industry s closet compulsion members of the media elite may not blithely volunteer the information , but just start asking and you 'll be amazed at how many people admit to watching behind the music is entertainment tonight without the heavy cheese factor , biography minus the historical pretensions it s a simple , brilliant formula a onehour documentary about the ups and downs of music careers , with subjects from fleetwood mac to david cassidy to the red hot chili peppers to madonna behind the music could be trash television it comes that close at times but it s well reported , thoroughly researched , rarely slavish and often winkingly funny and it gets unusually close to the comictragic essence of life in the music business in the tlc episode , lisa \( left eye \) lopes is explaining why she burned down the house of her former boyfriend , the football player andre rison he had bought 20 pairs of tennis shoes , she says , and none of them were for her i 'd been drinking , ms lopes explains , sighing , and there s no size 4 i just , i do n't know , man , threw a pair of sneakers in the tub and lit them but these days the real story is behind behind the music the show began as one of vh1 s periodic attempts to find an identity apart from its sister station , mtv but this time something clicked behind the music is now the network s highestrated show \( the shania twain episode in october 1998 reached 46 million viewers \) , and ratings are up more than 160 percent since it went on in august 1997 because the program is on every weeknight \( with premieres on sunday \) , each episode is in heavy rotation , running about 40 times a year it s intense exposure at a time when the concert business is in the doldrums , radio is stagnating in the hands of corporate giants and mtv is willfully unconnected to anyone over the age of 15 , behind the music does something fundamental it sells records bands and performers profiled on the show see an immediate uptick in sales def leppard had a 'greatest hits' album that was nowhere , said george moll , one of the show s executive producers when we did 'behind the music , ' it climbed into the top 10 on billboard s album chart the show also brings fans out to concerts lynyrd skynyrd s boxoffice receipts jumped 45 percent after behind the music told the band s story we 're a part of the marketing scheme for many artists , said mr moll artists now approach us , which in the early days was unimaginable behind the music has a reputation for being tragedyobsessed , but the producers are taking pains to get away from that the easy swipe is , 'i'm not going to get on the show because i did n't lose a limb , ' said mr moll jeff gaspin , another executive producer , said the bookings got a lot easier after we got madonna because when people would say , 'that series is for losers , ' we 'd say , 'is madonna a loser \? ' the show has branched out beyond individual careers into shows about events , like woodstock and lilith fair also in the works are shows about important behindthescenes figures , like the 50 s disk jockey alan freed still , the best episodes are the shamelessly emotional ones the more buffoonish a band s public image , the more it s going to whomp you when the members confront the nuances of private turmoil in an episode about the heavymetal band motley crue , a former lead singer , vince neil , discusses the death of his 4yearold daughter from kidney cancer wearing a leather vest , his tattoos showing , mr neil reaches up to wipe a tearfrom his eye it s like a smack in the face , mr gaspin said you watch it and go 'oh my god i cannot believe i was laughing at these guys , and now i'm crying with them'

there are in scottish lore brands of whiskey virtually unknown to outsiders merchants keep them out of sight lest some wandering american , englishman or even a resident of the next county know their identity music has its secrets , too , despite the alarming internationalization of tastes , instruments and performing styles often the appreciation of homebrew is as unexportable as the object of affection reasonable in other musical matters , i turn to jelly at the sound of nelson riddle s languid orchestrations and addon chords this is not a value judgment i would expect viennese musicologists to share , though i expect they , too , feel a sugarfueled tug when schrammelmusik begins to waft its way down from grinzing france s barroom chanson and the portuguese fado have their cultish international followings , but i suspect that in both cases , language and culture are so wrapped up in music that one can admire from the outside without truly penetrating the music of pierne and vieuxtemps still rings through the halls of the paris conservatory but hardly anywhere else we are what we have grown up with , and memory can be stronger than judgment bedrich smetana s music seems split between public and private sectors the bartered bride and ma vlast are household names in every musical family , but how many of us know that this 19thcentury bohemian composer wrote twothirds of his 300 compositions for the piano and that an awful lot of them are polkas \? more than 30 pieces are called just that , and many more are polkas in everything but name the polka , the new grove dictionary of music and musicians tells us , probably began as a country round dance , but by the 19th century it was evolving into a ballroom specialty for couples polka may be a corruption of polska , the czech term for polish girl it moves in two beats to the measure as opposed to the mazurka s three , but later on , there were hybrids combining the steps of the polka with mazurka time an early parisian source describes polka tempo as that of a slowish military march the program booklet for andras schiff s splendid new compact disc of smetana polkas for teldec offers snippets of etiquette as laid down by the ball room annual \( london , circa 1844 \) there should be no stamping of the heels or toe , it reads this may be tolerated at a bohemian auberge , but it is inadmissible into the salons of london or paris later the polka must be danced quietly , gracefully and without any awkward gestures , such as lifting up the leg too highly , or starting off in an abrupt manner so rougher american sensibilities beware the 14 items played by mr schiff are not of the beer barrel or too fat variety , familiar from latenight television comeons they are tender , pliant and understated mr schiff records here on a bosendorfer piano , which adds to the crystalline quality of smetana s writing as you may already have guessed , the composer must have been a superior pianist the operas and symphonic pieces came later in his life smetana s youth followed a pattern common among precocious musical talents in the 19th century family opposition to a musical career \( his father was a brewer \) , education in more mundane subjects and then a breaking free he met the schumanns and probably berlioz liszt became a friend and supporter smetana adored him later life was not easy , centering largely on music schools of his own founding musical politics at home deprived him of many rewards and satisfactions , although an extended stay in sweden won considerable respect abroad illness virtually wiped out smetana s first household , but he married again and struggled more , the last and most galling enemy being deafness he died in prague in 1884 , at 60 the young smetana was by all appearances a successful social animal , and his talents at the piano made him the musical center of evenings at the homes of the welltodo , where dancing was a necessary part of entertainment virtually none of the pieces here are for virtuoso display neither are they , when properly played , much good for dance accompaniments think of them as idealizations of a form and an activity that were as natural to a young central european of the time as eating and drinking mr schiff s playing is of admirable delicacy there is not a touch of grandness , and the polka rhythms are stretched enough to point out harmonic points of tension while never overreaching the curious lilt and the alternations of major and minor harmonies in short phrases reflect the musical culture that dvorak was to draw upon so successfully a little later the charm of this music is so unassuming that the outsider feels almost an eavesdropper think of that hidden stash of whiskey mr schiff has gone behind the counter and sneaked a bottle out for us i think we foreigners will like its taste photo bedrich smetana , who wrote many a polka in his day , a disk by andras schiff recalls , the dance was an elegant one , suitable for a ballroom
when gus johnson calls a knicks game on the radio , he visualizes his audio audience fans in their cars , tired truckers , eager to get home , needing a boost for two and a half or three hours people who need to keep their spirits up as they drive johnson remembers his days as a television sports anchor in waco , tex he remembers the drives to and from high school games on friday nights and the magic of radio i 'd always turn on the high school football games and listen to announcers in these small texas towns calling their games , johnson said i loved it it was exciting to me and very genuine there s something really unique and genuine about radio , something different about it you have to listen following your team on the radio can be torture if you truly care you trust the broadcasters to be more than your eyes you trust them to convey what they see , and for the evidence of things that can only be felt the mood , the energy , the surge of confidence for the last two seasons , johnson s enthusiastic voice has guided a regular audio underground of tortured knicks fans through the highs and lows of their perilous campaigns with each knicks victory this audience grows night shifts at the factory , people working late at the office , operating delis all flying blindly , following their unpredictable knicks , who have a twogamestonone lead over the atlanta hawks , on the radio last sunday , johnson had a larger audience than usual the day was too beautiful to stay inside but the game was too important to miss so fans sat in cars , in the park or in their gardens , on pins and needles , as the knicks played the heat in a crucial game 5 matchup finally , at the moment of truth , with the game on the line , allan houston hit the gamewinning shot with less than a second to play johnson , with the unabashed enthusiasm of someone who had just seen niagara falls and the grand canyon for the first time at the same time seemed to leap through our radios porter , one dribble for the win no good ! and the knicks win , 7877 ! they take the bestoffive series from the miami heat an eighth seed has won for only the second time in nba history , and pat riley and the heat , their season is over the knicks continue to play unbelievable ! against the hawks , johnson called games 1 and 2 and will call games 5 and 7 if they are played expect no letup i get so excited about it , he said i really love it i really , truly , genuinely love basketball johnson replaced marv albert as the radio voice of the knicks last season when albert resigned following his guilty plea to a misdemeanor assault charge when albert was brought back this season , johnson agreed to an arrangement in which he would call the knicks' road games and albert called the home games their contrasting approaches parallel the knicks' evolving style albert , like the old knicks , is cool , professional , polished , predictable johnson , like these latrell sprewellled knicks , is unabashed and exuberant when you 're coming up as a broadcaster you always try to mimic everybody else , johnson said you try to be marv albert or george blaha or bob costas now i'm coming into who i am , and i feel comfortable with that at the same time , you feel uneasy because you 're exposed people are seeing who you are johnson was born in detroit and was a honorable mention allstate basketball player , though his best sport was baseball he accepted a baseball scholarship to howard university but he never had illusions about a pro career i was a slow linedrivehitting outfielder , he said johnson became interested in broadcasting in his junior year by graduation he landed a tv weekend sports anchor job in waco , and from there he moved to huntsville , ala , then to winstonsalem , nc , where he began his radio broadcast career calling high school football games for 10 a game johnson joined fox television in washington in 1993 , calling the national football league and college football , and also worked for espn he joined cbs in 1995 and shortly after joined the msg network johnson is also an actor he played the role of a street kid in an independent film , urban folk tales , and he did a voiceover in spike lee s he got game johnson completed his first offoffoffoffbroadway play , so that s love , in march there are so many similarities between the two arenas , johnson said , but added the theater is a story being told by actors , but everything you see in a basketball or a sporting event is better than theater because nobody knows the outcome the outcome changes all the time the sporting event is live theater there s a beginning , there s a middle and an end there are central characters , there are protagonists , antagonists , and it changes from minute to minute in the high drama of this knicks' playoff run , the 31yearold johnson sees himself as a narrator look at that game 5 in miami , he said who would have thought that the game would have ended that way \? who would have thought that the knicks would have been able to overcome all of these different obstacles \? then at the end , allan houston , the player to hit the big shot , is the one who was having the worst game among them , the one who has always been questioned about his resolve and his heart johnson gets pumped up just thinking about it that s theater at it s best , he said that s unbelievable stuff
jacob h schiff a study in american jewish leadership by naomi w cohen 320 pp hanover , nh brandeis university press university press of new england 35 modern american jews generally believe that until the period after world war ii american jewry was afraid to exert political power jacob h schiff a study in american jewish leadership , by naomi w cohen , the author of jews in christian america , is a useful corrective to this mistaken idea surprisingly , schiff has not been the subject of a serious biography until now that makes this book particularly welcome a resolute defender of jewish rights , schiff was the american jewish community s preeminent leader from 1880 to 1920 he came before presidents not as a supplicant but as an advocate , convinced that in fighting against discrimination he was upholding american values a partner at the new york banking house of kuhn , loeb company , schiff was one of a cadre of german jews who in the 19th century created a kinship network of investment houses on wall street though many of these men demonstrated intense communal responsibility , none compared to schiff in terms of philanthropy , political activity and unashamed jewishness affectionately called unser yankele \( our jacob \) by eastern european immigrants , schiff vigorously opposed every attempt to bar immigrants from this country similarly , he spoke out for american jews excluded from the country s leading institutions by the wasp power structure of the time he gave barnard college a halfmillion dollars for a building for social and ethical activities because barnard , unlike columbia , forbade social groups that restricted jews but he did more than fight discrimination he sought to engender respect for judaism by financing translations of the hebrew scriptures and other classic jewish texts , and by donating the seed money for harvard s semitic \( that is , jewish \) studies program , the first of its kind in the country harvard s president , charles w eliot , said he believed schiff s efforts would help reverse the centurieslong antagonism of the christian church to the jews schiff was not without his contradictions although he viewed antisemitism as an irrational sentiment that existed irrespective of the presence or behavior of jews , he nonetheless believed that jews could take steps to prevent it arguing that resentment against jews was fostered by their congregating in ethnic neighborhoods in northeastern cities , he created the galveston plan to encourage jewish immigrants to enter the country in the southwest so , too , he thought that if the immigrants americanized by abandoning their distinctive dress , language and leftist politics , antisemitism would dissipate as an effort in americanization , schiff brought solomon schechter , a learned rabbi and cambridge university semitics scholar , to new york to revitalize the jewish theological seminary , then a moribund institution , and to reach out to the staunchly traditional eastern european immigrants with a form of judaism that bridged tradition and modernity in this way , schiff , a resolutely reform jew , secured a foothold for conservative judaism in america outside the united states schiff waged a personal battle against czarist russia s brutal antisemitism failing to persuade russia to abandon its persecution , he arranged for substantial loans to japan during the russojapanese war and he assiduously lobbied a series of presidents harrison , roosevelt , taft and wilson to abrogate the 1832 americanrussian treaty because russia refused visas to american jews he insisted that washington could not countenance a double standard in the treatment of american citizens unlike contemporary jewish leaders , schiff never felt the slightest obligation to achieve communal consensus as cohen so amply demonstrates in her wellwritten and wellresearched book , he did what he believed was right and he expected others to follow
poor marvyn kornberg across the nation , the words sleazy and shameful keep popping up in close proximity to his name columnists call him mud , poison , liar fellow criminal defense lawyers ridicule his trial tactics as outlandish and stupid it has got so bad for mr kornberg that the rev al sharpton , ordered to pay 65 , 000 for slanderously accusing a man of raping tawana brawley , felt safe this week to call mr kornberg beyond the realm of any decency if they were a firing squad , his critics would be reloading by now to which mr kornberg responds with a malevolent purr , take your best shot , my friends the words are cocky , pugnacious , all queens , just like mr kornberg but they mask an uncomfortable new reality for the man who defended justin a volpe , the new york city police officer who brutalized abner louima in a precinct bathroom in brooklyn in 1997 if the recently concluded louima case answered questions about the character of mr volpe , it also raised questions about the character and judgment of mr kornberg , who at 64 is in his 41st and most controversial year as a lawyer the questions come at a critical time mr kornberg s credibility will be tested again in january when he defends sean carroll , one of four police officers charged with murdering amadou diallo , the unarmed west african immigrant who died after 41 bullets were fired at him i'm sure the police officers are not very happy , said james j culleton , another defense lawyer in the diallo case , referring to the diallo defendants and their views of mr kornberg s recent performance , both in court and in his almost daily spin sessions before the cameras a month ago , mr kornberg opened mr volpe s defense by suggesting with only fumes of evidence to back it up that the gaping tears in mr louima s rectum and bladder resulted from a consensual sexual encounter with another man then mr kornberg watched helplessly as that theory was obliterated by police officers who said mr volpe had shown them the fecescovered stick he forced into mr louima s rectum and last week , when officer charles schwarz was convicted of restraining mr louima during the bathroom assault , mr kornberg made headlines with what prosecutors and other defense lawyers in the louima case called a cruel hoax mr kornberg said that mr volpe had he been called as a witness would have exonerated mr schwarz of any role in the attack this sequence of events strange even by the standards of mr kornberg s colorful career has prompted friends and rivals in the legal community to question the thoroughness of his case preparation and the sharpness of his courtroom instincts the most devastating whisper that all for the sake of publicity , mr kornberg ignored overwhelming evidence of mr volpe s guilt , dismissed the possibility of a plea bargain and prolonged his own media exposure with a sensational defense this is the allegation , said richard a dienst , a lawyer who represents three police unions in new york city i do n't know if it s true , but it certainly looks that way this is the best form of free publicity a lawyer can get mr kornberg said he presented the best defense possible based on the information he had from his client , his investigators , his experts and police records he said that when he learned in midtrial that his client had not told him the truth , he then made an ethical choice to shelve his controversial defense , knowing his reputation would be assailed you rely upon what your client has given you at the time , mr kornberg said it s every criminal lawyer s nightmare that a client is not completely forthcoming to his lawyer his defenders include none other than mr volpe s father , robert volpe , who observed mr kornberg closely through two arduous years of defense preparations he s not only a damned good lawyer , he s also a damned good person , robert volpe said marvyn put his client first when a lot of other people were thinking about promotions , advancement , careers the criticism of mr kornberg , mr volpe suggested , is the toxic spillover of the public s outrage toward his son if mother teresa sat in that courtroom and defended justin , i'm sure all the good she did in the world would be thrown away , he said while mr kornberg s clients give praise mr kornberg says officer carroll remains a satisfied customer his enemies give thanks for the louima case and the opening it offers to press attacks on mr kornberg before the diallo trial , set to begin jan 3 mr sharpton , for one , said he would soon file a complaint against mr kornberg with the grievance committee for the state appellate division that disciplines lawyers in new york city the complaint , he said , will accuse mr kornberg of using the bogus homosexualsex theory to slander mr louima , who is married and has two children each and every night he had to sit with his wife and children and hear that he had been unfaithful , and i think he mr kornberg should be made accountable , mr sharpton said , dismissing the possibility that his own slander case makes him a poor candidate to complain about mr kornberg that is all the more reason , he said if i as a nonattorney am held accountable , then certainly mr kornberg should be , too
mind of the raven investigations and adventures with wolfbirds by bernd heinrich illustrated 380 pp new york cliff street books harpercollins publishers 25 norse legend tells that odin , lord of the gods , was attended by two ravens , named hugin \( thought \) and munin \( memory \) , who served him as reconnaissance agents , returning after each long , snoopy flight to perch on his shoulders and whisper into his ears the story reflects a widespread belief , spanning cultures and centuries , that ravens possess uncanny intelligence by actual measurement they are the brainiest of birds , and on subjective evidence they seem more sapient than most other living creatures according to thucydides , ravens were too smart to feed on the carcasses of animals that died from plague according to eskimo cosmogony , the god raven made all things , creating light out of mica flakes and humans out of rock the roman naturalist pliny described a raven bright enough to exploit the physics of volume displacement , dropping pebbles into a narrowneck vase until the water level came up within reach for a drink other anecdotal accounts likewise portray ravens using tools , foresight , visualization , high analytical skills furthermore , they 're famously mischievous ravens steal , deceive , clown around acrobatically , mimic human speech and play pranks on dogs everyone who spends time in the wild north , it seems , has a raven story in his earlier book ravens in winter , the biologist bernd heinrich acknowledged this reverential buzz but put his scientific skepticism on record notwithstanding the consensus , he wrote , a review of the literature convinces me that no proof of the raven s singular intelligence has yet been published that absence of proof , plus his own affection for the common raven , corvus corax , has incited him to the long course of field study and experiments described in mind of the raven why did this enterprise seem so compelling \? why plumb the intelligence of a big black bird that lives in cold places and happens also to be famous for feeding on carcasses \? because , as heinrich nicely says , the poetry of biology resides hidden in opposing tensions , and the often arduous fun comes from trying to reveal it bernd heinrich is no ordinary biologist he s the sort who combines formidable scientific rigor with a sense of irony and an unslaked , boyish enthusiasm for his subject , and who even at his current professorial age seems to do a lot of tree climbing in the line of research i spent one winter getting up every day hours before dawn to climb tall spruce trees near baits i had put out , he reports in the new book his baits were calf carcasses and other meaty offerings aside from the pure enjoyment of climbing snowy trees in the dark at subzero temperatures , i did it to count birds he has a rare ability to embed dense scientific explications within graceful , lightfooted nature writing , as in bumblebee economics , his little 1979 classic on the energetics and foraging strategies of bumblebees whether he s studying bees , ravens or african dung beetles , he maintains a strong sense of the ecological fundamentals , asks good questions and complements his field observations with a manic experimentalism one day he hoists a calf carcass into a tree , seeking clues about why ravens sometimes seem wary of food on the ground on another he puts on a ghoulish halloween mask , testing his handreared ravens' powers of visual recognition \( and , no doubt , their patience \) still another time he designs a thinkanddo challenge using hard salami and a long piece of string some of his raven experiments are so sportive , in fact , that they bring to mind the elderly charles darwin , in his study , playing the piano to a potful of earthworms and watching them for auditory sensitivity who cares whether a passing acquaintance might conclude that the old boy s gone insane \? who cares whether a given experiment yields answers , ambiguity or only a useful new question \? that s the heinrichian spirit of inquiry mind of the raven is an amiable , disorderly book that for all its charm often seems too directly derived from field notes and daily journal entries of the working scientist some of the minutebyminute detail is engaging , some presents meaningful data and some is just noise occasionally heinrich spends two or three pages building toward what promises to be a narrative climax , then instead comes to a dissipated fizzle this bird flew over there , two more flew back , one sat , the afternoon grew chilly , heinrich waited , nothing , he went home , never mind , oh but he tried again a week later , and on that day uh , still nothing although he does have a gift for lyric description , heinrich is n't a born storyteller , and it s too bad his hardearned field notes have n't been more stringently selected and shaped what he wants to know about ravens , most essentially , is whether they merely learn useful tricks by happenstance and then remember them or whether they consciously analyze and solve problems do they embody the mental capacities of both odin s hugin and munin , thought and memory , or of munin alone \? he touches such topics as their social relationships , their sharing behavior , their vocal repertory , their ability to recognize one another as individuals , their fears , their playfulness and what might be considered their code of morality he describes research journeys to germany , yellowstone national park and a remote village on baffin island in the canadian arctic , where an old man tells him of the collusive relationship that once prevailed between ravens and hunters the ravens would fly along with hunting parties and make a wingdipping move to signal the hunters toward caribou , so that the hunt would be successful and everyone , humans and birds , would tuck into a bounteous feast
denver , nov 5 a national shortage of school bus drivers , caused by the roaring economy and a rise in the schoolage population , is making students wait up to an hour for a ride , delaying and canceling field trips and athletic events , and forcing mechanics , transportation supervisors and even some teachers to get behind the wheel school districts and private bus companies are responding to the shortage with ambitious recruiting initiatives , offering 1 , 000 signing bonuses , higher wages , longer hours , child care and other benefits , plus cash prizes for referrals and good attendance they are seeking drivers through television and radio advertisements as well as through job fairs and , in some areas , doortodoor canvasses industry experts , who attribute the shortage mainly to record low unemployment levels , are worried that the pool of potential drivers has largely disappeared as fewer people pursue parttime work , particularly the kind that involves discipline of and responsibility for children and parents are concerned that the shortage is compromising safety , though it is difficult to tell , because there are no statistics on nonfatal accidents and other school bus problems richard fischer , a school bus consultant based in peyton , colo , put the national driver shortfall at 20 percent in recent surveys by school bus fleet , a trade magazine published in torrance , calif , more than 70 percent of the nation s school districts said they were struggling to fill drivers' seats , with officials in 44 states citing the shortage as a problem , and 17 of them calling it severe it s a huge problem that no one seems to have an answer for right now , said michael martin , executive director of the national association for pupil transportation , whose annual convention here this week was dominated by discussion of the dearth of drivers it s not a problem that s getting better , it s a problem that s getting worse schools throughout the country have stretched starting times further apart so that buses can deliver elementary school pupils , loop around to pick up middle school students and then make a third run for high schoolers athletes on long island and in florida have forfeited games because they had no way to get there in hartford , dozens of students missed breakfast at school and morning classes in september because buses arrived as late as 10 am the student ski club in aurora , colo , now has to charter buses to the slopes , and in caledonia , mich , field trips must be squeezed in between picking up and dropping off students a bus company in new hampshire is offering to pay for drivers' college tuition , and one in new jersey is posting fliers on golf courses , suggesting that players drive the morning route , hit the links , then return for the afternoon run laidlaw transit , based in burlington , ontario , the largest private contractor in the business with 35 , 000 buses in 35 states , has hired fulltime recruiters and has begun offering a 401 \( k \) plan for the first time in many areas in basalt , colo , an old mining town near aspen that has become a bedroom community for service workers at nearby resorts , a driver was straddling two routes , delivering some children to school an hour early and making others wait an hour after classes for their ride home then last month , ronald goth , who teaches first through fourthgraders , agreed to take on a second job like several of his colleagues , mr goth had obtained a commercial driver s license so that he could take students on field trips without having to hire a bus while reluctant at first to give up his early morning lesson preparation time , mr goth said that picking up and dropping off 65 students at a trailer park each day helped broaden his understanding of his students' lives , and had padded his income to help with expenses for his 9monthold daughter , annie of basalt s nine drivers , six are teachers , and signs posted in the elementary school sound the bell for more she does n't like to wake up , mr goth , 32 , said as he turned the key of his hulking bus in the chill mountain air just after sunrise on thursday none of us do kicking tires and checking hoses is not exactly what mr goth expected when he chose a career in education and while he enjoys the serenity of cruising alongside the roaring fork river , surrounded by whiteblanketed mountain peaks , his responsibility on the road is , in some ways , more daunting than the challenges of the classroom if somebody has trouble reading , i can work with a child over and over until the child gets it , mr goth said if i injure a child with this bus , it s something i can never get over school bus accidents like the one last month in albany that has prompted a 10 million lawsuit against the bus company and its 79yearold driver , or the one last week in odessa , fla , in which a 10yearold boy was dropped at the wrong stop , four miles from home , and than was struck by a car and killed routinely make headlines but statistically , the big yellow bus is among the safest ways to travel
montreal late last year , when scandal forced the international olympic committee to investigate improper payments and gifts to some of its members by salt lake city s olympic organizers , the organization turned to one of its own , richard pound , to run the inquiry pound , a montreal lawyer and former canadian olympic athlete , had for years been the olympic committee s chief negotiator of television and sponsorship deals , and over two decades he had earned the trust of committee members as well as that of many of the corporate sponsors who finance the olympic games indeed , pound , whose efforts in the mid1980 s to reform the television rights bidding process had won him respect , has in recent years been among a handful of people considered to be possible successors to the ioc s president , juan antonio samaranch from the start , pound conceded his role of investigating his colleagues was an awkward one but within five weeks , pound s investigation , conducted against a tight , selfimposed deadline , produced a report that led to the resignation of three olympic committee members and called for the expulsion of six more at a news conference late last month , samaranch cited the investigation as evidence of the ioc s determination to examine and reform itself the report , which accused the implicated ioc members of having stained the good name of the olympics , put pound center stage in what has become a global scandal and , numerous committee members have said , it enhanced the 56yearold canadian s stature as a potential successor to samaranch but soon after its release , the report , as well as pound s attempts to investigate similar wrongdoing in other cities , was criticized as inadequate some corporate sponsors , concerned about the value of their investments , called for fuller investigations and more stringent reforms and certain officials in salt lake city cited pound s efforts as evidence that the ioc is incapable of vigorously investigating itself pound spent only two days in salt lake city , hired no independent investigators and conducted just a handful of interviews , including five or six of the accused ioc members he explained that he had worked quickly in order to be able to take some action at a january general meeting of the committee in switzerland his investigation of possible misconduct in previous olympic site selections involved sending letters to officials with those bidding cities and asking them to turn over any incriminating information only 13 of 28 cities even responded , and two said they had uncovered minor infractions mr pound has a great amount of integrity , but the ioc cannot investigate itself , said ken bullock , a member of the board of trustees of the salt lake organizing committee for the 2002 winter games they are mr pound s peers you ca n't help but be attached to these folks pound defends the quality of his investigation , saying he was working with limited time and with the confidence that other investigations of the salt lake scandal , including an internal ethics investigation by the city s organizing committee , would be more thorough earlier this month , a report by that ethics panel uncovered financial abuses by 10 more ioc members , and pound has pledged to hold them accountable often the legal profession disciplines itself , the medical profession , cpa s discipline themselves , pound said in an interview this month in montreal we are capable of it pound said he never asked for the job of investigator , but had done it at the request samaranch this is no fun , he said in my case , 30odd years of pretty decent and capable sports administration is being turned into pond scum because of the action of a small percentage of our numbers the committee currently has more than 100 members little accountability , inside or out however pound s report and the additional federal and state investigations wind up being regarded , and however much his work affects his chances of succeeding samaranch , it is clear that for nearly 16 years pound , as a member of the 11member ioc executive board , was at the center of an organization that functioned like an elite and insular club it was a club dealing with billions of dollars , but subject to little accountability from inside or out it was an organization , pound tacitly acknowledges , that for years had hints that its members might be abusing their positions and endangering the public image of the olympics , but that never vigorously policed itself the things the ioc tried to accomplish since 1980 consumed all our attention and energy , he said , so some of the things that should have had a higher profile did n't if the ioc failed in that regard , and there are plenty of critics and supporters alike who say it did , pound does not appear to deserve more blame than any of the organization s other senior members but others insist he deserves no less , either

as president of votehere net , a startup company that builds secure internet voting systems , jim adler hears the same question from investors again and again they do n't ask about politics or security they want to know what would happen if microsoft moved into the election business mr adler has a ready reply do you think the justice department would let microsoft run elections in this country \? voteherenet , which is based in kirkland , wash , is one of a handful of companies that are building systems to enable voters to cast ballots over the internet since no states allow internet voting few are even in the earliest stages of contemplating it the companies are focusing their efforts on building the trust of election officials in their products and reputations voteherenet is new to the industry , but most of these companies are already in the election business , selling voting machines and computer equipment for reading ballot results , and they are anticipating demand for internet voting software our primary focus is on continuing to sell our products and to participate in the evolution , said steve knecht , western regional manager for global election systems this is going to be a slow process global , based in mckinney , tex , sells touchscreen voting systems and equipment that scans ballot results into computers the company has also developed software to demonstrate how an internet voting system would work the companies developing internet voting products plan initially to sell to nongovernmental users like universities , unions and professional associations online elections among those groups , company officials hope , will build public trust and brand recognition that will serve the companies well if and when legislatures approve online voting in the biggest potential market , civic elections as it stands , only a few state legislatures have begun to address internet voting bills to initiate studies of the concept were introduced recently in minnesota and washington state in california , the legislature passed a bill to study the issue in 1997 , but it was vetoed by the governor then , pete wilson , because of fears of fraud and votetampering in march , the california secretary of state , bill jones , convened a task force to study the issue and make recommendations to the legislature later this year florida election officials had planned to test online voting systems in elections this fall , but the project was delayed indefinitely after cases of voter fraud in miami raised fears about security on the federal level , the pentagon , in an effort to make it easier for farflung military personnel to participate in elections , is sponsoring a pilot program through the federal voting assistance program the experiment will enable overseas residents of five states florida , missouri , south carolina , texas and utah both military and civilian , to vote by way of the internet in 2000 with the inevitable political starts and stops on this issue , five years could pass before any state election officials are authorized to buy internet voting systems moreover , the first civic election held by internet will attract substantial scrutiny any problems from a breach in security to a glitch in tabulation could prove disastrous for the company that builds the system still , the companies entering the field accept those risks it s absolutely imperative that it work right the first time , so we are approaching cautiously , said neil mcclure , president of worldwide election systems in lafayette , colo to mr mcclure , improved security is one of the best reasons for internet voting any internet voting system is going to be light years ahead of a punchcard system in terms of security , he said those ballots are handled by human beings the count could change by the mere fact that the ballots were handled the threeyearold company has designed an internet voting system that can be integrated with its electronic voting machines \( although none of its products are yet on the market \) the company has spent a year adapting encryption technology to insure the system s security still , the company s strategy is to add online voting capacity to conventional vote machines not to offer internet voting software as a standalone product it s not like we 're betting the company on this , mr mcclure said to a large degree , however , votehere net is betting the company on internet voting though developing these systems is a logical direction for companies in the election business , voteherenet came to the field for very different reasons the company started in 1996 as soundcode , which developed data security software but mr adler saw that field increasingly dominated by large companies like network associates and security dynamics so he put three engineers in the nineperson company to work applying their encryption to an internet voting system they spent a year on the project , and now patents for the product are pending we could be eaten alive or move into a market that s new and bold , mr adler said companies already in the election business say that technology companies like voteherenet are at a disadvantage because they have not dealt with the politics behind the development of election systems and the requirements that vary from county to county there are only a few companies nationwide that understand the election business , mr knecht of global said there are many , many companies interested in internet voting that have little understanding of election law mr adler , for one , is willing to learn his company s research shows that election officials nationwide spend 1 billion a year on equipment for election day but he recognizes that the business of handling election data carries an exceptional burden of responsibility you have the spotlight on you all the time , he said you have to be squeaky clean photo several companies are trying to merge traditional balloting with voting over the internet \( illustration the new york times \)
though much admired , cole porter is never mentioned as one of those innovators who forever changed the content or the direction of american musical comedy he is seldom spoken of with the same reverence with which we talk about irving berlin , george and ira gershwin , richard rodgers and lorenz hart , jerome kern and oscar hammerstein 2d , and especially the canonized rodgers and hammerstein porter , who was writing shows from 1916 until 1958 \( he died in 1964 \) , had his share of hits , a lot of flops , but only one generally acknowledged classic , kiss me , kate , which opened on broadway on dec 30 , 1948 yet because he wrote so many songs that became standards \( his flop shows were rich with them \) , he was never very far from the public s consciousness even today he hangs on , if mostly in hotel lounges in resort cities and in elevators everywhere porter wrote some of the most melodic , unsentimental and sardonic love songs of the 20th century \( night and day , just one of those things , i get a kick out of you , among them \) , but he is most widely identified with delectable doublesentendres in songs that , no matter when they were written , seem to anchor him forever in the precrash 1920 s that possibly more than anything else \( except that he was born rich and then married a very rich woman \) has always made him suspect among the more serious critics of theater he was charming , which seemed slightly disreputable as the depression wore on toward world war ii he was also too much fun , or wanted to be , which was even more of a burden when he failed to deliver look up harold clurman s piece about the original kiss me , kate cast album , published in the saturday review of literature in february 1949 , in which the usually astute critic calls the show s style unpleasant , saying that it combines references to shakespeare with gangster vulgarity unpleasant was not a gutless word in clurman s vocabulary it was a grave charge made by a man who valued manners not as etiquette but as part of the social contract manners are one of the ways by which we protect our intellectual heritage fifty years ago , clurman pretty much dismissed everything about the show however , in a piece about the state of american musical theater that appeared in the new york times in 1962 , he had apparently reassessed kiss me , kate with an endearing blitheness that makes no reference to his earlier thoughts about the show , clurman notes that the score seems to improve with age now , in the director michael blakemore s fine , exuberant revival at the martin beck theater , kiss me , kate is again revealed to be what it has always been an elegant , nimble dream of a show , one of the rare perfect achievements of the american musical theater let s not get bogged down about what constitutes importance on the stage or , for that matter , seriousness it is n't the subject matter that defines a show but the quality and truth of whatever world that is evoked in kiss me , kate , the wit and extreme high spirits of the music , the lyrics , the choreography and the performances have a way of deepening our sense of connection to life itself it is thus an important , serious show more relevant it is grandly entertaining in this case it even survives a couple of wrongheaded production decisions that , if the show were less solidly constructed , might do fatal harm kiss me , kate has the form of a backstage musical about the baltimore tryout of a musical version of the taming of the shrew , which becomes both an appreciation of the shrew and an appropriation of it scenes from the contemporary story , about the show s battling , egomaniacal costars , are interwoven with those from the shrew in such a way that each story carries the other forward wisely , no attempt has been made to update the original sam and bella spewack book it is still set in june 1948 , three years after the end of world war ii and , though we did n't know it at the time , two years before the start of the korean war in retrospect , it was a brief , halcyon timeout by keeping the 1948 period , mr blakemore automatically evokes a sense of fable , which should help literalminded nerds accept other perfectly harmless ways in which plausibility is stretched kiss me , kate does n't intend to be a realistic recollection of what taking a new show on the road was like 50 years ago neither before nor after did porter ever write so bountiful a score nor one so effortlessly integrated he helps himself to lines from the play and expands them into songs \( i 've come to wive it wealthily in padua , where is the life that late i led \? , i am ashamed that women are so simple \) one of his most magical inspirations is to take a throwaway reference , spoken by bianca , give it a mock shakespearean context and transform it into the ravishing beguinetempo love song were thine that special face , sung by petruchio there are songs you may well know by heart without being aware of it tom , dick or harry , why ca n't you behave \?

ericsson of sweden and the microsoft corporation will create a jointventure company to market and deliver mobile email and other internet services for wireless network operators , the companies said yesterday ericsson , the world s third largest mobile phone maker , will own a majority of the new venture under the terms of the deal , ericsson will provide its wireless application protocol to microsoft and will adopt microsoft s mobile explorer , a new version of its internet browser , in future cellular phones ericsson officials said the partnership did not mean that the company would use microsoft s windows ce operating system in its wireless devices at this time , although they did not rule anything out microsoft said it expected to start shipping mobile explorer in the middle of next year on nasdaq today , microsoft s stock closed at 918125 , down 11875 shares in phonecom , a redwood city , calif , company that already produces browser software for cell phones , fell 12625 , or more than 8 percent , to 142 in stockholm , a 12 percent rise in the shares of ericsson led the swedish market to an unusual daily gain of 582 percent analysts said the deal should help ericsson regain market share lost to motorola and to nokia of finland , and it represented another significant step in microsoft s efforts to be a major competitor in wireless networking microsoft has entered into a similar joint venture with qualcomm , called wireless knowledge , and has made a number of acquisitions of companies with wireless technology or software even microsoft ca n't jumpstart the wirelessdata industry singlehandedly , said alan reiter , president of wireless internet and mobile computing , a consulting firm in chevy chase , md this is one step in microsoft s attempt to be a major player in wireless data , but it s certainly not going to be a slamdunk microsoft and ericsson officials said their venture would concentrate on building , marketing and deploying products that use microsoft s windows nt server and exchange programs and ericsson s infrastructure and mobile internet technologies the mobile internet is part of ericsson s vision of convenient and userfriendly information access and wireless email , said kurt hellstrom , the company s president ericsson officials said the partnership with microsoft did not diminish the company s commitment to symbian , a consortium it set up with psion , nokia and matsushita of japan , in part to keep microsoft from realizing the kind of dominance in the wireless industry that it achieved in personal computer software symbian has created a standard operating system , called epoc , for wireless devices juha christensen , symbian s executive vice president , said he did not see the deal as a threat obviously , every time we see people with a competitive offering , we get a little apprehensive , he said but in this instance , he said , we do n't have a competitive offering , adding , in the long term it s very difficult for anyone who wants to play in the corporate space to avoid microsoft because they own all the desktops still , analysts said this deal , coming on the heels of a recent one in which nokia agreed to use the operating system of palm computing , presented trouble for symbian and its operating system this is strike 2 , said andrew seybold , an industry consultant in boulder creek , calif symbian , instead of being on the inside looking out , could be on the outside looking in but he noted that none of the wireless partnerships to date were exclusive deals nobody knows what the winning combination of wireless communications and information service is going to be , he said this is all posturing for microsoft , the link with ericsson provides credibility in winning deals with major wireless carriers microsoft , in order to be competitive in the wireless arena , mr seybold continued , has to get into the carriers' backend infrastructure some way because that s where all the smarts are ericsson is a trusted backend supplier david readerman , a managing director of thomas weisel partners , said the sheer numbers in the wireless market made it attractive to microsoft even if it would never achieve the dominance it has in desktop computing certainly in europe , the installed base of handsets is soon to exceed the installed base of pc s , he said this may not represent the classic annuity stream for microsoft , but they need to be there it s a major strategic move
jim calhoun s face was crimson as he bolted out of his seat to scream at a player last night the honeymoon has ended for the defending national champion connecticut huskies on the first night of the new season about as abruptly as if the bride had woken up and smacked the groom across the face first , calhoun had woken up thursday to learn of a report in a connecticut newspaper that said his point guard , khalid elamin , had been using a land rover registered to a hartford man who told the paper that elamin had been leaving him game tickets for the last two seasons the report raised the question of whether that would constitute a violation of national collegiate athletic association rules , and the university waited until just a few hours before the huskies game in the coaches vs cancer ikon classic to decide if elamin , the preseason big east player of the year , would play later , as calhoun looked to be at about his midseason level of stress , the huskies , projected to repeat as the national champions because they had lost just two players from last year s team , lost to unranked iowa , 7068 the stunning upset , combined with stanford s upset of duke in the first game of the night , sent the college basketball rankings reeling and relegated the anticipated rematch of last season s national championship game to the consolation contest tonight they just outworked us , said a seething calhoun afterward hopefully , they gave this team a lesson in how to play basketball together iowa is certainly a better team than we are because five guys played together offensively and defensively the huskies defeated iowa by 10 points in the round of 16 last march en route to the national title elamin was in the lineup tonight , although he will almost surely be the subject of some sort of investigation of the allegations , as was kevin freeman and none of it mattered in the first half there were air balls and turnovers and just four assists a particular sore spot for calhoun and a team that appeared to be entirely lost on the floor as calhoun paced and blustered fell behind by as many as 17 points early in the second half had the huskies taken iowa too lightly \? maybe in the first half , yes , said jacob jaacks , the hulking iowa center who scored 20 points we 're a team of nobodies and they 've got everybody elamin , a big somebody for connecticut , would redeem himself he nearly singlehandedly dragged connecticut back into the game , scoring from all over the floor , stealing the ball , and grabbing offensive rebounds he scored 24 of his gameleading 26 points in the second half , and connecticut did briefly snatch the lead with seven minutes to play as iowa s best player , dean oliver , who scored 14 points , spent all but nine minutes of the second half on the bench in foul trouble but then iowa found its shot and pulled ahead again , as connecticut scored just 6 points in more than four minutes the huskies trailed by just 3 in the final halfminute of the game , but elamin missed a 3pointer and the rebound went off albert mouring s foot out of bounds calhoun did n't look angry then , just bewildered on a night of startling upsets , calhoun s dream season came to an abrupt halt while steve alford s career as a big 10 coach began with a sparkling night do n't give me an excuse because it s a late hour , alford said after midnight get this in print we were concerned anytime you play no 1 , you 're concerned there was no need from early on to be worried connecticut missed 20 of the 27 shots it attempted elamin was 1 of 7 in the first half and turned the ball over 14 times iowa received just one vote in one preseason poll , and after losing seven of the nine players that were in the rotation for the sweet 16 , alford said before the game that he merely hoped his team would be better by saturday morning than they were thursday night but iowa raced out to a quick 122 lead after less than four minutes after three straight 3pointers and a total of 6 points by jaacks in the first 3 45 connecticut did eventually close to within 3 points , at 1815 , when ajou deng , the 6foot10inch skinny forward with the wingspan of a condor , hit a 3pointer with 8 05 remaining in the first half but the huskies would never get closer than that as connecticut fizzled , the specter of an investigation into elamin s actions loomed after the game , elamin answered the questions confidently and emphatically there s nothing i did wrong , he said , insisting that although he had a friendship with the owner of the car , he had never been in the car as far as i'm concerned , it s behind me iowa will play stanford , which beat duke in overtime , 8079 it was the first loss in an opener for duke , which lost four players to the first round of the national basketball association draft , since 1981 unlike connecticut , neither duke nor stanford is expected to be as powerful a contender as usual , and last night both teams showed why there are diminished expectations on their respective campuses stanford returns just one starter , forward mark madsen , from last season and he is unlikely to play tonight because he pulled a hamstring near the end of regulation last night duke is a work in progress , trying to meld the experience of shane battier and chris carrawell with another extraordinary freshman class but both coaches had wondered before the tournament how the youth of their teams would perform in such a highprofile game so early in the season duke shot just 282 percent and attempted 33 3pointers and still nearly won the game stanford turned the ball over 24 times and did win as mistakeladen as this game was , it was also unexpectedly thrilling duke staged a gritty comeback in the final four minutes of the game , only to lose a 5point lead with less than 40 seconds left in regulation a turnover by the freshman point guard jason williams gave stanford the opportunity to tie the score at the end of regulation , and stanford prevailed by making four of the five shots it attempted in overtime photos connecticut s khalid elamin losing the ball beneath the basket against iowa s duez henderson last night at the garden \( bernie nunez for the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) duke s shane battier making a diving attempt to wrestle the ball from stanford s curtis borchardt last night \( bernie nunez for the new york times \) \( pg d8 \)
cortez , colo , nov 20 as one of its last major public land initiatives , the clinton administration is preparing to designate as national monuments up to a dozen open areas in the west that federal officials say need protection from future commercial development and recreational overuse interior secretary bruce babbitt , who came to colorado this weekend to build support for the action , said the administration had decided to act because , in many cases , congress had failed to act on proposed legislation that would accomplish the same thing delays , he said , had prompted president clinton to consider invoking the antiquities act of 1906 , which gives the president the authority to act by executive order in the case of any lands that have scientific , historic or archaeological significance since the law was passed , every president except richard m nixon , ronald reagan and george bush has designated at least one national monument there are now more than 100 mr babbitt said the administration was more than willing to allow congress to take the lead but conceding that opposition in some cases might be strong , he said the president was willing to act i certainly hope this is not our last major initiative , but it is a major undertaking , mr babbitt said in an interview on friday before hiking through part of the 73 , 000 acres he wants added to the colorado national monument , near grand junction today he toured indian ruins here that he wants declared monuments the needs are growing year by year , he said , referring to commercial and recreation pressures congress has n't responded at all so rather than leave it all to the 11th hour , the president is ready to consider these on a casebycase basis besides the two colorado sites , the other proposed monuments are the arizona strip , on the north rim of the grand canyon perry mesa , near flagstaff , ariz la cienega , near tucson the missouri breaks , along 140 miles of the missouri river in montana steens mountain , in southeast oregon soda mountain , in southern oregon the santa rosa mountains , near palm springs , calif the carrizo plain , in california s central valley the otay mountains , east of san diego and thousands of islands and rocks off the california coast having toured them all within the last year , mr babbitt said he had found growing public support for granting monument status , which would provide greater protections through the national park service or the bureau of land management all the lands under consideration are managed by the land bureau , but monument status would add access restrictions and ensure that they cannot be developed or sold preservation groups and environmentalists are applauding the initiative it sends a very important signal that these special places deserve more protection than they 're getting , said richard moe , president of the national trust for historic preservation this tells the world that they are very significant sites but many opponents view it as little more than a political tactic by mr clinton , a way for him to seal his legacy as an environmentalist and cement environmental groups' support for vice president al gore in his quest for the presidency in addition , lawmakers from western states , like senators robert f bennett of utah and wayne allard of colorado , object to federal intervention within their borders without sufficient local input and commercial interests say the initiative is yet another effort by the administration to ignore the economic consequences of environmental policy this certainly smacks of another antimining advocacy effort , said john grasser , a spokesman for the national mining association you have to go where the minerals are , and if they continue to withdraw lands where the mines are , it means going elsewhere to develop , which means out of the country and the loss of millions of jobs myra b hyde , director of environmental issues for the national cattlemen s beef association , whose members own herds that graze on open lands , said once you take lands out of production , it affects whole communities lawyers for the interior department said that some of the lands in question have mineral resources but that none have active mines they also said grazing rights would probably not be affected representative james v hansen of utah , who is chairman of a house national parks and public lands subcommittee , sponsored legislation two years ago that would require approval of congress as well as the governor and state legislature to designate a national monument that exceeds 5 , 000 acres it passed the house , but a companion senate bill is still under consideration when the most recent national monument grand staircaseescalante , a 19 millionacre tract in southern utah was designated by mr clinton in 1996 , mr hansen called the designation the biggest land grab in the nation and in a letter last month to mr babbitt expressing concern over monument designations in their state , three colorado lawmakers senator allard , senator ben nighthorse campbell and representative scott mcinnis described it as a heavyhanded federal action mr allard said in an interview this week that mr babbitt had yet to respond to the letter he criticized administration officials for storming in and storming out without doing the proper legwork on the issue mr mcinnis , who attended a public forum led by mr babbitt at the colorado national monument on friday , predicted that congress would expand the monument , which is in his district , within the administration s timetable with regard to the other lands , he added executive order is not the way to go the antiquities act was never intended to bypass congress allen freemyer , staff director of mr hansen s subcommittee , said that even without mr hansen s bill , the administration already had hundreds of tools to manage public lands without drawing on a 93yearold measure that was passed before agencies like the park service were created to manage and protect federal lands this is a big photoop declaration , which really is n't necessary , he said of mr babbitt s initiative they 're just doing what al gore likes to do best , the champion of the environment warning that if we do n't make these places monuments , the bulldozers are waiting to administration officials and environmental groups , that prospect is not much of an exaggeration as the expanding national economy of the 1990 s has created more business opportunities and disposable income , they contend , open lands have become more vulnerable to commercial development , recreational use and encroaching sprawl at the forum , mr babbitt said that whether it is congress or mr clinton who makes the designations , monument status would assure that the next seven generations have the same opportunity to enjoy the lands that visitors have now photo interior secretary bruce babbitt took a hike on friday along the devil s canyon trail , part of a 73 , 000acre area that the clinton adminstration wants to protect by adding it to the colorado national monument \( mickey

moscow , sept 20 raisa maksimovna gorbachev , who broke kremlin tradition by sharing the spotlight with her husband , the former soviet president mikhail s gorbachev , and did so with bold selfassurance and flair , died today in munster , germany she was 67 the cause was leukemia , aides to mr gorbachev said she had been under treatment in university hospital in munster since late july mr gorbachev s rise to the leadership of the communist party in 1985 was the first sign of a seismic shift in the soviet union s calcified politics and economy but it was raisa gorbachev who , both at home and abroad , soon came to embody the changes to come she emerged as a first lady who had her own mind , her own style and according to reports of a secret videotape that circulated after one of her foreign trips , her own american express card none of this endeared her to the soviet public , who began to grumble early in her husband s tenure that she was too pushy , too flashy and too influential her appearances on foreign trips and her cultural projects at home stirred debate in many russian kitchens over whether the proper place for kremlin wives was as it had always been at home , or at least in the background but since the beginning of this month , when russians first learned that their former first lady had been hospitalized in germany with an advanced and rare case of leukemia , sentiments toward her in russia began to shift favorable articles began to appear in the press , and thousands of letters and telegrams of sympathy arrived at the hospital in munster , where her husband kept a faithful vigil that touched many russian hearts it must be in the russian character to run somebody into the mud , and them laud them to high heavens after a tragedy strikes , said vladimir polyakov , a gorbachev spokesman president boris n yeltsin , mr gorbachev s bitter rival in the early 1990 s , sent a message of condolence today , and in a statement he said that a wonderful person , a beautiful woman , a loving wife and mother is no longer with us in his autobiography , published in 1996 , mr gorbachev acknowledged that the resentment over his wife s high profile surfaced in letters written to the communist party s central committee who does she think she is , a member of the politburo \? he quoted one as saying the simplest answer would have been 'no , she is my wife' she first became known in the west in 1984 when she accompanied her husband , then a ranking member of the soviet politburo , to britain , where they were received by prime minister margaret thatcher diplomats and reporters , scanning the couple for clues about the next generation of soviet leaders , quickly focused up on her wardrobe in particular her gold lame sandals with chain straps , a far cry from the dowdy shoes worn by other kremlin wives on a later trip to france , the french press labeled her clothes elegant , but not chic on her foreign travels , she also became known for a haughty conversational style that bordered on the pedantic during the 1986 summit meeting in reykjavik , iceland , she needled her tour guides with persistent questioning , adding didactic commentary of her own visiting the united states for the first time in 1987 , she irked nancy reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism , reportedly prompting the american president s wife to quip , who does that dame think she is \? as she became more comfortable in her role as the soviet first lady , she loosened up and her wardrobe became more subdued on a visit to washington in 1990 , she established more friendly relations with barbara bush , from whom she got a recipe for blueberry pie born in the siberian city of rubtsovsk , raisa titarenko grew up as the daughter of a railway engineer she graduated from school with a gold medal top honors in the soviet system and went on to the prestigious university of moscow she was studying philosophy there when she met mr gorbachev , then a law student according to his book , he was smitten , but she was aloof our first meeting had not impressed raisa at all , he wrote she seemed calm and indifferent judging by the look in her eyes not much later , at an impromptu party staged by mr gorbachev s roommates for raisa and her friends , i wanted to impress her , he wrote , but i think i made a terrible fool of myself she was reserved and was the first to suggest breaking up the gathering after an intense courtship , the two penniless students were married in 1953 , the year of stalin s death they had one daughter , irina , born in 1956 , who survives her along with mr gorbachev and two granddaughters after the couple completed their college work in 1955 , the family returned to mr gorbachev s home region of stavropol in southern russia there mrs gorbachev completed a doctoral dissertation , entitled the emergence of new characteristics in the daily life of collective farm peasantry , based on an unusual amount of field research , which was accepted by the lenin pedagogical institute in moscow
in economics , the facts alone do n't usually tell the whole story consider inequality , the trendy subject of dozens of books in the last few years the facts are uncontroversial by any hard measure wages , income , wealth the gap between rich and poor in america has been widening for decades and while there are indications that the gap may have stopped growing in the mid1990 s , the disparities between americans of different means are wider today than at any time since the end of world war ii sounds like a big problem , right \? the conventional wisdom says so oddly , though , none of the authors who spend hundreds of pages and thousands of statistics documenting the phenomenon devote even a few paragraphs to rigorously demonstrating that greater income disparities as opposed to , say , the persistence of an entrenched underclass is a serious problem for the nation they simply assume that it is so when two distinguished empirical economists take the trouble to challenge what has become an article of faith , it s intriguing particularly because neither is a rightwing ideologue baldly denying the facts , nor a hoary elitist insisting that inequality is necessary for innovation , saving or support of high culture the main question they must tackle is how to decide whether rising inequality is good , bad or indifferent one approach , taken by martin feldstein , president of the national bureau of economic research , is to ask whether the sources of increasing inequality meet a widely accepted ethical criterion first proposed by the italian economist vilfredo pareto it is the economic equivalent of the hippocratic standard in medicine any change is good if it makes someone better off without making anyone else worse off professor feldstein examines some of the changes that have created an explosion of riches at the very apex of america s income distribution the most important , economists agree , is the market s increased tendency to heap most of its rewards on those with lots of education and sophisticated skills in addition , opportunities for entrepreneurs have burgeoned wildly as recently as 1980 , 60 percent of the forbes 400 had inherited the bulk of their wealth by 1997 the old money had dropped to just 20 percent then there s the wellpublicized phenomenon of the 70hour work week for investment bankers , lawyers , management consultants and other top professionals , a contrast to the past when those who worked the longest were those with the lowest wages and , finally , there s the extraordinary bull market in securities , mostly owned by the haves all these changes , mr feldstein says , are in themselves positive , and tend to benefit some individuals without making others any worse off by the pareto criterion , that s a change for the better finis welch , a labor economist at texas a m university who gave this year s prestigious ely lecture at the american economics association annual meeting , takes a different approach , focusing on inequality s consequences rather than its causes mr welch argues that rising inequality has had important positive effects along with at least one negative he points out that , while the market s uneven rewards for skills have caused the wage gap between highpaid and lowpaid individuals in general to widen dramatically , they have also sharply narrowed the far more disturbing wage gaps between blacks and whites and between women and men under these circumstances , it is hard to believe that most americans would prefer the more homogenous income distribution of the late 1940 s , when racism and sexism severely limited occupational choice and pay growing inequality could have devastating effects if it convinced those at the bottom that efforts to move up are doomed to failure but largely the opposite has happened young americans are finishing high school and going on to college in record numbers , an obvious plus still , one clear response to increased wage inequality that mr welch identifies is unambiguously troublesome lowskill , loweducation men react to their falling earnings potential by giving up on work and relying instead on welfare and other social programs for income , an option that did not exist before the mid1960 s policy makers are more conscious of the pitfalls and are more inclined than ever before to tie benefits to work that , together with the tightest labor market in memory and a recent surge in pay among the less skilled , may be drawing some dropouts back into the work force everybody was just wringing their hands about income inequality , mr welch said , but i just kept thinking that people have more of a sense of control over their destinies than when i was a kid mr welch , who overcame a devastating accident that left him a paraplegic at 18 , seems in step with the mood of most ordinary americans , who seem to feel that , whatever has happened to the income distribution , opportunities abound and not just for the rich graph more of the pie share of the total household income received by the 5 percent of households that earned the most each year since 1967 \( source census bureau \)

atmosphere so ominously noir , and everything fit so well into a world in which the angels of democracy were destined always to live in conflict with the alluring tug of the devil in the neardecade since they took the wall away there have been new and arguably greater threats posed by nuclear and biological terrorism than any that stalin could possibly have imagined for readers , though , it just has n't been the same nothing seems quite so malevolent , so wholly shrouded in evil , as the kremlin once did true , russia today is a country slipping into a different kind of darkness , and it can be horrifying to watch but some days you can hardly tell the good guys from the bad so we have to be at least a little thankful to robert harris , who in his new novel , archangel , has given those of us who retain some literary nostalgia for the evil empire exactly what we have been waiting for a thriller about the bad old days set in the deep , gray present in his previous work , most notably his 1992 novel fatherland , in which hitler triumphed and nazism lives , harris mapped out as his special terrain the effects that the 20th century s great villains have had on the world i am sorry to report it s a subject that never seems to lose its resonance archangel does more than simply touch the past its central question what would happen if the great spirit of stalin returned to the land he practically destroyed hovers like a storm cloud over russia today it is an issue that s easy to dismiss , and hard to approach in a novel but harris goes at it with real reporting many of the little details , from the badly patterned wallpaper in the dachas of the power elite \( today no less than in the communist era \) to the two webbed toes of stalin s left foot , make the place feel gruesomely right in harris s able hands you can feel the oppression of stalin s time on every one of moscow s poorly lighted streets his contemporary portrait of the city , overflowing with sin , possibility and hopelessness , seems unbelievable only if you have never spent a day there at five past 10 , the door opened , harris writes with perfect accuracy about one of the city s nightclubs a yellow light , the silhouettes of the girls , the steamy glow of their perfumed breath and from the cars now came the serious money you could tell the seriousness not just by the weight of the coats and the jewelry but by the way their owners carried themselves , straight to the head of the line , and by the amount of protection they left hanging around at the door clearly , the only guns allowed on the premises belonged to the management archangel is not without its problems , beginning with the plot the story line reads like , well , a cheap thriller , though one that moves with the speed of a freight train fluke kelso , a dissolute soviet expert whose early academic promise seems to have withered away with the soviet union itself , stumbles on the story of the halfcentury while in moscow to participate in a conference titled , appropriately enough , confronting the past while his staid academic colleagues listen pliably to the lectures arranged by officials from the russian national archives , kelso encounters a fearsome man , papu rapava , who was once the bodyguard of stalin s secret police chief , lavrenti beria , and then spent the mandatory 15 years in siberia rapava , after tossing back enough vodka to float the potemkin , claims that stalin left behind an astonishing secret , to which only he has the key it s a hokey literary device , but one that allows harris to link russia s gloomy present to its terrifying past the harrowing and often outlandish story flows from there it turns out that russia s most evil and effective man left behind something more of himself than even his many great admirers had hoped , and kelso is immediately pulled on a thrilling journey that takes him to the edge of the arctic , in archangel , a northern city that we are to interpret as the archtypical repository of that great mythic beast , the russian soul harris s book is most exciting as he maneuvers kelso through the political and criminal intricacies of moscow , hooking him up with an audacious and sadly credible television reporter who knows far more about sophisticated phone equipment than he does about the country he is covering once they set off on their quest for the truth , things get more troublesome for them and for the novel the characters are led across the vast snows of the russian winter by the unknown hands of an extremist with a penchant for collecting 30 s memorabilia like so many of the characters in this novel , vladimir mamantov would seem ludicrous if he did n't also seem so real it is the ruthless mamantov , a sta linist dinosaur , who turns out to be the only man in the book who knows what he s talking about kelso and the television reporter , r j o'brian , race to find their quarry for strikingly different reasons kelso is driven by his need to know what happened in the land to which he has devoted his intellectual life he is a historian in the rare position to see where history can take us o'brian knows a scoop when one hits him in the face and this is obviously the greatest scoop he will ever have naturally they find what they are looking for and that s when the novel sinks beneath the weight of its own implausibility the spirit of stalin is indeed alive in the land , but this time , predictably enough , it emerges purely as farce do n't dwell on the details of the novel too long or they will melt away like single snowflakes striking a windowpane harris has drawn a rude collection of characters they are boorish , obtuse , ignorant , vulgar and gloriously pretentious you could see them as foolish and fantastic , but none of them seems particularly out of place in moscow today the asinine television journalist the sodden professor who never realized his potential the aging whore with a heart of gold who mistakenly manages to get her father tortured and murdered \( and who , naturally , is saving her hardearned dollars so that she can go to law school \) and the extremist waiting for the brass ring to come around to his side one more time he is the best character of them all if you pull at the threads they 'll unravel so do n't the book is still fun , exciting even that s because harris never loses sight of the big picture he understands that the russian people are desperate , that they long for anything that could transport them to a better place , and that at this point , they are willing to shoulder the most unbelievable burdens to get there drawing \( john nickle \)
click on buy click on sell click on payoff the mutual fund industry has joined the rush to the internet over the last two years and the move seems to be benefiting both the fund companies and many of their customers investors can buy funds on the sites of many noload fund companies or through the sites of one of several brokerage firms that offer fund supermarkets to avoid losing customers to online firms , many noload fund groups , including the vanguard group , american century investments and t rowe price associates , have opened their own online brokerage firms , trading individual stocks and sometimes offering thousands of funds beyond their own such supermarkets will be the conduits for the bulk of all fund purchases by 2003 , with most investors relying on fund company sites for information only , according to james punishill , author of a report on internet investing for forrester research , a consulting firm in cambridge , mass by 2003 , forrester predicts , investors will hold 12 trillion in mutual fund assets in internetbased accounts , up from an estimated 128 billion by the end of this year the most noticeable change brought by the internet , however , has been its capacity to deliver detailed research to virtually all investors , no matter how much they have to invest using that information which is often free investors can compare funds before making choices dozens of web sites offer performance figures as well as portfolio tracking , so investors can monitor their holdings and the shifts in their asset mix of stocks , bonds and cash the selfdirected investor has at their disposal what five years ago professional investors did n't even have at their disposal , said cebra graves , internet strategist at morningstar inc , the financial publisher in chicago morningstar s web site lets investors compare funds and portfolio holdings at no charge \( www morningstar net \) for varying fees , investors can gain access to more detailed screens and data morningstar also supplies data to other companies like e trade , whose site provides free access to research and sorting tools using endofquarter data the mutual fund education alliance , an association of noload funds , offers a site at www mfea com with fund industry news , investment planning tools and links to fund company sites investors can register on the site to gain access to a personal portfolio tracker in other words , the internet lets investors get the information they need when they want it inevitably , you did n't get the brochure at the right time and , inevitably , the information you need is n't in there , said shelton s unger , head of online services at vanguard with the internet , a great deal of information is available immediately , she added , and you sort of find your own path vanguard recently updated an investment planning service to allow investors to prepare on line for retirement , college or other investment objectives the service considers the user s risk tolerance and time horizon , among other factors one bonus for the fund industry is that many investors who know the internet are willing to receive routine information , like shareholder reports , on line instead of in the mail that can help keep down a fund s expenses when an investor requests a prospectus over the phone , for example , vanguard spends 10 to 12 to respond in labor costs for the phone representative and for printing and mailing internet use is climbing at vanguard 37 percent of all shareholders used the web to get information or to make a transaction in the first quarter of 1999 , up from 20 percent a year earlier , ms unger said the trend is evident elsewhere at charles schwab company , 45 percent of all mutual fund transactions were on the internet in midjune , up from 25 percent a year ago and 16 percent at the beginning of 1998 what we see is that the process of investing is easier , richer than it s ever been before , said jeffrey m lyons , senior vice president for mutual funds marketing at schwab instead of searching through magazine and newspaper articles for information and advice , investors can go on line to sort through thousands of funds and run through detailed asset allocation scenarios for growth or value investing as well as domestic or international choices then , immediately , they click a button and invest in the fund , mr lyons said schwab and other companies say the ease of internet trading has not caused investors to flip rapidly in and out of funds schwab customers are charged a redemption fee if they sell shares within six months of purchase brian c murray , general manager for e trade s mutual fund group , which reserves the right to charge a fee for sales made within three months , said , there appears to be an even stronger buyandhold ethic than i expected the fund industry has also found the internet to be useful for reaching retirement investors the 401 \( k \) forum is an internetbased retirement investment adviser hired by companies to offer personal 401 \( k \) advice to their employees fidelity investments , which already offers extensive webbased services to its retirement plan participants , is now offering a service aimed at small businesses , e401k , that is a 401 \( k \) plan sold and maintained entirely over the internet

brussels , jan 30 nato allies removed restraints today on military action against serbia if it does not agree by feb 6 to start talks next weekend in france with the ethnic albanian leaders in kosovo about autonomy for the province alliance ambassadors in brussels gave secretary general javier solana authority , after consultation with allied capitals , to order air strikes against military targets in kosovo and elsewhere in serbia unless president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia agrees to negotiations they accelerated planning for a possible emergency extraction of the 1 , 020 international civilian observers now in kosovo for the organization for security and cooperation in europe in case the serbian authorities menace them because of the bombing threat officials said it could take up to 10 , 000 nato troops to take the observers to safety the alliance has also begun planning for a possible peacekeeping force of 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 troops to monitor any agreement the parties reach in eventual negotiations , officials said the united states is considering contributing 2 , 000 to 5 , 000 peacekeepers and britain and france have said they would provide soldiers for a force to carry out an agreement the allies acted after the british foreign secretary , robin cook , presented an international ultimatum to mr milosevic and the kosovo albanian authorities mr milosevic , who annulled autonomy for kosovo 10 years ago , made no direct response today , mr cook reported page 8 but in a warning to the ethnic albanian leaders fighting for independence for the province , nato officials said strikes would not go ahead if the albanians refused to negotiate or stop attacking the serbs the nato secretary general will take full account of the position and actions of the kosovar leadership and all kosovar armed elements in and around kosovo in reaching his decision on military action , the allies agreed , referring to the rebel forces nato will take all appropriate measures in case of a failure by the kosovar albanian side to comply with the demands of the international community in washington , meetings were scheduled throughout the weekend on plans for possible air strikes against serbia if mr milosevic resists the negotiations officials also were discussing how to send in american ground troops should president clinton decide they are needed the administration s top national security advisers have reached a consensus to recommend sending american ground troops if the two warring parties agree to a ceasefire , administration and congressional officials say but in a statement today , david leavy , a white house spokesman , said the president has made no decision whether to send american troops should an international peacekeeping force enter kosovo in a meeting of the socalled contact group on the balkans that was scheduled in london on friday in the expectation that nato would authorize air strikes today , six nations the united states , britain , france , italy , germany and russia demanded an end to all violence in kosovo officials said that though the earliest probable date for action was a week away , mr solana had full authority to order air strikes before then if there was another largescale massacre of albanian civilians by serbian forces officials said the allies did not want to take sides with the kosovo liberation army , in effect becoming its air force against serbia in the rebels' struggle for independence , a goal none of the contactgroup nations support kosovo is 90 percent populated by ethnic albanian kosovars we 're making clear that the actions of the kosovars in the negotiations and on the ground will have a bearing on the decision of the secretary general to order strikes , a senior nato diplomat said further possible military measures to exert pressure on the rebels , like a nato naval blockade of major albanian ports , were still under study , he said under what amounts to an international ultimatum , both sides have seven days from feb 6 , extendable by a week or less , to reach agreement on autonomy along lines worked out over the last few months by an american mediator for kosovo , christopher hill , the ambassador to macedonia the negotiations would be held at a rural 18thcentury chateau in rambouillet , 32 miles southwest of paris if the serbs and the kosovo albanians do negotiate a settlement , officials said the alliance would draw up plans for a 30 , 000member nato force that could stay in kosovo for years while a peace conference works out permanent arrangements albanian loyalties have been divided between the kosovo liberation army , armed through albania by a financial support network in europe and the united states , and moderates led by ibrahim rugova today s nato decision reactivates plans for both immediate , limited warning strikes and a wider phased air campaign that could hit serbian air defense sites and other military targets not only in kosovo but also elsewhere in serbia hundreds of planes , mainly american ones , and dozens of ships are poised for operations that could start from bases in italy and the adriatic within days
let s put president clinton s warning about the impending teacher shortage in perspective almost every president since harry truman has sounded the same alarm , and somehow we have survived is the danger real this time , or could this be another false alarm \? it s true that we will need 22 million teachers over the next decade because of rising enrollments , the imminent retirement of many teachers and legislation mandating smaller classes it s also true that some parts of the country are having difficulty finding teachers , particularly those who teach math , science and special education as a result , many districts are giving out emergency credentials to fill these positions new york city has 10 , 000 such teachers , and in some schools in oakland , calif , half the faculty is on emergency certification often school districts simply assign current faculty members to teach subjects out of their regular field of knowledge by some estimates , four million students are being taught essential subjects by teachers who neither majored nor minored in the subjects they 're teaching none of these facts , however , justify the solution proposed by the president and others spending hundreds of millions of dollars on recruiting and training money may attract people into teaching , but the odds are they will be badly trained the odds are even greater that they will be assigned to the toughest schools and the most difficult schedules as a result , according to a department of education study of teacher retention , 22 percent will leave the teaching profession within three years from 30 to 50 percent will leave within five years simply put , nothing short of a complete overhaul will solve the problems of the public schools extra money alone will just keep the current mediocre system in place consider the problem of teachers who are forced to teach subjects they have n't studied georgia , for example , allows teachers to spend up to half their time teaching subjects out of their field administrators often consider teachers to be interchangeable parts , so they 're comfortable assigning a gym teacher to teach math , for example richard ingersoll , a professor of sociology at the university of georgia , compares this to a hospital s asking a podiatrist to perform brain surgery more money wo n't end these practices or make administrators treat teachers with respect some school districts have created their own shortages some schools in oakland , for example , did n't have enough science teachers last year oakland s personnel office claimed that it could n't find qualified teachers , but i 've met several certified science teachers who tried to apply for jobs in oakland but could n't get interviews more money wo n't make bureaucracies competent teacher training is also a weak link most education schools train future teachers in lecture classes and have them spend time with children in real classrooms only in their last semester researchers , including linda darlinghammond , a professor of education at stanford , found that the best way to train teachers was to have them spend more time in schools working with master teachers but this is one problem that can be solved with a better use of resources universities regularly divert tuition paid by education majors into areas like nursing , engineering and medicine only about half of the tuition paid by education majors is used for their training universities have no incentive to stop siphoning money from education schools , and additional federal money wo n't change that it s time we took action a 1998 survey of college freshmen found that more than 10 percent of them wanted to become teachers we have n't seen that kind of eagerness to teach since the early 1970 s alternative certification programs , which train people to teach as a second career , are turning away applicants for lack of space in other words , teaching appeals to young and old we should act to see that the profession itself is deserving of their excitement

houston , aug 16 this morning s practice for the houston comets was far from normal they were still working as hard chasing balls , going for rebounds but there was no banter , no encouragement the comets have already clinched a playoff spot and are aiming for their third straight women s national basketball association championship but the concept of winning and losing games seemed much less important to them now point guard kim perrot , whose lung cancer was diagnosed in january and who underwent surgery in february to remove one of several brain tumors , had taken a turn for the worse and tonight was in the medical intensive care unit at m d anderson cancer center here perrot , who has not played this season , had been seeking alternative treatment in tijuana , mexico , when her condition deteriorated the team airlifted her to houston on sunday , and also brought members of her family from lafayette , la , to be by her side the team said perrot was receiving aggressive treatment and getting assistance breathing her condition put tonight s nationally televised game against the utah starzz against a somber backdrop the comets beat the starzz , 8071 , as fans honored perrot some wore white ribbons others pink hearts reading kim the comets wore white stickers with perrot s number , 10 i think who cares \? coach van chancellor said today before the game it s the only game i ever coached in my life where i do n't care if we win , fine if we do n't , fine i 've got bigger things , things that are more important to me , in my life right now chancellor said that none of the team members , including perrot s close friend , the twotime league most valuable player cynthia cooper , had asked for time off perrot , 32 , has been known as the heart of the team that won the first two wnba titles , earning enormous respect from her colleagues , coach and fans alike for her feistiness , work ethic and success , despite being only 5 feet 5 inches despite her public battle with cancer , her hospitalization came as a shock to her teammates and to the comets' fans her return from mexico led the evening television newscasts on sunday forward tammy jackson , designated by the team to speak for the players today , said she too was surprised you always have hope that she s going to get better , but in a situation of someone having cancer , you just try to keep hope alive , jackson said at one point in time , we knew that this day might come again we were surprised that it is here so soon perrot had played six professional years both in the united states and abroad since graduating from the university of southwestern louisiana she made the comets in 1997 at an initial tryout camp , then developed into the player chancellor has called one of the best point guards in the world last season , perrot averaged 85 points and 47 assists a game her 84 steals earned her second place in the balloting for defensive player of the year the comets , who won their division saturday night for the third consecutive year , tried to prepare themselves for utah game , but chancellor admitted that today s practice was a distraction we 've got a friend who s really fighting , so there s just nothing , nothing really good , he said jackson added it s hard , but again we 're professionals we have to come out here and do our jobs kim has already stated she wants us to come out and play hard and play the games and get prepared for the playoffs and keep working on the areas we need to work on to win another championship photo a comets fan showing support and concern last night for kim perrot , who has cancer \( associated press \)
espn asked a federal judge yesterday to halt major league baseball s termination of their contract after this season over the cable giant s plan to shift three sunday night games in september from espn to espn2 in papers filed with united states district court in manhattan , espn said that it has made numerous efforts over the past year to make the switch to espn2 more palatable to baseball but that all were rejected it appears no offer could salve baseball s psychic wound espn wanted to replace the three september games with higherrated national football league telecasts in its lawsuit , espn said that baseball had conditioned its acceptance of the shift to espn2 on receiving an additional 350 million in regularseason payments through 2002 , more than 300 percent above current rights fees , plus a contractual extension through 2004 and other concessions it s disproportionate and out of whack , said dick glover , an executive vice president of espn this is about three games out of 500 hours of baseball programming each year espn is seeking to enjoin baseball s termination of the contract and unspecified monetary damages last year , espn s nfl games generated an 81 nielsen cable rating , as against 18 for baseball the three nfl games that aired in place of baseball averaged a 73 rating in 1997 , when espn carried the three sunday night baseball games in september , the rating averaged 17 rich levin , a spokesman for baseball , declined to argue whether the deal s termination fit espn s alleged breach he said the bottom line is they broke the contract we had hoped we could resolve this baseball notified espn on april 21 that it was terminating its contract after more than a year of negotiations baseball felt aggrieved in january 1998 when espn made a 600 millionayear deal with the nfl for full seasons of sunday night games and was not consulted in advance about the impact on its sunday night baseball telecasts until then , espn showed the football season s second half , after tnt carried the first half the addition of the nfl games by espn meant pitting its first three sunday night games against the last three sunday night baseball games to espn , the remedy was easy shift the baseball games to espn2 because they rate lower than nfl telecasts and cost about 40 million a year for the regular season \( the dispute does not cover espn s separate contract through 2000 to carry baseball playoff games \) baseball disagreed , and last august it stripped espn of the right to carry the three sunday night games in september , thus preventing their showing on espn2 espn is available in 766 million cable households espn2 in 645 million the essential issue is baseball s unwillingness to acquiesce to a secondbanana role behind the nfl , said neal pilson , an industry consultant baseball is saying , if espn2 is so great why not put the nfl there \? espn believes its contract with baseball clearly spells out its rights to shift games to espn2 for events of significant viewer interest since 1995 , baseball has given its permission to shift about a dozen games from espn to espn2 to accommodate national hockey league playoff games , taped united states open golf highlights , a busch grand national auto race , the college world series and a world cup soccer match but none of the games were moved to espn2 on a sunday night glover said the criteria for moving games from espn to espn2 are the same for a sunday game as for one on wednesday when the deal was negotiated , the issue was never about time of year or day of week , he said baseball regards the espn sunday night games as a key showcase , because the telecasts are carried exclusively , with no other games played against them the dispute threatens to shatter the productive espnbaseball relationship , now in its 10th season glover said he felt betrayed by baseball s action , saying espn stood by the sport in tougher times and did not demand a full refund for unplayed games during the 1994 strike because they said they were strapped for cash but the impact of the past relationship seemed to fade yesterday levin , the baseball spokesman , said that espn s rationale in moving the sunday night baseball games is in error , that an nfl game is not an event of significant viewer interest as envisioned by the contract it says nothing about ratings , levin said just because something gets higher ratings does n't mean it s an event of significant viewer interest he added there s very little we would approve to preempt sunday night games for but it would n't be for earlyseason football games glover said there was no way to measure viewer interest without using ratings as the primary gauge how do you measure it \? he asked with public opinion surveys with past ratings levin said baseball s action was not taken with the advance knowledge that another cable network , like tbs , tnt or the fox sports net , was waiting to take over from espn baseball s looking at this as a free shot , said glover paul beeston is a guy who can perceive leverage when he thinks he has it beeston is the chief operating officer of major league baseball fox and turner officials said they had not been contacted by baseball
istanbul , turkey , feb 16 turkey s mostwanted fugitive , the guerrilla leader abdullah ocalan , whose army has been fighting for a kurdish homeland in the southeast , was captured in kenya and flown back to turkey early today mr ocalan , whose 14year war has cost the lives of an estimated 30 , 000 rebels , soldiers and civilians , has been sought by turkish authorities for more than a decade he is likely to be tried for treason and mass murder , and could face execution it was uncertain what effect mr ocalan s arrest would have on his guerrilla force , called the kurdistan workers party , or on the civil conflict that has cost turkey billions of dollars and severely damaged its image the conflict has come to dominate turkish life and has been used to justify measures ranging from limiting freedom of expression to burning villages in combat zones turkish leaders gave no details of how mr ocalan was captured , but officials and other people close to the government said a team of turkish commandos had snatched him away from greek diplomats , who had been sheltering him for two weeks he was being escorted to the airport in nairobi , said an official close to the turkish intelligence service his greek escorts lost the car in traffic , and he never made the flight some special operations guys figured out where he was and intercepted him grabbing a car that s being watched by a couple of greek diplomats is a piece of cake for a special operations team in a country like kenya , added the official , who like others who discussed the case , spoke on the condition of anonymity turkey has very good special operations people state of the art this is one of the biggest things they 've ever done a different account was offered by a lawyer for mr ocalan and a kenyan guard at the greek ambassador s residence , the associated press reported the guard said men in kenyan government vehicles entered the compound and forcibly removed three men on monday evening , although he was uncertain whether they included mr ocalan the guard said the men were forced into a vehicle , which sped off in a convoy that included the greek ambassador the lawyer , britta boehler , citing accounts by witnesses , was quoted as saying from the netherlands that mr ocalan did not leave voluntarily and that he was physically dragged out news of mr ocalan s capture set off waves of violent protest in european capitals , where kurds invaded greek and kenyan diplomatic missions to protest what they believed to be those countries' roles in turning him over to turkey it became clear later today , however , that in all probability neither country had cooperated in the operation mr ocalan s arrest was announced by prime minister bulent ecevit at a midday news conference in ankara the head of the separatist organization has been in turkey since 3 o'clock this morning , mr ecevit said , beaming and apparently struggling to control his emotions he will account for his activities before the turkish justice system in the eyes of some turks , the capture of mr ocalan may be seen as turkey s most spectacular success since it landed troops on cyprus in 1974 in what it described as an effort to protect the turkish minority there mr ecevit was also prime minister then , and he could reap considerable benefit from a new image as a twotime conqueror turks are to go the polls april 18 for a national election mr ecevit , who has been in office for barely a month and had been seen as only an interim figure , suddenly seems to be in a much stronger position the foreign ministry told foreign ambassadors today that ankara intends to use mr ocalan s trial to show its respect for legal formalities mr ecevit has long portrayed himself as an advocate for human rights they know they 're going to be under scrutiny , and they want to do their utmost to be scrupulously fair , said an ambassador who attended the briefing people around ecevit are going even further they see this as a way to break the stalemate on human rights altogether , to push through reforms that the system has been resisting mr ocalan lived semiclandestinely in syria from about 1980 until last october late that month , after turkish commanders made a series of statements threatening to attack syria if it did not expel him , he fled he turned up first in russia and then in italy turkish leaders demanded his extradition , but italy refused on the grounds that its constitution forbids sending suspects to countries where the death penalty is in force furious turks launched protests that ranged from boycotting italian goods to burning italian flags in january , mr ocalan was reported to have left italy earlier this month he spent several days flying around western europe seeking a haven , but found none after that episode , he disappeared again according to information provided today by foreign minister bonaya godana of kenya , he landed secretly in nairobi and was sheltered by greek diplomats mr godana said at a news conference that the greek ambassador in nairobi , george costoulas , had engaged in conduct which definitely cannot be said within the purview of what a diplomat is supposed to do hours later , kenya demanded that the greek government recall him when the kenyan authorities learned that mr ocalan was hiding in a greek embassy building , mr godana said , they demanded that he be expelled immediately it was at that point that the drive to nairobi s airport was hastily arranged turkish news reports said today that mr ocalan apparently was to be taken from kenya to greece , but mr godana said there was some talk of sending him to the seychelles asked whether he knew that mr ocalan would end up in turkey , mr godana replied we did not have the slightest suspicion this was a possibility there is no way we would have approved such a move foreign minister theodore pangalos of greece confirmed that greek diplomats had sheltered mr ocalan in kenya , but denied that he had been under their protection on his way to the airport he chose , despite our advice , to go with the kenyan authorities to the airport , mr pangalos said in athens in some quarters mr ocalan is viewed as leader of a liberation movement fighting for the rights of turkey s 8 million to 10 million kurds the government , however , portrays him as a ruthless terrorist for whom no tactic has been too gruesome or horrific ocalan was not fit , either as a person or by his leadership style , to be the head of a major political organization , said dogu ergil , director of the foundation for the research of societal problems , which seeks to resolve conflicts in turkish society we turks think since we have captured him , we have gotten rid of the kurdish problem as well , which is not true
to the editor in his review of geoffrey perret s eisenhower \( oct 24 \) , david m kennedy writes that ulysses s grant behaved so badly in the white house that his countrymen , who in the republic s first century had elevated six generals to the presidency , waited nearly a century before taking a chance on another this is simply not true rutherford b hayes \( elected in 1876 \) was a major general who served under philip sheridan in the shenandoah campaign james a garfield \( elected in 1880 \) was a major general who served under george thomas at chickamauga his successor , chester a arthur , was a brigadier general who served as quartermaster general of the new york state militia in the civil war and benjamin harrison \( elected in 1888 \) was a brigadier general who served under joseph hooker in the atlanta campaign mike lion mclean , va david m kennedy replies my statement was in error , and i thank mike lion and other readers who called the matter to my attention hayes , garfield , arthur and harrison all held the rank of general during the civil war yet it might be noted that none was a career soldier moreover , hayes and harrison were brevetted generals , a largely honorary rank further , all four of these presidents served in the united states volunteers , where commissions originated with state governors , were often politically colored and were much easier to come by \( and lose \) than in the regular united states army in which ulysses grant served as illustrated by the case of chester arthur , commissioned by a republican governor and summarily stripped of his rank when a democrat took over the new york statehouse in 1863 in any case , i believe my basic point about the different requirements of military and political leadership still stands , though it would have been more accurate and would have caused less confusion had i said that the american people waited nearly a century after grant to elect another professional soldier \( eisenhower \) to the white house

plays with the bestknown shore musician , bruce springsteen mr rosenberg said the hubcaps consisted mostly of jukes who were not doing anything when he formed the band when we started , it was usually me convincing a club owner we had a band that played pop tunes , mr lyon said he 'd hire us , and then i 'd run to the upstage club in asbury park and whoever was there at the time became the band we used to call it 'the band of the week' if the sound that developed at the shore in the 70 s was unique , it was because you could play traditional blues and rockandroll at the same time , audiences were open to experimentation we mingled everybody s' styles one of the players on the asbury park scene was mr rosenberg , who is to lead the hubcaps through a set starting at noon saturday but said , i do n't know if i will be playing with the jukes he does so know , mr lyon countered when told of mr rosenberg s comment i intend to get up with them , and i hope some of them will join us we built a

inside the building now , we are going to take it to the streets and have the best new jersey artists there as well and appropriately so , mr lyon said there is a certain high standard that is traditional in new jersey music , from count basie to frank sinatra on down , he said everyone can switch around because everyone is good mr rosenberg agreed it works because there is such a large pool of great musicians to draw from , he said if someone does n't show up , it does n't fall apart , and it always adds a new dimension when you stand up there with someone else he and other members of the miami horns play in the band on late night with conan o'brien on nbc , now being led by jimmy vivino for the months when its regular leader , the drummer max weinberg , who plays in the e street band , is on tour with mr springsteen mr vivino played guitar with the jukes at the hardhat concert two years ago n o one will be surprised if joe grushecky jumps onstage to become a temporary member of the jukes or the hubcaps , if he is in town on saturday mr grushecky and his band , the iron city houserockers , are from pittsburgh , but they have as many jersey shore ties as anyone in

when cathleen scott agreed to be the cohost of the gala opening of william h johnson truth be told , at the montclair museum of art in montclair , nj , she expected johnson s art to be the show s principal draw ms scott , a member of the bibliophiles , one of three black organizations sponsoring the opening , had admired the africanamerican painter s work at a 1992 whitney museum of american art show and eagerly awaited the 54 objects that steve turner , a los angeles art dealer and independent scholar , had purchased from european collectors most of the works had not been previously exhibited in this country that was , however , before ms scott saw mr turner s catalogue my cochair called me up and said 'cathleen , you 've got to read this it s very provocative , ' ms scott recalled she was unprepared for an investigative report suggesting that , through mismanagement , not all of johnson s paintings are in the hands of their rightful owners no minor charge , considering that some of johnson s paintings are valued at more than 100 , 000 mr turner s starkest allegation has been leveled at david driskell , a professor at the university of maryland and the author of many books on africanamerican art history mr driskell was chairman of the art department at fisk university in the 1970 s , when , mr turner said , some of the 21 johnson pieces given by the national museum of american art \( then a branch of the smithsonian institution called the national collection of fine arts \) to fisk disappeared mr turner contends that only eight of the 21 works are at fisk today two of the missing ones have surfaced in mr driskell s personal collection mr driskell appears baffled by mr turner s charges the paintings , he said in a telephone interview , were given to him by the director of the foundation from which the smithsonian received them i have absolutely nothing to hide , he said and indeed , the two disputed johnson paintings are illustrated in a newly published book on driskell s collection , which has also been on exhibition recently mr driskell also took severe exception to the way mr turner characterized mr driskell s management style nobody deals with art that way , he said people act in good faith in those days , people did n't even send notices all the time if you go into my exhibition , you will find numerous works that have been given to me by artists in some cases , they just have written on there , 'for david' in some cases , they have letters in my files people of good will do those kinds of things but if you want to go out there and stir up some nonsense , you can always find a case for that sort of thing the catalogue , which mr turner wrote with victoria dailey , a californiabased art writer , provides a detailed provenance for each of the pieces in the montclair show \( on view through next sunday , then traveling to the arkansas art center in little rock , feb 4 to april 25 \) and offers a new perspective on the artist and how he came to be known in the last 30 years the works in the show range from painterly , expressionist canvases created in scandinavia to latecareer genre scenes of africanamericans rendered in flat , comicstrip colors my goal was to correct myths perpetuated by careless scholarship , mr turner said i wanted to recognize the artist s unacknowledged scandinavian collectors and provide a factual record of how his work ended up at the national museum of american art and other museums and how some works were missing altogether in his lifetime , johnson was ignored by the art world few would have predicted that he would be at the center of a hotly contested ownership wrangle born in florence , sc , in 1901 , johnson moved to new york in 1918 he studied at the prestigious national academy of design from 1921 to 1926 , winning , in 1929 , the gold medal of the william e harmon foundation , a new york citybased philanthropic organization that promoted the work of africanamerican artists in 1926 , he left for europe , where he met and married holcha krake , a danish textile artist , and the sisterinlaw of the german expressionist christoph voll the couple settled in kerteminde , a tiny danish fishing village in 1938 , alarmed by the rise of nazism in europe , johnson and his wife moved to new york city , where he was beset by bad luck his loft burned ,

the unnamed hurricane that slammed into the south shore of suffolk county on the afternoon of sept 21 , 1938 , with such force that it registered on a seismograph in sitka , alaska , is about to go into the record book as the long island storm of the century in the little time that remains , it is a record no one wants broken let s hope it stays that way , said david h fischler , the commissioner of fire rescue and emergency services for suffolk county , one of a number of government agencies bracing for a 1999 hurricane season that arrived this month amid ominous forecasts the 1938 hurricane , which took forecasters and residents by surprise , devastated eastern long island and then tore into new england , leaving nearly 700 dead in its wake many of the deaths were drownings resulting from the powerful storm surge accompanying the fastmoving hurricane in westhampton beach , which bore the brunt on long island , more than 150 summer homes were swept from the barrier island during a threehour siege that punched open the shinnecock inlet some survivors escaped death by clinging to blownoff rooftops and debris propelled by the storm surge over raging moriches bay to improbable landings on high land in places like the westhampton country club golf course several bodies followed the same route about 100 people died in new york state water in the village of westhampton beach , which is behind the barrier island , was more than seven feet deep for miles around and particularly in the area east of the hurricane s eye in eastern suffolk roofs lifted off , chimneys and church steeples toppled soundlessly in shrieking winds and trees crashed down on roads and houses , flattened by sustained winds from 90 to well above 100 miles an hour with long island untouched by a major hurricane since 1815 , many residents in 1938 had never heard of hurricanes those who had never expected one to hit so far north indeed , government forecasters , without radar or other modern monitoring devices , thought the storm had turned harmlessly out to sea after threatening miami and passing by cape hatteras instead , it drew a bead on long island , heading north at 50 to 60 miles an hour toward the unsuspecting south shore people that lived there had no warning , said wallace broege , director of the suffolk county historical society in riverhead it took them by complete surprise i ca n't imagine the horror of all of a sudden looking out your window and a hurricane is there nassau , on the lesspunishing western side of the eye , escaped with rain , wind , fallen trees and damage to homes including the j p morgan estate in glen cove , which was left in shambles but there was little to suggest the ferocity of the storm farther east in the years since , the 1938 storm has been the benchmark for the destructive force of hurricanes that annually threaten long island , and a reminder of what may yet come while better forecasting , emergency preparedness and forced evacuation from lowlying areas and barrier islands would be expected to keep deaths to a minimum , insurance companies say a storm identical to the 1938 hurricane would produce up to 18 billion in damage in the new york metropolitan area hurricane andrew produced 33 billion in damage , the highest amount ever for a hurricane , when it ravaged south florida in 1992 this season , a prediction by the hurricane forecasting expert william m gray of colorado state university issued in april and updated on june 4 anticipates 14 named storms including nine hurricanes and four intense hurricanes in the atlantic basin , which includes the east coast the historic average for the past 100 years is about nine named storms , including about six hurricanes dr gray estimated that there was a better than an even chance one or more of the intense hurricanes , meaning hurricanes rated a category 3 , 4 or 5 on the saffirsimpson scale , would make landfall somewhere in florida or on the east coast , a far higher probability than the century s oneinthree average in an address to government agencies earlier this month , michael e wyllie , the meteorologist in charge at the national weather service forecast office in upton , also sounded a warning mr wyllie said that five key atmospheric and aquatic factors cited by dr gray , including the impact of an unexpectedly enduring , watercooling la nina in the pacific , were aligned in a troubling way all the pointers are pointing toward a large number of storms in the atlantic basin , he said last week as living memory of the 1938 hurricane fades , weather service maps show in detail what might be expected if a category 4 hurricane , defined as a storm with sustained winds of 131 to 155 miles an hour , hit the south shore the 1938 hurricane , a category 5 with winds in excess of 155 mph in earlier phases , had become a category 3 storm with winds of 111 to 130 mph by the time it arrived unannounced on long island on a rising tide during equinox , factors that maximized storm surge meteorologists and emergency agencies say a category 3 hurricane is the strongest that can be expected on long island except in extraordinary weather circumstances
bridgehampton , ny if cindy adams were dishing this particular item , she might give it a new twist on her famous kicker only in the hampton , kids , only in the hamptons but ms adams , the gossip columnist for the new york post , has kept mum about the rumble on lumber lane , where she has a vacation house that has her neighbors in a snit it seems that in the four years she has owned the place , ms adams has built her property up and out , crowding it with structures that do not have the proper permits , surrounding herself with enormous hedges and attracting the kind of crowds that might make new yorkers envious , but here in the east end has the neighbors deploying lawyers and press releases we were trying to be tolerant , understanding neighbors , but it just reached the point where people on the street were concerned that this was changing the character of the street , said morris zand , the owner of a manhattan marketing firm and ms adams' nextdoor neighbor there are a lot of longtime residents who do n't want to see a very quiet , rural residential area turned into a kind of halfway house for group living , said arthur dipietro , a lawyer for another neighbor so the neighbors complained , and the complaints attracted the building inspector , and the inspector issued summonses the additions to her little house lacked the right permits , he found , and not only was the tiny artist s studio in the back too close to the rear property line , but it also appears that people are living in it , in violation of the street s singlefamily zoning this complaining is not unusual here zoning and land use issues are probably the dominant local issues in this town , said vincent connuscio , the supervisor of southampton township , which includes this hamlet and this is especially typical in the most affluent areas of town neighbors of the industrialist ira rennert , for example , are suing the southampton zoning board of appeals because it allowed him to build a vacation home about twice as big as the white house and harry macklowe , the builder , is still in a legal tussle with the design queen martha stewart over landscaping mr macklowe wanted for a common border , but to be fair , that s in east hampton , not here we have enough tsuris without that one , mr connuscio said like those cases , most property fights here on the east end tend to be among people so rich and so famous that they have long since discarded any thought that they might one day lose an argument , mr connuscio suggested , and so the hostilities tend to be confined to the properties south of the highway , to use the local term for the highrent district but while it is true that ms adams is high profile enough to have her own fragrance gossip , by coty her modest compound is on the north side of route 27 and hard against the long island rail road s single track to montauk it does not seem like the kind of place for a bigname faceoff , but it is on an emotional level , people are offended by the fact that there is a kind of heavyhanded arrogance about it , mr dipietro said , with absolutely none of the kind of communication with the community where you say , 'hey , this is what we want to do , and would you mind \? ' ms adams had been summoned before the zoning board of appeals but she sent a lawyer instead she did not answer messages left for her at the post , and her lawyer , deirdre venables , did not respond to messages in the local papers , however , ms venables has been quoted as saying that ms adams assumed the builders knew what they were doing , and she has requested variances for her transgressions another hearing is set for next month richard hendrickson , a farmer who has just been told that under the law , only one of two houses he owns on a piece of land may be occupied , is in no mood to cut ms adams any slack he is still raising spring crops on a twoacre plot adjoining the gossip columnist s property , but he would like to subdivide the land one day , and with ms adams' studio so close to his property he thinks his land is worth less a variance for the studio \? i think she should cut about 10 feet off of it , he said
of all the gifts possessed by that supreme jackofallshowbusiness trades , sir noel coward , none surpassed his gift for friendship although sir noel expressed a wistful pessimism when it came to his love life , his deep and abiding friendships were another matter on wednesday evening at carnegie hall , where the cream of the cabaret world gathered to celebrate his centennial , the reminiscences and excerpts from diaries and letters that poured from the stage created an affectionate portrait of the legendary sophisticate whom edward albee , the evening s opening speaker , described as resembling james bond s gay uncle among many other facts about sir noel , we learned that he was n't at all religious and that \( according to elaine stritch \) when facing death his greatest fear was that he would n't be remembered he had longlasting romantic relationships , but as he wrote in verses read by andrea marcovicci , he did n't really believe in enduring passion and even at the beginning of a relationship found himself obsessed with how it would end but the focus of the nearly threeandahalfhour show , presided over by diana rigg and the coward biographer sheridan morley , was sir noel s extraordinary output of songs these could be generally divided into three groups there were the sentimental ballads , which ran from lilting operettastyle waltzes to gungho , patriotic singalongs and made sir noel the 1930 s and 40 s equivalent of paul mccartney in popularity on a higher artistic level were a handful of introspective gems , like the selfdeprecating and autobiographical if love were all \( exquisitely sung by barbara cook \) , in which sir noel observed that his talent to amuse was as much a curse as a blessing but most of his best songs were his witty , sometimes ribald patter songs postgilbert and sullivanstyle light verses that had the biting effervescence of dazzling party talk the singer and pianist steve ross , the ultimate contemporary embodiment of a cowardesque suavity , delivered a definitive mrs worthington the show demonstrated that he could write deftly in almost any style of his era and that he even developed his own starchy variation of the blues \( 20thcentury blues , sung by karen akers \) but his songwriting talent only sporadically yielded songs equal in stature to the best work of his american peers cole porter , the composer with whom sir noel is most frequently compared , far surpassed him in rhythmic dexterity , harmonic audacity and melodic invention nor does most sir noel stand up beside the best of berlin , gershwin , arlen , and rodgers given these limitations , there was still plenty to celebrate on wednesday among the outstanding nonmusical performances , lynn redgrave s hilarious monologue recollecting her experiences working in a 1964 production of hay fever with maggie smith and dame edith evans took the prize on the musical side , high points included a dark , sultry performance of mad about the boy by paula west , a rising cabaret singer from san francisco , and mary cleere haran s heartbreaking version of this is a changing world , a wistful waltz from the flop show pacific 1860 ms stritch squeezed every drop of comic juice from why do the wrong people travel \? and michael feinstein crooned a beautifully conceived homage to sir noel s rendition of someday i 'll find you there were also a number of fizzles , the most glaring being sian phillips s lifeless impersonation of marlene dietrich singing a cole porter song \( the laziest gal in town \) the evening was padded with far too much chirpy vaudevillian filler but as ms stritch exulted , the show demonstrated that sir noel s terror of fading into obscurity has yet to be realized in a hiphop world , there is a still a place for his brand of wit , charm and courtliness photo sian phillips as marlene dietrich on wednesday at carnegie hall richard termine for the new york times \) \( pg b13 \)
paris i'm straddling two chairs , says ea sola , just back in paris , when asked where she considers home the daughter of a vietnamese father and a frenchborn polishhungarian mother , ms sola grew up in lam dong , in the high plateaus of southcentral vietnam she was born near the beginning of the vietnam war , though she refuses to reveal the year when i was 12 , i already found the question of age obscene , she says in her low , deliberate voice living through all that i had by that age , i could have responded , '40' her childhood was overshadowed by a war she calls effroyable appalling in french and the word pours bitterly , painfully out of her mouth her father was a a member of the vietcong night after night her parents told her to fall asleep not by counting sheep but bomb blasts in 1974 , ms sola and two siblings were taken from vietnam to thailand , where her mother sought medical treatment four years later ms sola arrived in paris , alone , and still declines to discuss her life during that period the city was a shock i had grown up in the forest , in a universe of beauty , she says suddenly everything was immense the people , the streets , the buildings , the system of life were unrecognizable destitute and homeless , she dreamed of vietnam , tried to imagine what it was like at peace and then , as if to say , i am here , i am me , and i am not like you , she started to stand motionless in the street , day after day , for six , seven hours at a time i needed to revolt , to save myself , ms sola explains it was a surprising experience i learned to control my body , and as i watched the reactions of those around me , i learned how to manage space , rhythm , tension one day a group of artists approached her and told her she was creating performance art ms sola started studying a variety of dance and movement styles , from butoh \( with min tanaka \) to theater workshops with disciples of jerzy grotowski in the mid80 s she formed a butohinspired dance company and performed on the street throughout europe it disturbed her that vietnam was culturally absent from the international scene , that war and spring rolls were all people seemed to know about the country she applied for a grant at the french ministry of foreign affairs , for a project to go back home and mount a production serge francois , then in charge of artistic grants abroad , recalls she was uprooted from her culture and a little adrift as a dancer , experimenting with this and that nobody was interested in her project but she told me about it with so much emotion , i decided we had to help her in 1989 , ms sola arrived to see vietnam at peace for the first time in her memory her voice drops to a whisper as she remembers her shock it was black , miserable , she says the embargo had taken everything she was burning with curiosity to know more about her culture , and for the first time she visited the north , the cradle of vietnamese civilization when i was a child , she recalled , some people from the region came down south and sang for us for me , that was life for three years she lived among the northern people , mostly peasants , searching out those who remembered the village dances before the war , and then the communist regime , put an end to such celebrations the tradition in many villages had been that only virgins danced , passing on their knowledge once they married now the sole women who recalled the steps were the last ones who had danced them , at least 30 years earlier ms sola asked these women , who ranged in age from 50 to nearly 80 , whether they wanted to create a work that spoke of their experiences though none had ever performed onstage , they accepted immediately and enthusiastically the choreographer held auditions and made a first selection of 25 i had to reduce their number to 14 , she says it was horrible i took one woman aside and said , 'i'm sorry , it s not possible , your health' tears came to her eyes , and she replied 'i'm part of this group if i'm sick , take me for tests and i 'll go home or give me one more chance just two more weeks' in those two weeks she convinced me ultimately , she was magnificent with this group ms sola created secheresse et pluie \( drought and rain \) , a contemporary piece inspired by traditional music and culture breathtaking and simple , it was a work about memory and the war the women swayed and shuffled across the stage , bending over in sweeping motions learned from the rice fields , leaning back like reeds in the wind to the roar of percussion they brandished photos of the husbands , brothers and sons now gone it was a remarkable work about war and loss , says mr francois one without equivalent it made ea sola s name overnight one of her early admirers was dominique fretard , dance editor for the french daily le monde , who later followed the choreographer back to ho chi minh city she says sola was not just compensating for her own exile she has revived the memory , the forgotten traditions , of an entire people at the same time , her interpretation is thoroughly contemporary ms sola presented secheresse et pluie in europe in 1995 and then toured for two years she showed the piece in vietnam , to a mixed reaction of admiration and suspicion the simple concept of modern artistic creation was foreign , and some critics were insulted by her portrayal of the country s pain but her supporters in vietnam included the vice minister of culture , and she has since established a following there secheresse et pluie also made a stop at the spoleto festival in south carolina in 1996 that was very emotional for me , ms sola recalls i looked into the audience and saw many white heads , and several people crying as for the performers , they were just happy to be in america they were n't at all bitter the past is the past nigel redden , the festival s general director , has asked the choreographer to open this year s lincoln center festival , which he also directs , with her third and most recent creation , voila voila \( there you have it \) he thinks her work will interest new york audiences because , he says , the starting point is so different from dance and theater in the west ms sola brought voila voila from vietnam to europe this spring the final work in her cycle on tradition and modernity , it is performed by professional musicians , 40 to 70 years old from the north , who incorporate movement in their work the piece draws upon three different musical traditions , including two 13thcentury opera forms , the rural cheo and the chineseinspired , royal tuong against an abstract decor resembling endless rows of rice paddies , the women sing in rich , nasal twangs , their notes floating and jumping , slicing through the air their feet glide in tiny steps , their hands flutter , they hold their palms gingerly aloft like offerings their fragile movements range from spasmodic to sensuous there are moments when the choreographer tests her audience s patience , as in a gathering where the performers chat together in vietnamese , taken from an ancestral tradition where villagers exchanged ideas in the form of poetry at other times , the work reaches out with an unexpected power , the drums onstage beating and intensifying like a pulse with voila voila , ms sola uses tradition to explore a nascent sense of liberty it is in anonymity that one finds freedom , she explains , to lock one s door at night , to travel overseas this is the first time in history that the vietnamese people have been so free photos members of ea sola s company performing voila voila in paris the work is to open lincoln center festival '99 \( john giannini for the new york times \) ea sola s company in secheresse et pluie at the 1996 spoleto festival in charleston , sc \( wade spees the post and courier \) ea sola during a rehearsal of voila voila at the theatre de l'hotel de ville in paris \( john

for those who tirelessly warn that the economic boom is a bubble overdue to burst , these must seem like perilous days last week , worries about inflation and possible interestrate increases sent stock prices into their biggest swoon in a decade in what some noted was the week before the anniversary of the infamous black monday of 1987 when stocks rebounded this week , after consumer prices showed only a modest increase , there was talk of volatility but the doomsayers are looking for signs of disaster where none exist the american economy has performed better in the 1990 s than at any time in history , and there is no end of that success in sight the bubble theory rests on arguments that the stock market is overvalued , americans are not saving and the trade deficit is at a dangerous level assets are said to have become overvalued , leading to overconsumption and an overheating of the economy that will inevitably end in a violent correction a stock market crash but this argument will not stand up to a careful analysis the pessimists' misinterpretations begin with stock prices , which have indeed grown rapidly even after a 10 percent correction in the past two months , stocks in the companies that make up the standard poor s 500 index are trading , on average , at more than 24 times their 1999 operating earnings per share nearrecord levels however , values are highest in the sector where growth prospects are highest and demand is accelerating technology with the technology stocks excluded , the priceearnings ratio for the rest of the companies in the index is around 19 adjusted for interest rates , that s comfortably in line with the experience of the past few decades some analysts also think they see a real estate bubble a dangerous trend if it were real who can forget japan s bubble economy of the 1980 s , when the grounds of the imperial palace were supposedly worth as much as california \? but in the united states , mortgage borrowing has been relatively weak in the 1990 s and , despite dizzying prices in pockets like manhattan and silicon valley , the national median price of existing homes rose just 45 percent a year the negative national savings rate is another fiction the official savings rate has plunged from 5 percent at the end of the 1980 s to minus15 percent now , leading alarmists to say that americans are on a spending binge fueled by rising asset prices and excessive borrowing but the figures are flawed wage income has actually grown faster than consumer spending during the past several years and while total income grew more slowly than spending because interest and dividend income grew slowly during the 1990 s , that weak growth was more than offset by the rise in the value of stocks the official calculations of the savings rate do not count capital gains income though americans who pay taxes on it can attest that it is quite real when it is included , the savings rate is 8 percent as for the trade deficit , it is indeed at a record level , but it doubled during the past two years because weak growth in the rest of the world hurt american exports now the world economy is recovering in september , export orders rose to the highest level in 30 months what the unprecedented performance of the american economy in this decade really reflects is a revolution in productivity productivity grew during the past five years at double the pace of the prior 25 years that is what allowed the economy to grow by more than 4 percent last year while the core inflation rate dropped by half a percentage point and the unemployment rate was stable the economy may have to slow a bit now to keep the fed happy but although the united states will undoubtedly have a recession someday , do n't look for it anytime soon drawing \( maris bishofs \)
the date was july 19 , 1982 , and the cincinnati reds were playing the padres in san diego the reds had a first baseman named pete rose the padres had a rookie center fielder , tony gwynn he was playing in his first major league game in his first three times at bat , gwynn did n't get a hit , but in the eighth inning , he lined a pitch from sid monge into the leftcenterfield gap for a double rose is trailing the play , gwynn recalled vividly yesterday they flash on the board , 'tony gwynn s first big league hit' he shook my hand and congratulated me and said , 'do n't catch me after one night' i thought , boy , would n't it be great to have a career like his , to be able to do some of the things that he was able to do four years earlier , rose had collected his 3 , 000th hit from that day on , gwynn said , i felt if i was going to be as good as i thought i could be that s where i had to get to so for me , being this close to it is a real kick when the season began , gwynn needed 72 hits to reach 3 , 000 he has hit so well in the early weeks that if someone nods off , he might miss the magic hit in the padres' first 19 games , he has amassed 29 hits \( none against the mets at shea stadium last night \) for a 397 average wade boggs and cal ripken , the other two players within striking distance of 3 , 000 when the season began , have not fared as well boggs , with 15 hits in the devil rays' 20 games , needs 63 hits ripken , with only five hits and a spot on the disabled list , is 117 away from the plateau that only 21 players have reached at the rate gwynn is hitting , he will take his place in the ultraselect circle before the end of may and he will do it with no false modesty he has long wanted this , and he will relish every second of the experience when he slaps no 3 , 000 to left field for a single , or whatever the hit is it s been a goal of mine for a long time , he said , sitting at his locker hours before the mets' game , already engaging in his second long interview of the day with more to come if there s a select circle for words , the amiable gwynn joined it a long time ago my first day in the big leagues i thought , 'hey , maybe i can get there , ' he said no question it feels good throughout my career i 've had people who doubted that i could get there , that i could be healthy enough to get there , whether my body type was going to allow me to get there the first 2 , 957 hits , gwynn said , have required longevity , consistency and will i 've had a passion to go out and play and do the things that i felt i could do , he said even today that has n't changed i still have passion for the game i still love to prepare and do all the other stuff i do on the verge of joining rose and the others , gwynn described his feeling as kind of a chest stuck out , yeah , i'm going to get there type of thing it s going to be a big deal for me , he said the right fielder , who will be 39 years old on may 9 , is proudest of two elements of his hitfilled 18year career he has played it entirely with one team , and he has got all of his hits in the national league , where , he noted , a player ca n't rest occasionally as the designated hitter it s a big thrill to be the first one to do it in the national league since lou brock , he said brock reached 3 , 000 in 1979 carl yastrzemski , rod carew , robin yount , george brett , dave winfield , eddie murray and paul molitor have followed all or most of their hits came in the american league , some of them as designated hitters not that gwynn has anything against being a designated hitter he said he would definitely consider serving in that role if the padres want to end his career with them before he is ready to end it loyalty is a twoway street , said gwynn , whose contract ends after next season they got to want you you got to want to stay i think they know where i'm coming from i'm not sure where they 're coming from i 'd like to finish my career in a padres uniform i think they would like me to , but when is going to be the question only once , gwynn said , has he considered leaving the padres , and that was after the 1993 season , when the team jettisoned its highpriced players and started over with youngsters his father , he recalled , urged him to ask to be traded , but he resisted , deciding san diego was where he belonged but theirs became an unfinished argument he died a couple days later , never really giving me a chance to explain to him why i decided to stay , gwynn said charles gwynn , 61 , took ill that winter , his son explained , the flu leading to a massive and fatal heart attack in the intervening years , the son has made certain to include the father in his experiences , good and bad periodically , tony gazes skyward and has a onesided conversation last year in the world series , gwynn related , i'm standing out in right field at yankee stadium before they came to bat in the first inning looking up to the sky i know people were wondering what s he looking at it all my years in the big leagues i dreamed about playing at yankee stadium i told my dad , 'if you could be here , i know you would have loved seeing this place because it s awesome' there were times , too , last year , he said , when he looked up and told his father he stunk he added , i do n't hear words coming back , but i imagine what he would be saying he certainly knows what his father would say about the impending celebration in his career being there for 3 , 000 , he would really have a kick , gwynn said i told him early on that s what i wanted to do he told me if you work hard enough you can get there there have n't been a lot of believers that i could get there , but he was one he would really have gotten a kick out of it but charles gwynn will not miss out when it happens as soon as gwynn gets to first base , he will look skyward the conversation will be worth hearing photo after last night s game against the mets , tony gwynn , batting in the first , needs 43 hits to reach no 3 , 000 \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
it was a couch potato s dream the announcement , three years ago , that the mayo clinic was looking for volunteers willing to overeat for the sake of science they would have to not only eat 1 , 000 extra calories a day for eight weeks , in the form of favorite foods lusciously prepared by expert cooks , but also make the added sacrifice of just lounging around , refraining from exercise thousands of people , from ireland , germany , canada and even california , polished their forks and answered the call but only 16 were chosen , as planned , and all were from rochester , minn , home of the clinic their mission was to help researchers answer one of life s more vexing questions why is it that some people can eat virtually all they want and stay thin , while others get fatter with every cookie they swallow \? the answer , the researchers were surprised to find , is that when people eat too much , some of them the lucky ones burn off extra calories by starting to fidget the added activity is touched off somehow by the excess of food , and the fidgeters do not even realize they are doing it although the researchers described this moving around as fidgeting , they said they were not sure precisely what it entailed it may include things that most people would call fidgeting , like shifting position in their seats at work , crossing and uncrossing their legs and sitting up straighter to maintain their posture but it may also include behavior closer to real exercise , like getting up to stretch or going to the water fountain or the lavatory we did n't have fidget monitors , so i ca n't be certain it s what you 'd call fidgeting , said one of the researchers , dr michael jensen , an endocrinologist at the mayo clinic but we 're convinced it s something about physical activity a report on the study is being published today in the journal science dr jensen s coauthors were dr norman eberhardt and dr james levine , also endocrinologists at the mayo clinic none of the participants who enrolled in the study were obese half said they thought they were resistant to weight gain , and half said they had a normal tendency to put on a few pounds if they ate too much women , shunning the menace to their hips , proved difficult to recruit , although 4 finally did sign up , along with 12 men dr levine said he and his colleagues had expected the study to find that some of the subjects simply had a higher rate of metabolism than others , or shifted to a higher rate when they ate too much , and so burned off the extra calories rather than storing them as fat but that was not the case , according to the researchers' extraordinarily precise measurements of the calories the subjects ate , the calories they burned and the calories they turned to fat for two weeks , the subjects were studied to determine exactly how many calories a day they needed to maintain their regular weight in the absence of all exercise then dietitians consulted with each of them to plan menus incorporating 1 , 000 extra calories a day in foods they would enjoy for the following eight weeks , the volunteers , though living at home , ate most of their meals at the clinic they had hamburgers , steaks , pancakes , sausages , yogurt , spaghetti , said one of them , kelly pitts , a graduate student in biochemistry at the clinic asked if he himself had eaten all those foods , mr pitts laughed and said yes , he had one subject , dr jensen said , took most of his extra calories in pizza by dr levine s design , the subjects consented to be spied on by secretly appointed relatives and coworkers who were prepared to tattle if a volunteer cheated by going for a bike ride or a swim they were also grilled via questionnaire about all their activities , though dr jensen said that as best he could recall , the questions had not extended to sex we 're still fairly shy here in the midwest , he said in the clinic dining room , researchers hovered over the subjects to make sure they cleaned their plates from time to time , dr levine himself took their trash home to his garage and pawed through it to find out whether they had thrown away so much as a green bean they were tested like automobile engines to see how efficiently they metabolized the food they were eating no calorie went unaccounted for the fat content of their bodies was measured with exceptional precision , by a special xray machine calibrated with a sixpound block of human fat left over from someone s plastic surgery even the subjects' stool and urine were confiscated , to become the property of the mayo clinic this was a grossout study in every sense of the word , dr levine said after eight weeks of being overfed , the subjects , not surprisingly , had put on an average of 10 pounds , and most of them reported feeling bloated and sluggish much of the time but the gain of weight ranged markedly , from 3 pounds to nearly 16 when the researchers calculated where all the calories had gone taking into account all the metabolic and other precise data they concluded by process of elimination that the only possible explanation for the difference from one person to the next was physical activity and since the subjects were assumed to have complied with the ban on deliberate exercise like running , swimming or even walking , all that remained was what the researchers termed nonexercise activity thermogenesis they found that it increased more in some people than in others when they ate too much and those in whom it increased the most gained the least weight one subject burned off more than 600 calories a day in this fashion , with an amount of unknown activity that the researchers said would be the equivalent of strolling for 15 minutes in each waking hour the four women in the study had the smallest increases in the nonexercise thermogenesis , and correspondingly large weight gains the researchers did not know what to make of this , and said a larger study would be needed , designed specifically to detect malefemale differences within a few months of returning to their normal lives , all the subjects had lost the weight they had gained during the study , dr jensen said , adding that none needed medical help to do so , though it had been offered as part of the experiment now , dr jensen said , researchers will have to figure out why some people fidget in response to too much food we could n't find anything that would predict it or tell us , he said we 're going to have to start over and work back to find out what regulates it meanwhile , he said , the message of the study is that every little bit of activity counts , even if it does n't seem like much dr george blackburn , an associate professor of surgery at harvard medical school and associate director of nutrition at beth israel deaconess medical center in boston , said the study was extremely well done and convincing , and the research team first class but , he cautioned , people who are not fidgeters by nature should not imagine that they can transform themselves real fidgeters are born , not made , he said , adding , i'm not even sure that these people do n't fidget in bed but he supported the idea that people should get up , move around more and exercise daily , if only in ways that do not require a trip to the gym , like taking the stairs instead of an escalator and parking the car in a spot that will require a bit of walking do n't be a zombie , he said
for all the differences between hillary rodham clinton and rudolph w giuliani , none may be more important than this the democratic first lady is assured the support of her party if she runs for senate next year but the republican mayor faces the prospect of a complicated primary , fought in front of republican voters who have long been wary of him the huge interest stirred by the prospect of a clintongiuliani race has clouded mr giuliani s sometimes difficult history with his party and its leaders , and the ways in which he might be vulnerable , for ideological and geographical reasons , in a republican primary a reminder that his nomination would not be a foregone conclusion came yesterday as representative rick a lazio , a long island republican , prepared for a week of appearances before republican audiences upstate , where he will discuss his own interest in the senate seat held by daniel patrick moynihan , a democrat retiring after four terms mr giuliani , unlike mrs clinton , remains an unsteady figure in his own party , notwithstanding his evident political success an array of influential party leaders starting with gov george e pataki and including alfonse m d'amato , the former senator have battled mr giuliani for years , and many republicans say the governor and the former senator are tacitly backing mr lazio s bid mr giuliani s success in positioning himself for an election where democrats have a millionvote edge moderate on some issues , and conservative on others could complicate any republican primary the mayor , for example , was one of the few republicans who defended president clinton during impeachment proceedings , and he opposed a ban on some forms of lateterm abortions mr giuliani s position on both issues runs counter to the strong sentiments of the generally conservative republicans who are likely to vote in a primary by contrast , mr lazio voted for mr clinton s impeachment and has supported a ban on the lateterm abortion procedure party strategists said it was clear that voters in mr giuliani s political power base of new york city would have nowhere near the dominance in a statewide republican primary that they would in a democratic primary or , to a lesser extent , in statewide elections mr giuliani s advisers are counting on his strong standing in the city to help him overcome a statewide democratic edge in a primary , however , he could find himself facing a candidate from the suburbs who could erase any geographic advantage mr giuliani hoped to have by any measure , mr giuliani has to be viewed as a dominant figure in any republican primary he is well known , has demonstrated an overwhelming ability to raise campaign funds and has run new york city at a time when crime has dropped while the economy has boomed mr giuliani s advisers asserted yesterday that they were not concerned about the prospect of a tough primary race if he decides to run for the senate , recalling that he had won two primaries for mayor i do n't see a republican issue against him , said peter j powers , the mayor s political adviser when you look at what the republican party stands for lower taxes , lower spending , fighting crime he has stood for all of those things but other supporters of mr giuliani were a bit more concerned about how he might fare in a republican primary the main concern is that the candidacy of a rival like mr lazio a poised and articulate 41yearold , fourterm congressman could turn into a rallying point for upstate republicans wary of some of mr giuliani s more liberal positions , from supporting rent regulation to backing gay rights , as well as the mayor s frequently gruff manner further complicating the outlook is the prospect that mr pataki and mr d'amato might support a subterranean campaign against mr giuliani , encouraging supporters or contributors to back mr lazio or saying things that could undercut mr giuliani s standing mr lazio said yesterday that both mr pataki and mr d'amato had offered him counsel as he considered his future career they have been helpful and generous with their advice and in sharing their experiences , mr lazio said and i am comfortable running on some of the same issues that pataki has run on , including tax relief , protecting the environment and quality of life issues zenia mucha , the governor s senior adviser , said that as a rule , mr pataki stayed out of others' primary races it is imperative that new york elect a republican senator , she said we will work on behalf of the republican nominee , who we are certain will be a candidate who embraces republican principles and will be able to win in recent days , a number of state republican leaders with ties to the governor have spoken up for mr pataki , while blaming mr giuliani for the offandon political feud between the two leaders the concern i get and i'm getting this from the other western new york county chairman that i work with is this feud does n't make sense , said robert e davis , the chairman of the erie county republican party everybody is concerned about what s going on george pataki helped rebuild the republican party many republican leaders are quick to recall mr giuliani s support of mario m cuomo , the democratic incumbent , against mr pataki in the 1994 race for governor all of which could make it easy for mr pataki to complicate mr giuliani s attempt to line up the support of the party s apparatus mrs clinton is not alone among potential candidates in the democratic field representative nita d lowey of westchester is also interested in the nomination but ms lowey has said she would step aside if the first lady ran photos representative rick a lazio greeting supporters on a recent syracuse visit ,

bidding erupted over a trove of treasures looted by the nazis and returned to the rothschild family this year by the austrian government prized frans hals portraits , an illuminated medieval prayer book and a louis xvi royal commode were among the highlights that attracted recordshattering bids for the more than 200 lots , holdings from the austrian branch of the great banking family the sale jammed christie s great hall to overflow , with many members of other branches of the rothschild family present and bidding , officials at the auction house said virtually every item sold , most for more than their estimated prices expected to bring in 40 million , the sale totaled 899 million as it reached its exhausting ending a spokesman for christie s said 10 records were set five for old

extraordinary sums of money in one evening attracting the attention were the glittering contents of the family palaces originally belonging to the brothers albert and nathaniel von rothschild in southwest austria they had acquired a staggering variety of holdings from the declining monarchs and aristocrats of 19thcentury europe the brothers were connoisseurs and passionate collectors who personified the opulence of findesiecle vienna but the family s holdings were seized by the nazis during the german anschluss in 1938 when surviving members tried to retrieve their possessions after the war , the austrian government allowed them to leave the country with only a portion of what they owned , citing an export law , similar to those in other european countries , that forbade the movement of many treasured works out of the country many of them were hung in vienna s great museums the rothschilds and other families said they agreed to leave their works only under duress in announcing her intention to return the possessions , the austrian culture minister , elisabeth gehrer , said last year that she wanted to rectify what she termed immoral decisions at the end of the war she ran into criticism from some austrians who viewed the postwar agreements as legitimate and also argued that the valuable art works belonged not in a private collection but in public view saying their holdings had been vastly reduced , in part because of wartime destruction by the nazis , family members decided to auction the holdings after they were removed from the museums and released to them this year present today was the baroness bettina de rothschild , the matriarch of the austrian branch , who watched the sale on a closedcircuit television monitor from a private

washington , july 15 an internal justice department report has found that the fbi and federal prosecutors mishandled highly classified intelligence on accusations that china improperly tried to influence american elections an unclassified summary of the inspector general s report , which was released on wednesday , found that fbi officials were at first reluctant to share raw intelligence with campaign finance prosecutors , senior justice department officials and lawmakers who demanded the information as part of their own investigations later , the report said , justice department officials provided too much unverified intelligence to lawmakers , fearing that attorney general janet reno and her subordinates could be criticized by republicans if they failed to turn over information that might be considered relevant to a congressional inquiry the inspector general s report found that none of the missteps amounted to an intentional effort to mislead or interfere with any investigation instead , it said , the failures stemmed from institutional inertia , poor communication and a reluctance to share classified information with criminal prosecutors for fear of compromising intelligence sources ms reno said today that she was reading the report but added that she had found no evidence that the justice department s campaign finance investigation had been damaged by the problems uncovered by the inspector general s review michael r bromwich , the inspector general , concluded that the actions of the fbi and the justice department reflected an absence of clearcut standards about how much information to supply to outsiders in the case of the department , the report said , the distribution of sensitive information of dubious quality potentially endangered criminal investigations and could have violated the constitutional rights of people under scrutiny the report drew no conclusions about whether the problems in handling classified information had had any impact on investigations conducted by the justice department or congress the inquiries examined accusations that china had a plan to influence american elections in 1996 , when asianamerican fundraisers engaged in intensive efforts to find contributors for the clintongore reelection effort
evanston , ill taking on one of the most troublesome and contentious issues in american education , school officials and educators around the nation have begun discussing why the academic achievement of black middleclass and upperincome students lags behind whites of comparable socioeconomic status on some tests , black students from middleclass or wealthier families have done no better than white students who live in poverty and some especially puzzling data have suggested that at higher achievement levels , the gap between black and white performance is wider than at lower levels for example , an analysis of 1995 sat scores , the most recent such analysis available , showed that students of all races did better if their parents had more education but blacks whose parents had at least one graduate degree averaged 191 points lower than whites whose parents had the same amount of education , while blacks whose parents had no high school diploma averaged 137 points behind whites whose parents had none school officials and black education experts are increasingly troubled by the gap how do we explain the underproductivity of middleclass kids , of able and gifted minority youngsters who come out of situations where you would expect high achievement \? asked edmund w gordon , a professor emeritus of psychology at yale university and the cochairman of the national task force on minority high achievement , formed in 1997 by the college board this is not something that a lot of people feel comfortable talking about in one of the most closely watched efforts in education circles , more than a dozen middleclass , racially integrated communities across the country , including evanston , and two in the new york metropolitan area white plains , and south orangemaplewood , nj have formed a network to learn more about the disparity and try to do something about it they will scrutinize what happens in schools and classrooms , and will also look at research on the home lives , study habits , and attitudes of black students in evanston , a comfortable , attractive community just north of chicago , venessa woods has a firsthand look at the problem ms woods , who runs a high school program to help minority students do better , keeps coming across black students from stable , educated , middleclass families who have fallen behind despite seeming to have all the ingredients for success the first thing that came to my head is 'oh , they 're poor' or 'oh , they 're in a singleparent home , ' said ms woods , who is africanamerican to my surprise , the students were living in the better part of evanston students were living with twoparent families who have college degrees they have computers they have personal tutors and they 're getting c s and d s , and why \? nobody claims to have clear answers but from conversations with teachers , students , researchers and parents , the reasons seem to be multilayered , going beyond a student s socioeconomic status to include lingering racial inferiority complexes , peer pressure , low teacher expectations , curriculum , parental involvement and access to information , and vestiges of racism in schools some of the most compelling insights come from students like akilah rogers , who just completed her junior year at evanston township high school taking advanced placement and accelerated classes , and helped organize a day of student discussion about minority achievement this spring i would say that the most africanamericans in one of my honors classes is three , said akilah , who is 17 early on , she said , people were like , 'oh , you 're an oreo' getting good grades was always connected to white people so they 're like , 'are you going to be white and achieve \? ' in chicago suburb , numbers defy logic the 14 schools in the network are mostly topnotch , with high perpupil spending , many middleclass families and diverse student populations at these schools , middleclass blacks typically perform better than poor blacks and often score above the national and state average for africanamericans many are in university towns like berkeley , calif , chapel hill , nc , and amherst , mass but they still perform worse on average than whites these are areas in the country where you would think you would get people being high achievers , but it s not happening to the degree it should , said allan alson , superintendent of evanston s high school , who is concerned about what schools like his should be doing differently at evanston , 42 percent of the high school s 2 , 900 students are black and while there is poverty here about 30 percent of the students , mostly blacks , receive free or reducedprice lunches there is also a solid black middle class evanston provides afterschool , summer and weekend programs for struggling students , and honors and advanced placement courses are open to any student who wants to enroll still , the numbers at evanston have been disappointing a study of the first semester of the 19971998 school year found that nearly 25 percent of black students had failed at least one class , compared with 4 percent of white students seven percent of black students' grades were a s , compared with 25 percent for whites
stella ! glug , glug , glug stella ! that s the sound of stanley kowalski s immortal mating call , as delivered from an overflowing bathtub the ragged cry , which can be heard in ivo van hove s new production of tennessee williams s streetcar named desire at the new york theater workshop , is a lot more adenoidal and scratchy than the famous bulllike bellow of marlon brando so when this stanley s head is plunged under water and held there by a justifiably irritated neighbor , you may feel like cheering here at last is retribution for five noisy decades of secondrate kowalski interpreters and brando impersonators and that is about as close to catharsis as this rattling deconstruction of williams s masterwork comes mr van hove , a dutch director famed for his iconoclastic takes on classics , has chosen to create a streetcar with none , but none , of the niceties and illusions that the play s besieged heroine , blanch dubois , lives by although williams s text is basically intact , the production itself is all about stripping down both to the thematic bones of the play and to fullfrontal nudity by the three leading actors you should also know that stanley \( played here by bruce mckenzie \) is not the only character to spend time in the company of sudsy water and a rubber duck stella \( jenny bacon \) , stanley s eversmitten wife , finds sexual bliss in that same tub , while you ca n't keep her visiting sister , blanche \( elizabeth marvel \) , out of the darn thing at one point , she even flops into it fully clothed and head first , to reemerge looking like a swamp monster if this production , which i will always think of as a bathtub named desire , sounds like an antic , outlandish hoot , it really is n't mr van hove , who played similar \( and marginally more illuminating \) tricks with eugene o'neill s more stately mansions two seasons ago , has the severe logic of the steely literature teacher who parses works of art into diagrams there is a reason , for instance , for the dominance of that bathtub mr van hove sees the play , with its clash between the fantasist blanche and the realist stanley , as an elemental war waged between water and fire it is the description of an inevitable process of destruction , he writes in an introductory program note this is not out of keeping with what williams himself wrote about streetcar , and you do not feel , as you often do with deconstructionists , that mr van hove is imposing unwarranted meanings nor , unfortunately , is he providing anything in the way of fresh insights , unless you count a scrawny , charismafree stanley as a revelation set on a sparsely furnished stage defined by stark grids of light \( the production designer is jan versweyveld \) , with ominously dissonant music by harry de wit , this streetcar wallows in the obvious blanche , that noted hater of naked light bulbs , keeps to the shady part of the stage , and when she is dragged out of it , she screams like a vampire at sunrise stella , on the other hand , basks crucifixstyle on her back in a square of bright light after satisfying sex with stanley when early in the evening stanley says he is rifling through blanche s legal papers , mr mckenzie instead brutally frisks ms marvel s body like a wouldbe rapist , turning the real rape later in the play into a muffled afterthought and when mitch \( christopher evan welch \) , stanley s awkward , gentle pal , is first introduced to blanche , she does a provocative shimmy in black lingerie to show what is really going on in her head beneath the polite small talk just how necessary is this \? it does n't require heavy labor to expose the sexual elements of streetcar a nude , explicitly coital version of , say , a somerset maugham drawing room comedy would at least generate some novelty to apply the approach to streetcar is to be as crude as stanley himself it is n't the primal , universal conflict that gives this drama its greatness as much as the way williams translated that conflict into vividly particular characters and , with one exception , those characters are n't to be found in mr van hove s production that merciful exception is ms marvel s blanche like the other members of the cast , she shuns purely naturalistic delivery and moves in ways that often contradict what she is saying but ms marvel , a consistently inventive and adaptable young actress , delivers a performance of remarkable poise and stamina that also locates the tragic , selfdefeating conflict within blanche looking strangely like the infamous 1950 s socialite anne woodward , this blanche is mechanically manicdepressive , switching abruptly between hypedup , giddy flirtatiousness and deepvoiced , slowmoving melancholy the contrast emphasizes , in surprising ways , the glum fatalism in the character , the sense that she has surrendered before her climactic breakdown and i started hearing the full , despairing content in blanche s soliloquies , especially the one about what soft people must do to survive , in ways i had n't before like much in this production , ms marvel s interpretation sometimes has the feeling of an exploratory workshop exercise still awaiting integration into a complete performance but there is no denying the poetic dignity in her presence considering she spends much of the evening wet and naked , that is saying quite a bit photo jenny bacon as stella and bruce mckenzie as stanley kowalski in the new york theater workshop s production of tennessee williams s streetcar named desire \( joan marcus a streetcar named desire \)
chestnut hill , mass , july 17 when pete sampras raised his racquet to serve for the doubles victory that saved the united states davis cup team from elimination by australia today , the oncourt thermometer had already boiled over at 129 degrees the radar gun had shortcircuited , 5 , 300 overheated fans at the longwood cricket club were screaming pete , pete , pete , and sampras was close to a meltdown himself after 3 hours 28 minutes of tussling with mark woodforde and sandon stolle on the sizzling hardcourts , he wanted out of the inferno but sampras had no intention of letting the day end in a 30 sweep by the australians not after eating humble pie just to play in this centenary confrontation between the two superpowers of davis cup so the world s 778thranked doubles stylist playing today with a brandnew partner , alex o'brien reverted to the maneuvers that have earned him a recordtying 12 grand slam singles titles serving at 53 of the fifth set , he saved a break point with a serve and spike combination , whisked a service winner past stolle s waving racquet to reach match point , and secured a 64 , 63 , 36 , 46 , 63 victory when woodforde swung his backhand return wide at match point it s a sweet victory , sampras said after cutting the australian s lead in the threeoffivematch quarterfinal to 21 that s what it s all about when you get to the fifth set of a match like today s , you 've got to put everything into it it s either win or go home his mission completed , and his davis cup doubles record improved to 41 , sampras hugged o'brien and then accepted congratulations from tom gullikson , a very relieved united states captain gullikson s ears had been burning all week from the cavalcade of secondguessing that accompanied his decision to start todd martin and jim courier in singles as a reward for their firstround upset of britain their losses to lleyton hewitt and patrick rafter , respectively , in friday s singles had put the united states in its 20 hole tom is the only reason i'm here this week , said sampras , who admitted that he could replace the heathampered martin in sunday s reverse singles if necessary i feel like i recovered pretty good from this match , sampras said but it was hot , toasty the united states is 128 when it has lost the first two singles matches in the threeoffivematch format but at least it avoided the embarrassment of folding in three straight matches , an indignity last suffered in the 1998 semifinals with italy john newcombe , the australian captain , said he did not fathom gullikson s decision to restrict sampras to doubles duty ruffled feathers or not , newcombe said , he would have used his top singles star if the objective is to beat the australians and win three matches before they do , why would you have pete sitting on the bench \? asked newcombe sampras came off the bench today and wasted no time making his australian opponents regret their public sniping regarding his limited doubles skills though stolle ranks fourth in the world in doubles and woodforde 17th , sampras dominated them in the early going after he held his serve for 54 in the first set , sampras gained a triple set point against stolle s serve with a blistering forehand pass then , hunched expectantly and arrogantly on the baseline awaiting serve , he provoked the nervous stolle into a double fault that surrendered the set the second set featured more theatrics from sampras , who broke woodforde for a 42 lead with an inyourface volley smash , then helped o'brien hold serve for a 52 lead with a forehand that not only ended the game but glanced off stolle s shoulder sampras served for a twosetstonone lead at 53 and pocketed the set when woodforde buried a backhand volley in the net in the third set , the 33yearold woodforde , who built a 132 davis cup record with todd woodbridge , and stolle , a doubles specialist whose partner is often o'brien , began to have the edge in teamwork after messing up the first two sets , said woodforde , they settled into unison in the next two keying in on o'brien , they pushed him into doublefaulting to 040 in the eighth game of the third set , then forced a volley error from him woodforde served for the set at 53 , and a volley miss by a suddenly offkilter sampras gave the australians the set they opened the fourth set by breaking sampras for the first time in the match after sampras saved two set points against his serve at 35 , woodforde , who won all 12 of his fourthset service points , calmly sent the match into the fifth and deciding set with an ace at triple set point the pivotal break for the united states in the final set came in the eighth game woodforde fended off two break points before stolle , in pursuit of a lob from o'brien , banged a backhand out of bounds in the final set , sampras threw in some jordanesque slam dunks at the net to let them know i'm going to jump through the roof and we are not going to die newcombe was resigned to stating the obvious pete is a real champion he just sucked it up at the end and went really hard at it at the finish line match points don budge , winner of the grand slam in 1938 and one of several former champions on hand for the centenary , said he would be surprised if pete sampras did not play in the doordie first singles match against patrick rafter on sunday i should think he 'd want to play , budge said it seems like they 're disciplining him a bit the united states captain , tom gullikson , appeared to open the door for sampras to replace todd martin , who suffered ill effects from the heat on friday , when he said that martin was still receiving treatment karol kucera and dominik hrbaty of slovakia downed yevgeny kafelnikov and andrei olhovskiy , 62 , 62 , 62 , but russia still holds a 21 lead in its quarterfinal the winner faces the united statesaustralia winner fabrice santoro and olivier delaitre of france beat gustavo kuerten and jaime oncins , 76 \( 75 \) , 64 , 64 , to give france a 21 lead over brazil , and switzerland hung on against belgium when lorenzo manta and marc rosset beat filip dewulf and christophe rochus , 26 , 61 , 76 \( 97 \) , 75 photos pete sampras returning a volley at the net in the davis cup yesterday \( associated press \) \( pg 1 \) pete sampras , left , and alex o'brien after their victory \( associated press \) \( pg 7 \)
atlanta three hundred and eighty times john smoltz had entered a major league game , but always with the measured pace of a starting pitcher who cannot get too rambunctious too soon yesterday , john smoltz tried it a different way , leaving the bullpen in the ninth inning he literally did not know what to do should he run in with the quartermiler stride of the braves' own galloping john rocker \? should he stroll to the mound with the banker s poise of a starting pitcher \? it was all a mystery to smoltz all he knew was that the braves had a onerun lead on the mets in the ninth inning , and that his team dearly hoped to take a twogame lead into the boschian depths of shea stadium smoltz is second in longevity to tom glavine , the only two braves who have been here for the eight division titles , the four world series , the one world championship so far , that is the team keeps evolving , but glavine and smoltz have been the constants glavine a wiry lefthander who still has never relieved in 424 games , regular and postseason , and smoltz , a durable righthander who had pitched 356 first innings in the regular season and 24 more first innings in the postseason , but had never pitched out of the bullpen anybody can start , smoltz would say later with a touch of gallantry , but i do n't know that everybody can relieve oh , he had volunteered to pitch relief a few times in the past when the braves had a gap in the bullpen , but bobby cox had always declined the offer a few times smoltz had passed the evening in the somewhat neurotic company of relief pitchers , whose twitches make them first cousins to such haunted souls as hockey goalies and football placekickers when you start , you can work your way into it , smoltz said yesterday when you relieve , you have to be ready right away he is to be the starting pitcher in saturday s fourth game he last started last saturday as the braves mopped up houston starting pitchers always throw between starts i 've been with john smoltz for 12 years , said leo mazzone , the pitching coach who constantly rocks forward and backward on the dugout bench there is n't one thing john smoltz ca n't do cox has already used kevin millwood and greg maddux in the first round of the playoffs when smoltz volunteered to pitch an inning yesterday , if needed , maddux gave him advice he told me , 'do n't try to get all your pitches working , ' smoltz recalled afterward 'just find a few that are working and go with them' smoltz ambled out to the bullpen in the fifth inning , unsure he would be needed , but he started loosening up when rocker blew away the mets in the top of the eighth and then the bullpen phone rang a decade plus in the major leagues and the bell had never tolled for him my first thought was , 'who could i possibly face \? ' smoltz said smoltz semijogged in from the bullpen , without the thundering footsteps or maniacal glares or exaggerated resinbag tossings of career relief pitchers but even without trying to stoke himself up , smoltz discovered the nutty little secret of relief pitchers the rush , he called it the sudden supply of energy that , in more lifethreatening situations , allows a mother to lift the rear end of a car to save her baby smoltz already knew he had a good fastball working , and he forgot about the other pitches in his repertory he retired shawon dunston on a pop fly to short left field he got roger cedeno to ground out to shortstop and that brought up bobby bonilla as a pinchhitter i know he bats primarily from the left side , smoltz said i was going to pitch him outside if he got a single , he got a single instead , bonilla looked at a third strike and the braves had a 43 victory but smoltz displayed none of the panache of a dennis eckersley pumping his fists or the swashbucklers who close imaginary doors or blow away the smoke from imaginary sixshooters he had not thought it through it makes you appreciate what a great job our relief pitchers do , smoltz would say later this is nice this is great he had packets of ice strapped to his right arm the physical work he had done was no more than what he ordinarily would do to prepare for the 381st start on saturday but in his eyes there was the trace of the secret life of the relief pitcher john smoltz s life may never be the same photos rey ordonez bunting in the second yesterday with men on first and third , none out i was surprised by it , mets manager bobby valentine said catcher eddie perez and john smoltz celebrating yesterday after smoltz shut down the mets \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
burlington city route 130 in southern burlington county is a true new jersey byway before the postwar interstate highway boom , route 130 was the main road from philadelphia to new brunswick , where it hooked up with route 1 and continued on to new york today , still six lanes wide and clogged with traffic , it is a panoply of strip shopping centers , old motels and diners of all sorts there is the prince diner , the dynasty and nick s hometown diner , not to mention samplings of kfc and wendy s and mcdonald s but none of those places are so venerable as the burlington diner , which for 72 years has sat at high street where route 130 bypasses the edge of downtown burlington city the diner is the old boxcar type , bordered on the outside with gleaming chrome its large sign has burlington in big , green neon diner in pink neon script with a star as the dot on the i , and a deco black martini glass emblazoned cocktails at the top inside the narrow car , there is a chrome dome ceiling , frosted mirrors and a gray , black and pink tile floor earlier this summer , though , it seemed as if this icon of roadside culture was doomed its owners , chris and anthony stratis , had agreed to sell the diner and its adjacent parking lot to commercial net realty services of orlando , fla , which plans to build a large eckerd drug store on the site the people at the american diner museum in providence , ri , alerted mayor herman costello here that the destruction of such a piece of history would be unnecessary since the boxcar part of the diner was meant to be portable , it could be saved on another site they wondered if the mayor had an idea on how to rescue it mayor costello did have an idea the proposed new jersey transit lightrail line from camden to trenton is scheduled to come through burlington , and a station with a 400car parking lot is planned at the commerce square commercial center at the south end of the city canon usa has 800 employees there , mayor costello said there are several other smaller businesses we 're building a new ymca and it s right off the burlingtonbristol bridge would n't a diner be a natural on that site \? so the mayor negotiated with commercial net , and the developers have agreed to move the boxcar portion of the diner about a mile to the south to a cityowned site at commerce square two additions , which now house a kitchen and a separate dining area , will not be moved and the move is pending local and state approvals for the eckerd project but , still , the mayor is confident that everyone will win four months down the road or so , i see another positive for the city , mayor costello said burlington has been trying to revive its downontheheels downtown for more than a decade , with some limited success the city was the home of capt james a lawrence , who was famous for the phrase do n't give up the ship , which could be costello s byword i look at that weeded lot and i see something more than an ordinary diner there , the mayor said i see outdoor tables with umbrellas maybe an open kitchen i remember going to the burlington diner as a kid in the 1930 s when the shortorder cook was right out front where you could see it hopefully , this will be up and running soon mayor costello said that once the diner is moved , the city and the joint burlington group , a quasigovernmental development agency , will be looking for someone to run the diner with the rail station , the ymca and canon s proposal to expand its facility , the mayor sees no problem in getting a new owner i may be dreaming , but i think this is a natural , with a good potential clientele , he said i'm not looking backward this is a new idea , and it s too good not to do it it s a greatlooking place , and we 'll do everything we can to make it work again' daniel zilka , director of the american diner museum , is delighted , too there are only about 2 , 500 of these manufactured diners left in the country , and we consider them historic community resources , mr zilka said they were and are unique community gathering places in america , like a pub in ireland or a bistro in france they hold a lot of living memories for truck drivers who looked for them as landmarks to people who had their first dates there a place as old as the burlington diner has a lot of those memories i look to that last line in the movie 'diner , ' where mickey rourke says , well , we always have the diner , mr zilka said i'm glad we 'll have the burlington diner still , for it is a place where the soul is reenergized photo the burlington diner on route 130 has seven decades of memories \( laura pedrick for the new york times \)

over a decade ago , michael r daley was touring a plant that burned old tires for energy when he learned that it paid haulers to cart away gypsum , one of its byproducts mr daley was astounded gypsum , he knew , is used in plaster , toothpaste , paints , even molds for false teeth so mr daley set up shop near the plant to collect and resell the gypsum since then , his company , triad energy resources inc , has grown into a successful small enterprise , all by setting up next to corporations and finding uses for their wastes triad makes soil additives from the c h sugar company s sugarfiltration byproducts in crockett , calif it turns leftover skins and seeds from australian wineries and fruit processors into fertilizer and compost and it is now contracting with fish processors in oregon to turn their detritus into fertilizer and fish food if companies were smart , they 'd all locate near sources of waste , mr daley said corporate america is , in fact , catching on more and more companies are buying their neighbors' wastes or selling their own and a growing number of economic development agencies and private developers are building ecoindustrial parks ecoparks for short for this purpose some are doing it to attract jobs , others to reduce trash flows , still others simply to make money but all are working on the principle that one company s waste can be its neighbor s raw material and they are taking advantage of the fact that many wastes that cannot be recycled back to their original uses can still be profitably used as materials for other products a park that makes environmental and economic sense is an idea whose time has come , said dustin bielagus , a developer who is building an ecopark in londonderry , nh ecoparks are rising in mississippi and mexico they are on the drawing boards in puerto rico and mesa del sol , nm the dow chemical company is building one near its plants in eastern germany in california , local officials plan an ecopark in oakland , while the cabazon band of mission indians is looking for companies to set up at its trashtoenergy plant near palm springs to extract materials from the trash before it is burned while the environmental movement spawned the idea of such industrial symbiosis , it is no longer the primary force people realize that where materials are thrown out , there is money to be made , said kevin taylor , coordinator of the california materials exchange program , a state group that brought triad and c h together there is money to be saved as well , added reid lifset , who edits the journal of industrial ecology companies are always looking for cheaper ways to procure raw materials , he said , and the more they hear about ecoindustrial parks , the more light bulbs go off the idea of selling and buying wastes is not new , of course the environmental protection agency lists about 40 governmentsubsidized waste exchanges but now more entrepreneurs are becoming involved , charging companies for listing available wastes or wasteproduct needs valuable waste materials should not be consigned to subsidized exchanges whose funding can get cut , said william sloan , who just started millennium exchange ltd , a forprofit , webbased waste exchange even the terminology reflects the privatesector thrust , said julie rhodes , executive director of the reuse development organization , a clearinghouse for information about reusing materials people call them materials exchanges now , not waste exchanges , she said the whole idea is to think of waste as having value still , most existing exchanges ignore location when they match waste sources with users factor in the cost of shipping waste , and the economics of selling it becomes shaky but put companies next to one another , and the economics works it s a lot cheaper to transport used lumber from next door than it is to truck wood down from a forest , said ann schneider , director of recycling programs at the university of california at santa cruz that is the type of argument that the energy answers corporation , a resource recovery specialist in albany , is using to woo companies to set up near the trashtoenergy plant it wants to install in rio pedras , near san juan , pr patrick f mahoney , president of energy answers , said he was close to persuading a paper company to reopen an abandoned plant on the site because it could recycle waste paper coming in and use cheap energy from the trash being burned he said he was also talking to steel and concrete companies about using scrap steel from the trash and the fly ash that is left after combustion we can put the companies close enough to get the materials by conveyor belt , mr mahoney said despite the proselytizing , ecoparks are not an easy sell when a company is picking a site , a chance to lower disposal or materials costs pales next to considerations like availability of workers , taxes and nearness to customers the sheer logistics of figuring out the proper mix can be daunting

fifteen years after the courtsupervised breakup of att , a part of the old ma bell stands a good chance of being allowed to offer customers both longdistance and local service the bell atlantic corporation , the nation s biggest local telephone company , plans to ask federal regulators , perhaps as soon as today , for permission to sell longdistance communications services in new york state approval would make it the first baby bell to enter the 80 billion longdistance market the federal communications commission has rejected five previous longdistance applications from other baby bell companies , saying they had not yet opened their local networks to competition , as required by the telecommunications act of 1996 but many communications executives , analysts and lawyers expect bell atlantic s new york application to be approved for the 66 million new york households served by bell atlantic , approval could mean onestop shopping for local and longdistance phone service for the first time since the breakup of what was then known as the american telephone and telegraph company in 1984 in addition to offering pricing plans competitive with those of the established longdistance giants , bell atlantic could also offer special deals like discounted pricing for local service to consumers who sign up for the company s longdistance product bell atlantic s entry into the longdistance market could push longdistance rates , which have already dropped , even lower the fcc declined to comment but john t nakahata , who was chief of staff for the commission s chairman , william e kennard , until last winter , said , i think that there s a sense at the commission that it s getting close to being time to let a bell into long distance mr nakahata added , assuming they have the support of new york regulators , i think they 'll get it even as they say that bell atlantic does not deserve to win longdistance entry , some of bell atlantic s potential longdistance competitors , including att , also say the petition will probably pass muster i 'd put the chances above 5050 , said michael j morrissey , vice president for government affairs at att , which stands to lose billions in revenue if the bells broadly enter the longdistance market the other applications had no real chance bell atlantic s application would apply only to new york state , with a 7 billion longdistance market that is among the most attractive for communications companies but if the petition is approved , new york will probably set a regulatory tone for much of the rest of the nation , with other bells in other states looking to bell atlantic s new york experience for guidance on gaining access to the longdistance market we 're on track for a filing this week , said james g cullen , president and chief operating officer of bell atlantic if bell atlantic wins longdistance approval , it would open a huge new front in the brutal wars of marketing and technology that have roiled the communications business since passage of the telecommunications act , a law that was intended to eliminate many barriers among various communications sectors the act set off a frantic dash among the nation s communications giants to assemble comprehensive baskets of local , longdistance , wireless and internet services to be offered to consumers as onestop communications solutions , making it less likely that consumers would divide service among several companies in that vein , att , the no 1 longdistance carrier , has committed more than 90 billion to enter local communications markets by acquiring two big cable companies , telecommunications inc and mediaone group inc , and retooling its network to piggyback local phone service and internet access on tv cables bell atlantic , based in philadelphia , acquired the nynex corporation in 1997 and has since agreed to merge with the gte corporation this month it struck a deal with vodafone airtouch , britain s largest wireless concern , to combine their united states wireless operations and create the nation s largest coasttocoast network so far , none of the local bells have won entry to the longdistance market before that can happen , baby bells must have fcc certification that they meet a highly technical checklist included in the 1996 act to insure they have opened their local networks to competitors between the breakup of ma bell in 1984 and the passage of the act , the bells were completely barred from long distance in the eyes of many communications experts , bell atlantic s strategy for winning longdistance approval has been more patient and potentially more effective than those of the other bells bell atlantic , which provides local phone services throughout the northeast and middle atlantic regions , has spent more than a year slogging through a tough review by the new york public service commission and the justice department in april 1998 , it made a deal under which the public service commission and the justice department would support bell atlantic s longdistance aspirations in new york after the company had completed a set of tests of whether its network could easily link with its competitors' systems
in an apparently unprecedented action , donald j trump revealed on friday that he is not fond of a sign on a building that spells out his name too glitzy , mr trump said , referring to the fourfoothigh goldcolored letters proclaiming trump on the facade of the general motors building too shiny some people love the color i do n't love it mr trump did not name the people who love the sign , and thus far it has not been possible to locate any of them it has been easier to find people who share mr trump s distaste for the gleaming letters , which appeared in late spring on a building that many new yorkers would prefer to ignore altogether the skyscraper , which mr trump bought with partners last year and renamed the general motors building at trump international plaza , has always seemed out of place to architects some of them vainly picketed in the 1960 s to save its predecessor , the savoy plaza , a hotel whose facade on fifth avenue elegantly framed one of the city s great public spaces , grand army plaza that classic frame was ruined with the stark 50story building set back from the sidewalk to make room for a woebegone little plaza with a sunken pit but whatever the faults of the old gm building , at least it did n't have huge golden letters two months ago mr trump sounded proud of the letters , telling the new yorker that they were titanium and really expensive praising the way the letters were molded to wrap around the marble columns , he said , the sign guy is a genius the building s tenants were not so impressed some complained about the big sign , as well as four smaller but equally shiny trump signs at the corners two above fao schwarz , the toy store at the 58th street side , and two above the new cbs studio on the 59th street side , where next month the network will begin broadcasting its revamped morning program on friday , mr trump said that he had assuaged the tenants' concerns , and that the goldcolored signs had never been intended to be permanent the two corner signs facing fifth avenue will vanish , he said , making it possible for cbs to show an external shot of the throng outside its studio without giving mr trump a free ad mr trump said his name will remain in the other three spots at the center of the fifth avenue facade , and on the corners facing the side streets but in less gleaming style the titanium letters will be replaced within a few weeks , he said , with letters the same size and shape made of bronze with an antique finish they 're going to be very beautiful , very highlevel material , he said among architects who have heard the news , the reaction has been less than ecstatic well , bronze has a luster and a depth and a quietness that would be commendable , said robert a m stern , the new york architect and dean of the yale school of architecture bronze would be better than gold , and fewer signs would be better than more none would be better still the building speaks for itself sometimes it s nice to hide your light under a bushel a little but that s not donald no , it s not , as mr trump is the first to acknowledge it s a branding thing , he said by putting the brand on the building , i can get more rent per square foot , solely and simply because of the trump name he seems to be right about that , judging from the recordbreaking rents he has collected in the gm building and other properties still , might people pay just as much to be in a trump building that did n't scream his name \? in this case , a more subtle brand might be better public relations one alternative , mr stern noted , would be to highlight mr trump s plans for landscaping the plaza and covering up the sunken pit what donald is doing on the plaza is a huge improvement , he said maybe there s a way to take the letters off the building and put them in the plaza instead that idea was passed along to mr trump , whose reaction was less than ecstatic well , it s certainly something i could look into , he said diplomatically , and explained again that the fourfoothigh trump had nothing to do with his ego it s purely economic we put it there because people want to see it but could n't they be satisfied without the sign \? people do n't need giant letters to know who built rockefeller center and they probably appreciate his discretion but rockefeller center does n't get nearly the rent that i get , mr trump said photo \( barbara alper for the new york times \)
washington , jan 22 assuming a more active role , senators posed questions to defense and prosecution teams for the first time today , producing the semblance of debate in the impeachment trial of president clinton the republican prosecutors sought to repair the damage done by white house lawyers to their carefully constructed chronologies concerning the search for a job for monica s lewinsky , whose sexual relationship with mr clinton led to the two articles of impeachment , and the concealment of presents given to ms lewinsky by the president they denied that their perjury and obstruction of justice charges had been loosely drawn or constitutionally defective excerpts , pages a12a13 president clinton wants all the benefits of a criminal trial without bearing any of its burdens , representative charles t canady of florida asserted , as charles f c ruff , the white house counsel , argued again that the impeachment articles were so vague they would be thrown out of court and continued to resist all republican demands that witnesses be summoned representative henry j hyde of illinois , the chief prosecutor , pressed his case for witnesses , arguing that only witnesses could resolve conflicts in testimony on several key points , even after senator robert c byrd of west virginia issued a news release promising to move on monday to dismiss the case but mr hyde wanted none of that and even proposed that senators ask the president to testify , an idea the white house has dismissed out of hand i think by dismissing the articles of impeachment before you have a complete trial , you are sending a terrible message to the people of the country , mr hyde said you 're saying , i guess , perjury is ok if it s about sex obstruction is ok , even though it is an effort to deny a citizen a right to a fair trial mr hyde continued i know oh , do i know what an annoyance we are in the bosom of this great body but we 're a constitutional annoyance , and i remind you of that fact david e kendall , mr clinton s personal lawyer , said it was inconceivable that anything could be gained by questioning ms lewinsky or vernon e jordan jr , the presidential confidant who sought a job for her , or betty currie , mr clinton s secretary , who hid the presents under her bed the senate already has before it five volumes of testimony , he said thousands of pages the independent counsel , kenneth w starr , called many , many , many witnesses , many , many , many times , mr kendall reminded the senators mr ruff , almost always gentlemanly and composed , came close to losing his temper on the witness issue at one point if the republicans so badly needed witnesses to nail down their case and clear up inconsistencies , he demanded , how could they have called for mr clinton s removal from office without summoning witnesses of their own before the house judiciary committee \? the house of representatives , he charged , violated their constitutional responsibilities the questions were posed by the senators through an arcane 19thcentury process that forbade them to speak directly and required them to submit their queries on paper lined cards were used to the respective party leaders , senator trent lott of mississippi for the republicans and senator tom daschle of south dakota for the democrats the leaders screened them and sent them , one by one , with the parties alternating , to chief justice william h rehnquist , who then read them to the senate most went from democrats to democrats , republicans to republicans they were frequently vague and unchallenging , enabling the house managers and the white house lawyers to veer off in almost any direction when senator christopher j dodd of connecticut , a democrat , objected that an answer to a question he had put to representative asa hutchinson of arkansas , a republican , was not responsive , chief justice rehnquist overruled his objection with the comment that he was not inclined to police the responsiveness of answers clearly , the republicans from the house were prepared for some of the questions , because they read out prepared answers and used charts the result was nothing like the crossexamination of a criminal trial it was more like the rebuttal and surrebuttal of a college debate but the two sides engaged each other more directly than they had since the trial began eight days ago , and there was more real debate than usual in the modern senate , with its serial speeches chief justice rehnquist , a stickler for form and punctuality at the supreme court , added to a feeling of relaxation in the senate chamber today at the beginning , he told the lawyers , the chair will operate on a rebuttable assumption that each question can be fully and fairly answered in five minutes or less in fact , many were and many were not representative ed bryant of tennessee , the first manager to speak , took nine minutes on a broadly phrased question , and chief justice rehnquist did not cut him or anybody else off about 50 questions were asked in the fourandahalfhour proceeding , and more will be put in a session expected to last most of saturday the two sides debated whether overt threats were required in order to prove intimidation of a witness , the democrats saying yes and the republicans no there was more argument about whether private or only official acts could be subject to impeachment and the lawyers squabbled over whether the standards for the impeachment trials of federal judges differed from those governing presidential impeachment one of the more telling moments came when senator joseph i lieberman of connecticut , a democrat , asked representative lindsey graham of south carolina , a republican , whether he thought a president should be impeached anytime he committed a criminal offense , regardless of its nature no , mr graham replied , i would not want my president removed for trivial offenses but it was no trivial offense , he suggested , when mr clinton coached ms currie with a series of questions about ms lewinsky shortly after his deposition in the paula jones case , designed , mr clinton later said , to refresh my memory i do n't believe he was refreshing his memory when he asked his secretary , 'i never touched her , did i \? ' mr graham said i believe you should only remove a president who in a calculated fashion puts the legal and political interest of himself over the good of the nation in a selfish way that you only should remove a president who , after being begged by everybody in the country , 'do n't go into a grand jury and lie , ' and he in fact lied the question of mr clinton s deposition in the jones case , which brought the lewinsky matter to light , came up repeatedly the republicans contended that mr clinton had lied in it the white house lawyers said he had evaded , answered incompletely , misled , but had not committed perjury even if he had , mr clinton s lawyers said , it was a moot question , because the house had rejected the judiciary committee s article covering the jones case not so , said the republicans because the president affirmed his statements in the jones case when he testified before the lewinsky grand jury , he had piled perjury upon perjury but he had not affirmed them , mr ruff insisted so it went all afternoon , back and forth , with a little namecalling to enliven things the republicans built straw men , said mr ruff the white house had provided a lesson in legal schizophrenia , said representative james e rogan , republican of california , perhaps the most hardedged of the prosecutors photos representative bob barr , one of the 13 house impeachment managers , left the senate chamber yesterday , the first day of queries from senators \( stephen crowley the new york times \) chief justice william h rehnquist , right , who is presiding over the impeachment trial of president clinton , was escorted into the senate chambers yesterday by james ziglar , the senate sergeantatarms \( associated press \) \( pg 10 \)
a new type of 401 \( k \) retirement savings plan that would allow withdrawals free of taxes is expected to be proposed today by the chairman of the senate finance committee the proposal would greatly expand americans' savings options and would allow them to save far more each year in retirement accounts it could even raise money initially for the federal government because workers would pay income taxes on the money they contribute to the new plan , not on what they take out but over the long term , it would deplete revenues and is expected to face opposition from the clinton administration and democrats in congress , where it will be one of several competing ideas about how to cut taxes this year mr clinton has said he will oppose any tax cut until an agreement is reached to shore up social security the major portion of the proposal , called a roth 401 \( k \) , would extend the popular 401 \( k \) plans for employees and would operate on the same principles as the recently created roth ira , said senator william v roth jr , republican of delaware , who is chairman of the finance committee mr roth sponsored the 1976 law giving unemployed spouses the right to individual retirement accounts and the 1981 law letting anyone with a job create an ira contributions to a roth ira are made with dollars that have already been taxed , but none of the investment earnings on that money are subject to taxes nor are withdrawals with conventional ira s , workers do not pay income taxes on the money they contribute , but both the contributions and their gains are taxed when the money is withdrawn financial institutions reported a rush of activity at the end of last year as people opened roth ira s but not everyone can contribute to a roth ira , which has income and other restrictions many more people could take advantage of a roth 401 \( k \) at work , paying taxes on their contributions but not on any growth in that money or any withdrawal in 401 \( k \) s , workers choose how to invest their money , and employers often match part of their contributions to encourage participation senator roth said he wanted to give people more incentives to save and to expand their savings options his proposal would allow workers to increase their savings substantially in taxadvantaged accounts the maximum annual contribution to a roth 401 \( k \) and a conventional 401 \( k \) plan would climb to 15 , 000 from 10 , 000 workers age 50 and older would be allowed to set aside as much as 22 , 500 a year the current limit on ira contributions would rise to 5 , 000 from 2 , 000 , and workers 50 and older could set aside up to 7 , 500 most income limits on ira s would also be eliminated under mr roth s proposal that means that older workers with high incomes could save up to 30 , 000 annually through a combination of 401 \( k \) and ira plans , and could use any mix of traditional and roth plans roth 401 \( k \) plan funds would have to be withdrawn , beginning at age 70 1 2 , under the same rules as existing 401 \( k \) plans roth ira s have no such requirements on withdrawals rules governing employer contributions to 401 \( k \) plans would be liberalized to allow up to 30 , 000 in matching contributions , now limited to 25 percent of salary the roth 401 \( k \) , which would be accompanied by a similar roth 403 \( b \) plan for government workers and employees of nonprofit groups , could in its first few years raise government revenues but there are two serious downsides it would cost the government money in the long run and most of the tax benefits would go to people with higher incomes robert s mcintyre of citizens for tax justice , a washington nonprofit organization that says the tax system favors the rich , said that the middle class will be subsidizing the savings of the rich under senator roth s proposal the plan , mr mcintyre said , would move the tax system closer to the plan by representative dick armey , republican of texas , to tax all wages at the same rate and to eliminate taxes on gains and income from investments mr mcintyre and two capitol hill democrats who work on tax policy said that they expected the white house to oppose any plan that increased tax benefits to the rich among the many elements in mr roth s proposed retirement savings opportunity act of 1999 are a provision to eliminate income limits for traditional ira s and for roth ira s and to make the rules more liberal on converting existing accounts to roth ira s workers could invest their ira money in employers' retirement plans , which could reduce administrative costs on traditional corporate pension plans , which are funded and managed by employers , mr roth proposes to allow corporate income tax deductions for contributions even if plans have 50 percent more money than they need to pay benefits that would eliminate most of the pressure on companies with overfunded plans to reduce the surplus and preserve their tax deduction
hampton bays it may be the last call for the canoe place inn off montauk highway in hampton bays , a legendary watering hole for bootleggers , politicians and mobsters that saw its heyday in the 1920 s to the 1940 s the inn has been put up for sale , with the owners hoping to lure a resort hotel developer to the site the building is now a giant nightclub that on summer weekends draws up to 5 , 000 patrons , many of whom tend to favor loud music and loud motorcycles but whatever the canoe place inn s perceived drawbacks , some of its neighbors and local environmental groups are opposed to the idea of a resort hotel on the site , or anywhere else in the hamptons , which has none unless you count gurney s inn in montauk that s going to make us look like hauppauge , said robert deluca , president of the group for the south fork , alluding to marriott s hotel and sports complex there maud kramer , president of the hampton bays beautification association , said her group would consider approaching the southampton town board to prevent a resort hotel from being built on the site it could be very nice or it could be disastrous , ms kramer said people do n't want a big hotel chain that would n't be concerned with the community chuck herman , one of the owners of the inn , indicated that he had the support of the town board in seeking a resort hotel on the site the town has designated this on the master plan as a convention center , mr herman said there are no hotels , holiday inns or ramada inns out here , so it s a huge opportunity i 've discussed this with the supervisor s office all the way down but the town master plan adopted in march makes no mention of a convention center , and town supervisor vincent cannuscio said he had no recollection of any discussion with mr herman regarding a convention center or resort hotel no one has come to the town hall to discuss that use , mr cannuscio said a highrise is just not going to work here we do n't want them the town building inspector , jack capone , said the site may need to be rezoned to accommodate more hotel rooms it s zoned resort waterfront business , basically the same as a hotel , mr capone said even though it was preexisting to the zoning , it may have lost its status because it has not been used as a hotel in decades canoe place inn received a royal charter as a coaching inn in 1707 , according to kerry mclaughlin of the southampton historical museum we think it was the first inn in new york state , according to historical books , she said it may even be the oldest inn in the country the inn got its name from the ground it sits on , the narrow isthmus dividing great peconic bay from shinnecock bay before the shinnecock canal was built , it was a place to portage canoes the original building , dating from 1656 , was destroyed by fire in 1921 , but the inn was immediately rebuilt among those who stayed in one of the inn s 40 rooms were albert einstein , gary cooper and john d rockefeller the inn was a favored haunt of gov alfred e smith , who served four terms from 1915 to 1928 and was the democratic party s presidential nominee in 1928 smith had a house nearby and used it as a summer vacation spot for some 30 years known for his antiprohibition stance , the governor was often seen at the inn with meyer lansky and dutch schultz , two of the leading mobsters of the day who were heavily involved in bootlegging during prohibition this was probably the biggest speakeasy there ever was , said mr herman , who owns the canoe place inn with richard orofino the barges full of rum would come in on the shinnecock canal from canada , and the bootleggers threw potatoes on top to cover the bottles mr herman and mr orofino originally purchased the cpi in 1984 , when it was called the oak beach inn east the club s 34 , 800 square feet include a 178foot bar and a 30 , 000watt sound system there are three separate dance areas , including a 70 s lounge with gogo dance cages an outside patio features live jazz , soft rock and blues lines form around the building well before the doors open at 10 pm mr herman described the place as a big moneymaker , but said , i want to retire and spend a lot more time pursuing other interests the current 34acre site could be sold with adjoining properties , owned separately but similarly zoned , of 32 acres and 27 acres , for a total of 10 acres the property is being auctioned by sheldon good and co , based in new york prospective buyers are required to send a sealed note to the auction company , along with a check for 5 percent of the bid , by aug 19 losers get a refund mr deluca said that he thinks the history of the inn should be reason enough to preserve it it s a building of significance for a lot of people , he said they do n't build them like that now you do n't see that on long island anymore maps of long island highlighting canoe place inn
the whole woman by germaine greer 373 pages alfred a knopf 25 when germaine greer s swaggering call for sexual liberation , the female eunuch , appeared in 1970 , it created a sensation the book urged women to embrace their sexuality , to become selfreliant and to repudiate the passive roles in which they have traditionally been cast it laid out these dictums with a rollicking sense of humor and a marked sympathy for men , two qualities in decidedly short supply among feminist theorists of the time indeed , ms greer s book anticipated the thinking of later feminists like naomi wolf who would treat men not as adversaries but as potential partners now , some 30 years later , ms greer has written a sequel of sorts to the female eunuch it s a book that is as sour as eunuch was exuberant , as dogmatic as eunuch was original , as slipshod in its thinking as eunuch was pointed instead of drawing upon her readings in psychoanalysis , literature and cultural history as she did in that earlier book , ms greer relies in these pages on highly selective anecdotal evidence \( from newspaper stories , court cases and polls \) to support her assertions instead of drawing her disparate observations together into a coherent thesis , she settles for giving the reader a scattershot and often highly contradictory series of reactions to an assortment of phenomena , including sexual discrimination legislation , deadbeat dads , anorexia , selfmutilation and the rise of madonna and the spice girls throughout this messy volume , ms greer tries to argue that things are worse than ever for women although she acknowledges that feminist consciousness now leavens every relationship , every single social and professional encounter , she insists that our culture is less feminist than it was 30 years ago when 'the female eunuch' was written our daughters were not cutting or starving themselves , she writes on every side speechless women endure endless hardship , grief and pain , in a world system that creates billions of losers for every handful of winners it s time to get angry again perhaps one reason ms greer is so pessimistic has to do with her willful and often perverse insistence on seeing developments most feminists would embrace as signs of progress as symptoms of some vague male conspiracy modern contraception , she suggests , does not give a woman greater control over her body , but turns her into a manmade nonmother it is another instance of male interference with conception and birth reproductive technology , in her view , does not exist to offer unfertile women the hope of having babies but to make women subsidiary to the process of reproduction screening for cervical and breast cancer , she declares , is many times more likely to destroy a woman s peace of mind than it is to save her life women are driven through the health system like sheep through a dip , she writes in a typically dogmatic passage the disease they are being treated for is womanhood as for the legal right to have an abortion , ms greer sees it as a reflection of the power of the masculine medical establishment and the masculine judiciary there were fortunes to be made in pregnancy termination , she writes , at a time when advances in the technology were making a risky procedure foolproof in her opinion , all that women won with roe v wade was the 'right' to undergo invasive procedures in order to terminate unwanted pregnancies , unwanted not just by them but by their parents , their sexual partners , the governments who would not support mothers , the employers who would not employ mothers , the landlords who would not accept tenants with children , the schools that would not accept students with children while ms greer noisily assails the western establishment for forcing women to conform to stereotyped standards of beauty , she denounces western efforts to stamp out female genital mutilation in africa as an attack on cultural identity although she admits that genital mutilation represents a significant health risk , she argues that it must also be a procedure with considerable cultural value because it has survived 50 years of criminalization and concerted propaganda campaigns although the brutal procedure is frequently performed on girls who have no say in the matter , ms greer writes that we should be considering the possibility that fgm acts in a similar way to tattooing and body piercing to assert the individual woman s control over her genitals and to customize them to her specification such patronizing , illconsidered remarks do nothing to inspire confidence in ms greer nor do her hectoring denunciations of men as lazy beasts who increasingly prefer masturbation to the services of actual women or her churlish reluctance to regard maletofemale transsexuals as women as for her recommendations for change , they not only sound impractical but often loony as well she suggests that women should consider the possibility of deploying grief as a subversive force as a means of protesting , even stopping governments from making war on a helpless civilian population she also argues that women who , she now believes , will always be ignored or treated as sex objects by men should make a conscious decision not to want men s company more than men want women s , even if that results in a segregation of the sexes while reporters have already made much of the fact that in the 30 years since the female eunuch ms greer has changed her mind about everything from motherhood as a career option to sex as a liberating \( or enslaving \) force , she would argue that women s changeability can be a corrective to masculine rigidity what is unfortunate about the whole woman is less that she has changed her views than that she has done such a weak job of articulating her evolving vision and that her writing and thinking have grown so vituperative and shrill none of the thoughtful insights into male and female psychology that animated the female eunuch are to be found in this volume , just as none of that earlier book s intellectual analysis is to be found in its pages the whole woman is a castrated book photo \( carolyn djanogly alfred a knopf \)
we 're just like numbers , one juror said last month after voting to order the general motors corporation to pay 49 billion to six people severely burned when the fuel tank of their 1979 chevrolet malibu exploded after a drunken driver ran into them the award is an understandably human reaction to evidence introduced during the trial that purported to show that general motors had a policy of forgoing safety features that cost shockingly little , perhaps no more than 240 a car yet the award is outrageously high it is perhaps the largest award ever in a personalinjury lawsuit , imposing 48 billion of punitive damages it will probably be set aside or at least greatly reduced , when , as expected , gm appeals the jury clearly demanded that car manufacturers value human life beyond a few dollars and cents brian j panish , lead lawyer for the plaintiffs , said that general motors made a business decision to fight lawsuits from fuelfed fires rather than to fix something that would n't have cost them much at all in a recent interview , he said , when you make a conscious decision to allow people to burn , you have to pay but the verdict leaves unanswered what exactly general motors did that was reprehensible the jury may have choked on the notion that car manufacturers trade off benefits and costs when designing safety features but so do government regulators operating on behalf of consumers the practice is not reprehensible indeed , economists say , there is no escape from ghoulish calculation the simple fact is that consumers do not want to buy the safest car possible because they do not want to pay the costs general motors may have taken its calculations to an indecent extreme , placing too little value on human life but the jury could not have logically drawn that conclusion from the evidence presented in court the numbers they saw the cost of various safety options per car reveal nothing about the sense or nonsense of general motors' decision put aside whether the jury s verdict proves that the nation s tort system resembles a lottery put aside questions about this particular trial whether , as general motors contends , the judge prevented it from presenting exculpatory evidence the immediate issue is whether jurors were right to rebel against evidence that purported to show that gm made business decisions that placed profits before safety the fuel tank on the 1979 malibu fulfilled federal regulations , according to tests conducted by general motors beyond that , how safe should it have made the car \? statements that manufacturers are morally obligated to put costs and profits aside in safety decisions amount to little more than blather there is only one way to make a car safe build a 500ton fortress on wheels , drive at one mile an hour on highways with lanes that are built , at taxpayers' expense , one mile wide in short , stop driving because no one could afford the trilliondollar price tag but were the jurors right to punish general motors for spending too little on safety \? mr panish said that general motors chose to fight the lawsuits and not spend the 859 it would have taken to get safer gas tanks and no fires the 859 figure comes from a general motors estimate of what it would have cost to relocate the fuel tank in a 1973 model to what the plaintiffs argued would have been a safer position general motors says the figure is bogus the new position , it says , would not have been safer besides , when the malibu was redesigned in 1978 the fuel tank could have been relocated , if the engineers thought it advisable , for nearly nothing but even if the 859 is taken at face value , it proves nothing robert litan of the brookings institution points out that positioning the fuel tank is one of many decisions that car manufacturers must make that affect safety each might cost only a few dollars a car but take the most expensive option each time and the cost quickly adds up the fact that millions of households choose lighter over heavier cars and forgo extra air bags and other safety features proves that spending money on safer cars does not always come ahead of many other needs but there s a more profound glitch in the evidence provided to the jury none of it was in the form that would allow juror , regulator or anyone else to determine if general motors made the wrong call jurors needed to take account of how many lives a safety feature would save they needed to know the cost of saving a life , not the cost of installing a feature in a new car there were about 40 million gm cars on the roads in the 1970 s a safety feature that cost 10 a car would cost general motors , and , therefore , its consumers , about 400 million suppose , to take an extreme example , the repositioned fuel tank would save only one life then the safety measure would cost about 400 million for each life saved that would be about 80 times , according to mr litan , the figure 5 million per life saved that the government often uses to decide what safety measures private industry must adopt if , by contrast , the repositioned tank would have saved 1 , 000 lives , the cost per life saved would be only about 400 , 000 , a fraction of the amount that government expects business to spend on saving lives the jury never learned how much a repositioned fuel tank would have cost for each life saved , if indeed any lives would have been saved the figures it did hear costs per car of safety options usually look minute no matter how frivolous the benefit the plaintiffs swayed the jury by bandying about a misleading figure but 859 is an answer to a question no regulator in charge of consumer safety would bother asking
after denying he had had any contact with the former bulls coach phil jackson , madison square garden s president , dave checketts , admitted during yesterday s game 3 that he had used an intermediary this past april to gauge jackson s interest in taking over as coach of the knicks checketts did not attend game 3 , but before tipoff , through his spokesman , he denied yesterday s report in the new york times , which disclosed a secret meeting he had with jackson during the game , that stance was altered through the garden spokesman barry watkins , checketts said he had no facetoface meeting with jackson but did contact him through an intermediary before the team s president , ernie grunfeld , was reassigned on april 21 during that time , jackson said he was interested in a position with the knicks if grunfeld and coach jeff van gundy were dismissed watkins also said checketts informed him that the former charlotte coach dave cowens and the former knick doc rivers had made inquiries with checketts it was unclear whether cowens or rivers was seeking an interview for a potential headcoaching position or the general manager s job that was once grunfeld s throughout the knicks' turbulent season , checketts maintained that he had not addressed van gundy s job with any potential candidates and that he would wait until the season ended to make a decision despite van gundy s ability to get the knicks into the playoffs , defeat the no 1seeded miami heat in the first round and take a threegamestonone lead against the hawks in their secondround series , checketts has issued no vote of confidence until he does , van gundy s job status remains an issue that he ca n't escape in an all too familiar position , van gundy was asked about his job status he would not comment on checketts s contact with jackson , other than to say , just how it is i'm just worried about atlanta van gundy , who was under extreme scrutiny , did respond when asked if his job status crossed his mind every time i'm honest , it comes back to bite me , he said van gundy s future with the knicks may be tied to more than simply his team s finish this season he has had a difficult time establishing relationships with latrell sprewell and marcus camby sprewell has been unhappy with his sixthman role , while camby has been seeking steadier minutes and a more defined role exactly how those relationships factor into checketts s thinking is unclear van gundy , whose patience has been tested by the power structure at the garden , will also have to decide if he wants to stay do n't even go there , van gundy said let s just talk about atlanta
washington , sept 16 citing executive privilege , president clinton today rejected subpoenas from congressional republicans to turn over records of private deliberations that led him to offer clemency last month to 16 members of a violent puerto rican nationalist group the white house , bolstered by an opinion from attorney general janet reno , asserted flatly that congress had no authority over the matter pursuant to the constitution and the separation of powers doctrine , the president s authority to grant clemency is not subject to legislative oversight , cheryl mills , the white house deputy counsel , wrote to representative dan burton , the indiana republican who is chairman of the committee on government reform on sept 1 , the committee issued subpoenas to the white house and the justice department seeking all interagency communications and other records relating to the president s decision ms mills also said the white house was spurning the committee s subpoena for beth nolan , the president s new chief counsel , to testify on the matter but administration officials said tonight that three other officials would appear next week at the panel s hearings , although they would not testify to matters considered confidential the white house will release about 10 , 000 pages of documents not covered by executive privilege , including thousands of letters asking the president to show leniency toward the prisoners congressional republicans reacted angrily to the rebuff mr burton accused the president of hiding behind the shield of executive privilege to avoid giving the public a full explanation of why he granted clemency to the militants , a move that mr burton said runs counter to the interests of the united states this was the fourth time the clinton administration asserted executive privilege in response to demands from congress mr burton said in an interview that while the president had a right to claim executive privilege he also had a moral obligation to tell the public why he freed people who were members of a terrorist organization that killed or maimed nearly 90 people in bombings in the 1970 s and 80 s none of the 16 offered clemency was convicted of violent acts tied to the terrorist group , faln the american people deserve an explanation , and he s thumbing his nose at them , he said republicans have privately delighted at the problems the matter has caused for hillary rodham clinton , who is almost certainly running for the senate from new york mrs clinton at first supported the clemency offer , then opposed it , incensing many puerto rican members of congress two new polls show that large majorities of voters , both nationally and in new york , disapproved of the clemency offer and more view mrs clinton s handling of the episode unfavorably than favorably mr burton said that even if administration officials refused to discuss the decisionmaking process he would issue subpoenas on friday for representatives of the justice department , the federal bureau of investigation and the bureau of prisons to appear on tuesday to provide as much documentation as they could about the prisoners' backgrounds and activities several top lawenforcement officials recommended against the clemency the senate judiciary committee also plans to issue subpoenas for documents and testimony regarding the case , said the chairman , senator orrin g hatch , the utah republican and presidential candidate myron marlin , a justice department spokesman , said the officials would appear but would not testify regarding advice given to the president or deliberative communications those to be subpoened are jon jennings , acting assistant attorney general neil gallagher , the fbi s assistant director for terrorism , and michael cooksey , an assistant director of the bureau of prisons still , joe lockhart , the white house spokesman , dismissed mr burton s action as politically motivated i do n't really know what legislative accomplishments he s had in his tenure as chairman , mr lockhart said but i can tell you that we 've gotten something like 700 subpoenas from him he has publicly stated that his mission is to get the president congressional republicans concede that the clemency matter is more or less moot now eleven of the prisoners were freed last friday two prisoners rejected the offer one accepted a deal to serve five more years , and two who had already served out jail sentences were forgiven outstanding fines still , the republicans have sought to keep the matter alive as a rare miscalculation by the president representative vito j fossella , republican of new york , said , while i recognize that the president would have a hard time justifying putting terrorists back onto america s streets , he has a fundamental responsibility to explain his actions the president said last week that he was responding to humanitarian calls for the prisoners' release , that they had served long enough , that none of them had done anyone bodily harm and that they were being punished excessively for guilt by association with terrorists his response seems to have satisfied few and only fueled his critics mrs clinton s likely senate opponent , mayor rudolph w giuliani , a republican , excoriated the president today for trying to conceal the basis of his decision he s taking a very , very questionable and bizarre situation and making it appear even more questionable and bizarre , the mayor said he has never granted clemency before in any serious case all of a sudden he does , and now he wants to not release the documents from which he made the decision mr lockhart said that mr clinton s invocation of executive privilege should not suggest anything untoward in his decisionmaking process , rejecting any suggestions that the president offered the clemency to help his wife win the support of puerto rican voters he said the president had every right to receive advice confidentially as he has in the past , mr lockhart noted that the president s decision was based on a recommendation from charles f c ruff , who was his counsel until a few weeks ago i can say absolutely and unequivocally that this case was based on the merits as presented by the former counsel , chuck ruff , and the politics of new york or anywhere did not come into play , mr lockhart asserted mr ruff has not returned phone calls on the matter mr clinton s three previous claims of privilege were in 1996 and pertained to the white house travel office firings , a memorandum to the president on drug enforcement , and policy regarding haiti
east rutherford , nj , aug 20 with remarkable timing , bill parcells traded today for a backup quarterback , rick mirer , to shore up a problematic area of the jets' offense mirer , who played against the jets in last week s loss at green bay , was not in uniform tonight as the jets squeezed out an erratic 109 exhibition victory over the eagles scott zolak , tonight s backup , played the entire second half for vinny testaverde but did little to add to his resume he led six drives , saw all of them end in punts , connected on only 10 of 22 passes for 90 yards , and was surprised to learn that mirer was his newest teammate in two preseason games , the jets' backup quarterbacks have managed only two field goals in 15 drives parcells , though , was more furious with another unit that s the worst special teams i 've seen in 15 years as a head coach , he said i'm going to tell you that if they do n't change , we have no chance we 're lightyears from being where we have to be to compete in this league right now there was a muffed punt by leon johnson that led to a philadelphia field goal , kevin williams bobbled another kick near the goal line , and the eagles managed a punt return of 34 yards and a kickoff return of 31 those are more correctible problems than not having a reliable no 2 quarterback , though so parcells brought in still another onetime starter to fix a hole mirer was once held by many to be the finest quarterback in the country as a collegian his pro career has been problematic , though with mirer s arrival , the jets finally have a backup with considerable bigleague starting experience he has started 54 games compared with 7 by zolak , 13 by punter tom tupa \( his last was in 1991 \) and none by ray lucas , all of whom are potential quarterbacks behind testaverde after the game parcells said he had been working on the deal for two weeks thus , he identified early in camp that the jets did not have a backup quarterback he was happy with in last saturday s loss at green bay , lucas replaced testaverde and directed nine drives , leading only to two field goals the trade , for an undisclosed draft pick next year it will depend on whether mirer makes the team and how effectively he plays unites parcells with one of the two quarterbacks who dominated his first draft with the new england patriots in 1993 , mirer , of notre dame , and drew bledsoe , of washington state , were the nationally acclaimed top quarterbacks but with his first overall pick of the draft , parcells chose bledsoe mirer went to the seahawks and began an erratic pro career he went to the bears in 1997 , the packers last season \( seeing no action \) , and then was expendable following a better performance by matt hasselbeck against the jets last saturday in green bay now the jets have five quarterbacks , including tupa , the versatile punter either zolak , lucas or mirer is likely to be gone soon perhaps even two of them we won the game , but seemed like we lost it , zolak said we seemed flat it was tough to come in and rally people a lot of players' jobs were on the line and we should n't have been flat as for mirer s arrival \? i 'd have liked to have heard about it from somebody here , rather than an outside source , he said while mirer s pro career has never equaled his college status , he was a starter for four years in seattle and has completed 533 percent of his passes , with 41 touchdowns and 62 interceptions thus he becomes the fifth potential impact veteran the jets have acquired since training camp began the others are the fback keith byars , receivers quinn early and dwight stone , and guard ian beckles the others are all over age 30 mirer is 29 the moves , though , show parcells s continued insistence to make quick decisions in areas that concern him at each of the positions he backed up , there were inexperienced players that worried him things work quick around here , the rookie guard randy thomas said by the time zolak made his jets debut tonight , the firstteamers had led the club to a 106 halftime edge they did it with an erratic offensive performance slowed by a testaverde interception meanwhile , the jets' firstteam defense held the eagles to the two field goals and one was positioned by a turnover when they got the ball on the 1yard line following johnson s muffed punt return testaverde , though , continued to show this summer the same command he demonstrated last year he did toss one interception that brought a look of disgust to parcells s face on the sideline but testaverde also connected on 11 of 14 attempts for 130 yards and a 12yard touchdown to wayne chrebet through threeplus quarters over two exhibition games , testaverde has hit on 22 of 27 attempts parcells was asked about mirer s soso career his response perhaps alluded to testaverde s transformation i 've seen some guys start off and have some problems , parcells said he was rookie of the year now all parcells wants is a veteran for this year extra points john hall s 24yard field goal to open the second quarter was his fourth if five tries mo lewis generated two sacks of doug pederson in the first half photos scott zolak trying to win the jets' backup quarterback job against the eagles last night he was 10 for 22 for 90 yards and could not lead the jets to a score \( associated press \) \( pg d2 \) the jets' victor green \( 21 \) trying to intercept a desperation eagles pass in the end zone that closed out the first half last night \( g paul burnett the new york times \) \( pg d1 \)

san antonio one day in march 1997 , david robinson and his wife , valerie , paid a visit to the carver community cultural center , the weatherbeaten but enduring arts institution on this city s neglected east side they had been there previously to discuss a donation to the center , which operates on a modest 14 million annual budget and was then preparing to open a capital campaign for muchneeded renovations we wanted to create something that would still be here 100 years from now , said mr robinson , best known as the center of the san antonio spurs , the national basketball association champions , who play in the alamodome , a few blocks from the carver and we wanted to do something on the east side it s a sad neighborhood , and that has always bothered me it s mostly an africanamerican neighborhood , and it s right down the street from my arena to those ends , the robinsons made a decision that was remarkable in its magnitude and abruptness they chose to build a school for neighborhood children on the grounds adjacent to the carver , with the carver name the school had been a wish of jo long , the carver s longtime director , as an appropriate crown for an institution she has nurtured almost obsessively for 23 years but it was largely a pipe dream and in any case she was unprepared for the robinsons' largesse after the march meeting the robinsons went to lunch , ms long recalled and they called me an hour and a half later and said , 'ok , we 're going to give you 5 million for this school' i was speechless i got up and came home and the next day they delivered a check for 75 , 000 to start the master planning in recognition of the gift , on wednesday mr robinson , 34 , is to receive the montblanc de la culture award , one of a series of annual honors for philanthropy in the arts bestowed around the world by montblanc , the german pen makers for the carver , however , and for ms long in particular , the story has a be careful what you wish for element as well the ceremonial groundbreaking is to be held on monday for a new institution , the carver complex , encompassing a 6 million renovation and expansion of the carver cultural center and a 280student independent elementary school to be known as the carver academy , all of which has been set in motion by mr robinson s 5 million but ms long , 49 , who is something of a local legend , will not be there she is at home recovering from a breakdown , leaving the carver leaderless at a crucial time it is uncertain when , or if , she will return i believe the stress of this effort contributed to her disability , said isaiah t creswell , the chairman of the arts center board , known as the carver development board it was an assessment with which ms long , who spent a month in the hospital this summer being treated for bipolar disorder , concurred it was just after the delivery of the first 75 , 000 , ms long said , that the carver began acquiring the property for the academy six months later as she was being named by texas monthly as one of the 20 most influential texans , the robinson gift was announced to the public that , she said , was the start of my anxiety the strain on ms long and the carver has to do with the problem of what happens to a small institution when it faces the kind of change that the robinson gift has engendered there is no precedent in the carver s history for the kind of fundraising , money management , land acquisition or capital construction required by the new project the general situation is complicated by the carver s idiosyncrasies its historical significance to san antonio s black population \( less than 8 percent of the city s approximately 1 million people \) , its current significance to the poor and underserved area where it stands and its unusual relationship to the city government , which finances more than half of its budget through the city s social services arm , the department of community initiatives the city would ultimately like to trim its financing of the carver , but any moves along these lines have been successfully fought by the local community , and ms long , who say the city pays far too little attention to the east side as it is the carver is the east side landmark , a place where the likes of ella fitzgerald and paul robeson performed it began life in the early part of the century as a segregated library and meeting hall the current building , erected in 1929 , has an inscription over the side door identifying it as the colored branch of the san antonio library it served that function until the city was desegregated in the 1960 s ms long arrived in 1976 , just three years after the city , to neighborhood outrage , threatened to demolish the building \( one woman actually lay down in front of the bulldozers \) under her guidance the carver has presented , mostly in its 650seat , poorly ventilated auditorium , a diverse series of dance , theater and musical performances the performance artist danny hoch , the jazz pianist ahmad jamal and the donald byrd dance company were among its offerings last season the center also conducts workshops and classes in performing and fine arts and it is also still used for such varied activities as meetings , beauty pageants , weddings and even the occasional funeral

no doubt somewhere passions still rage over political ideas as distinguished from practical politics , but their celebration in a twohour television documentary through the careers of four new york academics is not the usual stuff of prime time yet political ideas are what arguing the world , being shown on pbs this week after a brief run in theaters last year , is all about it can be seen at midnight tonight on channel 13 and tomorrow night at 9 on other pbs stations no , joseph dorman s evocative program is not competing with the three tenors few viewers , even among the relatively educated and aging cadre whose dials are preset to public television , are likely to find irving howe , irving kristol , daniel bell and nathan glazer household names it s been a lifetime since the issues that brought arias from this city college quartet could get much of a rise even among dedicated intellectuals in their preworld war ii ccny years , the four hung around alcove 1 in the college cafeteria , a gathering place for disputatious antistalinists since none of these children of immigrants , who had settled in brooklyn and the bronx , had cash to spare for lunch , they brownbagged it but their real feast was on marxism , especially of the trotskyite variety the program s photographs capture the grubby yet aspiring spirit of the place and the time as evidenced by norman podhoretz s recent book about his own fallingouts with norman mailer , lillian hellman , allen ginsberg and lionel and diana trilling , such matters are today consigned to frienddropping memoirs , and pretty confined ones at that mr podhoretz , a decade or so younger than the howekristol band , is among the last surviving witnesschroniclers of a fierce intellectual and cultural combat that few americans even knew was going on most of the combatants , with the notable and often noted exception of the sovietphiliac hellman , fired shot and shell against stalinism and in behalf of modernist writers \( howe recalls reading proust and joyce while the middlebrow communists were relishing palookas like howard fast \) whatever the numbers of mr podhoretz s readers or the viewers of arguing the world , the accounts of a war on the left between communists and anticommunists still carries considerable ideological weight by comparison with what mostly passes as ideas on television and elsewhere at their most respectable , the sunday morning network gettogethers tend to be mainly about personalities and shortterm confrontations , a brand of journalism lite where mr kristol once delivered polemics in littleread magazines on the failings of liberalism , over at widely watched abc his son , bill , now analyzes campaign tactics it has been suggested that with the passing of hitler and stalin , the world has run out of momentous matter , leaving an electorate that was once invited to choose between franklin d roosevelt and herbert hoover to search out distinctions between george w bush and lamar alexander or between al gore and bill bradley distinctions that somehow do not stir the blood the flickerings of substantive disagreement in the recent impeachment arguments were soon extinguished by the intellectual limitations and rhetorical ineptitude of congressional managers who could not manage to tell the difference between principle and platitude ah , if only henry hyde , who resorted to tattered battlefield rousers from henry v , had had the benefit of a city college education after college , the documentary s heroes gravitated to academe but dispersed ideologically howe , who died in 1993 , remained a social democrat while mr kristol became a scout for the reaganesque right professor bell and professor glazer continued to consider themselves more or less liberals by the 1960 s , all were confronted with a new generation of ideological foes on the new left , who have since found their way to history s dustbin passionprovoking issues and irreconcilable doctrines have not altogether vanished from america , perhaps the most persistent being the abortion standoff , which still rallies true believers but missing from public discourse are the overarching theories like marxism or assertions of power like fascism with their implications for the fate of the world such were the ingredients that gave the 1930 s their dangerous excitement nowadays americans may disagree about how to deal with china or russia , but such divisions cut nowhere nearly as deeply as the war in spain did among a consequential minority an age ago it was far easier to carry signs against fascists in the 1930 s than it is now to figure out how to handle the bad guys in serbia or rwanda so the issues that stimulated the ccny achievers are no longer in fashion it is left to a nutty loner or some fringe fanatics to break forth in a grand cause , even if means blowing up innocent people mainstream opinion tends toward dampening conflict , particularly when the stakes are fancy theories that seem unconnected to quotidian existence whether that is a sign of maturity or civility or , more probably , evidence that the nation would just rather relax , theories do not summon masses from the television set to the barricades well , there is a lot to be said for the absence of a hitler and a stalin and the emotions they incited maybe the nation ought to be grateful for being spared interesting times and just accept the players in arguing the world as adornments of a moment in 20thcentury history when political ideas seemed important and a few people believed that what they thought about them mattered photo daniel bell , left , and nathan glazer at harvard university last year , from the film arguing the world \( nina davenport \)
washington , nov 22 the further al gore tries to distance himself from bill clinton , the closer the republicans want to link him that is why the republican national committee is putting up a billboard that shows the president and vice president in a bear hug the committee is planning to rotate a series of images at a site across the street from mr gore s presidential campaign headquarters in nashville the first one shows mr gore and mr clinton embracing stamped across the front is a reminder of mr gore s tribute on the day last year that the house voted for impeachment that mr clinton would go down in history as one of the country s greatest presidents we want to turn some heads , said jim nicholson , chairman of the committee it s a pretty stark reminder of his close relationship with the president mr nicholson said the picture would convey quickly and graphically that mr gore is deeply associated with the president , who enjoys favorable jobapproval ratings but , as mr nicholson put it , is disdained on a personal level , and that s rubbing off on gore it is also intended to remind viewers that mr gore has undertaken a headspinning process of separating himself from the president while trying to benefit from being part of the administration some days he solidly embraces the president and some days he does n't , mr nicholson said al gore does n't know who al gore is and what he should be today vice president or presidential aspirant he ca n't decide who he is and what he stands for the republicans expect to rent the billboard , which is to be in place in the next two weeks , through march mr gore moved his campaign headquarters last month from washington to nashville by renting the billboard , the republicans are inadvertently paying mr gore the compliment that he will most likely be the democratic nominee , elevating him at this early stage to generalelection status as their opponent but first mr gore faces a tough challenge from former senator bill bradley of new jersey some republicans have said they believe that mr bradley would appeal to voters in both parties and to independents , and would be a tougher opponent next november commenting on the billboard , chris lehane , a spokesman for mr gore , said the billboard is telling in what it does not show , and that is the republican agenda , because there is none al gore and the campaign look forward to talking about the vice president s record of success and his vision for the future , and comparing it with what the republicans are offering , which is no vision , no message , no ideas photo the first in a series of republican advertisements that will run outside al gore s nashville headquarters
students at duke university and georgetown university held raucous protests on friday against a proposed code of conduct for apparel makers that they say does too little to insure that products bearing the names of their schools are not made in sweatshops at duke , 100 students held a rally and then about 30 staged a sitin at the president s office with many students even sleeping there to demand that the school not sign the code of conduct at georgetown , more than 100 students demonstrated and several got into a noisy argument with the dean over the code , developed by a licensing company the students at duke and georgetown , two traditional basketball powers whose names are bestsellers on sports gear , attacked the code for not requiring disclosure of the names and addresses of all factories making products bearing the schools' names the students insisted that such disclosure was needed to enable independent monitors , like human rights groups , to determine whether factory conditions were adequate duke has about 700 licensees that make tshirts , caps and other apparel at hundreds of plants in the united states and in more than 10 other countries it s important for us to know where the factories are because then people will be able to monitor them to make sure they 're not sweatshops , said kyle crafton , a duke senior who is a member of students against sweatshops the protests are directed at the code being developed by the collegiate licensing company , an atlanta company that helps more than 100 schools license their names for apparel collegiate , the nation s largest schoollicensing company , is working with universities to develop a consensus code that sets minimum rules for licensees' factories , like a maximum 60hour work week we 're very proud of the work we 're doing , and we have no apologies to make to anybody , said bruce b siegal , the licensing company s general counsel but benjamin smith , president of the georgetown solidarity committee , which organized the protest , criticized the code for not requiring factories to pay workers a living wage that is sufficient to support their families it s not enough to pay the minimum wage in these countries , mr smith said , because the minimum wage is often set very low to attract investment and often is not adequate to meet the nutritional needs of workers' families the code has become an emotional issue at duke because last march the university adopted the nation s strictest code for licensees , with students applauding the university s president , nannerl o keohane but the new code , which the school is under industry and peer pressure to accept , is not as strict and would supersede duke s code the duke code calls for disclosing the names of factories and for paying a living wage the new code requires no such disclosure , although it sets up a monitoring system for factories and it calls for paying whichever is higher , a country s minimum wage or the prevailing industry wage where a factory is located mr siegal defended the code , saying apparel companies strongly oppose making them disclose the names and addresses of the factories they contract with to make apparel the companies fear that identifying their factories will enable competitors to use their favored factories and maneuver to end their longstanding relationships with their factories duke officials were puzzling over how to handle the sitin , especially if it continued through the weekend nonetheless , john f burness , duke s senior vice president for public affairs , said the school respected its students' commitment president keohane has consistently said that we believe the code is not as strong as we would prefer , particularly in regards to disclosure and wages , mr burness said we believe , as president keohane reiterated to students on friday , that in effect getting part of the loaf is better than getting none of the loaf and that the revised code , with its recognized weaknesses , is better than having no code at all duke officials said they hoped that after signing the code , they could work with other schools to improve it but tico almeida , the senior who led the protest , said it s disheartening that duke is settling for the weaker code we understand that there are times to compromise , that it s ok to compromise when you 're getting the good instead of the great but this code is too flawed it s not even good
it was a glorious spring day for baseball in providence , ri , last saturday , in which the home team , the providence college friars , was about to play the villanova wildcats the welloccupied metal bleachers sparkled under the noon sun fans had set up beach chairs behind the screen and spread out blankets on the grass beyond the leftfield line at hendricken field the dust from the tan infield had been hosed down by some of the players themselves in their white uniforms so why the sadness \? why the anger \? why the passion \? and where was father smith \? after what happened , said barry sullivan , an allamerica baseball player for providence in the 1970 s , referring to the college president , you 'd think he 'd have the guts to show his face this was the 78th season of providence college baseball , making it the school s oldest athletic team this season , the friars are rated best in the northeast and 26th in the nation in a poll of coaches they came into saturday s game with a 4213 record , two victories short of the school record , and were assured of being seeded in the big east tournament , which begins today in trenton it is one of the best baseball seasons in school history , and it will be its last last october , the rev philip a smith , the school president , announced that baseball , along with men s golf and tennis , would be eliminated from the varsity athletic program he said the cuts were made in order to comply with gender equity and proportionality strictures set down by the national collegiate athletic association , driven by the federal office of civil rights i'm still so upset that i can hardly express it , said angelo ciminiello , the senior third baseman , an academic allamerican for four years who will soon be going to medical school shortly after the announcement was made , three players transferred to other schools but the rest of the team decided to stay , to play , perhaps with a commitment that they never had before at one stage , they won a schoolrecord 15 straight games before the game against villanova , each player and coach was introduced , their team contributions briefly noted by a young announcer on the crackling pa system the team heard and saw the fans standing and clapping for this last home game it was so emotional , mike scott , the freshman rightfielder , said later i had tingles all up and down my body the friars fell behind by 10 in the fourth , tied the score in the bottom of the inning , only to fall behind in the fifth , 21 again , they mounted a rally in the bottom half of the inning and took a 32 lead it s amazing what this team has done , said lou merloni , a former providence infielder who was with the boston red sox early this season , before having been sent to the pawtucket farm team the other day he had come to lend his support on this last home game and it s so sad i feel like something has been ripped out of my insides but this team has never quit , even when the school quit on them smith sees his decision differently i do not feel good about the decision to drop baseball , but in the end we had to have our academic priorities come first , he said on monday we tried other ways , but nothing else worked it seemed we 'd be taking from peter to pay paul , and still falling short ultimately i had to make this unfortunate decision the baseball team also has the support of female athletes at providence , who were angered by the decision when the announcement was made about eliminating baseball , the women athletes were as mad about it as anyone else , said michelle hackmer , a junior on the swimming team , who attended the game sure , we want women athletes to be treated fairly , but at this expense \? i do n't think this is what title ix was supposed to be about the day after the announcement , the women s volleyball team had a game at home , and threatened to boycott the game they did n't , but to show their support to the men they warmed up in the baseball team s jerseys the women s sports foundation has issued a position paper on title ix and the elimination of men s varsity sports in that regard most schools cite , as the reason for their decision , the need to reduce expenditures in order to provide opportunities for women , it reads title ix requires no such reduction in opportunities for men the foundation is not in favor of reducing athletic opportunities for men as the preferred method of achieving title ix compliance enrollment at providence is 59 percent women , and 41 percent men but 57 percent of the athletes are men , with the men receiving the majority of athletic scholarships at providence , there will soon be 11 women s varsity teams to go along with 9 men s varsity teams the ncaa insisted on 1 percent gender equity proportionality , meaning that the percentage of female students and the money spent on their sports must be within 1 percent of each other participation of women in sports continues to trail enrollment rates of women at many colleges , according to the chronicle of higher education nationally , women constitute 53 percent of the undergraduates on division i campuses , but only 40 percent of their athletes
a class action lawsuit filed yesterday on behalf of mentally ill inmates in city jails charges that the city and its medical provider on rikers island routinely release patients who have received mental treatment behind bars without making any provision for continuing their mental health care and medication in the community the lawsuit , filed in state supreme court in manhattan by legal advocates for the mentally ill , cited as plaintiffs seven current inmates with extensive histories of serious mental illness and criminal arrest who have repeatedly been released to the streets without any planning for continued care about 25 , 000 inmates with mental illnesses are discharged each year from city jails without referrals or plans for them to get treatment or support services , the lawsuit said typically , the mentally ill are discharged in the same way as other rikers inmates they are dropped off in queens plaza between 2 and 6 in the morning , with 150 in cash and a twofare metrocard the lawsuit charges that this kind of discharge violates state laws , including those requiring hospitals and other providers of health care to plan for needed treatment after discharge because many of the mentally ill inmates are unable to find support or treatment on their own , they often deteriorate and commit new offenses , the lawsuit said city officials at the departments of health , mental health and corrections , the human resources administration and the city s health and hospitals corporation , all named as defendants in the lawsuit , said they could not comment on pending litigation gerald mckelvey , a spokesman for st barnabas hospital in the bronx , which provides medical and mental health care to rikers inmates under contract to the city and is also a defendant , said he could not comment because the hospital had not yet been served with the legal papers but in a telephone interview last week , dr john burgess , st barnabas s director of mental health at the jail , said part of the problem is that the city often discontinues the medicaid insurance coverage of the mentally ill while they are in jail often because the inmates fail to keep up with paperwork requirements the problem with that is after they 're released , they have no way of paying for medication and no way of getting care in most community clinics because they have no medicaid and no ability to pay , dr burgess said it would certainly help if the city could have a better procedure for that so we could make sure they had a prescription when they left rikers a prescription they could get filled using medicaid the plaintiffs , identified by pseudonyms in the lawsuit , include brad h , a 44yearold homeless man with schizophrenia who grew up in a psychiatric hospital and has been treated for mental illness each of 26 times he has been jailed as an adult , most recently for jumping a subway turnstile on none of these occasions , the lawsuit charges , did anyone plan for how the man would continue to receive medication and other mental health services on his release from jail , or how he would obtain medicaid benefits , social security disability payments , or supportive housing another plaintiff , called robert k , was described in the suit as a 38yearold schizophrenic drug offender who hears voices commanding him to do things , has tried to commit suicide and who has been arrested about 30 times , twice for assault every time he has been arrested , he has received treatment for his mental illness in the units set aside for the mentally ill in the city s jails but no one at rikers island , where he is now jailed , has assisted robert k in determining how he will continue his treatment upon release , the lawsuit said a third plaintiff , kevin w , 36 , was most recently accused of wielding a knife in the subway despite a diagnosis of schizophrenia and cocaine addiction and three episodes of inpatient treatment during prior incarcerations , the lawsuit said , he has never been able to continue his treatment after discharge , in part because he has never received medicaid insurance coverage as an adult public concern over the dangerously mentally ill spurred gov george e pataki and state lawmakers to agree earlier this month on legislation giving the courts new authority to order former mental patients to comply with treatment or face rehospitalization but lawyers at the urban justice center , the nonprofit advocacy organization that brought the lawsuit , said the new law , which carries no financing until april 2000 , does not address the larger problem of jail inmates like the plaintiffs , many of whom serve sentences for the same kinds of misdemeanors again and again we really are moving the hospitals into the jails , said heather barr , a lawyer at the urban justice center , which brought the lawsuit with assistance from new york lawyers for the public interest and lawyers from debevoise plimpton working free expanded mental health services on rikers island include nine mental observation units capable of housing up to 625 inmates at a time if they are seriously mentally ill , seriously depressed or at high risk for suicide in addition , each year a separate center on rikers island houses 1 , 200 disturbed male inmates considered too ill for the mental observation units they receive aroundtheclock psychiatric , medical and nursing care for an average stay of 60 days a third center , the behavior modification unit in the bronx , each year handles about 150 male rikers inmates who are considered too disturbed and aggressive for the center though all such inmates are probably eligible for medicaid on their release , obtaining coverage is a complicated process that can take weeks and is often daunting to the mentally healthy , ms barr noted , adding that as the city has tried to divert people from public assistance into jobs , the hurdles to get and keep medicaid have multiplied but medicaid is usually necessary to obtain scarce community mental health services , like supportive housing
beijing , jan 18 as they very publicly send the most outspoken democracy campaigners to prison , china s leaders have also quietly tightened the screws on liberal intellectuals , journalists and publications in the last few weeks the communist party s powerful department of propaganda has closed down an influential book publisher in beijing and an adventurous newspaper in the southern city of guangzhou it has sent stern warnings to some magazines and newspapers that strayed too far from the prescribed line , forced some editors and writers out of their jobs and halted distribution of several books that delve into political alternatives or embarrassing episodes in the history of communist rule although some writings and meetings that are relatively free by china s standards continue , the campaign reflects the leadership s concern for stability as it confronts rising unemployment and protests by workers and farmers officials may also be worried about dissent related to the 10th anniversary this june of the violent smashing of prodemocracy demonstrations in tiananmen square and the 50th anniversary of the founding of the people s republic of china on oct 1 in the last year , liberals who want more open discussion of political alternatives have been testing the limits of public discourse but in recent interviews , many scholars , magazine editors and journalists said they now sensed a shrinking of the boundaries none of those interviewed said they believed that china was in the throes of an allout crackdown or a major shift in policy like the one in late 1989 that followed the suppression of the tiananmen square protests , when liberals were purged from many institutions since many books , magazines and newspapers touch on sensitive topics these days , the repressive measures to date seem almost arbitrary they have not been mentioned in the press here but word spreads quickly , and the authorities may hope that by setting examples they will induce others to exercise new caution i do n't think there will be a general crackdown on liberal intellectuals , said one such scholar , liu junning , a political theorist with the chinese academy of social sciences and editor of a journal on political thought but they may tighten up on publications , making it more difficult for people to get their ideas out some intellectuals interviewed said that in today s china , with burgeoning outlets for publishing , so many intellectuals chafing to explore new ideas and so many eager readers , the government probably lacked the ability to suppress debate altogether the internet and electronic mail , for example , have given many chinese new access to unauthorized writing even before the recent setbacks , writers could not directly discuss multiparty politics or the possibility of ending the communist party s monopoly on power still , the last year has been a relatively loose period , with more books frankly discussing issues like corruption , crime , the effects of different economic strategies and in a guarded , theoretical way the nature of democracy such books , in turn , have served as the basis for seminars at universities and bookstores only a small number of those books that the government sees as most objectionable have been directly curbed many newspapers and magazines around the country have explored similar topics and exposed local corruption and policy failures the publications campaign is directed by the party s department of propaganda , under the leadership of ding guangen , a onetime bridge partner of the late leader deng xiaoping who has become president jiang zemin s chief ideological enforcer a joke that plays on the phonetic elements of mr ding s name has been circulating among intellectuals , who say he has a talent for three things ding , which can mean keeping watch guan , which can mean closing down , and gen , which can mean rooting out perhaps the most farreaching act was the suspension in early january of operations of one of china s boldest and most influential book publishers pending rectification of the staff two top editors at the company , china today publishers , have been ordered to write selfcriticisms a timehonored communist technique for forcing wayward individuals to acknowledge ideological errors said people familiar with the situation , who spoke on condition of anonymity china today publishers , based in beijing and operating under the authority of an information unit of the communist party , issued several of last year s most widely discussed books , including china s pitfall , a withering analysis of corruption in the dismantling of state enterprises crossed swords , a strong attack on the remaining opponents of the country s move toward a market economy and looser social control and political china , a collection of essays on political change by scholars and former officials in the case of political china , which quickly sold out its first printing of 30 , 000 last fall , the authorities forbade a second printing other books from the publisher have not been quashed in this manner

montreal , feb 3 the head is still shaved the square jaw juts out as defiantly as ever mark messier , at age 38 , still propels himself up ice with the same powerful strides that were one of his trademarks as a ranger that , and guaranteeing playoff victories but playoff victories will be unlikely this season the canucks \( 3122 in the past 17 games \) are in danger of missing the postseason for the second consecutive season ever since they acquired messier as a free agent the canucks are young , rebuilding and woeful it is obvious that messier does not fit in , even though he picked up an assist in a 21 loss tonight to the canadiens he played 23 minutes 39 seconds in the game and his 28 shifts were the most of any forward from either team there is little question that the future hall of famer has lost a bit of his legendary ferocity messier , who suffered the first serious concussion of his 20year career earlier this season , seems reluctant to charge into the corners and trade high elbows but he leads the team in scoring 13 goals and 29 assists just as another 38yearold legend , wayne gretzky , leads the rangers while every game has become important to messier , none will be quite as emotional as thursday night s contest at madison square garden against the rangers it will never be past that kind of emotional stage , said messier , who cried last season during a pregame celebration on videotape of his six seasons in new york and then went out and scored the winning goal the ruts that line his cragged face seem more pronounced than they were when messier was captain of the rangers and the soul of their 1994 stanley cup champions , who became the organization s first cup winners in 54 years messier was asked today if he recalled what could have been had the rangers decided that they should have resigned him to play alongside gretzky again for more than only one year , one in which they surprisingly reached the 1997 stanley cup semifinals before injuries and a younger flyers team defeated them in five games i think you 'd have to ask those questions to the people making decisions , messier said messier s relationship with his former general manager , neil smith , is obviously a subject that still bothers a player whose influence over his teammates was so strong that he was called captain dad there were many who felt that influence and the way that messier successfully held out for a new contract after the rangers won the cup \( something his thencontract stipulated he could do \) may have caused some resentment by smith and hastened messier s departure when asked today how he felt about smith s current plight running a team that also is in danger of missing the playoffs , messier bristled and said , i do n't have any feelings whatsoever then there is messier s relationship with gretzky the two first met as teenagers and grew up together as they helped create a dynasty in edmonton and messier seemed elated when gretzky signed with the rangers in the summer of 1996 but there are those in the rangers' organization who have suggested that gretzky resented messier s leaving after they only had one season together and some close to messier seem to feel that gretzky distanced himself from messier when messier was trying to negotiate with the rangers before he opted for a guaranteed 3year , 20 million deal with vancouver messier retains much closer ties to brian leetch and mike richter , his two best friends during his rangers years when asked what he thought of the rangers' reluctance to negotiate with leetch , who is in the final year of his contract , during this season , messier who knew the feeling himself quipped well , it s pretty similar with what they did with richter , too at least they 're consistent shortly after his arrival in vancouver , the coach \( tom renney \) and captain \( trevor linden \) were gone along came mike keenan , messier s controversial old coach on the rangers' 1994 team messier went out of his way to stress keenan s importance to that team mike , i do n't think , ever got enough credit for what happened in '94 because of all the things that happened directly after us winning , messier said , referring to the power struggle with smith that keenan eventually lost but we would n't have won without mike making all the deals he did at the trading deadline the problem in vancouver was that keenan did not win enough , despite all the deals he and the thengeneral manager , pat quinn , made still , vancouver struggled and once brian burke succeeded quinn \( who had signed messier \) this past off season , keenan knew it was only a matter of time burke took his time in dealing the disgruntled star forward , pavel bure the canucks floundered and on jan 24 , two games after bure was finally dealt to florida , keenan was replaced by the former colorado coach , marc crawford now , there is talk that messier who is guaranteed 6 million for next season plus a 2 million buyout for 20001 might be the next to go , perhaps to somewhere like dallas , a team that is set to make a run at its first stanley cup yes , i hear all the rumors and all that , said messier , who has six stanley cup rings all to himself but unless somebody knows something that i do n't , i'm not really interested in going anywhere i 'd find a lot more

washington , oct 19 president clinton and republican congressional leaders took the first step tonight toward striking a deal on the federal budget , meeting at the white house for more than 90 minutes and promising to work diligently toward a final agreement over the next week or so neither side made any concessions tonight and no specific differences were bridged but both sides said that the mere fact that the president and the republicans could meet cordially and discuss common goals , despite their mutual mistrust and distaste , was a sign of progress what we did today was start the clock on the week when things will get done , jack lew , the president s budget director , said in an interview after the meeting mr lew said that he would be on capitol hill on wednesday to begin working on the differences with congressional budget writers speaker j dennis hastert called the session a very positive meeting senator trent lott of mississippi , the republican leader , said , now we 've got to roll up our sleeves the president and the republicans agreed , the officials said , that no money raised from social security taxes would be used for purposes other than paying social security benefits or retiring government bonds republicans have been insisting for months that as a matter of principle they would not dip into the surplus in social security money to pay for other programs the congressional budget office calculates that spending bills still working their way through congress would rely on the surplus republican leaders maintain that if that is the case , the bills will be changed the president s budget does not rely on social security money to pay for other programs , and he has said all along that if republicans do not want to tap that money , it is fine with him the congressional leaders agreed tonight to send the chairmen of the various appropriations subcommittees to meet with the president if he thought that would help resolve specific points of disagreement mr lew said the president noted that government s interest costs in the years ahead would be lower as the national debt was paid down and recommended that these savings in debt service be dedicated to bolstering the social security trust fund mr lew said republicans did not reject this proposal but the talk of progress tonight masked the wide differences between the two sides and in some instances , the congressional leaders and white house officials had different versions of what was said for example , the republicans said the president had agreed that no tax increases would be part of any budget deal john d podesta , the white house chief of staff , said that the president had conceded that the cigarette tax increase of 55 cent per pack he has proposed might not be possible but that mr clinton still thought a smaller tobacco tax increase should be on the table in addition , there was no hint as to how some of the fundamental divisions on policy could be resolved among the main differences are these congress has rejected the president s proposal for spending federal education money to reduce class sizes and hire more teachers the republicans want the money to go to the states in block grants to be spent as the states wish lawmakers have insisted on dozens of provisions in the interior department spending bill that are favored by oil , cattle and mining interests and that the administration believes would damage the environment congress has rejected an appropriation the president sought for more community police officers furthermore , there is a big difference between the two sides on how the budget questions should be addressed in the remainder of the year mr hastert said , for instance , that he favored the regular order of considering each spending bill separately the president and democrats in congress prefer combining most or all of the remaining matters in one big bill that the president could then either sign or veto of the 13 spending bills to finance the various departments and agencies of the government in the fiscal year that began oct 1 , five have become law , and the president plans to sign a sixth for veterans and housing on wednesday two bills , one for foreign operations and the other for the district of columbia , have been vetoed congress has completed action on bills to finance the defense and agriculture departments white house officials say the president will not decide whether to sign or reject these measures until he sees how other bills are worked out the final three bills one for the departments of labor , education and health and human services , one for the interior department and one for the departments of commerce , state and justice have created considerable controversy in congress , and the white house has said the president will veto them unless they are significantly changed from where they now stand officials from both sides said they thought the differences over the foreign operations bill could be worked out the president vetoed the 126 billion measure on monday on the ground that it allocated 2 billion less than he requested and provided none of the money he sought to facilitate the middle east peace accord negotiated last year at wye river , md the officials also said the republicans had agreed to work with mr clinton to find an acceptable way that the united states could pay its debt to the united nations , which exceeds 1 billion since oct 1 , government offices have been running on a temporary spending measure that expires on thursday today , the house and senate voted to extend the deadline for eight days , until oct 29 , and the president said he would sign the extension as if to stick their fingers in the president s eye before the meeting , house leaders today called up for a vote the 20 billion in tax increases and user fees that were in the budget the president proposed in january the leaders knew the revenueraising proposals could never pass as a standalone measure , and to no one s surprise , they were rejected , 419 to 0 representative dick armey , the majority leader , said the measure was brought up to get this question settled once and for all any idea you can solve this problem the easy way by going back and raising taxes photo speaker j dennis hastert described a budget meeting yesterday with president clinton as very positive

washington , jan 6 in its antitrust trial today , the microsoft corporation made its most concerted effort yet to convince a federal judge that the recently announced deal that brings together three of its rivals america online inc , the netscape communications corporation and sun microsystems inc seriously weakens the government s case in a threeway deal announced in late november , america online agreed to buy netscape for 42 billion and made a side agreement to buy and jointly develop technology with sun last month , judge thomas penfield jackson , who will decide the outcome of this nonjury trial , expressed the view that the deal might be a very significant change in the playing field as far as this industry is concerned during today s crossexamination of the government s last witness , franklin m fisher , an economist , microsoft s legal team presented as evidence comments made by executives of the three companies who characterized the deal as sure to strengthen their competitive muscle in software used to browse the world wide web , in electronic commerce and in internet technology all areas of headtohead competition with microsoft a microsoft lawyer , michael lacovara , repeatedly tried to get mr fisher to concede that the triumvirate of rivals with ambitious plans for the future did indeed pose a genuine threat to microsoft s dominance in the personal computer software business at times , mr fisher would give an inch or two , saying , for example , that moves planned by the three companies were a hopeful sign that they might some day be a counterweight to microsoft but each time he was challenged , mr fisher returned to his view that microsoft has a monopoly in the personal computer operating system market with its windows family of products and that it has illegally used its market power to defend that monopoly none of this , mr fisher replied at one point , affects my conclusions mr lacovara prodded mr fisher repeatedly to admit that the emerging technology championed by the group the combination of sun s java software , an internet programming language , and netscape s web browser could pose a serious challenge to microsoft in the long run mr fisher allowed that it was difficult to predict what might happen yet any such challenge will not come soon , he said , adding , i do n't think it will happen at all if microsoft is permitted to go on as it has microsoft insists that the america onlinenetscapesun deal fundamentally changes the competitive landscape and undermines a linchpin claim in the government s case that microsoft has a resilient monopoly this deal was the shot heard around the world , in the industry , by the public and in this courthouse , said william h neukom , the microsoft senior vice president for law and corporate affairs today , judge jackson gave another signal that he is weighing the impact of the threecompany deal on the case he interrupted the crossexamination of mr fisher to directly ask his opinion about a column this morning on the oped page of the washington post by david ignatius , based largely on an interview with stephen m case , the chairman of america online in it , mr ignatius quotes mr case as saying that the deal is not intended to mount a challenge to microsoft s mainstay , the windows operating system , which controls the basic operations of more than 90 percent of personal computers sold today aol s merger with netscape has no bearing on the microsoft case , as nothing we 're doing is competitive with windows , mr case was quoted as saying we have no flight of fancy that we can dent in any way , shape or form what is a monopoly in the operating system business after reading the quotations , judge jackson asked mr fisher if he agreed with that view of the deal i certainly do , mr fisher replied judge jackson then asked lawyers for both microsoft and the justice department whether they planned to call mr case as a witness another america online executive , david m colburn , has already appeared as a witness for the government mr case is not on the 12person witness lists for either side , but he could be called as one of the two additional witnesses allowed to each side after microsoft presents its defense , which is expected to begin early next week both microsoft and the government told the judge that they would wait until microsoft had presented its defense , expected to last six to eight weeks , before naming their two socalled redirect witnesses later , on the courthouse steps , david boies , the lead trial lawyer for the justice department , made no commitment , but he said mr case would be a useful witness for the government he s very knowledgeable , mr boies said , and microsoft is pinning a lot of hopes on the effect of that merger
london the special relationship is beginning to look awfully onesided for years , the assumption has been that new york and london enjoyed a uniquely symbiotic rapport , so that a major success in one city could be counted on to open and be appreciated in the other ask an english theatergoer of a certain age , and one hears of the defining impact made in london by the original broadway productions \( occasionally with their new york leads \) of company , west side story or even oklahoma ! both annie get your gun and the sound of music had longer initial runs on the west end than they did on broadway and while british drama of , say , the 1950 s could seem stuffy and classbound , the american work of the same period was seismically invigorating i was in love with the american theater before i fell in love with theater as a whole , richard eyre , the former artistic director of the royal national theater , has said the british stuff seemed incredibly etiolated , extremely bloodless , he recalled of the playwriting he knew growing up whereas with o'neill and tennessee williams , suddenly , he said , drama had fangs how ironic , then , that the english nowadays regard so much american drama as toothless and readily bare their own fangs to dismember many a new york hit to be sure , williams , o'neill and arthur miller are still revered , with mr miller joining sam shepard , david mamet and , occasionally , stephen sondheim among a handful of american writers to enjoy honorary englishman status but members of the subsequent generations must go it alone , as must any shepardmamet contemporary terrence mcnally , for example who has had the misfortune of arriving in london with a play that has already had commercial success in new york more than one west end producer has remarked that the phrase broadway hit seems to be anathema to london critics they apparently prefer to nurture homegrown stars like david hare or tom stoppard or even discover american playwrights like tony kushner or phyllis nagy for themselves rather than follow a parade that originated elsewhere yet the american appetite for english work appears only to intensify over time , as this new york theater season bears out so it can be dismaying when the traffic is reversed to find that the enthusiasm is not sometimes it s enough merely to cite a show s origins , with a single place name , to speak pejorative volumes you can take a show out of new york but you cannot take new york out of the show , john peter in the sunday times of london wrote of the west end opening last may of the american musical rent , before deriding the late jonathan larson s wellmeaning but oppressive political correctness that sometimes makes you recoil in despair \( mr peter s review was gentle three of his colleagues went so far as to imply , however facetiously , that mr larson s death before the new york production had even opened was a canny career move \) conversely , the musical chicago , currently on broadway and in the west end , received glowing notices in london , but that is a show that portrays americans as hardedged and cynical everything the singularly openhearted rent , for all its real flaws , does not in a review of the vagina monologues , the solo piece by eve ensler that the american writer and actress is performing at the king s head theater through march 7 , nick curtis wrote in the evening standard the tone is an uneasy mixture of the wry and the wrenching , of sitdown comedy and theater as therapy then the dig oh , and it comes from new york , in case you had n't guessed even a writer of edward albee s eminence is n't necessarily spared in london last september for the world premiere of his very fine play about the baby , he must have looked on with some surprise as the british reviews appeared almost uniformly hostile , while those from american critics were almost uniformly positive given the opprobrium heaped upon him over time back home , mr albee could be forgiven for perhaps anticipating the opposite response the more prizes a show has won in the united states three seasons ago , for example , rent won both the pulitzer prize for drama and the tony award for best musical the more that seems to irk the british we do n't like huge hoopla and success , said jonathan kent , coartistic director of the almeida theater in north london , a company that has tended to present american plays \( the play about the baby and ellen mclaughlin s tongue of a bird , among them \) before they reach new york when a show comes trailing every award known to man , we get nervous in new york , by contrast , mr kent said , all success becomes their success it becomes universal that s what is enlivening about working there but , he cautioned , referring to the city s hitflop mentality , that s also what s dangerous accordingly , the london response to new york hits , whether large scale or small , can be grudging at best , fierce at worst
dili , east timor , sept 25 when marcos napoleao soares returned today to his burnedout house he walked on a carpet of soft grey ash the place he called his sweet home was gone blackened , empty , partly roofless , filled with the rustling of the cool bamboo trees outside but for the moment , none of that seemed to matter right now , said mr soares , 27 , the most valuable thing we have lost is my mother , my sisters , and my two small brothers every person s life is unique , but mr soares' story is typical like countless people here in dili , and in towns around east timor , he is the victim of a rampage by violent men who have burned thousands of homes and kidnapped tens of thousand of people in a mass deportation of onefourth of the population my wife and children are not here , mr soares' father , jose salvador soares , 53 , said by way of introduction when his son arrived with a visitor i do n't know where they are at the moment five days after international peacekeeping forces began to deploy here , the mood in dili has shifted from one of terror to one of anxiety and the pain of personal traumas across the city , files of refugees are walking back to their neighborhoods to see whether their homes are still standing and whether it is safe to return to live in them through burned out alleys and rural lanes in this tiny capital , where sea breezes still mingle with the tart scent of smoke , people walk with bags of belongings balanced on their heads two women carried a table on their heads a man pushed three small children in a barrow one refugee carried a broken mirror an old man walked with nothing but a rainbowcolored umbrella but like the soares family , it appeared that few felt secure enough to stay in their homes at night , returning to the safety of the seafront or the soccer stadium or the steep hills that rise above the city in a daylong stream , refugees like mr soares and his family walk the six miles down from the forests that shelter more than 30 , 000 people they visit their homes , ask among the refugees for news of their relatives , buy handfuls of fruit or cabbage , then walk back into the hills when the violence began here on aug 4 , after the people of east timor voted to become independent of indonesia , the soares family , like many others , first fled to the shelter of a church here in east timor , we are mostly catholic , said the younger mr soares , who works for an oil company we know that the only safe place is the church but the indonesian army does not respect the church they force out the refugees and kill the priests after two days of refuge there , he said , the priest warned all the men to flee to the safety of the hills , which are controlled by proindependence fighters the militia is coming to attack and kill you , mr soares said the priest told them these irregular militias , organized and often led by members of the indonesian military who opposed the independence vote , have laid waste to much of east timor in the past three weeks they have left most of the population of 800 , 000 people homeless , hungry , traumatized and , in many cases , trapped in camps that the fighters control in west timor , which is part of indonesia when the militia did attack the church the next day , mr soares said , they did something nobody expected they took all the women and children from the church , and we do n't know where they took them four days after that , he later learned , they burned our sweet home , where i lived since i was a baby returning for a look today , mr soares picked his way carefully through the house , making small discoveries as he went a pile of charred but unbroken cups and saucers , the sooty shell of a refrigerator , a white plastic motorcycle helmut , a small bottle of cough syrup , a plastic trophy won by his father in 1993 as employee of the year at the electric company in his parents' room a bit of bed frame survived the fire , as well as a crucifix that had melted into the wall where it hung in the room of his brothers , aged 6 and 8 , there was nothing but a black twisted sheet of plastic on the wall once a picture of the virgin mary then mr soares came to the room of his sisters , dulce fatima , 26 , and sonia magdalena , 14 it was as if his sisters had chosen a macabre black decor their walls and ceiling were shiny from fire and smoke despite this , the room held a spark of life it was still the home of two young women in one corner lay a pair of silver highheeled shoes in another was a red compact with a tiny mirror a pile of books remained untouched by fire on a shelf , along with a blistered photograph of dulce beside it was her diary , decorated with the words , i love jesus my name is dulce soares photo refugees , like this man passing the central market , are returning to dili to try to restart their lives \( agence francepresse \)

a few months ago , in a seemingly helpful innovation , the state of new york gave a new electronic banking card to margarita o , an 18yearold from mexico and the mother of a baby boy it is an unusual debit card on the front is a picture of her smiling shyly the familiar black magnetic stripe on the back gives her access not to a checking account , but to 448 a month in government food credits and cash the card held much promise she would have the same access everyone else had to all those automatic teller machines no more waiting in lines at checkcashing stores no more demeaning food stamps and just a short walk from her rented room in east harlem waited banco popular , a neighborhood bank with two gleaming atm s but for now , her card is useless at banco popular in fact , it cannot be accepted at most atm s in east harlem and throughout new york city out of frustration , margarita o , who asked that her last name not be used , simply walks up the street to the same checkcashing store where she used to get her benefits for free only now , she pays up to 235 for each withdrawal 150 to the store and 85 cents to citigroup , the financial conglomerate hired by the state to distribute welfare benefits through atm cards i do n't understand , she said , why they are taking away money from my child she is enduring the unintended consequences of a sweeping transformation in the way the nation s poorest citizens receive cash and food credits from the government in the last few years , 39 states and the district of columbia have hired corporations to distribute welfare benefits through the nation s vast web of atm s and grocery store debit machines the states hoped to reduce fraud , save money and draw poor people into the financial mainstream they wanted to encourage better money habits and to provide convenience and simplicity but the emerging system has pitted profits against service in a way that has created new vulnerabilities for millions of welfare recipients across the country they are assessed atm fees that most regular customers do not have to pay fees that are deducted from their welfare benefits the number of free withdrawals is severely limited , sometimes to two a month balance inquiries at atm s are forbidden in many states , including new york by the thousands , welfare recipients have learned at the cash register that their cards often do not work across state lines presiding over most of this system is citigroup , the parent of citibank and the nation s largest financial services company about 12 million americans in 29 states , including new york , now get welfare with citigroup atm cards at the end of 1998 , citigroup was distributing 640 million in welfare benefits each month citigroup s dominance is growing as welfare rolls shrink , competitors have backed off because there is far less money to be made this has strengthened citigroup s position as it pursues new contracts and , once it wins contracts , in deciding how welfare money is delivered new york vividly illustrates how the states , by handing off the cumbersome and politically sensitive task of providing aid to the poor , have given broad new control over welfare policy to private corporations , primarily citigroup for months , as citigroup struggled for profits in the welfare business , the company withheld from hundreds of thousands of new york city welfare recipients access to 23 , 000 atm s in the nyce network and 40 , 000 atm s in the mac network , the two largest in the northeast citigroup , which will be paid about 80 million by the state over the next four years to distribute benefits , blocked access by refusing to pay the full fee charged by other banks for each transaction payment of the full fee would have allowed poor people to use the same range of atm s in both networks as citigroup s regular customers in interviews over several weeks , citigroup officials defended their decision , saying new york city s poor had adequate access to cash state welfare officials , while expressing disappointment , said their contract with the bank gave them little power to tell citigroup what to do i really do n't have any authority at all to direct them one way or another , said brian j wing , the state s commissioner of temporary and disability assistance and yet , this situation is just as mr wing and other welfare officials planned it despite warnings from a state justice who reviewed the contract , state officials willingly embraced an ambiguous contract that gave citigroup a free hand to decide how new york s poor get access to their benefits on friday afternoon , citigroup s control was again on display after being informed that this article was imminent , citigroup officials abruptly announced

philadelphia , may 23 no one on the indiana pacers brought out a broom to signify a sweep over the 76ers this afternoon , or made any kind of motion that they had just cleaned house in the first union center there was no strutting or boasting or chestthumping the cool , purposeful , veteran pacers had won again , by the skin of their teeth , 8986 , to take the eastern conference semifinal series by four games to none but afterward , the pacers expressed nothing but admiration for the more youthful , dogged sixers , who came back to take the lead by 4 points with just three minutes left in the game it felt like a six or sevengame series , said reggie miller , the pacers' shooting ace , who led his team with 23 points they could 've gone south today when we went up by 17 points in the first quarter miller said that when philadelphia s allen iverson , the league s leading scorer , went out in the second quarter with a thigh injury , it added to the pacers' optimism but then allen returned after a minute and a half on the bench and brought them back iverson said every time they got down , they showed a lot of poise they got great shots , and played great defense the pacers have now won each of their seven games in the playoffs , having swept the milwaukee bucks in three games in the opening round they will face either the knicks or the atlanta hawks in the conference finals new york leads that series by 30 after a 9078 victory today the three biggest plays down the stretch today were clutch shots by miller and chris mullin , and a defensive play by center rik smits on iverson which , iverson believed , should have resulted in a whistle with the sixers ahead by 8379 and 3 minutes 17 seconds remaining in the game , and the home sellout crowd of 20 , 844 waving white handkerchiefs and shouting itself hoarse , mullin hit a 3point shot to draw the pacers within a point iverson missed a jump shot and miller came down and hit a running onehander off the backboard to return the lead to the pacers smits added 2 more points on a layup , and the pacers were ahead by 8683 with 41 seconds to go , the 6foot iverson took a 3point shot from the corner with a chance to tie the score the 7foot4inch smits left his post near the basket and flew at iverson , getting a piece of the ball , which fell short of the basket iverson thought he had been fouled but we should never have let it come to that , he said we just ca n't let ourselves get down so far in a game so early it takes such energy to get back in the game that it s tough when you need all the legs you can get for every shot at the end of the game , and you need to jump another inch higher on every rebound , and it s not there the sixers had enough left that they shook the arena with a remarkable run to start the fourth quarter they outscored indiana by 174 to snatch the lead they were helped considerably by the pacers' stunning inability to make a shot from the field in that time the pacers went 0 for 13 over 12 minutes without a basket , going back to late in the third period before mullin sank his crucial 3pointer with two minutes left in the game beyond the resilience of the sixers , another obstacle for the pacers was their usually dependable bench , which finished with just 11 points the starting team , however , showed particular balance , each player scoring in double figures miller , who had 23 , was followed by mullin with 16 , smits with 15 , mark jackson with 14 and dale davis with 10 and jackson , the point guard , finished with a gamehigh 13 assists , an indication of how he controlled much of the game iverson led all scorers with 25 points , making 11 baskets on 28 shots matt geiger , the 76ers' center , who did not pull down a single rebound in friday s 9786 game 3 loss , grabbed 13 today , to tie davis for the game high he also scored 23 points a lot of teams would have packed it in , said larry brown , the philadelphia coach , referring to his team s dismal first quarter but our guys did n't we were behind in each game in the series , and we battled back every time speaking of the pacers' next playoff opponent , pacers coach larry bird said it does n't matter who we play , but i know that some of the players hope it s the knicks reggie gets fired up for them , and so do some of the other guys but if we play like we have so far in the playoffs , we 'll do fine against anyone photo reggie miller during the closing minutes of game 4 yesterday \( associated press \)
albany , feb 21 casting as long a shadow over new york state government as any issue in recent years , health care could dominate this year s legislative session , state officials say , and it is already the subject of one of the fiercest , most complex lobbying wars in memory several tightly interwoven questions must be answered how to spend new york s share of the national tobacco settlement what to do about the rapidly rising number of new yorkers without health insurance whether to accept gov george e pataki s proposed cuts in medicaid spending , and how to cope with expected federal cuts in medicare at the core of the disputes is a state law that adds 26 billion a year in surcharges to hospital bills , mostly to help hospitals pay for training young doctors and caring for the poor that law expires later this year employers end up paying most of those charges through higher insurance premiums for their workers , and the business council of new york state , a group of large corporations , is lobbying hard to have the assessments eliminated or greatly reduced that pits one of the state s most powerful interest groups against two other heavyweights hospitals and hospital workers who insist the charges are essential to their economic survival i do n't know if i 've ever seen lobbying this intense , this early in the year , said state senator kemp hannon , a republican from garden city , a 22year veteran of the legislature and chairman of the health committee mr pataki has not staked out a position on renewal of the hospital charges , leaving a vacuum that the opposing sides have rushed to fill since last fall , they have barraged lawmakers with glossy reports , weekly faxes and requests for meetings throw in the disputes over the uninsured and tobacco money , and the fight has drawn in combatants like public health groups and the state s fiscal monitors it s going to be the health care super bowl , said elliott a shaw jr , director of government affairs at the business council democrats who control the state assembly want to maintain the hospital charges and even expand statefinanced health care programs the senate s republican majority is ambivalent its members are closely allied with business groups and believe that there is a need to cut health care costs , but they also want to protect hospitals , which are among the biggest employers in nearly every senator s district in 1995 , when mr pataki proposed deep cuts in health care spending , a coalition led by 1199 , the national health and human service employees union , waged a fierce advertising campaign against him , predicting hospital closings the governor s popularity dropped sharply and he backed away from some of his demands dennis rivera , president of the 150 , 000member union , said he was prepared for a reprise this year that might be in the cards , he said we have to defend the health care industry if we do n't do it , who will \? but some lawmakers say the expected fight could be more of a fizzle they say the issues are so complex and politically vexing that there will be a great temptation to put them off by maintaining the status quo for a year or more there are so many questions that do n't have answers yet , that i think there s a very good chance we 'll just extend everything as is , senator hannon said on the other hand , next year is an election year , and no one is going to want to deal with this in an election year for years , new york was one of a handful of states that set all the rates that hospitals could charge , whether for an appendectomy or the birth of a child the hospitals had no choice about what to charge , and insurers had no choice about what to pay in that atmosphere , critics say , hospitals grew inefficient , and there was no question that hospitals had far more beds than were needed two years ago , at mr pataki s insistence , the state stopped setting rates , forcing hospitals to negotiate 16 billion a year in charges with health insurers the change gave great power to health maintenance organizations , which could demand that hospitals lower their rates or see patients routed to other hospitals the hospitals began competing for patients and advertising their services to cut costs , they merged , closed wings , laid off workers and established outpatient clinics to divert patients from expensive emergency room and inpatient care but one aspect of the old system survived the state continued to add charges to every hospital bill , albeit about onethird less than it had before , in what amounted to a 26 billionayear subsidy for hospitals the largest part of that money goes to teaching hospitals to pay for the training of medical residents , doctors in their first few years out of medical school another big piece goes toward paying hospitals for patient bills they say they cannot collect , usually because the patients are poor and uninsured a third , smaller pot goes toward retraining thousands of hospital workers as they lose their jobs or are moved to new ones
washington , jan 29 the white house will probably forgo witnesses of its own in president clinton s impeachment trial unless the three witnesses giving depositions next week present damaging new evidence against him , white house advisers said today for weeks , presidential aides warned that if republican prosecutors drawn from the house called even one witness , mr clinton s lawyers might be forced to examine others and engage in a timeconsuming review of evidence that the white house has never had access to they have now softened their stance mr clinton s lawyers are still conspicuously keeping their options open , and may ultimately seek to call witnesses but they are hoping that this step will prove unnecessary , white house aides said we 're not going to surrender our rights , one senior clinton adviser said , but we 're not going to exercise them unless we feel we need to one clinton ally said the white house was worried about a risk beyond delay the white house , for all its bluff and fuss , does n't want a live witness , he said even your own witnesses surprise you the white house , he said , is in as good a situation as they 're going to get , and any new news , by way of new testimony or this and that , is probably bad news it is even possible , the presidential aides said , that white house lawyers will choose to ask few questions during the three depositions , beginning with an interview of monica s lewinsky on monday votes in the senate trial this week appear to have amply demonstrated that barring an explosive disclosure , republicans will not be able to muster the twothirds majority needed to convict and remove the president democratic senators said earlier this week that mr clinton s legal team was now split on whether to try to finish the trial quickly or push for extensive discovery to search for additional evidence favorable to him but white house aides said today that the lawyers were agreeing to place priority on wrapping up as soon as possible mr clinton is eager to push ahead with a raft of domestic policy initiatives already , on monday , he faces the prospect that attention on the unveiling of his annual budget proposal will be swamped by that on ms lewinsky s deposition ms lewinsky , said her spokeswoman , judy smith , is to be interviewed beginning at 9 am at the mayflower hotel , a location that will keep the media circus that invariably accompanies her from encroaching on capitol hill today the senate sent a subpoena to ms lewinsky and the two other witnesses whose testimony the senate demanded in a partyline vote on wednesday they are sidney blumenthal , a senior white house communications strategist , and vernon e jordan jr , a lawyer and clinton confidant mr jordan is to be interviewed on tuesday , and mr blumenthal on wednesday unlike ms lewinsky , both will be deposed at the capitol , in a secure room normally used for secret briefings on national security matters or discussion of ethics issues the house managers and the white house lawyers will have four hours each to question each witness , and so none of the depositions should run more than eight hours two senators , a democrat and a republican , will preside over each deposition the room is likely to be rather crowded , though , since up to six senators , six senate leadership aides , two senate legal counsels , two court reporters and one video camera operator will be present joe lockhart , the presidential press secretary , said today that white house lawyers might meet with witnesses before they testify the house managers , mr lockhart said , saw it appropriate to sit down and have a cup of coffee with monica lewinsky last weekend although the depositions will be conducted behind closed doors , they will be videotaped , and some republicans are urging that the tapes be released to the public , a step opposed by the white house the senate adopted rules on thursday that require a vote to determine whether transcripts of the depositions will be disclosed , and whether the tapes will be shown in the chamber or be made public in any way at all mr lockhart criticized those rules today , saying they were drawn up literally on the back of an envelope the rules permit a motion calling for more witnesses or evidence to be heard by the senate , but that motion must be made jointly by trent lott , the majority leader , and tom daschle , the minority leader that would seem to give mr daschle veto power over the calling of further witnesses but mr lockhart argued that with a simple majority vote , the republicans could rewrite the rules the rules can be changed at any time , he said , opening this up to new witnesses , new evidence and allowing this trial to go on endlessly mr lockhart said the white house would like to see the senate set a concrete date for the end of the trial , provided that rules were clear and a specific record for weighing the president s conduct was agreed to after the depositions next week are complete , the white house will have an opportunity to file a motion seeking to summon witnesses of its own no decision s been made , a senior white house official said nor is there any reason at this point why a decision needs to be made in eventually making that decision , the white house lawyers must weigh several issues first , they must determine whether any of the depositions have produced evidence that weakens their case , a prospect the white house says is unlikely , since all three witnesses have already testified at length before a grand jury but there is a further complication some republicans are pushing for a vote on a finding of fact that the president committed perjury and obstructed justice that vote , unlike those on the articles of impeachment , would require only a simple majority , and would not require the senate to decide whether to convict mr clinton and oust him from office it would also enable the senate , although without the twothirds majority needed to convict , to pass judgment on mr clinton s conduct if the senate is going to proceed with that vote , white house aides said , the president s lawyers may feel it necessary to call witnesses to bolster his case but they may not know before they must file their motion whether the senate will take that step lanny j davis , a former white house special counsel who still consults with some of his old colleagues , said that there is sincere anger at the patent unfairness of a vote on a finding of facts what makes it so outrageously unfair , he said , is that they 're doing that in the context of intense pressures that they are putting on the white house not to call witnesses and engage in extensive discovery photos charts senators to be present at next week s depositions one republican and one democratic senator from the six below will preside over each of the depositions , of monica s lewinsky , vernon e jordan jr and sidney blumenthal , to be

toronto they joke in pittsburgh , ruefully , that the penguins could leave the steel city and even exit the national hockey league before they are out of the current stanley cup playoffs that was never quite true , but any of the above could occur soon injured and fatigued on the ice while battling bankruptcy in court , the penguins could be eliminated tonight by the toronto maple leafs in game 6 of the eastern conference semifinals in pittsburgh s civic arena and on wednesday , lawyers and accountants will bring arguments and balance sheets into united states bankruptcy court to again debate the future of the debtridden franchise should the penguins be moved or dissolved this spring , tonight s game could be the last ever for a team that began during the big bang expansion of 1967 , when the nhl doubled in size from 6 teams to 12 nobody knows what s going to happen , said jaromir jagr , the star right wing and captain of the penguins who is the top scorer in the nhl and who is likely to be voted the hart trophy as most valuable player these fans , and even us , we cannot control what is going to happen after the season monday , he said , is going to be a special night , for many reasons after we lose , i'm going to worry about it , jagr said but right now , no he did not mean to predict defeat , although the mood was heavily pessimistic here saturday night in air canada center , where the leafs defeated the penguins by 41 to take a 32 lead in the fourofsevengame secondround series jagr had no goals or assists , was on the ice for the first three toronto goals and took a penalty for slashing defenseman dmitri yushkevich , assigned to check him although jagr said he was no longer troubled by the groin injury that kept him out of four games in the first round against the devils , other penguins are ailing among them is aleksei kovalev , pittsburgh s secondbest attacker , who missed his second consecutive game with a bruised right foot we 're missing kovie , jagr said it s a big loss we have to switch the lines everyone is switching now nobody knows where to play centers play wing wings play center it s kind of confusing for everybody it s kind of frustrating in playoffs , games 5 , 6 and 7 , you 're so tired you do n't even have enough power to shoot also confusing and frustrating is the ownership question mario lemieux , who led the team to cup championships in 1991 and 1992 , leads a group bidding to buy the team from roger marino lemieux is motivated in part by a debt of more than 30 million still owed to him by the team the nhl recently said that another bidder , which it declined to name , could buy the team for 85 million and move it out of town this escalated the war of words last week mayor tom murphy of pittsburgh said this is just a ploy by the league and said the nhl is legally prohibited from leaving pittsburgh because of the terms of the arena lease the nhl requested a speedy hearing , saying that scheduling requirements for next season constituted an emergency james weisman , who represents marino , said , if there is an emergency , it s one of their own making judge bernard markovitz asked a league bankruptcy lawyer , jeffrey levitan why did you wait so long \? why did n't you file something back in march \? none of this is flattering to the image of nhl commissioner gary bettman , who came to hockey from the national basketball association in 1992 with a reputation for sharp business instincts during bettman s tenure , two owners have gone to jail for financial fraud even with the penguins bankrupt , the league will expand to three more cities in the next 14 months some franchises change owners as often as they change coaches since the 15week labor lockout of 199495 , salaries and franchise prices have continued to rise fantasy leagues can make any fan an ersatz owner , so here s a suggestion from a makebelieve judge to solve the bankruptcy problem and help creditors get their money while saving hockey in pittsburgh imagine if the court would order the contracts of the penguins players to be sold not through a league draft , but through an open auction to the highest bidders among all teams in and out of the nhl \( what would jagr s rights bring on the open market \? or kovalev s \? \) take the money from this sale and pay off the creditors then award another expansion franchise to pittsburgh , a hockey version of the new cleveland browns in football take pittsburgh s 75 million entry fee , finish paying off the creditors , and let the rest of the owners split what is left oh , sure , such a solution might sound preposterous to the hustling entrepreneurs and financial wizards who run the fin de siecle nhl how dare we tell them how to manage their affairs \? but this farfetched formula is no less ludicrous than the reality of the embarrassing mess surrounding the pittsburgh penguins , weary and hurting , on and off the ice , in the stanley cup playoffs of 1999

would the prosecution has said it may seek the death penalty for mr garcia , 47 , who is being held in 5 million bail in a bergen county jail his lawyer , fernando oliver , has entered a plea of not guilty and says mr garcia did not intend to harm ms ricart although he did not provide details of his planned defense , he insists that the two were still in a relationship and that she had never told mr garcia about her marriage plans he just happened to stop by her house and saw all the limos outside , mr oliver said he was shocked during a struggle between mr garcia and ms ricart s brother , he said , shots were discharged , and ms ricart was mortally wounded i do n't know how they were discharged , but when the facts come out , we will see the real victim is him while the killing of a bride on her wedding day has turned ms ricart s death into national news , in upper manhattan , where many people knew both the victim and the accused , the loss feels personal that loss includes a leader who spent two decades trying to bolster dominican political power while alleviating poverty among the city s most beleaguered group of immigrants not only are we mourning the tragic death of this young woman , said councilman guillermo linares , who represents washington heights , but all the good that agustin garcia ever did has been wiped out although ms ricart s friends and family members say mr garcia could be vicious and vindictive , his friends and colleagues knew him as wellmannered and selfless none could explain an act that if proved true would overwhelm everything he accomplished since arriving in new york in the late 1970 s even mr garcia s supporters seemed convinced of his guilt , and with few exceptions , those who agreed to be interviewed spoke about him in the past tense looking at a photograph of mr garcia and mayor edward i koch in his office , alfred placeres , president of the new york federation of hispanic chambers of commerce , shook his head when asked to recall any clues that his friend of 20 years was troubled the worst thing is that we just ca n't explain this , said mr placeres , who shared a hotel room in san diego with mr garcia two weeks ago at a conference of hispanic business leaders we thought he was such a strong character , that he had everything under control i guess he had a side he did n't show the world despite his reputation as a selfless advocate , mr garcia and his nonprofit organization , asociaciones dominicanas , were criticized last april in an audit by the new york city comptroller , alan g hevesi in addition to citing 2 , 500 in unaccounted spending and two noshow employees , the audit determined that mr garcia had received 11 , 400 in federal money for work he could not prove he had performed mr garcia , investigators also found , had hired six relatives among a staff of 26 there are those who say they saw more than mr garcia s charm , his quick smile and the selfconfident grip he seemed to have on life they describe him as controlling , stubborn and reluctant to share the spotlight a man with little patience for dissent and even the appearance of failure when he shook your hand , he tried to squeeze it to the bone , letting you know he was powerful , that he was important , strong and dominant , said moises perez , executive director of alianza dominicana , a social service organization in retrospect , it was a reflection of low selfesteem a prominent dominican businessman , fernando mateo , said that when he was unable to attend an awards ceremony sponsored by mr garcia s dominican chamber of commerce , mr garcia angrily withdrew the honor , saying he no longer deserved it

seven sundays ago you started all this , tim russert told senator robert g torricelli on nbc s meet the press yesterday , alluding to the senator s comment on an earlier program that he would like hillary rodham clinton to run for the senate from new york i was just making small talk , answered mr torricelli , a new jersey democrat you made it into a national issue this may sound like throat clearing , a cloying yet harmless way to ease into an interview mr russert promotes his own program and mr torricelli banters back with flattery but the senator had a point since president clinton s impeachment trial ended \( was it only 10 days ago \? \) television has been filled with small talk that has become big talk about a possible hillary clintonforsenate campaign there could not be a more dramatic example of how 24hour news , with its obsessive focus on a single story , can shape politics the possibility of a hillary clinton campaign would have been a story even in the precable era , but it would not have turned into such a gigantic snowball , quickly filling the postimpeachment void it was a mediamade event that fed on itself , kept alive by strategic comments wafting from the white house in the past week , speculation about mrs clinton s future dominated broadcast and cable programs , from cnbc s hardball with chris matthews to cnn s crossfire , from nbc s today to abc s nightline and a halfdozen msnbc chat shows the possible campaign has been so thoroughly scrutinized that it is only a slight exaggeration to say mrs clinton does n't need to do her own research she can turn on television and see the latest polls that show her beating mayor rudolph w giuliani she can hear democrats predict she would win , and republicans call her a carpetbagger , a word that probably has n't been uttered so much in one week since reconstruction the issues were treated with the sophistication of a horse race will she run \? will she win \? because mrs clinton herself has been mum , the speculation can go anywhere , fueled by tantalizing hints a spokeswoman s comment that mrs clinton would give careful consideration to running set off a frenzy senator daniel patrick moynihan , whose announcement that he would not run for reelection opened the floodgates to this speculation , met mrs clinton at the white house for a lunch and strategy session on friday the meeting was well publicized , his arrival and departure well photographed as the week went on , the chatter turned to whether mrs clinton s public indecision was cynically calculated to deflect attention from the impeachment but the story has been good for mrs clinton s possible opponents , too at times the coverage seemed to be allrudyallthetime on thursday the mayor appeared on crossfire , on friday on today and cnn s inside politics , and yesterday on abc s this week and cnn s late edition he got to talk about the city and solidify his position as the likely republican candidate nita m lowey , the democratic congresswoman who has said she might run but only if mrs clinton does n't , was on fox news sunday and late edition yesterday , graciously saying she respected mrs clinton s timetable and why should n't ms lowey be gracious \? now she is on a national stage positioned as the hillary clinton understudy , when two weeks ago few people knew her name outside her westchester district though the clintonforsenate barrage suggests that one walltowall story will always be with us , in some ways the past week merely hints at what television news will be like postmonica for a full year , journalists from dan rather to matt drudge have been following the same story there may be a fork ahead where the high and the low roads diverge minor differences have already emerged when they were n't discussing mrs clinton , the cable shows , particularly on msnbc , returned to their allpurpose fallback position , hashing over the jonbenet ramsey murder that conversation was spurred by the publication of perfect murder , perfect town , a massive book on the subject by lawrence schiller \( an nbc consultant \) the sunday talk shows covered more substantive issues on meet the press , a panel of governors discussed social security , taxes and education abc s this week was defiantly nonglitzy as it introduced a new regular segment , on the campaign trail in a taped interview , george will , never their most dynamic commentator , talked to john sweeney , president of the aflcio the pablum questions and nonanswers about the need to save social security provided exactly the kind of drone that will send even serious viewers fleeing but if those shows feel too proud of their highminded stances , it is worth noting that only cnn s late edition devoted a segment to the kosovo talks , in a live interview with secretary of state madeleine k albright kosovo may be the most dangerous and immediate issue at hand , but it is even less sexy than the 2000 election more telling , none of the sunday talk shows resisted will hillary run \?
rio de janeiro paulo coelho was visiting spain last summer when a reporter back home in brazil called with a piece of news that made it clear to him that the audience for his books no longer knows any bounds the president of the united states had just been photographed reading the alchemist , the best known of mr coelho s slender fables of spiritual growth and fulfillment granted , something in mr coelho s deceptively spare and direct style must appeal to world leaders , since jacques chirac of france has just named him a knight of the legion of honor , and boris yeltsin and shimon peres are also admirers but over the last five years mr coelho s ability to speak to ordinary readers has made him a global publishing phenomenon a recent survey by the french magazine lire rated mr coelho the second most popular author in the world last year , selling more books than any other writer except john grisham the nine titles to mr coelho s credit , which include novels , parables that read like a mixture of khalil gibran and carlos castaneda , and autobiographical tales of faith and mystery , have been translated into 43 languages and , at last count , had sold 263 million copies no wonder then that some of mr coelho s dedicated readers believe he really is a wizard with magical powers , an image he has cultivated in books like the pilgrimage and the valkyries the french magazine in fact gave him the nickname big chief of the spiritual in the world s most affluent publishing market , this slim and agile 52yearold finds that i am not very well known in the united states , even after the boost from president clinton and celebrity endorsements from julia roberts and madonna but i know i am widely read there , he said in an interview at his apartment overlooking copacabana beach mr coelho \( pronounced coailyou \) credits the publication of the alchemist in english in 1993 with starting his international career the story of santiago , a spanish shepherd boy who journeys to the pyramids of egypt in search of his destiny , or personal legend , to use mr coelho s preferred term , the alchemist was an immediate best seller upon publication here in 1988 but did not initially attract much attention beyond latin america in the publishing world outside of the united states , nobody reads spanish , much less portuguese , he said , adding that the attitude of publishers in europe and elsewhere was that even though he had sold six million books here in his home country , those are brazilian numbers , just a lie he had to establish a presence in the united states , he said to have a book published in more than 119 countries , you need to have a language that can be read in thailand or lithuania , he continued translation into english made it possible for other editors to read me since that door opened , mr coelho has helped himself by insisting that , no matter what the country , his books be priced accessibly and handled by a local publisher , a step that has spurred his sales in places like india and with a yen for travel that dates back to his days as a hippie , he does not hesitate to go off the beaten track to promote his books because i come from a country that is excluded , that does n't see authors of big best sellers come here , i 've made a point of going to the places where no one else goes , like bulgaria , macedonia , slovenia , latvia , slovakia , iceland , he said all my life the most important things have been what i learned from ordinary people mr coelho s most recent novel , veronika decides to die , to be published in the united states in may , was born of just such an excursion it is set in a mental hospital in ljubljana , slovenia , and tells the story of a bright and beautiful young woman who seems to have a golden future but concludes that life has no meaning and tries to kill herself i decided to write a book about a person with an identity crisis living in a country with an identity crisis , the former yugoslavia , he said the point of the novel , which is a best seller all over europe and latin america this fall , is to say to such people that you are not alone and you are not crazy , he continued , and that everyone wonders , what am i doing here \? like all of mr coelho s books , veronika draws heavily on his personal experience when he was a teenager , his parents had him committed three times to a mental institution here he displayed copies of the medical papers , which indicate that he twice fled the hospital where he was being treated for irritation and hostility mr coelho s early adulthood was nearly as turbulent he used drugs heavily , he said , dabbled in the black magic doctrines of aleister crowley and was imprisoned three times and tortured by the rightwing military government then in power here , which suspected that the alternative society he and his hippie friends were advocating concealed a communist conspiracy none of his books have been set in brazil , and for one reason i am deeply accustomed to brazil , so my eyes do not have the innocence to write about brazil , the innocence to be able to see new things , he explained
even if new york city s board of education is able to spend 11 billion to build and renovate schools over the next five years more than double what it spent over the last five it will still have to place tens of thousands of students in cramped or decrepit classrooms and deprive whole neighborhoods of required services like prekindergarten , according to more than 100 parents , school administrators , teachers and politicians who testified yesterday the testimony came at a hearing that began yesterday afternoon and stretched late into the night the board s 109 billion capital budget proposal , which schools chancellor rudy crew introduced in november and which the board is scheduled to approve on march 24 , lays out an ambitious schedule for the next five years 114 schools , or nearly one in 10 , would receive new roofs 171 schools would be fitted with new windows 150 would have their antique coalfired boilers replaced , and 64 brandnew schools would rise from the ground when all of that construction dust settles , queens , for example , its schoolhouses flooded by a river of recent immigrants , is expected to have space for an additional 31 , 950 children but with the borough s publicschool rolls projected to grow by 53 , 550 over that period , it would still be short of classrooms for 21 , 600 billy , pay attention ! the queens borough president , claire shulman , boomed at the board president , william c thompson jr of brooklyn , who was distracted as she opened her remarks at the hearing yesterday at the board s headquarters in downtown brooklyn she then called on the seven board members to mount nothing short of an intensive marshall plan that would somehow save her borough s schools from the drastic measures that will be needed to accommodate all of its students , including asking the state legislature to expand its high schools to staggered , yearround calendars and turning away scores of 4yearold students from prekindergarten classes but ms shulman s was only the first of dozens of such pleas an aide to james f brennan , an assemblyman from brooklyn , asked the board to amend its plan and add two new elementary schools for flatbush a 14yearold freshman , natelina price , asked that her school , the bronx leadership academy , be given a few supplies , including an auditorium , which has yet to be added to the school since it was built three years ago and lew simon , a democratic district leader who represents the rockaways , broad channel and howard beach in queens , asked for a grand gesture in the spirit of the jewish holiday of purim , which concluded at sundown yesterday and marked the deliverance of the jews from a massacre we need a minimum of nine schools in district 27 , mr simon said , noting that there were only three in the chancellor s capital proposal please grant us that miracle that the 11 billion an amount just shy of the proposed education budget of the entire state this year can go only so far is largely a factor of the longterm neglect and shortsighted planning of the nation s largest school system half of its buildings were constructed before world war ii , and few have received any preventive maintenance since the city s fiscal crisis a quartercentury ago longrange population projections were , until recently , ignored the system s needs are so great that most of those who came before the board yesterday , in a hearing that began at 4 pm , succeeded only in getting their concerns on the record almost none will be able to have their requests incorporated into the document that will come before the board three weeks from today though the board is asking the city , state and federal governments to provide 11 billion , it is unlikely to receive much more than 8 billion and will have to postpone any number of projects already promised this is simply too large a problem to be addressed in a fiveyear framework , said lewis h spence , the deputy chancellor for operations , who sat in for dr crew at the hearing
president clinton s proposal to use tax credits to help about two million disabled americans , many of whom depend on relatives for longterm care , includes some innovative ideas , but it also has some serious problems john rother , public policy director of the american association of retired persons , applauds the program for providing overdue recognition and support for caregivers stuart altman , a health economist at brandeis , agrees , praising the white house for making a real start on a real problem but even they recognize the plan s serious limitations critics say the proposal skips over most of the poor , provides small financial protection for middleclass families and largely overlooks the potential for private insurance to handle the problem mr clinton s advisers fully recognize the problems with their proposal but they operate under rigid budget rules that make it nearly impossible to solve social problems the oldfashioned way , through government spending tight caps on discretionary spending for next year leave little room for new programs instead , henry aaron of the brookings institution says , the proposal is testimony to a budgetary staitjacket that forces the administration to cast social policy as tax cuts the only budget idea congress will take seriously even when , as is true in this case , the tax code is poorly designed to deliver the needed relief the administration estimates that five million americans receive longterm care for a disabling physical or mental ailment about two million of them live in nursing homes the rest live in their communities with the help of relatives or other care providers the cost can be crushing nursing homes can charge 60 , 000 a year or more if the disabled stay home , then children or spouses are often forced to leave work and suffer the grinding stress of caring for desperately ill loved ones there are few sources of financial relief medicare provides nearly none , and medicaid pays for nursing homes but only after patients run through nearly all of their assets that is not the worst of all possible systems it takes care of poor families from the beginning and tells middleclass families that they must spend their own money before calling on taxpayers to pick up the rest of the tab but the system turns medical catastrophe into financial catastrophe unless the patient can figure out , legally or otherwise , how to transfer assets to family and friends before applying for medicaid one solution is for adults to buy insurance to cover the costs of longterm care but private insurance barely exists the problem is that 60yearolds have no way to know how much protection they are buying when they take out a policy that covers , say , 150 a day even if adjusted for inflation of nursing home care that might look good in 1999 , but how much care will it buy 10 or 20 years from now \? the administration s solution is to cut the taxes of chronically disabled patients or their family care providers by up to 1 , 000 the tax cuts will cost a modest 55 billion over five years and will probably be paid for , the administration says , by closing an unspecified list of tax loopholes the proposed tax credit is based on the patient s need , not expenditures , so the program does not steer the elderly into nursing homes in order to qualify for reimbursement the most interesting part of the plan would have the federal government offer longterm care insurance to its employees the idea is for the government to create model policies that could then spread through the private economy the problem with the plan starts with the tax credit it only helps families who pay taxes , thereby eliminating the poor and , mr aaron points out , many elderly fall into the notax category because social security income is largely untaxed the administration hopes it has improved the problem by offering the credit to family care providers , thereby expanding the pool of eligible people still , the proposal shuts out many poor families the administration s strategy is to focus on a big expense of middleclass families and tee up a tax cut that republicans find hard to resist the white house calculates that tax cuts do a little good and blunt republican fervor for big acrosstheboard cuts that would threaten spending on programs dear to democrats the political tactic is understandable but comes at great cost in the case of longterm care , mr clinton steered clear of readily available and potentially effective solutions new york and several other states have created , with the help of the robert wood johnson foundation , a marvelously designed answer new yorkers can buy a stateapproved insurance policy , typically costing about 2 , 000 a year , that reimburses the policyholder for three years of nursing home expenses if patients who buy the coverage eventually enter and stay in a nursing home for more than three years , then the state medicaid program pays whatever bills the patient cannot handle based on income in other words , the state does not invade the patient s savings the families win protection of their assets the state wins , too , because few patients actually stay in nursing homes for more than three years
to the editor wynton marsalis s effervescent eulogy to the immortal duke ellington at 100 reveling in life s majesty , jan 17 was marred by the author s potshots at past and present musical peers on two continents for example , mr marsalis dismisses composers of what he calls european concert music as being distanced from the vibrancy of 20th century life , adding that a good deal of the european composers' music is somewhat gloomy i guess the horrors of the modern age were too much for them , he writes mr marsalis fails to consider the possibility that what he terms gloomy music may be a direct reflection of what some might see as the horrifying vibrancy of 20thcentury life in europe mr marsalis is equally acid when he none too subtly dispatches his creative american contemporaries in the jazz world whomever he may have in mind , it is clear mr marsalis has always had a problem with successful creative innovators like ornette coleman , miles davis and quincy jones , as well as anyone else who dares to stretch the musical envelope of mr marsalis s doctrinaire vision of jazz perhaps this keeper of the duke s flame should heed the noble example of his mentor and learn to appreciate the diversity of all forms of musical creation theodore folke westport , conn
washington , aug 31 leaders of a committee of business executives who have endorsed a ban on unlimited campaign contributions said today that their members would not be intimidated by an aggressive letterwriting campaign led by senator mitch mcconnell , one of the senate s most ardent opponents of a bill that would overhaul the campaign finance system in the letters , mr mcconnell , a kentucky republican , accused the group of trying to eviscerate private sector participation in politics by imposing antibusiness speech controls i hope you will resign from ced , mr mcconnell scribbled near the bottom of one letter sent to an unidentified senior executive of a telecommunications corporation leaders of the organization attacked by mr mcconnell , the committee for economic development , which includes executives of general motors , xerox , merck and the sara lee corporation , refused to identify the executive or the corporation in the letter but they did say that mr mcconnell wrote letters to executives who work for companies that have significant issues pending before congress none of nearly 20 members of the committee for economic development planned to resign from the committee , as mr mcconnell urged in the letters sent in late july , committee leaders said edward a kangas , a cochairman of the ced committee that studied the campaign finance system , said today that mr mcconnell s letter confirmed for him that the organization , which has enlisted more than 100 current and retired executives to endorse new campaign finance rules , was beginning to shape the contentious debate on the subject on capitol hill the letter was first reported on sunday on the editorial page of the new york times what we 've been doing as a group of business leaders is obviously beginning to have an impact , said mr kangas , the chairman and chief executive of deloitte touche tohmatsu , the accounting and consulting firm if we were n't having an impact , he would not be communicating with us in his public statements , mr mcconnell argues that current campaignfinance legislation would infringe on free speech protections of the first amendment critics of the republican party s position on the issue , however , say that republicans are motivated by the knowledge that they hold a commanding advantage in raising campaign money from the private sector in one letter , mr mcconnell also wrote that he was astonished that the corporation of the recipient had lent its name , prestige and presumably financial backing to the committee for economic development , which he said was lobbying on behalf of a radical campaignfinance agenda mr mcconnell argued that the executive s alliance with such a group had consequently damaged the reputation of the executive s employer mr mcconnell wrote the letters in his role as chairman of the national republican senatorial committee , the party s major fundraising group for senate candidates his spokesman , robert steurer , said that mr mcconnell was unavailable for comment , and referred questions to the national republican senatorial committee steven law , executive director of the national republican senatorial committee , issued a brief statement tonight , in which he said nearly all the companies we contacted had no idea that ced was throwing their name around in connection with campaignfinance reform and they were outraged that ced had hijacked their corporate identity to sell a position with which they sharply disagreed the executives on the ced committee are speaking for themselves , and not necessarily on behalf of their companies most of their corporations still continue to give large sums to political parties and candidates mr kangas and other committee leaders said they had recruited more executives in the past several days they said their goal was to have 300 executives endorse their campaign finance proposals by late autumn i think most of the people at ced have figured out just how corrupt the campaign finance system is , and this letter is just an example of what they already knew , mr kangas said actually , we are broadening the constituency of business leaders who recognize that the campaign finance system is a real problem senator s mcconnell s letter has not had much impact the letters were seen by some as an attempt to intimidate the members with the implied message resign and keep quiet or do n't count on doing business with congress the reaction was interesting , mr kangas said these guys are running big enterprises of their own they are not easily intimidated they looked at the letter and most of them just chuckled and filed it away the committee is a 60yearold businessled public policy and research association based in manhattan its leaders pride themselves that it is fiercely nonpartisan the executives on the committee are urging congress to prohibit soft money , the unlimited donations that corporations give to political parties the committee also advocates increasing the limit on individual contributions to 3 , 000 from the current limit of 1 , 000 the business community , by and large , has been the provider of soft money , said charles kolb , the committee s president these people are saying we 're tired of being hit up and shaken down politics ought to be about something besides hitting up companies for more and more money the committee s members studied the campaign finance system for two years committee members said they were horrified at the public perception that big donors receive special favors in washington in a report released in march , the committee wrote the suspicion of corruption deepens public cynicism and diminishes public confidence in government more important , these activities raise the likelihood of actual corruption in a response sent to mr mcconnell last week , leaders of the committee wrote we know that a majority of the house and the senate supports campaign finance reform that sentiment is also shared by a growing number of business community leaders both warren e buffett , the acclaimed value investor and chief executive of berkshire hathaway , and jerome kohlberg , a founder of the leveraged buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts company , have tried on their own to persuade chief executives of businesses to embrace campaign finance reform measures but many , though sympathetic , refused to speak out because they do not want to rankle the legislators on whom they depend mr kangas said he disagreed with mr mcconnell s position that campaign contributions were protected by the first amendment i was a little disappointed that he would suggest that freedom of speech does not apply to us , but it applies to the people who agree with him , mr kangas said photos senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky is urging 10 executives to resign from an organization that favors a ban on unlimited contributions to political parties \( andrea mohin the new york times \) charles kolb ,

washington , april 21 in the first governmentfinanced study using tissue from aborted fetuses to treat parkinson s disease , a team of researchers announced today that they had relieved the symptoms of some patients , a discovery that experts say suggests that scientists are on the verge of being able to repair the damaged brain the study involved only 40 patients , just 20 of whom received the transplants , and for reasons the researchers do not quite understand , the only significant improvements were in patients younger than 60 those who benefited were better able to move and experienced less stiffness before taking their daily medication some switched to less potent drugs but despite the small size of the study and its mixed results , experts said it offered a tantalizing hint that the transplants may someday work it found that the fetal cells took hold and established new networks to produce a missing neurochemical , dopamine , in the brains of twothirds of the transplant recipients , regardless of their age ten or 15 years ago , people would have thought of this as science fiction , said dr gerald fischbach , director of the national institute of neurological disorder and stroke , which paid for the study given other promising developments in parkinson s disease , including research involving electrical stimulation of the brain , dr fischbach predicted that within the next 10 years there will be a much more rational and safe and effective means of reversing the dopamine deficit while doctors have transplanted the fetal cells into parkinson s patients before , the findings announced today represent the most thorough examination of the procedure to date but the experiment is certain to inflame a debate that has divided abortion rights advocates and opponents for more than a decade the questions of whether fetal tissue should be used in medical research , and whether taxpayers should pay for it researchers saw the best results in the nine transplant patients who were younger than 60 older patients , who account for the majority of those with parkinson s , were not helped over all some got better but some got worse the researchers said there was no way to predict who would benefit even so , dr fischbach said , my view is that the surgery worked the cells took they survived others were not quite so enthusiastic i'm disappointed that the results were not more dramatic , said dr j william langston , president of the parkinson s institute , a nonprofit research organization in sunnyvale , calif on the other hand , they do show that this seems to be feasible the fouryear study , which the government said cost 57 million , was led by dr curt freed of the university of colorado in denver and dr stanley fahn of columbia presbyterian center in manhattan they announced their findings at a conference of the american academy of neurology in toronto , 11 years after president reagan first banned taxpayer support for such experiments and six years after president clinton lifted that ban the results have not yet been published in a peerreviewed scientific journal , and in interviews , dr freed and dr fahn emphasized that questions about the proper dose of cells , and why some patients did better than others , must still be answered we need to reduce the variability of the transplant response , dr freed said more than one million americans suffer from parkinson s disease , a degenerative neurological condition that slowly strips patients of control over their own muscles there is no cure although the disease can be treated with medication , primarily the drug levadopa , it eventually stops working patients with advanced cases often lose their ability to walk and speak for years , parkinson s patients have watched as their symptoms have worsened while the fetal cell research became caught up in abortion politics in 1988 , dr freed began operating on patients with private money , and he continues to do so , he said , in an effort to refine his technique the operations cost about 35 , 000 some paid for by patients , others by a denver philanthropist but there were difficulties the fetal tissue is hard to obtain , which might prevent the procedure from being used widely and until he got government support , dr freed said , he was prevented from conducting a a truly high quality study the experiment is controversial , not only for its use of fetal tissue but also because of its design each patient underwent neurosurgery four tiny holes , drilled through the wrinkle lines above the eyebrows into the skull , to clear a pathway to the brain but only half received injections of dopamineproducing cells into the putamen , the region of the brain that controls movement in the others , the surgery was a sham , designed to test the placebo response , in which patients get better simply by thinking they have been treated and indeed , the experiment found a particularly powerful placebo effect in at least three patients in the control group
miami until the kickoff , the super bowl is always a talk show yak , yak , yak and super bowl xxxiii s most eloquent , or at least its most voluble , talkshow guest has been shannon sharpe , the broncos' tight end when asked anything , he always had something to say , especially about himself i'm not a good talker , i'm a great talker , because i do it so often , he announced during the week i think if you do something well enough , you become great at it when i was at savannah state , i 'd get in the mirror 20 minutes at night before i 'd go to bed and talk to myself i 'd ask questions , answer questions i 've kind of perfected it now more important after tonight s kickoff , sharpe has also perfected how to play tight end i want to be a great runblocking tight end , he said i want to be a great receiving tight end he has even perfected where he thinks he already rates among the best tight ends in pro football history i would like to think i'm one of the best , he said if you look at ozzie newsome and kellen winslow , none of those guys ever played in a super bowl here i am in my second one i 'll take my numbers for nine years and put them up there with anybody over his career , sharpe has caught 529 passes for 6 , 759 yards and 44 touchdowns , including 64 for 768 yards and 10 touchdowns during the recent season , his seventh as a pro bowl selection in the super bowl , the outcome is often in the hands of the receivers three wideouts lynn swann , fred biletnikoff and jerry rice have been voted the most valuable player , but a tight end never has sharpe could be the first , if only because the falcons , like almost every other team in the national football league , do not have a tight end in his class o j santiago , the falcons' tight end out of whitby , ontario , is one of the nfl s few canadian players , a thirdround draft choice from kent state at 6 feet 7 inches and 267 pounds , santiago is a tall target , but in only his second season , he s still very much a work in progress when we played the broncos during my rookie year , it took me a whole half to get some good blocks , santiago said i 'll get into this game a lot earlier but with only 27 catches for 428 yards and 5 touchdowns this season , santiago hardly creates the offensive problems that sharpe does with his deepthreat speed sharpe is the more difficult matchup for us , said rich brooks , the falcons' defensive coordinator other tight ends do n't threaten you vertically by vertically , brooks meant being able to go deep , which sharpe can do as well as rod smith and ed mccaffrey , the broncos' wide receivers cornelius bennett , the falcons' 33yearold linebacker , remembers sharpe going deep during the 1997 season he caught a 65yard touchdown pass right down the seam , bennett said on a busted coverage , he was running wide open he can catch the ball at any angle bennett sounded confident that my passcovering skills will match up with sharpe , but eugene robinson , the falcons' experienced free safety , acknowledged that sharpe on a linebacker is a mismatch robinson ought to know his 53 career interceptions are the most among active defensive backs sharpe s talent and trash talk have also contributed to smith s and mccaffrey s success a lot of the game i have has come from shannon , said smith , who caught 86 passes for 1 , 222 yards and 6 touchdowns this season he works so hard , he prepares for a game so hard by trashtalking so much , he puts pressure on himself and thrives on it and by trashtalking so much , sharpe has taken some of that pressure off mccaffrey he really entertains me during a game , mccaffrey said i find it quite comical mccaffrey was once a giants wide receiver , while the falcons' wide receivers , terance mathis and tony martin , once were jets receivers mccaffrey was cut by dan reeves , then the giants' coach , during the 1993 exhibition season something reeves has since described as his biggest mistake as a coach dan told me , 'we have enough receivers , ' recalled mccaffrey , who caught 64 passes for 1 , 053 yards and 10 touchdowns for the broncos this season i never took it personally i considered it a business decision mathis joined the falcons as a free agent in 1994 after four seasons as a seldomused wide receiver with the jets he caught a total of only 93 passes for the jets his first season with the falcons he caught 111 in a runandshoot offense this season he caught 64 for 1 , 136 yards and 11 touchdowns the jets did n't think i could take the everydown pounding , mathis said i proved i can martin , who caught 66 passes for 1 , 181 yards and 6 touchdowns for the falcons this season , was among the jets' last cuts in 1989 when joe walton was the coach the jets wanted to put martin on their developmental squad , but he requested his release , signed with the dolphins and later moved to the chargers one of us , martin said , referring to him and mathis , will have to come up with a big play in this super bowl but if the opposing wide receivers cancel each other out , shannon sharpe is likely to come up with the biggest play he s the reason i like the broncos to win , 3128
for centuries , art historians and leonardists , as some fans of leonardo da vinci are called , have pondered why the darkhaired woman in his famous painting is smiling a web site created by students and a computer graphics instructor at john f kennedy high school in marble hill , on the edge of the bronx , offers a possible solution to this 16thcentury enigma the site , why is the mona lisa smiling \? features an animated sequence that fuses the mona lisa s face with that of her creator s we feel that she is smiling because of leonardo s secret that the mona lisa was , in fact , a selfportrait , said steve feld , the teacher who helped his students set up the site he noted that while leonardo kept careful notations of model sittings for his other works , none was ever found for the mona lisa mr feld and his students are not the first to put forth this theory of leonardo s inside joke the morphing mona lisaleonardo graphic was based on the work of lillian schwartz , author of the computer artist s handbook \( w w norton , 1992 \) , who says that when she digitized leonardo s selfportrait and his portrait of the mona lisa and merging the images , she found their facial features to be perfectly aligned the site , a collaborative effort with students from a high school in sweden , was created in less than three months for a 1997 competition sponsored by think quest , a nonprofit group that promotes the creation of educational web sites by students mr feld said his students , using inexpensive software and 15yearold tandy computers that lacked mice , designed their site so that visitors using even the most primitive browsers could have easy access what you see \( and hear \) click on the vitruvian man s hands or the site map to explore an esoteric collection of things leonardo , from a picture of a recent plan by norwegian highway planners to build a bowshaped bridge that the artists designed five centuries ago to an american art collector s dream of casting a 24foot bronze horse that was one of leonardo s unfinished projects in a section called original da vinci music and billed as an internet exclusive , the student web masters have digitally produced a few bars of a leonardo composition links many , including the dozen listed under leonardo learning links from there , viewers can be transported to the home site of the louvre or the outlandish pages of the mona mailart show , a web site dedicated to mona lisainspired computer art , such as pictures of her appearing as an xfileslike alien visitor what you get an awardwinning , informative site that also doubles as a springboard to the wonderful world of leonardo da vinci richard weir why is the mona lisa smiling \? http libraryadvancedorg 13681 photos

those of us raised on the big pieces of the 19th century , a lot of mozart and a little haydn raced to the record stores to hear the latest torelli and corelli from chamber orchestras like i musici or i virtuosi di roma we were charmed by the elegance and the certitude we liked the absence of bigness for its own sake and the clarity of small string ensembles in synchrony with exceptions \( vivaldi is one \) , i find this music increasingly difficult to listen to saturation \? perhaps near symmetry , often repeated , numbs the spirit the frictionless paradoxically becomes an irritant this civilizing of human passions runs like a current beneath the great musical events of the 18th century , although the best composers , refusing to be so easily tamed , fought against the tide locatelli s upbeat energies are arranged like a wellengineered stairway the patterns rise uniformly , and the principal tension is uncertainty as to when the ascent will stop anguish in the minor mode has a similar formality , resolved , finally , by strong cadences here are sad stories with happy endings dei ex machina descend in the form of the major third ms dion , like locatelli , satisfies the listener s need for order my heart will go on is , if anything , reliable fourbar phrases , four beats each eightbar stanzas the bass line adds a comforting thump at the beginning of every measure equally reliable are the melodic shape and its delivery , with little variation , often none harmonic change takes a small step forward and a small one back rhetoric waves passionately , but the music hangs limp we know the end at the beginning complacency , not disruption , is the gift offered , and the casual ear accepts it with gratitude ms dion energetically assures us that love is in the air and that it will eventually make us happy the andante from locatelli s b flat concerto for violin and strings \( no 7 from his art of the violin , published in 1737 \) is ms dion s ancestor more sophisticated but bearing family resemblances again fourbeat , fourmeasure phrases , though locatelli keeps us on our toes by elongating or shrinking his stanza endings by a measure or two the sequences get a little busier as they mount but offer no surprises the soloist s elaborate embellishments of repeated material remind one of nabokov s pronouncement that important novels invent their own world while mediocre fiction embroiders the commonplace not to pick too strenuously on locatelli he had plenty of company also , keep in mind that early18thcentury music evidently made a different impression on its contemporaries from that on late20thcentury ears any listening problems we may have now say as much about us as about the music indeed , history looks back admiringly on locatelli , pointing out his innovations in playing the violin and their effect on music to come a colleague , albinoni , made interesting experiments in form and organization it s quite possible that their audiences , inhabiting another world and possessing a different sensibility , heard in their pieces the same red heat that we find in messiaen and aretha franklin indeed , colleagues of corelli called his music the bread of life today , its superior gravity and dignity set it somewhat apart from the rest of the italian baroque , but we still find little rescue from the numbness of predictability the period piece is our topic it is an artifact that speaks to its own time but no other mediocre pop singing like ms dion s unashamedly defines what period piece means , though the period is measured less in generations or centuries than in months or weeks locatelli s period is not ours , and perhaps his postwar exhumation by the earlymusic movement and the recording business is momentary as well if ms dion s fans are merely lazy , locatelli s 18thcentury listeners were optimistic his wellordered music regurgitated the enlightenment s belief in the human brain and heart , and their powers to soothe the savage breast and clarify the muddles of existence nowadays , scientific symmetries proved on monday are replaced by wednesday human invention and development , rather than curbing our cruelest instincts , make their employment more efficient locatelli s better colleagues were less trustful than he bach was the master saboteur of symmetry his sequential patterns alter constantly , giving us the better than expected vivaldi s pictorial drama excites again and again he is the era s true eccentric haydn based his musical life on the delightful , touching or deeply moving surprise mozart managed to be sad and happy at the same time it is this ambiguity that is so splendidly disconcerting cimarosa s operas , in contrast , charm for one act but have annoyingly little new charm for the next two the pop music world shows good sense by making products whose obsolescence is not only planned but welcomed when the occasional meteor burns brighter than the rest , its durability will depend on its own resources classical music needs to monitor a little better the argument between disposability and preservation fortunately classical music has its audience , which may enthusiastically greet the historical fad but eventually knows how to forget the forgettable photos pietro locatelli \( archive for art and history , berlin \) celine dion \( agence francepresse \)
schools chancellor rudy crew met privately yesterday with the board of education for the first time since his threat to resign over mayor rudolph w giuliani s plan for school vouchers , and he assured its members that he wanted to remain in his post and that the issue was off the radar the meeting with the sevenmember board , which was closed to the public , came two days after dr crew and mr giuliani had emerged smiling and laughing from a similar , private , 90minute discussion to announce that the chancellor would stay on , at least for the time being , and that he and the mayor had agreed to work out their differences members said the chancellor told the board at the halfhour meeting what his aides had been saying for the last week that he was deeply opposed to using tax money to send children to private school , and that if the board chose to administer such a plan , he could not in good conscience continue as chancellor before anyone on the board had a chance to speak up , dr crew added that he would like to stay on the job and that he believed , in view of his monday meeting with the mayor , that there would be no obstacle to remaining , board members said i came out of the meeting feeling that he and the mayor had reached some kind of accord , said irving s hamer jr , the manhattan member of the board , although he added that dr crew did not give any details he was very clear in saying that he wanted to stay on , that he hoped this matter was behind him and that it would not cause any further anxiety or angst william c thompson jr of brooklyn , the president of the board , who like dr hamer has expressed reservations about vouchers , said , it was not a long conversation it just clarified yes , he s staying in brief comments to reporters yesterday , dr crew said he had told his board that vouchers were now off the radar but during the meeting he did not actually use the word vouchers , board members said they said he used the word privatization instead , apparently as a way of stressing what he saw as the conflict between vouchers and public education members said he also apparently feared that using the word vouchers would make it a policy meeting , which must be public under state law instead , members said , dr crew and others used the word privatization mr thompson said the meeting was legal because the board was discussing a personnel and employment matter robert j freeman , executive director of the state s committee on open government , said that if dr crew s threat to resign was the result of a policy disagreement , state law required the meeting to be open to the public the only exceptions , he said , are for discussions of the medical , financial , credit or employment history of a person working for the board gene russianoff , senior attorney at the new york public interest research group , had written a letter to the board on tuesday saying any closed session to discuss vouchers would violate state law and deny the public the opportunity to hear debate of an important issue the closeddoor meeting was an anticlimactic finish to the roller coaster of events that began last wednesday , when dr crew threatened to resign in protest as mr giuliani began lobbying the board of education to approve his voucher plan the mayor had first presented his plan in january in his state of the city message , but had said little about it after then mr giuliani proposed to designate one school district in the city that would offer vouchers , financed with tax dollars , to impoverished students in lowperforming public schools , so they could transfer to private or religious schools mr giuliani had focused his lobbying efforts on terri thomson , the queens member and the swing vote on the board of education regarding vouchers ms thomson did not return a telephone call asking for comment yesterday , but other board members said she had remained silent throughout the meeting the mayor had no comment yesterday , said a spokeswoman , samantha lugo none of the board members asked dr crew any questions , they said afterward and only two of them spoke up jerry cammarata , the staten island board member and a supporter of vouchers , told dr crew that the board had supported his initiatives in the past and looked forward to doing so in the future mr thompson , board members said , told them that dr crew had been asked his position on vouchers when he was interviewed for the chancellor s post three and a half years ago , and had made his opposition clear then
fifty years ago , aldo leopold s ecological testament , a sand county almanac , was published it was a posthumous book , appearing a year and a half after leopold died of a heart attack in april 1948 at the age of 61 a graduate of the yale forestry school and a 17year veteran of the united states forest service , leopold had his greatest influence , during his lifetime , as a professor of game management at the university of wisconsin but it is the almanac , his meditations on a wisconsin river farm and an unequivocal statement of conscience , that will carry his influence and his good name down the generations leopold s principal and extraordinary contribution to our world was to articulate the idea of a land ethic the human relation to land , he wrote , is still strictly economic , entailing privileges but not obligations leopold believed that the basis of successful conservation was to extend to nature the ethical sense of responsibility that humans extend to each other this idea has acquired tremendous force since a sand county almanac first appeared the fact that the idea now seems unexceptionable is a measure of its widespread influence fifty years is both a very short and a very long time in the life of a good idea the power of leopold s argument buttressed as it is by his clear , vigorous prose has not been blunted in the least in fact , his argument seems more urgently true now than ever in the past 50 years leopold s work has helped drive the environmental movement yet the tendencies he lamented , summed up in the phrase despoliation of land , have accelerated almost out of control leopold will last not because he captured a moment or a feeling , though he does both in the first sections of a sand county almanac he will last because we have scarcely begun to work out the implications of his ideas he suggested an ecological interpretation of history , which has only recently begun to be written he recognized that the ability to see the cultural value of wilderness boils down to a question of intellectual humility he described a dynamic that still threatens wildness the very scarcity of wild places , reacting with the mores of advertising and promotion , tends to defeat any deliberate effort to prevent their growing still more scarce these are formidable ideas but none are more challenging than leopold s land ethic it requires a rerooting in nature , a forsaking of the hope that we can save wild or even open land on the basis of its economic value we are busy , leopold says , inventing subterfuges to give nature economic importance they will not work there is a risk involved in creating a truly ethical relation to the land but leopold believed in risk too much safety , he wrote , seems to yield only danger in the long run
and the walls came tumbling down kentucky , texas western and the game that changed american sports by frank fitzpatrick illustrated 256 pages simon schuster 24 it was easy to miss if you were n't a fan of college basketball in 1966 , and easy to miss even if you were but as frank fitzpatrick informs us in his rousing new book , and the walls came tumbling down , when texas western beat the university of kentucky in the finals of the national collegiate athletic association basketball tournament on march 19 in cole field house of the university of maryland \( long before the competition became known as march madness \) , it was the first time in the history of the tournament that a team starting five black players beat an allwhite team this was not expected to happen , points out mr fitzpatrick , an editor and writer with the philadelphia inquirer and the author of worst to first the story of the '93 phillies in the view of too many americans at the time , blacks were n't disciplined enough to defeat a wellcoached , talented white squad like kentucky , as mr fitzpatrick puts it they were n't mentally tough they did n't have heart if they fell behind , they 'd quit at least one white was required , the thinking went , to provide stability and discipline the quarterback in football , the shortstop or catcher in baseball , the point guard in basketball such expectations were among the many reasons that no blacks at all played for most colleges in the south and why even at the most liberal colleges , basketball coaches observed strict racial quotas , and , mr fitzpatrick continues , the whispered motto for many of them was 'two blacks at home three on the road and four when behind' and when it did finally happen that a college team of allblack starters beat an allwhite one in a championship game , by the score of 72 to 65 , another set of prejudices , equally pernicious , came into play , mr fitzpatrick says talking about the texas western players , one former star player joked , they can do everything with the basketball but autograph it others characterized them as a team of urban hired guns , the author writes adolph rupp , kentucky s imperious coach , called them a bunch of crooks and erroneously said that the university was placed on probation soon after its championship still others spread the rumor that none of the players went on for another semester , much less graduated but the event was even more significant than the foregoing might make it appear , mr fitzpatrick argues texas western s victory gave hope and encouragement to many black players throughout the country , and in the next four years , a 1972 study would note , the most substantial increase in integration in the history of college sports took place the author continues , suddenly , schools north and south had a license , an urge in many cases , to seek out black athletes in retrospect the game has come to symbolize the watershed dividing what the author characterizes as the old , white style of college basketball , slow , patterned and controlled , and the freer , more improvised style of play many blacks favored , featuring as its signature move the slam dunk \( less than a year after texas western s victory , the ncaa rules committee outlawed this shot , a ban that would last a decade \) to illustrate these points , mr fitzpatrick examines the background of the event in detail he traces the history of basketball from the rather static game dreamed up in 1891 by james naismith , a presbyterian minister who saw his invention as a means of developing christian gentlemen , to the faster , freewheeling sport evolved by urban blacks he explores the record of racial integration in college sports and explains why texas western \( now called the university of texas at el paso \) , isolated from the rest of texas by geography and the area s bicultural attitudes , became one of the first southern colleges to integrate , while kentucky was among the last he contrasts the two opposing coaches on one side the dictatorial rupp , who had learned his basketball practically at the knee of naismith , and who , if not an outright racist , certainly impeded the integration of his team on the other side don haskins , who , despite being reared in the segregationist oklahoma town of enid , was so purely competitive by nature that he could n't have cared less who did his winning for him unfortunately for mr fitzpatrick s story , the game itself was not a great one neither team played up to its potential early in the game david \( big daddy \) lattin , texas western s power forward , delivered a jam through the arms of pat riley , kentucky s allamerican forward , and from that point on the undersize kentucky team seemed intimidated , at least in the view of riley but the lack of a strong climax does n't really detract from the book s effect there s satisfaction alone in seeing coach rupp chagrined and blaming everyone but himself for his team s defeat and beyond the issues of race there s gratification in learning what the texas western players accomplished as people besides adjusting to an alien culture , they learned under coach haskins to meld themselves into a disciplined team playing a style that one member called more whiteoriented than any of the other teams in the final four we played the most intelligent , the most boring , the most disciplined game of all what s more , four of the seven blacks on the team did get degrees and move on to middleclass careers , and the other three succeeded in their own fields despite being a few credits shy to all of them , that final game in the tournament was never about black versus white only in later years , when the team members began to hold reunions , did they begin to see the significance of what the game had meant as mr fitzpatrick concludes , perhaps it is destined to be recalled like that memorable scene from 'the wizard of oz , ' the moment when everything changed from black and white to unforgettable color photo frank fitzpatrick \( charlotte fitzpatrick simon schuster \)
the great disruption human nature and the reconstitution of social order by francis fukuyama 354 pp new york the free press 26 francis fukuyama is an analyst who does not , intellectually speaking , get out of bed for anything less than the allencompassing grand sweep of history a decade ago , this former policy planner at the state department emerged from the backwaters of wonkdom with an article that argued that the rise of liberal democracy constituted the final phase of human political development few critics swallowed the idea whole , but everybody talked about it a booklength exposition in 1992 , the end of history and the last man , was widely read the national interest , the journal that first carried his apocalyptic thesis , has just published his second thoughts on the subject , together with the opinions of a bevy of heavyweight commentators , from e o wilson to gertrude himmelfarb there is no sign , though , that fukuyama , who is now the omer l and nancy hirst professor of public policy at george mason university , has scaled down his ambitions far from it his new book , the great disruption , tackles social and moral development on the same grand scale as his earlier work the end of history and the last man declared that all nations are fated eventually to become liberal democracies , and that when they do , history will in effect run out of steam it will do so because history is a series of struggles for mastery that are driven by the human desire for recognition , and this desire is necessarily satisfied in liberal democracies this portentous , millenarian picture of history as an easily explicable march toward a predetermined conclusion has hegel written all over it , and indeed fukuyama s version was first espoused in an influential series of lectures on hegel given by alexandre koj ve , a russianborn trade adviser to the french economics ministry , in paris in the 1930 s koj ve was a little vague on the precise arrival date of this inevitable denouement hegelian trains are notoriously unreliable , though they always get there in the end , or so we are told but he sometimes oddly suggested that it had already pulled in , at the beginning of the 19th century at the end of his new book , fukuyama reaffirms his belief that history appears to be progressive and directional in the political and economic realm but he now asserts that this is not necessarily true in the social and moral sphere the moral behavior of societies seems to be cyclical , with peaks \( like the victorian era \) and troughs \( like the 1980 s \) he cautions that there is nothing that guarantees that there will be upturns in the cycle he does , however , find reason for optimism and closes with hopeful talk of the upward direction of the arrow of history the great disruption of his title refers to deteriorating social conditions in most of the industrialized world from the mid1960 s to the early 1990 s , as measured by \( among other things \) rising crime , divorce and illegitimate births and declining fertility , personal trust and confidence in social institutions in fukuyama s opinion , when so many social indicators move dramatically and more or less in step in many countries , something big is going on , and it calls for a single big explanation his favored culprit is the transition to a postindustrial or information age economy this transition , he argues , led to a depletion of social capital , with the baleful consequences that he meticulously charts whatever one thinks of his own theories , his careful reporting of a wide range of social data and his critical account of the various explanations that have been offered for them make this a useful volume but fukuyama is also too skilled a social scientist for his own good he dutifully notices all the subtleties , exceptions and qualifications that weaken his case if japan and south korea mostly escaped his great disruption , although they underwent the economic changes that he says caused it elsewhere , is n't that terminally inconvenient for his theory \? there are many smaller anomalies in his data , such as the fact that divorce rates have been declining in the united states since the 1980 s equally disconcerting is the looseness of his characterization of the information age or postindustrial economy , which makes some of his explanations verge on the vacuous the development of the birth control pill , increased longevity and the culture of individualism , for instance , are all plausibly cited as contributing factors to the great disruption yet none of them can reasonably be regarded as necessary effects or intrinsic characteristics of the transition to an information economy the overgeneralizing tendency of history in the hegelian style seems to loom here fukuyama is inclined to regard every simultaneous development as a manifestation of a single phenomenon there are problems , too , with his concept of social capital \( which he defines as a society s stock of shared values , and which is principally manifested by trust , the subject of another earlier book \) when he introduces the idea , he maintains that it is a key resource to track because economic success depends on it but that sits uneasily with his thesis that the great disruption suffered from a shortage of social capital , since the period was , on the whole , one of powerful economic growth either the stock of social capital is not so economically important , or else it was not much depleted during the great disruption no doubt some suitably convoluted solution to this paradox can be found , but the suspicion must remain that the concept is too vague to mean much having described and analyzed the malaise of the mid60 s to the early 90 s , fukuyama steps back in part 2 of his book to consider the genealogy of morals a nietzschean title for a most unnietzschean account of social order although there is little new in this guided tour of game theory , evolutionary psychology and other incursions of pop science into ethics , it is perhaps the most convincing part of the book fukuyama plausibly argues that human beings will produce moral rules for themselves , partly because they are designed by nature to do so and partly as a result of their pursuit of selfinterest with this much established , it comes as no surprise to learn that humanity has regularly healed itself after earlier great disruptions in the final part , fukuyama briefly illustrates some nowdistant recoveries from social and moral decline , like the meiji restoration in japan and the victorian era in britain and america and then he drops his bombshell our own great disruption is already ending rates of increase in crime , divorce and illegitimacy have slowed in the 1990 s and even reversed in some countries in the united states , levels of crime have returned virtually to where they were when the great disruption which is now looking not so great after all first started welfare rolls are shrinking almost as fast levels of trust have recovered significantly , and there are signs that the destructive culture of rampant individualism is coming to an end so what was all the fuss about in the first few hundred pages of the book \? as with a cheap novel , it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this book is marred by its happy ending this is a paradox to which fukuyama has only the limpest of answers he insists that there was nothing automatic about our recovery from the great disruption no doubt that is technically true but who except hegelians like him ever believed in historical inevitability anyway \? he has given us strong reasons to believe that a recovery would come , and the evidence to show that it in fact did you do n't need an upward arrow of history to know which way the wind blows drawing \( christoph niemann \)
little goose dam , wash of all the ways in which americans have reshaped the land to suit their priorities , none is more audacious than the vast network of hydroelectric dams that stretches across the pacific northwest , taming wild rivers , opening shipping passages and bringing the region the cheapest electricity rates in the nation the construction of these huge dams , dating back to the great depression , was an epic engineering achievement , amply glorified by woody guthrie in the 1940 s your power is turning our darkness to dawn , ran his folk song , so roll on , columbia , roll on but whatever their benefits to man , the great dams have proved lethal on a gigantic scale to the region s wild salmon , striving to complete their own remarkable journey from the rivers out to the pacific ocean and back again to spawn , right where they were born and here on the lower snake river , two federal agencies are exploring a proposal that is proving to be far more contentious than building the dams was in the first place , and could have just as enormous consequences taking four dams out of service , including the little goose , and restoring a 140mile portion of the snake to its wild , freeflowing condition as required by the endangered species act , the united states army corps of engineers and the national marine fisheries service are studying the most radical step of all to save the salmon it is an idea passionately favored by environmental groups , many american indians and commercial fishermen as far away as canada and alaska , who could someday catch a healthy run of idahoborn fish in their waters , and bitterly opposed by farmers and many others in this region , who now rely on the river for shipping and electricity the debate will almost surely wind up in congress , where most lawmakers from the area are vowing a toothandnail fight against breaching the dams , which would involve removing the earthen portions , and rendering the dams inoperative but the once unthinkable idea is clearly on the table because for 25 years , the army corps of engineers , which operates the dams , has been struggling to find ways for the dams and the salmon to coexist on the snake despite federal spending of more than 3 billion on programs that include fish ladders , hatcheries and even a truckandbarging system custommade to make the trip as safe and comfortable as possible for the salmon , according to a corps brochure , the fish remain in a terrible decline the river s coho salmon have already been declared extinct , and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the snake river is now listed under the endangered species act two centuries ago , when the explorer william clark wrote that the snake was crouded with salmon , about 2 million adult salmon a year completed the trip back to their spawning grounds , biologists estimate last year s official count , according to the idaho department of fish and game , was as follows 8 , 426 spring and summer chinook , 306 fall chinook and 2 sockeye environmental groups have already scored some major victories in their bid to take down dams in various parts of the country this summer , for instance , an aging hydroelectric dam on maine s kennebec river was demolished , under federal order , to open the river so that several species of atlantic fish , including salmon and sturgeon , could regain access to their traditional spawning grounds and a northwest electric utility , pacificorp , said recently that it would take down the condit dam on washington s white salmon river by 2006 rather than pay the 30 million federal regulators would have required to make it less harmful to fish the dam , which is 125 feet high , is the tallest dam ever slated for demolition in the united states , environmentalists say interior secretary bruce babbitt said the plan was yet another example that river restoration is on the national agenda but the breaching of the little goose and three other snake river dams would dwarf either of those actions , and would signal a remarkable shift in national priorities opponents of the breaching plan seem flabbergasted that the idea is even up for discussion the dams provide about 4 percent of the northwest s electricity and were also built to turn lewiston , idaho , in the foothills of the rocky mountains and nearly 500 miles from the pacific , into the west coast s most inland seaport none of the dams is used for flood control the opponents trust that even if federal agencies do recommend the action , it can be blocked in congress a draft report by the fisheries service earlier this year called breaching the dams more likely than any other hydrosystem action to meet survival and recovery criteria for the listed species , bureaucratic language nonetheless greeted as a bombshell around here still , the opponents have staunch defenders , like senator slade gorton , republican of washington , who says that breaching the dams would be an unmitigated disaster and an economic nightmare for the region
friday harbor , wash , june 27 if you think about it from the whales' point of view , said fred west , mostly what they get from us is a lot of engine noise and that s certainly not the best human beings have to offer and so mr west and the group he directs , seattle s city cantabile choir , took to the waters around washington s san juan islands to rectify this , at least for one sundappled summer evening in which the last stretches of northern light lingered until after 10 out at sea , the group gave a concert for the whales with unusual official permission from the national marine fisheries service , an underwater speaker system and an eclectic repertory that included monteverdi s vespers , afrobrazilian songs for the goddess of the sea and when the saints go marching in , the sounds of the group wafted across and under the waters on saturday night the human spirit was willing we 're a lot more loose here than in a concert hall , explained brad hawkins , the cellist none of them , he said of the whales , are critics let the record show that in the intended audience , there was no clapping of hands and no standing ovation but let it also show that about a dozen of the killer whales , or orcas , showed up , nearly surrounding the boat at times , cutting the surface of the water , their blackandwhite coloring spectacularly visible it is also indisputably true that in a rendition of amazing grace , two of the whales turned around and headed back toward the 64foot boat , the odyssey , from which the choir sang and humans may even figure out one day precisely what the whales thought of it all underwater monitors picked up the squeaks , clicks and low whistles the orcas use to communicate with each other , and a tape recording of the evening will show what sounds the whales were making during various songs still , for whales to surround a boat is nothing unusual here the waters off the san juans and neighboring british columbia are considered some of the best whalewatching vantage points on earth all kinds of boats offer whalewatching tours , and in friday harbor , there is a whale research center , a whale museum and a 22yearold nonprofit company , interspecies communication inc , that among other things works to give artists some of the same access scientists have to wild animals , said its founder , jim nollman and near robson bight , british columbia , an inlet that is perhaps the busiest whale intersection in the world , a small fm radio station broadcasts the eerie sounds of the whales , live , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week all whales , all the time , is its unofficial motto it is run by the vancouver aquarium , which , asked on the government application it filed two years ago whether the station would broadcast in english or french , listed whale the whales are so wellstudied here that naturalists can easily distinguish them by their markings , and nearly all of the 95 or so in the three southern pods , or groups in which they travel , have names among them are baba , hugo , marina , grace , sparky , squirty , sissy , spock , ruffles , granny , tahoma , oreo , sequim , deadhead , mike and ralph no one wanted to make too much of the science on saturday evening this is really more a cultural gesture than some huge jacques cousteau expedition , mr west said but even at that , it almost did not come off , after the choral group and two other sponsoring environmental organizations , people for puget sound and friends of the san juans , made the possible mistake of seeking permission to go out to sea and sing some fisheries officials asked whether the group might be in violation of the marine mammal protection act the question was , are you seeking to affect the whales' behavior , said mike sato , north sound director for people for puget sound and we had to say , 'well , yeah we want them to come and listen' but eventually the red tape was cleared up , and so , as the odyssey made its way through haro strait and the western skies turned orange and pink over the canadian peaks nearby , the group of about 20 sang and a handful of musicians played yemanja , the afrobrazilian music plovi , barko , a serbocroatian song about the sea a french christmas carol renaissance madrigals south african children s songs and the christian hymn for the beauty of the earth whales coming at 7 o'clock ! reported lynn danaher , the skipper of the odyssey and a former commercial fisherwoman in alaska , referring to the orcas' location and not the time keep singing ! keep singing ! as two orcas moved slowly along the port side , surfacing now and then , ms danaher , whose company , san juan excursions , runs tours every day from early may to late september , said she had little doubt the whales were intrigued but i'm really wondering right now if they want something a little faster like 'johnny b goode' mr nollman , the founder and director of interspecies communication , who has studied a dozen species of whales around the world and written several books about them , said the whales were capable of making phenomenal musical sounds the ones up north , there are some great sounds for a jazz musician , he said of orcas he has studied , for months at a time , 200 miles to the north off vancouver island some of them sound like charlie parker they do completely intellectual things i 've heard stuff up there that would knock your socks off he also said he had no doubt the whales heard this concert their ears are like a bloodhound s nose , he said some singers on the boat said the experience was a blissful break from other performances in a concert hall , you 're trying to make it all perfect , said joanne nelsen , a singer and songwriter here , you 're just trying to reach well , somebody kathy fletcher , the executive director of people for puget sound , said the point was , for one night anyway , to give the whales the best human beings have to offer it would be nice to think it would be wellreceived , she said but whales are whales if they ignore us , that s ok too mr west , meanwhile , said he would simply love to hear something back from the whales someday my whole thing out here is , if we could just get off of our dominionovertheearth thing for a while , put aside the idea that we 're the top of the heap , then maybe we could really learn something from other species photo fred west of seattle s city cantabile choir played the flute as he and the singers performed on saturday for 12 whales off san juan islands \( larry davis for the new york times \) map of washington state highlighting friday harbor the waters off san juan islands are prime whalewatching points

moscow , june 22 the deputy atomic energy minister valentin b ivanov has good reason to promise that russia s 29 nuclear reactors will be free of the year 2000 computer problem in january the reactors , it seems , are largely free of computers at the nuclear station nearest to moscow , mr ivanov said , the general engineer promises that he 'll have a new year s party , and he s invited me although american experts said they would quite likely accept such an invitation , they still have nagging questions about how ready the reactors are the experts said they were unsure whether engineers could locate and check all the microchips and other digital improvements that have been added to sovietera plants over the years the experts worry that russian engineers , adept at handling breakdowns in sometimes creaky plants , might be overwhelmed if four or five systems failed at once , and they wonder whether backup water and power systems are sufficient most of all , the experts wonder whether the cashdepleted government can really oversee all the work at stations flung across 10 time zones , some so remote that it is tough to administer them even in normal times they 're taking it seriously , an american official said our concern is that they wo n't do enough , either because there are some pockets in russia that still are n't taking it seriously , even though they 've been ordered by the government to do things , or because they lack the resources the official echoed an analysis by the pacific northwest national laboratories of the united states energy department about potential year 2000 flaws in sovietstyle reactors the report found that senior russian officials had made reactor safety a priority , but that the level of effort devoted to date varied from site to site and organization to organization in particular , american experts worry that the nuclearenergy industry is so short of cash and time that even some obvious flaws will go uncorrected those experts stress that their views are only welleducated guesses although americans have visited all 66 sovietstyle reactors in russia and surrounding nations , they have not evaluated the plants for year 2000 vulnerabilities in general , they said , the millennium bug poses a small threat analog devices control most mission critical functions , including crucial water pumps some flawed computers or chips could force a plant to shut down , but none appear vital to stopping reactors in an emergency in an emergency , a reactor can usually be shut down instantly but operators still need to pump cool water to the core for a few days , until the plant is completely stabilized that underscores american experts' second concern , that reactors could be hampered by the failure of regional power grids or other utilities and that backup systems at cashstrapped reactors might prove inadequate as in the west , russian nuclear stations have emergency backups like multiple generators but they can be thwarted by many factors like poor maintenance or a shortage of diesel fuel even in western plants , an american said , the systems do n't work right all the time russian experts nevertheless said they were atop the situation the top year 2000 official in the atomic energy ministry , yuri sokolov , said in march that experts had checked 97 percent of datesensitive reactor components mr sokolov did not say what that review found , but he said his ministry would use all means at its disposal to correct any flawed hardware or programs mr ivanov said flatly that the only computer systems with potential problems were those that process data and that all systems that affected critical reactor operations had been deemed safe , as have the systems that contain radiation still , he indicated that russian experts harbored some of the lingering concerns that nag american scientists russia , it turns out , is not the americans' greatest concern the greatest potential for problems is in ukraine , which is in even worse financial shape it has 14 reactors in operation
washington , sept 2 justice department officials have held serious discussions with former senator john c danforth , a missouri republican , about leading a new , broadbased inquiry into what happened at the branch davidian compound near waco , tex , in 1993 , clinton administration officials said tonight the officials said that a final decision had not been made and that there was at least one other plausible candidate that person is a former united states attorney , whom the officials would not name , but whom they characterized as being thought of as a fallback choice the officials noted that mr danforth , who retired from the senate in 1994 , fit most , if not all , of the requirements set by attorney general janet reno for the person to lead the inquiry ms reno has emphasized to aides that she is seeking to recruit a nationally known republican with a strong reputation for integrity the officials also disclosed today that ms reno believed that the federal bureau of investigation had concealed from her a second audio recording made on the scene the day the branch davidian compound erupted in flames , killing some 80 people , many of them children on wednesday , ms reno ordered united states marshals to enter the fbi s headquarters across pennsylvania avenue from the justice department and seize a tape recording of conversations between field commanders and agents that dealt with the firing of pyrotechnic teargas canisters on the day of the assault it was the recent disclosure that such canisters had been used despite years of denials by the bureau and ms reno that prompted her to complain she had been badly served by the bureau the second tape was made between 10 am and noon on the day of the assault , and officials asked to retain it to make a transcript with their playback machines but ms reno refused and asked that the tape be turned over to the marshals along with the one about the canisters a transcript of the first tape , which was made between 6 am and 8 am on april 19 , 1993 , details a sometimes inaudible conversation between two fbi officials that culminates in the order to fire the canisters according to a transcript , supplied by officials , in the conversation that took place at 7 49 am , richard m rogers , the agent in charge , from the bureau s elite hostage rescue team , questions a subordinate , stephen p mcgavin , a supervisory agent of the rescue team , about the feasibility of firing the canisters the transcript shows mr mcgavin suggesting that an agent armed with the canisters can fire them at the construction project with relative safety using a vehicle for cover mr rogers responds with a question , you 're talking about the block over top the construction \? he then repeats that he is referring to a block by the construction , a site since identified as a concrete bunker some 25 to 30 yards from the wooden residence where the davidians resided mr mcgavin then says the agent armed with the canisters believes he can use a truck for cover and attempt to penetrate it with military rounds he then asks for permission to do so yeah , that s affirmative , mr rogers responds as for the second tape , which was not transcribed by officials until today , it was unclear what the tape dealt with justice department officials also spent today hurriedly pondering who should be asked to lead the investigation ms reno , who returned to washington today from panama , has scheduled a news conference for friday morning mr danforth became best known to the public in the summer of 1991 , when he vigorously defended the nomination of judge clarence thomas to the supreme court usually mildmannered , mr danforth shed his reserve to wage war on behalf of judge thomas , who had once worked for him and was a close friend the discussions with mr danforth , officials said tonight , concerned the degree of independence he would enjoy , the reach of the investigation s subpoena power and his authority to hire investigators department officials have already begun reviewing mr danforth s current legal clients for any conflicts of interest mr danforth , who practices law in st louis , did not return telephone calls to his office the discovery that the pyrotechnic canisters were used may have touched off a major brawl between ms reno and director louis j freeh of the fbi and angered many members of congress , but no one has suggested there is any new evidence that the bureau started the fatal fire the canisters were fired six hours before the fire senator charles e schumer , democrat of new york , said tonight that he thought any new inquiry should be narrow this whole thing might be getting out of hand , mr schumer said perhaps the fbi behaved badly in not disclosing facts , he said , but no new facts have come out , certainly none that suggest there is anything wrong with the main conclusion that david koresh was responsible for setting the fire mr koresh was the branch davidians' leader
williamstown , mass when summer comes and the golden yarrow is blooming , this impossibly tidy new england town revels in its nickname , the village beautiful , and in the usual tension of dramas that divide twins , trap lost souls , rile shrews and inspire neutrons to burst into song benedict arnold and henry david thoreau may have retreated for a respite to this village in the berkshires of northern massachusetts , but the theater tourists drawn here are seeking something more dynamic at the annual williamstown theater festival for three months each summer , festival organizers mount an ambitious schedule of new plays and classics that tap the talent of broadway and hollywood \( the actor ethan hawke recently played the doomed boxer in tennessee williams s camino real and gwyneth paltrow is performing in shakespeare s as you like it this month \) this year , from june to aug 29 , 11 plays are being performed the tranquil setting does not influence the selection , said michael ritchie , the producer of the festival , but it does help lure actors , many of whom live during performances at the dormitories of williams college , a small , 206yearold liberal arts institution at the foot of mount greylock , the highest peak in massachusetts in an earlier time , the benefits of a retreat to the area duly impressed thoreau , who remarked that it would be no small advantage if every small college were thus located at the base of a mountain he added that some will remember , no doubt , not only that they went to college , but that they went to the mountains the same advantage holds for the festival , said mr ritchie , who noted that the new england setting was a great hook in terms of making an appeal to actors it s an idyllic town of brick walls surrounded by these beautiful mountains for the uncelebrated tourist without a script for a long weekend , williamstown is not only a draw for its theater but also a convenient staging area for a leisurely drive along the 63 miles of the mohawk trail , the only motor road of the preworld war i era still in use in the united states opened in 1914 , the mohawk trail \( route 2 \) is a twolane road that follows the old footpath of trade through northern massachusetts it was once used by five nations of american indians , including the mohawk of new york and the pocumtuc of the connecticut river valley roaming with a 2yearold , the road beckoned for its hypnotic effect on my passenger on a day when i did n't have a ticket to a matinee the air was cool and scented with wildflowers the sweeping view from western summit , or spirit mountain , as it was known by indians , takes in mount prospect , mount williams and mount greylock , where herman melville and nathaniel hawthorne once met , and the site this october for a ramble hike for an expected crowd of 3 , 000 hikers the mohawk trail s twists , dips and landmark hairpin turn conjured up the epigraph for the script for the dreamy camino real , which i had seen a day earlier in the middle of the journey of our life i came to myself in a dark wood where the straight way was lost this is a road that can lead a traveler to quirky landmarks , odd adventures or serious institutions for example , the newly renovated 19thcentury brick mill complex that houses the massachusetts museum of contemporary art in north adams this community bills itself the city of spires for its abundance of churches in autumn , it is host to one of new england s oldest celebrations , the foliage parade in williamstown itself , the sterling francine clark art institute draws busloads of tourists for its expansive collection of impressionist art , including more than 30 renoirs , and a current exhibition devoted to the work of the 19thcentury artist jeanfrancois millet but the mohawk trail is also a path to the unexpected , a place where the local guidebooks suggest short detours off the trail for llama treks to sunset picnics , or tours of a climatecontrolled shiitake mushroom farm or glacial potholes in a deserted clearing looms the hail to the sunrise monument of a lone indian in a loincloth with outstretched arms a short detour south leads to an arched trolley bridge built in 1908 and now transformed into a vivid garden of carefully labeled day lilies , primroses and petunias the shelburne falls bridge of flowers is described as internationally famous in local guidebooks , but i was unfamiliar with this 400foot bridge , spanning the deerfield river it is blooming with some 500 varieties that are tended by volunteers from the shelburne falls women s club , which created the garden in 1929 on aug 14 , the village of victorian homes and shops will be host to the bridge of flowers classic road race with a 10kilometer and twomile run shelburne falls is also home to a trolley museum that displays the last surviving trolley car from the shelburnecolrain trolley line , which used to rattle along the bridge of flowers for years the no 10 sat idle after roads were improved and trucking drove out the trolley business that hauled freight from the rail yard in shelburne falls to mills in colrain , mass in retirement the trolley car doubled as a chicken coop in a farmer s field , but now it is restored , and the museum and its volunteers are preparing to operate it for passenger runs perhaps by october , when autumnleaf tourists head for the berkshires we 're hoping it s going to run , but we 're not promising it , said the museum s president , tony jewell
the experimental filmmaker warren sonbert died of aids complications in 1995 before he could complete whiplash , an aching evocation of the fleetingness of experience , but not before leaving detailed instructions on how the film should be edited what he did not specify , however , was who should do the work in distress , his companion , ascension serrano , consulted a psychic , who assured him that help with the work would come by sea the next day mr serrano received a picture postcard of an ocean liner from the filmmaker jeff scher , a longtime friend and former student of sonbert s at a screening of both directors' films at the knitting factory a year later , a hat was passed to collect money to cover costs of finishing whiplash , and the film archivist john gartenberg offered to lend his support a former curator at the museum of modern art , mr gartenberg well understood the fragility of experimental films , most of which exist only in camera originals or worn prints , which is all most filmmakers can afford to create and the cinematic legacies of artists with aids , said mr gartenberg , are the most endangered through the estate project for artists with aids , a nonprofit organization to help these artists preserve their work , mr gartenberg secured financing to complete the editing and to make exhibition prints of whiplash at the request of patrick moore , the director of the estate project , he then set about designing a preservation pilot project so that the entire body of sonbert s work lush , symphonic montages exploring desire , endeavor and mortality would be restored and readied for distribution , as well as for archival and educational purposes now , a lasting home has been created for sonbert s work the films are part of the guggenheim museum s collection , and are commercially available through canyon cinema camera originals and inter negatives the intermediary film used to make final prints have been accepted by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences film archive as part of its effort to preserve not only hollywood movies but also experimental film art acting as a liaison between the estate project , the academy and the guggenheim , mr gartenberg has created a model for film preservation , distribution and exhibition the fruit of this collaboration is the retrospective running from wednesday through may 8 at the uptown guggenheim museum s renovated peter b lewis theater this is a very important project for us , said john hanhardt , the guggenheim s senior curator of film and media arts it s part of our effort to represent the history as well as the contemporary directions of international cinema , and to identify the idea of film as an art form in titling the exhibition friendly witnesses the worlds of warren sonbert , the curators are emphasizing the avantgarde s connection to , rather than its distance from , world cinema many of the eight programs include the works of other filmmakers these especially reflect a distinct world or cultural view that had impact on sonbert s life and work the first program explores the director s gay identity , the second mines the influence of andy warhol another pairs his films with those of the avantgardist stan brakhage , whom sonbert referred to as a hero of film one show explores how sonbert s passion for music \( he was an ardent opera buff \) influenced his work sonbert , who believed that the divergent rhythms of film and sound get in each other s way , made silent films for 20 years when he returned to music in the late 80 s , the balance he achieved between sound and image in films like friendly witness and short fuse was sublime beginning with the recently recovered 1968 tuxedo theater , the films of sonbert s mature period seem to contain multiple worlds shot with a handheld bolex during his global peregrinations , they are densely layered with place and meaning though his films have been referred to as diaries \( sonbert made extensive use of his friends and travelogues \) , they are not really his films foil expectations of confession and documentary truth , yet are rich with anthropological observation and personal vision in a sequence of friendly witness that is cut to the song mr postman , sonbert shows us the taj mahal bathed in a pinkish glow followed by a shot in similar tones of a man sauntering down a sunny street in morocco as the camera pans past him we can just make out the profile of mick jagger caught unawares making a sly allusion , sonbert then cuts to the profile of an egyptian sphinx after accumulating years worth of footage , sonbert would retire to his cutting room with a specific theme in mind in his editing , the images took on a new life uncoupled from literal meanings and quotidian contexts , they became notes or colors through visual puns , metaphors and stunning juxtapositions of color and movement , sonbert built films in which the connection between shot a and shot b produces the intent of shot c like the russian montage master dziga vertov , sonbert saw film as a language , and his work demands to be read it is hardly surprising that from early on his films found favor with poets while it is not always possible to grasp the exact psychological or emotional nuance he had in mind while constructing his arguments , as sonbert once called his films , their sensual appeal can be overpowering he favored the intense color saturation of the discontinued kodachrome reversal stock , and passages in all of his films verge on the erotic the rich chiaroscuro lighting of the gorgeous and rarely seen tenth legion is especially notableit s not that the imagery is sexually explicit , but rather that sonbert imbued the act of seeing with such intense pleasure the bodies of the lovers he intimately observes are as tantalizing as a caravaggio nude they 're delicious celluloid epiphanies , says mr scher of sonbert s films what emerges from these programs is an expanded esthetic awareness that also pulses through sonbert s films the guggenheim exhibition amplifies the sympathy between the film , art , poetry and music that were the fulcrum for sonbert s artistic development during the 60 s and 70 s this connection between worlds is brought home most strikingly through the program exploring sonbert s relationship to hitchcock like most avantgarde filmmakers , sonbert understood his work as a radical retort to commercial , narrative moviemaking , yet his relationship to hollywood movies was as complex as everything in his life he detested the stranglehold of plot on narrative because it overdetermines the interpretive possibilities of film language a diehard cineaste , sonbert saw everything and could brilliantly discourse on whatever he saw the acclaimed stylist , douglas sirk , and hitchcock were favorite directors because they undermined plot conventions and , as he once wrote , the hollow cupidity and superficiality of middle class ideals in an homage to hitchcock s marnie called a woman s touch , sonbert explores similar themes of female enclosure and escape the cultural perspective of the guggenheim retrospective suggests that sonbert s greatest legacy may be the compassionate equanimity of vision that undercuts even his ironic selfappraisal as a friendly witness we are privileged viewers of many sectors of humanity , he once remarked , none taking precedence over the other photo a woman s touch , warren sonbert s 1983 22minute silent film , was an homage to alfred hitchcock s marnie \( solomon r guggenheim museum \)
mexico city , june 7 like many oldstyle mexican matriarchs , emma castro amador bore so many children that she ca n't keep their birthdays straight sometimes she even loses track of whether oscar , her 10th , came before david , her 11th , or vice versa but i never regret having so many , said mrs castro , 59 , who had 14 children in 25 years mrs castro s offspring , however , have a different view in a generational divide repeated in millions of mexican families , all 14 say they are determined to limit their families to two or three children small families live better , says gloria munoz castro , mrs castro s eldest daughter , echoing the jingle , broadcast incessantly on television here after the government reversed its stance in 1974 , and put a brake on exploding growth gloria has two children and says she will have no more next year , mexico s population is projected to reach 100 million , and the contrast between mrs castro s family and those of her children illustrates the extraordinary changes under way in the country s family and population patterns , which hold important consequences for the rest of north america because mexican women like the elder mrs castro traditionally had so many children , the population has quintupled since 1940 , and will continue to surge at about one million people a year for nearly three decades but because of people like her daughter , many forecasters predict that slowing fertility rates will mean that the country s population will virtually stop growing by 2045 the tremendous reduction in fertility , from 7 children per woman in 1965 , to 25 today , slightly below worldwide rates the drop is resulting in a significant decline in the number of dependent children supported by each worker it may also offer mexico what population experts call a demographic bonus , the opportunity to generate higher savings rates and domestic investments that can raise this country s standard of living and bring rapid development if the bonus is managed shrewdly the drop in fertility is a spectacular change that has meant a revolution in mental attitudes , said dr rodolfo tuiran gutierrez , secretary general of the governmentrun national population council it s opening a demographic window of opportunity for mexico around the world , fertility rates have fallen from an average of 495 children per woman in the 19601965 period to 296 children in the first half of the 1990 s but fastgrowing populations are like speeding locomotives that cannot brake slowly , and even though mexican birth rates fell dramatically , the population has kept surging for now , unemployment will remain high , since even when the economy is robust it cannot provide jobs for the 13 million new workers who enter the job market each year many of the jobless will continue to emigrate to the united states during the next decade , some 35 million mexicans are projected to travel to the united states to work and establish residence when emma castro was born in 1940 , mexico s population was 196 million , little changed from what it had been in 1910 , at the outset of the mexican revolution she married at 15 after a oneday courtship , and bore her first son the following year for the next 25 years she bore one child , on average , every 21 months her experience was typical in 1956 , the year mrs castro bore her first son , an american anthropologist , oscar lewis , began collecting an oral history of a poor mexico city family , later published as the children of sanchez when mr lewis first interviewed the patriarch , jesus sanchez , he had 4 children , but when mexican reporters interviewed him 14 years later , mr hernandez had 16 more government policy encouraged rapid growth , partly for historical reasons mexicans believed that the 19th century seizure of mexican territories stretching from texas to california by the united states would have been impossible had they not been so sparsely populated but in the late 1960 s , as mexico s postwar economic boom began to slow , the sheer force of the population figures began to alarm experts in 1970 , mexico s population hit 48 million , and in an influential study several prominent mexican demographers warned that unless policies changed it would more than triple by the year 2000 , to 148 million faced with the challenge to national stability those projections implied , president luis echeverria alvarez in 1974 reversed course , establishing a national population council to control population growth and a network of government clinics to help couples plan their families the reversal came as women s attitudes about birth control were already changing ignoring the government and the roman catholic hierarchy , many women in the 1960 s and early 1970 s were buying contraceptives on the black market as a result , the government s new offer of family planning services began satisfying a repressed demand , and mexican families began changing dramatically , almost overnight we were determined to have just two , said mrs castro s eldest daughter , gloria , who married in 1977 we did n't want to spend all our money just to feed and clothe children
the network television business will enter the last year of the century groping to find a strategy that will insure its future profitability , and even viability but discovering such a strategy is becoming increasingly difficult , because the paradoxes about the networks almost outnumber the hit programs there has never been more revenue in the network industry an estimated 15 billion plus yet there have never been bigger losses only one network , nbc is truly profitable , and even its profits are in decline cable networks with fractions of ratings , like mtv and nickelodeon , are making much more money than broadcast networks , which have several times as many viewers advertisers continue to pay increased rates for diminishing audiences , because they want to reach large groups of viewers at the same time but they refuse to pay networks for all the viewers they have , paying them only for certain viewers , mainly young adults to accommodate the desires of advertisers , broadcast networks are increasingly trying to brand themselves the young adult urban network \( nbc and abc \) , the young male network \( fox \) , the teenage girl network \( wb \) even though that brings them closer in identity to cable networks , thus erasing the distinction that makes them more appealing to many advertisers the kind of programming that still attracts reliably large audiences , sports events and hits like er , has become so expensive that it often makes sense only as a loss leader but without it , viewers seem to drift away in even bigger numbers , meaning that the networks face a choice of either losing money to gain viewers or losing viewers , which eventually means losing money contemplating the implications of these challenges , many broadcast network executives now envision the need for nothing short of a reinvention of their business the new model is centered on greater ownership of shows , much tighter cost controls on programming , new sources of programming that move the networks away from reliance on the big hollywood studios and less \( or no \) money going to affiliated stations for carrying network shows but accomplishing these goals can merely be started in the next year , even while the networks are in the midst of the same old ratings competition that has driven their decisionmaking for the last half of the century how bold do you think any of these executives can be when they know their jobs are on the line if they do n't produce results in the next sweep month \? asked one former network president indeed , late last year two networks , nbc and fox , removed their head programmers , replacing them with executives who built their careers at cable channels those moves were widely interpreted as the first sign that the broadcast networks have to adopt a ca n'tbeat'emjoin'em strategy at fox at least , where the new president of entertainment , doug herzog , is arriving with one cable program , the outrageous animated series south park as the most prominent entry on his resume , the goal seems to be to play even more aggressively to the network s core audience , the young men who watch little television but love the xfiles , the simpsons and specials featuring elephants stomping their trainers and drivers crashing into abutments mr herzog said he would try to finesse the distance between risky ideas and broadly appealing programs he also underscored his confidence that fox was the place to be for the future of network television because of the carefully assembled assets of its parent , the news corporation it has brought all the production functions inside the company , achieving what is called vertical integration , which mr herzog said is the only route to success that means fox will get a heavy quotient of its programs from the 20th century fox television studio it will get movies from fox s movie studio news from the fox news channel , and sports from news corporation s everexpanding sports empire the other network already set up for this asset alignment is abc , which , thanks to its corporate parent the walt disney company , enjoys similar access to movies and sports the disney television studio is openly committed to producing shows that will specifically help abc the two fledgling networks , wb , and upn , which spent this year going in opposite directions \( up and down , respectively \) , exist specifically to establish a distribution system for their corporate family s studios \( time warner s warner brothers and viacom s paramount \) , presaging a move by the networks to own most or all of their programs i think we and abc just have advantages because of our vertical integration , mr herzog said i'm sure it gives cbs and nbc something to think about a lot of thinking is certain to go on at both cbs and nbc over the next year about whether to make an alliance , through a merger , sale or takeover , with a hollywood studio or a cable network talks have already gone on between nbc and the usa network , cbs and the sony corporation , cnn and just about everybody the issues can be complicated because foreign companies like sony are not allowed to own more than 25 percent of a network , and companies like time warner that have cable systems are not permitted to own broadcast stations executives at nbc and cbs have stated publicly that they have no intention of relinquishing control of their companies but the pressures of intensifying competition for shrinking audiences and profits could force a recalculation of the value of owning and operating a network in this environment at almost any time more than ever , the real value of the network business resides in owning stations the networks want to own more , and they will continue to press the federal communications commission to change the current limits so they can buy more failing that , the networks are likely to press all the more for some other revenue stream , trying to match the advantage of cable channels , which receive revenue from both advertising and subscription fees that may mean more direct sales appeals to viewers for videos of shows and the networks will continue to look for ways to repurpose their programs , like sending off repeats to cable channels , as nbc has done , putting reruns from its dateline nbc series on its msnbc and cnbc cable channels they may also begin moving more toward the idea of trying to sell accumulated audiences for shows repeated several times in a month , as cable has often done some of that is happening already fox ran the movie the lost world jurassic park twice in three weeks in november nbc ran a wrestling special twice in the same month but none of these tactics will diminish the everconstant hunger for the next big hit with the competition closer than it has ever been before , the difference between the top and bottom among the network competitors , between profits and no profits , may be determined by a single new hit show the program makers say they are desperate for new ideas , new formats , something that will either excite the public or at least alter the programcost formula as the head of one major hollywood television studio put it , if my garbage man gives me a good idea , i 'll take it and i 'll give him a 'created by' credit photo networks strain to lure big audiences like those watching the discovery liftoff last fall \( associated press \)
boston , nov 1 cities often undertake campaigns to fight crime or litter this city is fighting what health officials call its no 1 killer cancer over the last few days , every household in boston , in theory , has been mailed a brochure describing how to prevent cancer and to detect it early if it develops the quartermillion englishandspanish brochures , boston s largest public health mailing ever , are the flashiest element of the city s crusade against cancer , but they are only one of many boston s municipal employees are allowed to take four hours off each year for cancer screening a rule that city officials say was the only one of its kind until springfield , mass , adopted a similar rule last week over the last several months , about 1 , 600 chemotherapy patients have been given free rides to and from their sessions , thanks to hospitals and taxis participating in the city s crusade other cities and states run anticancer programs , as does the federal government but over all , said donald j gudaitis , chief executive officer of the american cancer society s new england division , this is the most visionary public health initiative ever undertaken in any city around prevention and early detection of cancer such a campaign may seem logical at a time when the death rate from heart disease has been dropping and cancer , the nation s no 2 cause of death , kills more than half a million americans every year but mr gudaitis attributed the anticancer campaign in boston to a particular asset a personally interested mayor mayor thomas m menino s father died of prostate cancer , and the mayor , who does not normally play up his personal life , said in a telephone interview that he saw his father go from a big brawny guy to 70 pounds and you ask yourself , why \? mayor menino added i want to try to help other people out in particular , it seems , he wants to help the poor boston , like many other cities , has found that cancer death rates are especially high in poor and minority neighborhoods patchy health care makes poor people less likely to have checkups for cancer and thus more likely to die from it more than a year ago , mayor menino convened a panel of medical experts and cancer survivors to help decide what to do the process , which led to the crusade against cancer , is continuing , said john rich , medical director of the boston public health commission but the panel established three initial goals that all boston households receive information on cancer prevention , that all bostonians receive appropriate screenings and that all cancer patients have transportation to and from treatment sessions transportation may seem minor compared with the first two goals but not to chemotherapy patients , said maureen sullivan , vice president of the massachusetts bay region of the american cancer society who is a cancer survivor it might not be bad getting to chemotherapy sessions , but , ms sullivan added , let me tell you , coming home can be really awful , and not only for you but for everyone else on that bus with you boston has introduced other help on wheels a mobile mammography van that has been booked solid since it began six months ago officials say the city is fighting cancer in small ways as well supplying sunscreen to its outdoor workers , for example and in bigger ones mayor menino supported a ban on smoking in boston restaurants , despite heavy opposition from restaurateurs the program includes television advertising and a new city agency , the office on cancer prevention the campaign costs little , mr menino said , perhaps 100 , 000 for the mammography van , about 250 , 000 for the brochures and nothing for the transportation and time off asked why boston is undertaking an anticancer campaign now , when the disease has killed millions for decades , those involved cited two factors the accumulation of research findings on cancer prevention and widespread disillusionment with the prevention promise offered by health maintenance organizations if we look at the actual synthesis and explosion , if you will , of information on the relationship between lifestyle factors and cancer in the last 20 years , it really has moved beyond just smoking as a major cause , said dr graham colditz , director of education at the harvard center for cancer prevention , which is participating in the campaign dr colditz said the center haddetermined that at least 50 percent of cancer cases could be prevented through behavioral changes alone the screenings could also prevent deaths among those whose cancer would be detected early , he said the brochure advises people to eat a healthy diet , to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day , to keep their weight down , to drink less alcohol , to avoid smoking , to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and to protect themselves from the sun none of that was news to mary caulfield , a 58yearold retired resident of the dorchester section of boston but , ms caulfield said , i think a lot of newcomers , foreigners , probably do n't understand even things like immunizations
kwambonambi , south africa the zulu bride had intended to approach the groom s family homestead in her shimmering white wedding gown , with her pearlstudded headdress and 20footlong train but her husband s relatives would have none of it the wedding festivities came to a standstill the singing stopped negotiations began as family members from both sides milled around on the dusty road outside the groom s family s property , each side clucking over the other s stubbornness eventually it was decided that nompumelelo mkhwanazi , surrounded by her family , could come as far as the gate in her white dress but then she would have to go away again to change into a traditional beaded skirt and leopardskin collar before actually being welcomed by the mthembus who had slaughtered a pale brown cow for the occasion and carefully divided the meat between the two families , in zulu tradition after that she is theirs , joked the bride s uncle , joe mkhwanazi , who had led her side s negotiating team and agreed to the compromise they can do what they want with her across south africa , in black townships and in rural villages , tribal marriage ceremonies are under assault , and it is not merely because young women want the white dresses they are also seeking the stronger legal rights that statesanctioned weddings hold out for them under apartheid , marriages following local tradition were denied state recognition though widely practiced , they were governed by tribal law , which made wives wards of their husbands once married , a woman could not own property , and if divorced , she had no claim to any of the couple s assets her husband could take another wife without her consent the apartheid government , geared to the needs of whites , recognized only weddings in which couples obtained a license and were married by someone the state had authorized last fall , however , parliament passed a law recognizing tribal marriages and seeking to bring them into line with the country s new constitution , which guarantees equal rights to women the new law allows a wife in a tribal marriage to own property and gives her half the marital assets in case of divorce , as do other statesanctioned marriages it continues , however , to allow a husband who has been married only under tribal law to take more than one wife as long as the first wife agrees and there is a formal inventory of property to protect the first wife s claims many women s rights advocates acknowledge that the law governing tribal weddings was a compromise but they contend that it was unavoidable the rural areas are filled with women in polygamous marriages and outlawing their marriages would have been more hurtful and than helpful , rights experts say in addition , they assert that if polygamy was outlawed , many men would refuse to marry at all as liesl gerntholtz , legal director of the south african government s commission on gender equality , put it for many women in the rural areas , these marriages are their only hope of access to resources housing and water yes , it s problematic but in some of these areas women are not in the position to negotiate the kind of relationship they want to have still , ms gerntholtz says , the new laws represent a major gain , and the property clauses will eventually make an impact our hope is that now it will be so expensive that polygamy will eventually die out , she said already , she points out , tribal marriages are on the wane since south africa never recognized them , there are no statistics on them but likhapha mbatha , a researcher at the university of witwatersrand s center for applied legal studies , says that even before the new law , black south africans had increasingly been mixing their cultural traditions with others and insisting on a statesanctioned ceremony as well part of the impetus was the influence of christianity those most likely to mix both were the most urbanized and educated in many cases , weddings have become an expensive mix of both cultures , with aggravation and amusement for everyone involved white ritual , zulu flair the nuptials of nompumelelo mkhwanazi and mthokozisi mthembu began on a recent saturday with a white wedding a christian ceremony , which took place in her family s baptist church near their home in a township outside richards bay on south africa s east coast the service had elements of african tradition , though for instance , family elders from both sides of the aisle gave speeches describing the many virtues of their own families , in a kind of jovial contest at one point , the bride s uncle made her stand to show how sturdily built she was like an ox , he said the groom , he pointed out , was just a short man the couple , known to their friends and family as mpume and guava , did not argue about having both kinds of ceremonies they agreed immediately that both were necessary to satisfy their respective families the bride , who lets her outgoing husband do most of the talking , said demurely that she would not have been happy with only a zulu wedding i am not going to feel good , she said there are people in my family who would want to see me in a white dress and even myself , i liked to see it
san antonio , june 15 tim duncan is thought to be drab and indifferent by almost all of the basketballconsumed public he is said to be too boring to be the best player in the league , too passionless and polite to be the leader of the gen x stars his own coach , gregg popovich , has said that his extraordinary power forward has no mtv in him it is because duncan does n't hang on the rim , spread his legs , growl and stare derisively at opponents after dunks or signal for fans to raise the roof after san antonio baskets or pound his fist against his chest during momentumbuilding spurs runs or gratify the news media with controversial or humorous quotes duncan , 23 , simply plays basketball well he scores and rebounds and blocks shots better than any other player in the national basketball association and does so with all the emotion of a grandmaster in a chess match , leading onlookers to glorify his game but dread his supposed lack of personality but duncan s teammates say that the dull and lifeless image is a facade , that the player who will lead the spurs against the knicks on wednesday night in game 1 of the nba finals pulls pranks like a grade schooler and often has them in stitches in the locker room do n't be fooled by all of that , spurs guard antonio daniels said , pointing to duncan as the 7footer soberly answered reporters' questions there s a lot of class clown in there jumping around with the media , he s kind of standoffish and reserved but we hang out all the time , so around me he feels like he can afford to let himself go duncan denied none of this and when asked why he did not share that side of himself with the public , he responded , y'all do n't ask me funny questions there is nothing funny about the way duncan has turned the nba into his own playground just two years removed from wake forest , duncan is already regarded as the league s most versatile and dominant player he was the only player to finish in the top 10 in five of the league s nine statistical categories points \( 217 a game \) , rebounds \( 114 \) , blocks \( 25 \) , field goal percentage \( 495 \) and minutes \( 393 \) and if the spurs defeat the knicks , he will become the first secondyear player to lead his team to the title since boston s larry bird in 1980 utah s karl malone won the most valuable player award , but if the voting had been conducted within the past week , the honor almost certainly would have gone to duncan ask anyone here knicks coach jeff van gundy the knicks' emerging star marcus camby the former coach and longtime nba analyst jack ramsay , or duncan s teammate and future hall of famer david robinson he s the best player in the league , and i thought he deserved the mvp award , said camby , who will be matched up against duncan at times in this series not only does he score but he rebounds exceptionally well , he blocks shots and he plays aggressively on defense i'm just trying to get to where he s at right now ramsay , who won 864 games in 21 seasons as an nba coach , said , he may become the best of all time at the power forward position duncan admits to being flattered by such compliments , but refuses to let them go to his head it s an awesome feeling , but i still have to go out there and prove it every night , he said all it means is that you 've got a higher bounty on your head that camby , kevin garnett , rasheed wallace and the league s other young frontcourt wonders are looking up to duncan is somewhat surprising while they were playing basketball daily in the schoolyards of america , duncan was in his native st croix in the virgin islands , striving to become a worldclass swimmer it was not until hurricane hugo destroyed the local pool in 1989 that duncan , once a top united states competitor for his age group in the 400meter freestyle , became even remotely interested in basketball at 13 years old , he was starting late , and with shockingly poor coordination he seemed to be nobody s great find duncan aspired to be like his basketball hero , magic johnson , but he was so out of touch with the game and its skills that competitors nicknamed him mr clumsy but after some hard work and long hours , he improved enough to earn a scholarship to wake forest , where he got off to a notsoblazing start no points in his first game by his junior year , however , duncan was a firstteam allamerican unlike camby , who was the nation s player of the year that season \( 1996 \) , duncan chose to stay in school to complete his degree in psychology and enjoy himself he was the best player in the land as a senior , and the spurs , struggling because robinson missed almost the entire season with injuries , made him the first selection in the 1997 draft a few weeks later , during workouts with robinson in aspen , colo , duncan established himself as the spurs' best player , astonishing robinson and leading the onetime league mvp to declare that duncan was better than he was i was amazed at his skills from the first time i saw him , robinson said once i saw him doing some of the things that he does , there was no question in my mind that he would become a special player in this league he s got great hands , great touch he s so smooth this year , popovich focused the spurs' offense more on duncan instead of robinson but robinson , who advised duncan during his rookie season on how to guard various power forwards , remains duncan s mentor and considers that role as large a part of his job as blocking shots and anchoring the defense he gives me advice on the league , on situations , on everything else , duncan said of robinson he s just been a great person to be there for me duncan says he hopes to finish his career with the spurs but because the team may leave the city if a vote to finance the building of a new arena fails , duncan said he would not sign a contract extension with the spurs when he becomes eligible this summer i love this city , duncan said i hope the whole situation works out , and i hope that as far as we 've gotten now helps it out but i want to know where we are i do n't want to sign back with a team and then end up wherever that statement ended yet another plain session with reporters for duncan , who then headed for daniels , his best friend on the team jokingly placing daniels in a headlock , duncan began smiling and taunting his smaller teammate , showing more emotion and personality than he ever has on the court photo tim duncan has lifted the spurs into the finals with a quietly efficient game \( reuters \)
camden sean russell never saw governor whitman s motorcade drive down admiral wilson boulevard on march 10 somebody said they came by , but they never stopped here , said mr russell , a lay minister at a converted gogo lounge and motel that is now the gatekeepers fellowship church i do n't think they stopped anywhere but when he heard that the governor was planning to spend 45 million 15 million from the state department of transportation and 30 million from the delaware river port authority to landscape , move businesses , tear down abandoned structures and otherwise clean up admiral wilson boulevard in time for next year s republican national convention in philadelphia , we knew our prayers had been answered , mr russell said for more than 40 years , this twomile , eightlane thoroughfare of abandoned factories and active liquor stores , gas stations , motels and gogo bars advertising live sex shows has been south jersey s most visible eyesore west of atlantic city originally bridge boulevard , the road was renamed in 1929 for henry braid wilson , the superintendent of the united states naval academy , a camden native who was commander of naval forces in the atlantic in world war i admiral wilson refused to travel on the road named for him after a tavern , the wilson bargrill , opened there it later became the site of what was said to be the world s first drivein movie , a boxing arena , and the first sear s store with a parking lot , on the roof \( the building now houses the offices of the camden housing authority \) the road is one of the busiest in the state , used daily by as many as 80 , 000 cars commuting between philadelphia and south jersey on the benjamin franklin bridge the governor s plan calls for removing billboards , utility poles , unused buildings and all businesses on the south side of the boulevard , between the eastbound lane and the cooper river , and replacing them with a landscaped park with bicycle trails other portions of the road would be decorated with roadside plantings the deadline for the project s completion is july 29 , 2000 , when the republican party is to hold its national convention in philadelphia we have been praying exactly for this since god called us to come here here four years ago , said mr russell , adding that none of the 150 members of his church , some of them former prostitutes , derelicts and drug addicts who used to haunt the boulevard s underpasses , have tried to contact the governor personally we prefer to work through god but when asked if he would consent to having his church removed to make way for the bike trails and park land the governor envisions for his portion of the boulevard , mr russell said no we have no desire to move this is where we belong this is where god called us to be we could n't accomplish our mission anywhere else but here thus mr russell finds himself in the same camp as the sex club operators , motel owners and and other entrepreneurs who have found more than salvation behind admiral wilson s boulevard s grim facades jev huja , manager of a car stereo store near the admiral lounge , a gogo bar , said we 're all for any kind of beautification the governor wants to bring put in but there s no way we 're going to be relocated this is a very visible location for us we 've been here for five years , and we 've been quite successful the only place i could put my business and make the same kind of money is on broadway , and i do n't mean broadway , camden the governor s plan is one of several for the region hauled out since the late 1950 s , when the restaurants and amusements along the boulevard were replaced by bars , motels , car dealerships and liquor stores since then , the only changes have been a series of road improvements that made travel faster for commuters , beginning with the removal of traffic lights , cross streets and housing in an eightblock section of north camden in 1962 and culminating in a threeyear resurfacing and redecking project completed in 1998 none of these improvements has benefited business along the boulevard , said j p gupta , owner of the four winds motel for five years , the problems we have had , we have had to fix ourselves i am in favor of anything the state can do to help what i ca n't fix one thing i ca n't fix is with the flooding of the river another is the reputation of the city of camden every time i talk to the government about it , they say they are working on it , but nothing changes when mr gupta bought the four winds for 15 million in 1993 , he said , he stopped renting rooms to prostitutes who beckoned to drivers from the roadside he also installed hallway surveillance systems and floodlights in the parking lot and made general improvements so he could market the motel to convention visitors and tourists going to philadelphia an internet listing has brought him lodgers from britain , italy , belgium , but very few from the surrounding area , he said they hear we are in camden , and they are afraid to come here will a few trees make any difference \? if so , it would be a very advantageous place to have a hotel and there would be no reason for me to sell so far , the governor has not indicated how the state will acquire businesses and property along the boulevard , or what provisions , if any , will be made for relocation we have no details right now about how it s going to happen , said gene herman , a spokesman for the governor mark magner , a disk jockey at the admiral lounge , a gogo bar , e has heard that tune before , he said they 've been trying to get rid of places like this for 30 years all that s happened is that the people who have wanted to get out have left , and those that want to stay here have learned how to fight back there s something about the way they 're going about it now , with the convention coming and the governor s desire to put on a good face , that makes me think they might succeed photos for more than 40 years , this twomile stretch of admiral wilson has been south jersey s most visible eyesore west of atlantic city but jev huja , the manager of a car stereo store near the admiral lounge , a gogo bar , said we 're all for any kind of beautification the governor wants to bring put in but there s no way we 're going to be relocated \( photographs by tim shaffer for the new york times \)

it never occurred to t peter kraus , the owner of ursus books , that yesterday s torrential downpour would touch the vast collection of rare art books stored at the rear of his shop in soho that s because the shop and its 100 , 000 or so volumes are on the third floor of a building at 375 west broadway but a clogged gutter on the roof and a few hours of heavy rain were all it took to destroy thousands of books that mr kraus and his wife , evelyn , had spent three decades collecting early yesterday morning , sheets of water poured through the top two floors of the fivestory loft building , soaking several aisles of books about artists like goya , delacroix , pissaro and toulouselautrec , many of them with original lithographs by the time the couple arrived at the store at 10 am , the water had receded , leaving behind piles of bloated and waterlogged paper it was a horrendous sight , mrs kraus said if you love books , it s like seeing a lot of dead bodies while none of the items were one of a kind , most were extremely rare , mr kraus said , particularly a 30volume set by the french editor loys delteil that catalogues 19thcentury prints the krauses , who run a second shop inside the carlyle hotel on the upper east side , also collect illustrated manuscripts and rare prints from medieval times to the 20th century , but those were not damaged mr kraus estimated yesterday s loss at several hundred thousand dollars although everything was insured , mr kraus , 54 , said the loss was not a matter of money you ca n't easily replace these books , he said in an interview last night after spending the day sorting through the detritus they were things gathered from the four corners of the globe during the next few days , he and his staff will sort through the books to see what can be saved in some cases , he said , a book can be salvaged by tearing off its front and back covers and rebinding the pages still , he and his wife said they were trying to put the loss in perspective the world is full of books , he said my wife keeps reminding me of the poor people in turkey , and that there are always people worse off than yourself
cleveland , oct 6 in the indians' dugout , they watched the man on the mound and the numbers on the scoreboard and they noticed something change dramatically in the fourth inning pedro martinez , boston s sterling starting pitcher , had been throwing fastballs of more than 90 miles an hour , according to the radar gun reading that was posted in big , bright lights martinez also had a 20 lead suddenly , after martinez struck out jim thome , his speed dropped to 88 or below sandy alomar , the cleveland catcher , said he thought to himself wait a minute ! that ca n't be a changeup omar vizquel , the shortstop , said , maybe there s something wrong with him travis fryman , the third baseman , did n't believe it i thought he was joking , he said , referring to vizquel s speculation but this was serious martinez had a back injury and could not come out for the fifth inning the indians tied it in the sixth on a tworun home run by thome off derek lowe and they secured a 32 victory in the ninth inning on a basesloaded single by fryman against rich garces the victory gave the indians a onegametonone lead in the threeoffivegame american league division series game 2 is here on thursday afternoon the winner of this series will play either the yankees or texas for the pennant martinez is the best pitcher in the american league and the probable winner of the cy young award he said he felt burning in his back after a 96 mph fastball to thome but he also said he plans to be back in the series for a team seeking its first world series championship since 1918 do n't scare our fans , martinez told reporters afterward write it the right way i 'll be back in the house i could rehab it i'm a quick healer martinez stressed that there was no pain in the shoulder that idled him at midseason while he was on his way to a 234 record , the best in the major leagues the game was an interesting affair , as brisk as the 49degree air , lasting less than three hours in a duel of aces who are close friends , martinez faced bartolo colon , who went eight innings and struck out 11 boston batters colon pumped his fists after good plays by the fielders behind him it was very emotional every time one of our infielders made a great play , colon said afterward both red sox runs were scored off colon by nomar garciaparra , who hit a home run in the second inning and doubled in the fourth before coming home on a single by mike stanley thome s home run in the sixth came after a twoout throwing error by john valentin , the boston third baseman , allowing manny ramirez to reach first base lowe , who pitched brilliantly in relief of martinez , left in the ninth after hitting ramirez , the leadoff hitter ramirez moved to third and scored the winning run when fryman singled off garces fryman missed much of the season while rehabilitating a knee injury he hit a 12 pitch to left field and said it was the only good thing about his trip to the plate i did everything i did n't want to do , he said you do a lot of talking to yourself that was not a textbook atbat , but the result was good paul shuey , who relieved colon at the start of the ninth , got credit for the victory when manager mike hargrove made the change , the cleveland fans booed paul probably saved me from getting buried by our fans , hargrove said colon is almost four years younger than martinez and their friendship is like that between a freshman and a senior from the same neighborhood who attend rival schools colon is 24 years old and martinez will celebrate his 28th birthday on oct 25 both are from the dominican republic , a cradle of talent for contemporary baseball when asked about his relationship with martinez , something of a mentor to him , colon said he s a great person , he can help me a lot with my pitching and with life whenever we get together or before the game , whenever we see each other , we have conversations about pitching he is a great person to follow martinez said colon looks up to me and respects me a lot martinez added even though he is not on my team , i try to teach him the right things and tell him how to do it because so far he s been good to me he makes it tough for me every time i face him i hate to face him again and again and again every day , but , if we have to , it s part of the game so we just have to go out there and do whatever we can to help our team from there on , just leave it in god s hands inside pitch boston s reggie jefferson , who batted 277 this season in 206 trips to the plate , was left off the 25man roster for this series and has left the team manager jimy williams said , we decided to go with 11 pitchers , adding that he was also concerned about the wrist injury to shortstop nomar garciaparra and the knee injury to third baseman john valentin and had to stock backups at those positions when asked whether he expected jefferson back with the team , williams said well , i do n't know go with the players that we have would his departure have a negative impact in the clubhouse \? we keep everything in our clubhouse , williams said everything stays in there period bret saberhagen , boston s scheduled starting pitcher for thursday s game , was asked about the psychological effect of jefferson s departure we 'd love to have reggie here supporting us , saberhagen said he wants to get away and clear his head a

alabama was first by early last year , nearly all of the state s public libraries had computers and internet access then came louisiana and mississippi next up are arkansas , kentucky , west virginia and new mexico we 're literally going to march through the states , said patty stonesifer , president of the gates learning foundation the plan is to help close the growing digital divide between rich and poor by donating money for publicaccess computers to libraries in all 50 states by 2003 this is the stated goal of the foundation s benefactors , william h gates , chairman of the microsoft corporation , and his wife , melinda , who recently gave 11 billion to the foundation , bringing its assets to 13 billion mr gates does not run the foundation , but the people who run the libraries have no doubts about the source of the money several of the libraries that ms stonesifer visited on a recent whirlwind tour of the south , accompanied by a reporter , prominently displayed a poster of mr gates holding up an ernest hemingway novel and admonishing people to read as ms stonesifer was leaving a branch in new orleans , an exuberant librarian called out , tell mr gates it s like manna from heaven the library program offers a glimpse into mr gates s newly burgeoning philanthropy he and his wife also gave 2 billion last month to the william h gates foundation , which focuses on world health and population issues , and followed that with another 1 billion earlier this month it also casts new light on some old questions can computers help bridge the nation s economic gaps \? and what is the role of the public library in the digital age \? at the same time , the relatively recent involvement in public libraries by mr gates , whose company is embroiled in antitrust litigation with the united states department of justice , suggests a nagging question at what cost does a public institution accept the largess of a benefactor whose corporate interests are so closely linked to the social good he is providing \? the need for computers in economically disadvantaged areas is obvious according to a report released last summer by the department of commerce , american households with annual income below 35 , 000 have pc ownership and online access levels well below the national average , while households earning more than 75 , 000 have the highest the report said the gap had widened in the last three years figuring out a way to bridge that gap is important to us , mr gates said , in email , referring to himself and his wife we want to make sure everyone has the ability to have internet access , regardless of where they live or how much money they have critics have questioned mr gates s altruism when the gates learning foundation was announced in 1997 , as a spinoff of a microsoft program called libraries online , skeptics noted that by encouraging the use of the technology that made him rich , mr gates s philanthropic efforts could be considered selfserving virtually all the computers that go to the libraries run on the microsoft windows operating system they arrive at the libraries loaded with a dozen or so microsoft programs and games as well as a handful of cdrom programs from corbis , an archive of images owned by mr gates further , the gates money goes to libraries as a onetime grant the foundation will supply free software upgrades , but once the hardware is obsolete , the libraries are on their own when they need to replace it this does n't even qualify as philanthropy , said theodore roszak , a historian at california state university at hayward and a social critic it s just seeding the market you 're simply lubricating future sales much of the skepticism , however , which was heaviest in the earliest days of the program , has dissipated carnegie gave money to build libraries on the proviso that the libraries would support themselves afterward , said john berry , editor in chief of library journal obviously , gates must be biased in favor of microsoft products , but that is the dominant technology right now andrew carnegie , the steel tycoon whose money built more than 1 , 600 public libraries in the united states in the early part of the century , is a name that crops up frequently alongside mr gates s these days not since carnegie s time , in fact , have public libraries , chronically strapped for funds , seen such an infusion of private money public libraries have been ignored over the years , said susan kent , city librarian at the los angeles public library , who welcomes the donations what the gateses have done is say that libraries are important grant recipients are not required to buy computers that run on windows once the gates learning foundation issues a check , librarians are free to buy whatever equipment they choose , with one condition the money must be used for publicaccess computing there is a catch the foundation s technical support staff is set up to install and support a specific configuration of computers manufactured by gateway computers deviating from the prescribed setup means forgoing technical support from the foundation since the program began , said ms stonesifer , a handful of grant recipients have chosen windowsbased computers made by other companies , like dell , but none of the recipients have opted for macintosh computers , which do not use windows and are made by microsoft s main rival , apple computer
ronald bladen may have been one of the founding fathers of minimalism , as some have called him , but that depends on what you mean by minimalism bladen \( 191888 \) started making simplified , industriallooking sculptures in the 1960 s but minimalism in the most thoroughgoing sense meant more than just extreme formal economy at its most radical , minimalism tried to eliminate any dimension other than that of the immediate , material present , forcing concentration on the physical facts of the object and the space it occupied but bladen , who was born in vancouver and spent his formative years in san francisco , where the abstract expressionist clyfford still was the presiding spiritual force , was too much the romantic poet to be a pure minimalist an interesting if not wholly satisfying retrospective at ps 1 contemporary art center makes that clear covering five decades , the exhibition presents a curiously diverse oeuvre it moves from a set of symbolist graphite drawings from the 1940 s , to some abstract expressionistic paintings from the 1950 s , to four of the giantscale minimalist works for which bladen is best known , to a selection of pedestalsize geometric models from the 1970 s and 80 s in all of this , the retrospective conveys no sense of continuous formal evolution but it does affirm a spiritual continuity however minimalistic his mature sculpture may appear , it is animated by the soul of an abstract expressionist in the 1940 s drawings , bladen appears to have been inspired by idiosyncratic visionaries like william blake or albert pinkham ryder murky and densely worked with erasers as well as graphite , they depict barely decipherable symbolic images of things like an angel , bursts of light and mystical signs of particular interest at this point is a small painting from 193940 depicting a single telephone pole starkly silhouetted against a red sky to monumental and unmistakably religious effect it is a remarkable anticipation of the stark , black monuments of the 1960 s bladen continued to paint into the early 1960 s , producing thick , brushy , monochromatic or twotone fields punctuated by a few irregular shapes the debt to still is evident , but there is a material generosity and compositional compactness that corrects for the arid grandiosity of the older painter bladen s abstract expressionistic impulses come to fruition not in painting but , paradoxically , in his huge geometrical sculptures of the 1960 s the culmination of this show occurs in one large room containing only the enormous cathedral evening \( 1969 \) , in which a great v shape thrusts outward and upward almost 30 feet into space , from two massive , trapezoidal feet positioned in the center of the room , it points with phallic urgency toward an open , arched doorway the effect is not unlike that of a painting by franz kline what s impressive about this piece is not its material being up close , it is a letdown roughly sheathed in thin plywood painted dull black , it has none of the material sensuousness of the sculptures of donald judd or richard serra but it does have a great theatrical command of space hovering mysteriously a couple of inches off the ground , its cantilevered , cannonlike element defying gravity , it seems otherworldly , an inexplicable thing from another planet looming with enigmatic purpose over the viewer that theatrical effect is felt in two other large works displayed indoors , each in its own separate room three elements \( 1965 \) consists of three identical 10foottall black boxes jutting up from the floor at a slant curve \( 1969 \) is a great ushaped , twofootthick wall , white on the inside and black on the outside crammed into smallish , rather dim rooms , these works seem at once futuristic and primordial the psychological impact is not simply a matter of size rather , it is in the way the works fill the empty room , pushing against its limits it is instructive to compare the one largescale work placed outdoors rockers \( 1965 \) , a construction of low rocker forms from which a pair of vertical square pillars rise 20 feet , is a big sculpture , but in ps 1 s vast courtyard it has a toylike quality , which is enhanced by its cheery , taxicabyellow paint job turning to the 14 pedestalscale models for sculptures from the 70 s and 80 s is disappointing made mostly of wood and painted semigloss black , they monotonously recycle a generic vocabulary of rectangular boxes , pyramids , trapezoids , vshapes and parallelograms they lack the drama of the earlier big works they have an angular , rather busy dynamism that harks back to the airy utopianism of early russian modernists like kasimir malevich or el lissitzky titles affirm that bladen continued to have spiritual aims in mind cosmic seed , blake s shadow , host of the ellipse but the main impression is of a bland , corporate modernism unlike his early paintings and drawings , bladen s mature sculpture does n't look very relevant today but there s a funny echo of bladen s theatrical play with scale in an installation by thom merrick on view at ps 1 , in a gallery not far from bladen s show it consists simply of a giant , inflated cartoon dinosaur lying on its side and filling the room with its pneumatic green bulges \( it is actually one of those balloon signs used by car dealers and other roadside businesses to attract customers \) outdoors , this object would be of little interest inside , its gigantism is impressive popstyle irony aside , considered mainly as an overwhelming of the container by the contained , composition in green and white , as it is called , carries on where bladen left off ronald bladen selected works remains on view at ps 1 contemporary art center , 2225 jackson avenue at 46th avenue , long island city , queens , through may 30 photo cathedral evening \( 1969 \) is among ronald bladen works at ps 1 \( ps 1 contemporary art center \)
johannesburg , june 1 even on the eve of south africa s second postapartheid elections , race is still a dominating factor thabo mbeki , who is virtually certain to become this country s next president , put out an open letter , not to all south africans , but to whites mr mbeki , president nelson mandela s heir apparent , said in the letter , which was printed in newspapers today , that there are some in the country who insist on issuing negative messages suggesting that whites are an endangered species this is done to gain shortterm political advantage without regard to either the truth or the wellbeing of the white population , he wrote , adding that whites should reject the message of fear and despair peddled by opposition parties as south africans go the polls on wednesday , they have much to celebrate in 1994 , the year of the first allrace elections , the fear of civil war hung in the air and violence crackled on the ground during the campaign season , whites hoarded canned goods and ammunition , while blacks died by the thousands in grisly clashes none of that is true today indeed , a mere five years later , south africans seem so adept at democracy that there has been a kind of hohumness to this campaign season but race continues to divide this society and despite all the campaigning , south africans of different races are expected to go their separate ways when they step into the voting booth mr mandela , who has had an unerring sense of the gesture that could , at least for a few moments , bring out the patriotism in all south africans , will retire but his african national congress party is expected to win easily , capturing the vast majority of black votes and perhaps even twothirds of the seats in parliament the 80yearold mr mandela , who has often campaigned until he is hoarse , remains beloved but his departure is not unexpected , and many south africans are taking it in stride they talk with fondness of a hero who needs help climbing stairs now he is tired , said rebecca dlamini , 36 , a nurse s aide from soweto he should be allowed to go rest some south africans even look forward to the leadership of mr mbeki , 56 he is seen here as a man who may crack the whip better than mr mandela did bookish , pipesmoking and reserved , mr mbeki does not have mr mandela s moral authority but he is considered a shrewd administrator perhaps the man to tackle the country s most persistent problems and , as he promises , to speed up change in the last few months , the britisheducated mr mbeki has been working on his image , often trading in his crisp suits for sport shirts and plunging into crowds to shake hands polls indicate that his popularity has risen about 10 percentage points but polls also indicate that the anc has not managed to attract most of the white , indian or mixedrace voters about 23 percent of the population two whiteled parties have been locked in a tight battle for those voters , with both parties playing on the fears of those groups that the country s black majority will ignore their rights one of the parties is the national party , which imposed apartheid on south africa and has renamed itself the new national party it is feeding whites' fears with posters referring to the president of neighboring zimbabwe , robert mugabe , who has been trying to expropriate land from white farmers without paying for it the other largely white party , the liberal democratic party , has been even more forthright with its slogan , fight back its leader , tony leon , regularly warns his audiences that a twothirds majority could mean a lifetime presidency for mr mbeki or anything else the anc wants the country that mr mbeki will inherit is already far different than the one mr mandela took over under the leadership of the anc , the country has adopted a new constitution one of the most liberal in the world and it has passed more than 500 laws , revamping a legal system that once did not allow blacks to vote and contended that they needed only a rudimentary education more than half a million new homes have been built since the last election , and telephone and electric lines now crisscross even squatter camps millions of people have been given access to clean water , health care and school feeding programs but problems still abound crime rates have soared more than 500 , 000 jobs have been lost as the country s once isolated and protected economy has tried to compete on the global market hopedfor foreign investment has not materialized and the country has one of the fastest growing aids infection rates in the world poor schools and corruption also remain issues at the same time , the giddy feelings of triumph that accompanied the country s first allrace elections have faded and some south africans believe south africa is more racially polarized than ever surveys indicate that blacks and whites hold widely differing views blacks are optimistic about the future whites are not though they still control a vast majority of the country s wealth and have only a 4 percent unemployment rate , compared with nearly 40 percent for the country as a whole

washington , june 24 snake oil salesmen have been around for ages but they are proliferating in the electronic age , according to the federal trade commission , which announced today that it had identified hundreds of web sites promoting phony cures for 30 ailments , including aids , multiple sclerosis , liver disease and cancer the sites are so numerous , the agency said , that it cannot possibly take action against all of them but it has reached legal settlements with four internet companies one that advertised shark cartilage as a cure for cancer , another that sold a fatty acid to treat arthritis , and two that promoted magnets for various diseases sites touting unproven remedies for very serious diseases cancer , heart disease , hiv aids and , particularly , arthritis are absolutely exploding on the web , said jodie bernstein , director of the agency s bureau of consumer protection none of the four companies admitted wrongdoing , and the settlements do not preclude them from doing business on the web they must only stop making fraudulent claims however , melinda sneed , owner of arthritis pain care center of arlington , tex , one of the four , said she shut her web site down nearly a year ago not because of ftc pressure , but because other sites were promoting the same product , a fatty acid derived from beef tallow , for arthritis by the time they contacted us , we already had the web site down , ms sneed said it was strictly competition that put us out of business the cases announced today stemmed from two health claims surf days , one in 1997 and another in 1998 , in which agency investigators and public health advocates from 25 countries scanned the internet for fraudulent health claims each session identified 400 sites containing questionable promotions , said richard cleland , an ftc lawyer handling the investigation mr cleland said the trade commission did not have the resources to conduct fullscale investigations of all the sites the investigations are extremely timeconsuming and require a comprehensive review of scientific literature to prove the agency s contention that a company is behaving deceptively instead , the agency acted against four of the most egregious sites , he said , and sent the rest email messages , warning the site owners that the government had paid them an electronic visit some companies reacted incredulously to the warnings , mr cleland said one fired back , if you 're from the government , what are you doing here \? others sent stronger messages two months after the 1997 warnings were sent , officials surveyed a representative sample of 64 of the sites nearly threefourths of them , 72 percent , were operating unchanged about 13 percent had dropped their unsubstantiated claims or disappeared from the web , 10 percent had made some changes and 5 percent could not be found when the survey was repeated in 1998 , the government found that the percentage of sites that had dropped their phony claims had more than doubled , to 28 percent mr cleland characterized the increase as a significant shift , which he said demonstrated the agency s work was having an effect today s announcement was part of what the trade commission has called operation cure all , a consumer education campaign to help patients sift through the maze of often confusing health information available on the world wide web officials from the department of health and human services used the occasion to promote their own web site \( www healthfinder gov \) , which they said was visited by 400 , 000 people a month and had links to 5 , 000 other sites containing reliable health information our message is it s quality , not quackery , ms bernstein said in addition to the arthritis pain care center , the companies that settled with the agency were body systems technology , of casselberry , fla , which sold capsules containing shark cartilage for cancer and aids and two selling magnetic therapies , pain stops here of baiting hollow , ny , and magnetic therapeutic technologies inc of irving , tex the lawyer for body systems technology could not be reached , and the owner of pain stops here declined comment jim richardson , the owner of magnetic therapeutic technologies , said he had cooperated with the ftc from the outset today s announcement , mr richardson said , has been blown out of proportion an estimated 223 million adults in the united states sought health care information on the internet last year , said scott reents , an analyst with cyber dialogue , a market research company that tracks the internet most people , mr reents said , visited the internet to understand their personal ailments the most oftvisited sites are those devoted to specific diseases and specific drugs there are an estimated 15 , 000 to 17 , 000 health care sites on the internet consumers , mr reents said , generally feel confident that they can distinguish good information from bad a confidence many doctors do not share it is perfectly obvious that some of the junk is junk , said dr george d lundberg , former editor of the journal of the american medical association and now editor in chief of medscape , an internet health information site \( www medscape com \) but there is a lot of inbetween stuff that is very difficult to discern
american commandos are poised near the afghan border , hoping to capture osama bin laden , the man charged with blowing up two american embassies in africa eight months ago , senior american officials say but they still do not know how to find him they are depending on his protectors in afghanistan to betray him a slim reed of hope for one of the biggest and most complicated international criminal investigations in american history capturing mr bin laden alive could deepen the complications american officials say that so far , firsthand evidence that could be used in court to prove that he commanded the bombings has proven difficult to obtain according to the public record , none of the informants involved in the case have direct knowledge of mr bin laden s involvement for now , officials say , federal prosecutors appear to be building a case that his violent words and ideas , broadcast from an afghan cave , incited terrorist acts thousands of miles away in their war against mr bin laden , american officials portray him as the world s most dangerous terrorist but reporters for the new york times and the pbs program frontline , working in cooperation , have found him to be less a commander of terrorists than an inspiration for them enemies and supporters , from members of the saudi opposition to present and former american intelligence officials , say he may not be as globally powerful as some american officials have asserted but his message and aims have more resonance among muslims around the world than has been understood here you can kill osama bin laden today or tomorrow you can arrest him and put him on trial in new york or in washington , said ahmed sattar , an aide to sheik omar abdel rahman , the blind egyptian cleric convicted of inspiring the bombing of the world trade center in 1993 if this will end the problem no tomorrow you will get somebody else interviews with senior american officials and knowledgeable observers of mr bin laden in pakistan , sudan and elsewhere suggest that there is widespread support among ordinary people in the muslim world for his central political argument that american troops should get out of saudi arabia the embassy bombings , they note , took place eight years to the day after the gi s were ordered onto saudi soil the interviews also raise questions about key assertions that have been made by the government about mr bin laden senior intelligence officials concede that their knowledge of him is sketchy we ca n't say for sure what was going on with him from 1991 to 1996 most of the years covered in the indictment one senior official said his affluence seems overstated present and former american officials and former business associates of mr bin laden say he appears to control only a fraction of the 250 million fortune that the american government says he possesses clearly , his money s running out , said frank anderson , a former senior central intelligence agency official who maintains close middle eastern contacts larry johnson , the state department deputy counterterrorism director from 1988 to 1993 , said administration officials had tended to make osama bin laden sort of a superman in muslim garb he s 10 feet tall , he s everywhere , he knows everything , he s got lots of money and he ca n't be challenged milton bearden , a retired senior cia official who ran the agency s war in afghanistan and retired in 1995 , said the government had created a north star in mr bin laden he is public enemy no 1 , mr bearden said we 've got a 5 million reward out for his head and now we have , with i'm not sure what evidence , linked him to all of the terrorist acts of this year of this decade , perhaps political leaders in sudan and pakistan who have met mr bin laden describe him as intelligent , softspoken , polite they also say he is deadly serious about his violent brand of radical politics and capable of killing in god s name mr bin laden was born into the ruling class of saudi arabia his father was the favorite construction magnate of the saudi royal family , who gave mr bin laden s family huge contracts to renovate the holy cities of mecca and medina and build palaces for saudi princes american officials calculated mr bin laden s fortune by estimating the family fortune at 5 billion and dividing by 20 , the number of male heirs but business associates of mr bin laden said his family cut him off years ago and are managing his share of his inheritance for him as long as he is disowned business associates say that mr bin laden has been living on a generous allowance from his eldest brother and that his assets in saudi arabia are now frozen in 1980 , at 22 , mr bin laden left saudi arabia and moved to the afghan frontier in peshawar , pakistan working alongside , but never directly allied with , the cia he used his money and his machines to help the afghan rebels fight the soviet army invaders the afghan war shaped mr bin laden , those who know him say he is an ordinary person who is very religious , said president omar hassan albashir of sudan , who met mr bin laden often from 1992 to 1996 he believes in the rule of islam and where possible the establishment of an islamic state the time that he spent in afghanistan led him to believe that this might be achieved through military means
chestnut hill , mass , july 18 his own captain had declared todd martin an invalid today before he limped out for his confrontation with patrick rafter but it took 3 hours 14 minutes before martin finally gave up the ghost in the brutal fivesetter that clinched this davis cup quarterfinal for australia with an illaimed backhand return of the spry serve rafter sent his way at triple match point

practice session and doubted that he could give rafter a fair fight if martin had been found unable to play , gullikson could have substituted pete sampras but over the objections of gullikson and the united states team s doctor , martin was deemed fit to compete by the event s neutral physician , richard paul , an orthopedist and a longtime longwood member martin was then ordered to play by stefan fransson of sweden , the event s referee , and sampras assumed his cheerleader s position on the bench for the australians , rafter s victory , which gave them an insurmountable 31 lead , was a just result to a competition tainted by controversy about the location , the court surface and the possible scheme to bring in sampras as a ringer in singles while the grayhaired martin slumped down in his changeover chair under a shroud of cold towels , the ponytailed rafter raised his fists in the steamy air , ripped off his shirt and was raised on the shoulders of his hooting and hollering teammates as they celebrated his comeback victory now i know why he s won the us open twice , gullikson said about rafter speaking of martin , who assumed the lead singles role many felt should have belonged to sampras , gullikson was properly grateful i thought he played a heroic match , gullikson said after rafter clinched the threeoffivematch competition , lleyton hewitt , the 18yearold rookie who defeated martin on friday , completed a 41 australian victory by defeating alex o'brien , 75 , 64 o'brien , sampras s doubles partner saturday in the united states' only match victory , filled in for jim courier , who opted not to play because of a slight leg strain rafter , who won his fivesetter against martin despite trailing by 42 in the final set , said , my body might not want to last , but my mind and everything else wants me to keep going the secondranked rafter improved his record in fiveset matches to 122 , and has now won 11 fivesetters in a row , five of them after trailing by two sets to none when i get into a fiveset match , i know that record , rafter said i know i'm going to be the one there last what rafter did not know , until 20 minutes before the match , was whether his opponent would be martin or sampras he did not comment on gullikson s reasons for trying to use sampras , but he made it clear that he believed martin s apprehension about putting his body through another workout in the saunalike heat you 're not going to get a better sportsman in the world than todd , rafter said i have a lot of respect for todd i never once saw todd trying to pull something over on me i saw him out on the court and he did n't look great he looked very pale in the beginning but as the match got along , he got more and more into it , and i knew then that i'm in a lot of trouble though martin had a 30 lead in the fifth set , he slowly frittered it away a double fault at break point closed the gap to 43 , a strong hold by rafter tied the set at 44 , and in the last two games rafter pushed himself to a competitive zone martin was too weary to reach rafter seized his pivotal break to 54 in the final set with a searing crosscourt backhand volley after martin doublefaulted to break point rafter then zoomed out to a 400 lead as he served for the match patrick outplayed me , said the eighthranked martin , who was told before the match by the united states doctor , david altchek , that he was unfit to play because of the lingering effects of heat prostration from his loss on friday to hewitt suspicion about martin s fitness , coupled with the availability of sampras , made for a byzantine morning at longwood he s entitled to his opinion , martin said of dr paul the australian captain , john newcombe , who said that martin seemed reasonably fit , added we are not into mind games he played three and a half hours of pretty good tennis in the heat , had pat two sets to love and two breaks in the fifth i think that speaks for itself martin said that his prematch intravenous treatment helped him , but that he did not take to the court voluntarily i did n't know that i was really fit to play the whole match until near the end of the match i was actually very distracted i had a tough time controlling my emotions i went out and played two very good sets and three ok sets and lost match points australia will face russia , a 32 winner over

washington , oct 13 a supreme court argument in the first of the new term s federalism cases demonstrated convincingly today that the states'rights majority on the court had lost none of its energy over the summer recess the question was whether congress validly bound the states to the federal law that protects older workers against discrimination on the job the answer appeared almost certain to be no , by the 5to4 margin familiar from the trio of decisions last spring by which the court carved out new immunities for the states from the application of federal laws what was less certain by the end of the argument was the route the court would take to that outcome , and how many other federal laws might be curbed in their application to the states as a result the justices heard an appeal brought jointly by the federal government and by a group of state university professors and librarians from florida and alabama , who sued their state employers for age discrimination in a case that was dismissed last year by the federal appeals court in atlanta the 2to1 decision by the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit did not have a majority rationale one judge in the majority said congress had not been sufficiently clear in expressing its intention to apply the age discrimination in employment act to the states through a 1974 amendment to that law the other judge said that while congress made itself clear , it lacked the authority to overcome the states' sovereign immunity from suit under the 11th amendment , which shields states from suit in federal court a supreme court decision that congress should have been more explicit would leave congress free to rewrite the 1974 amendment , and would not have farreaching consequences but a constitutional ruling that congress lacked authority to make states liable to age discrimination suits , on the other hand , would raise new questions about the ability of congress to define and legislate protection for civil rights that the court had viewed as having only a minimal constitutional dimension the court has never ruled that discrimination on the basis of age is unconstitutional , and justice antonin scalia said today that he found it extraordinary that congress just went ahead and did so on its own chief justice william h rehnquist noted that the court had ruled in a 1976 case that massachusetts did not violate the constitutional rights of its state troopers by making them retire at 50 we said there was no invidious discrimination , the chief justice said , addressing the state employees' lawyer , jeremiah a collins can congress change constitutional law \? he added the court s recent rulings on state immunity and constitutional lawmaking provided a subtext for the argument today the justices have greatly circumscribed congress s ability to make federal law binding on states , beginning with a 1996 ruling in seminole tribe v florida that the exercise of congressional power to regulate interstate commerce is not enough to trump states' immunity under the 11th amendment that decision left congress another avenue , section 5 of the 14th amendment , which authorizes congress to enforce by appropriate legislation the amendment s guarantees of equal protection and due process but a decision last june in florida prepaid v college savings bank suggested that congress s ability to act under section 5 was narrower than it had long appeared , indicating that the court would closely inspect congress s rationale for legislating under the 14th amendment the florida prepaid case concerned suits for patent infringement , far removed from the civil rights concerns at the heart of the 14th amendment the case today , kimel v florida board of regents , no 98791 , for the first time brings a civil rights issue within the court s new states'rights focus as the justices and lawyers were well aware , other cases raising similar federalism questions under the americans with disabilities act , the equal pay act and other federal civil rights laws are waiting in the wings , with the climate for considering such cases sharply different now from what it was even a few years ago by her questions today , justice ruth bader ginsburg evinced some concern that a 1976 precedent upholding suits against states under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act , the basic federal law against employment discrimination , might now be on shaky ground when mr collins , the state employees' lawyer , said in response to a series of questions by justice scalia that this court has always looked at what congress has done with a presumption of constitutionality , a comment that would have been merely a statement of the obvious a few years ago took on a plaintive , almost archaic tone barbara d underwood , a deputy solicitor general who was arguing the federal government s portion of the appeal , said congress acted on the basis of abundant evidence that public employers were engaging in arbitrary and irrational discrimination on account of age that the court has not given age discrimination the same constitutional scrutiny as discrimination on the basis or race or sex does not place it beyond the power of congress to address , she said justice scalia said he did not find age discrimination to be irrational as a general matter , adding that to say it s unconstitutional boggles my mind arguing for the states , jeffrey s sutton said the age discrimination law was an example of congressional overprotection of constitutional rights , unlike any other law the court has ever upheld under section 5 of the 14th amendment he cited the court s 1997 decision that struck down the religious freedom restoration act on the ground that congress in that law gave more protection to religious observance than the court itself had found to be constitutionally required mr sutton , who is now in private practice , was then ohio s state solicitor and argued before the court on behalf of a group of states that the religious freedom law was unconstitutional the court will hear at least three other federalism cases in the next few months , including whether congress had authority to pass the violence against women act , giving federal courts jurisdiction to hear domestic violence cases that are traditionally matters of state court jurisdiction in a second argument today , the court debated the constitutionality of a california law under which the addresses of people who have been arrested are made available to news organizations , but not to those who seek to use the information directly or indirectly to sell a product or service the law was successfully challenged in the federal appeals court in san francisco by a company that supplies arrest information to lawyers , insurers , driving schools and others who then solicit business from people facing criminal charges the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that the law was an unconstitutional restriction on commercial speech in a wideranging discussion today , the justices considered how to draw the line between the press and other publishers of information , as well as whether the appeals court was correct to find a constitutional problem in the selective denial of access to material the government is not obliged to disclose at all the case is los angeles police department v united reporting publishing corporation , no 98678
houston , oct 31 through the sadness and the symbolism , the extraordinary run of tiger woods continued today winning his third consecutive start , and for the seventh time in his last 10 tournaments , woods cruised to a fourstroke victory at the tour championship today , ending a week that was emotionally draining for everyone involved in a poignant show of respect , 24 of the field s 29 players wore knickers , the distinctive golfing attire worn by payne stewart , who died in a plane crash monday it was an unforgettable week at champions golf club , with the golf world mourning the loss of stewart while playing one of the year s most prestigious events but through the many feelings , woods added another milestone to a memorable season , becoming the first player to win seven pga tour events in one season since johnny miller won eight times in 1974 he also won the deutsche bank open in may with the 900 , 000 firstplace check , woods clinched this year s money title , having won more than 561 million on tour this season he is the first pga tour player to surpass 5 million in one season , and he has more than doubled david duval s previous record of 259 million set last year with a first or secondplace finish at the seasonending world golf championships american express invitational next weekend in spain , woods could surpass 6 million for the season woods shot a twounderpar 69 and finished at 15under 209 for the tournament , four strokes ahead of davis love iii and five strokes ahead of brent geiberger but these days , the distance between woods and his peers cannot be measured by strokes i know there were times when people on the tour sat back and watched jack nicklaus do the same things , love said while discussing woods s supremacy when he first came out , i told guys he is not even close to how good he can get i think we are starting to see that he is going to be good for a long , long time we are all going to have to get used to it at age 23 , woods has already won 14 times on tour , including two major championships , the 1997 masters and this year s pga championship but the tour championship victory was unlike any other , because the entire week was surrounded by tragedy the 24 players wearing knickers today served as a constant reminder of stewart , and stuart appleby took the gesture one step further by wearing one of stewart s actual outfits appleby visited stewart s home in orlando , fla , on thursday night , the day before his funeral , and received permission from tracey stewart to get one of her husband s outfits from the closet the hat , the knickers , the shirt , the socks and the shoes that appleby wore today all belonged to stewart none of the clothes had to be altered to fit appleby , and especially from behind , he bore an eerie resemblance to his late friend i was n't really sure what i looked like , but i was told that , said appleby , whose wife , renay , died last year when she was hit by a car it s like walking in his shoes for one day , even though my swing s not fluid , and i do n't putt as well but for woods , there has never been a prolonged stretch of better golf early this year , the swing changes he had been working on since last year started to come together , and he mentioned as much to his coach , butch harmon after i came off the west coast swing , i told butch , do n't be surprised if i won seven times this year , woods said i felt i could win in bunches starting the day with a threestroke lead over chris perry , who finished fourth , woods was never seriously threatened , winning for the 11th consecutive time when he has entered sunday with at least a share of the lead when woods begins a sunday in first place , he is as close to a sure winner as there is in golf i 've always had it , woods said of his ability to close tournaments it s something you ca n't teach i 've always felt you have to love the situation you have to love everybody chasing you , having all the pressure on you i love that feeling give me your best shot if i can fend them off , great if i ca n't , i learn from it woods was one of the players who decided against wearing knickers , but he wore a black ribbon on his hat throughout the tournament i do n't need to show it outwardly , the pain that i feel inside , and how much i held payne in honor , woods said other players may feel differently , but that s the way i feel it has been a very difficult week we 've all had to come to grips with everything i can honestly say i'm drained but on the course , woods managed to focus his most precarious moment in the tournament occurred thursday , when he sustained a stinger injury to the left side of his neck while hitting a fistsize rock with his golf club while taking a swing play was suspended friday because of stewart s funeral , however , and by saturday woods felt much better friday would have been a difficult round to play because my neck was still a little stiff , woods said my range of motion was n't there i was maybe 70 percent , and that would have been tough to play at but i felt a lot stronger saturday woods became the first tour player to win three consecutive starts since duval in 1997 , and next weekend in spain woods will try to become the first player to win four consecutive starts since ben hogan in 1953 asked if he could imagine winning eight times worldwide in 20 starts , as woods has done this year , love said 'no , i ca n't imagine it in this day and age , with the competition , i just think it shows he is clearly head and shoulders above the rest that is where woods wants to be and that is where he intends to stay i do n't know how much better i can get , woods said over the course of the next 20 years , we 'll see what happens then you 'll be able to understand when my peak was but i can tell you one thing i will continue to work hard photos payne stewart , who often wore knickers , was remembered on the practice tee yesterday \( associated press \) \( pg d1 \) stuart appleby wearing one of payne stewart s actual outfits before the final round \( associated press \) \( pg d4 \)
fine , ny , oct 20 john a gibbs , a new york state forester , walked along a ribbon of dirt road through one of the hundreds of public woodlands in the adirondack park , a vermontsize patchwork of state preserves and private land on one side lay the 2 , 000acre alice brook tract , one of many areas in the park officially designated as wilderness , where people can pass only on foot or in a canoe on the other was land labeled wild forest , where trails can be traversed by snowmobiles or mountain bikes the trees and tangled brush on both sides of the road were the same the patches of stillgreen ferns sprouting through golden mats of newly fallen leaves were the same but the difference could not be more stark , a variety of private environmental groups , sporting groups and local officials say in the latest fray in a decadeslong battle for the soul of the adirondacks , the culture of the hiking boot and that of the motor are locked in debate over a state plan to change the status of the alice brook tract from wilderness to wild forest so it can provide an eastwest corridor for snowmobiles altogether , the adirondack park agency this fall is considering what kinds of restrictions should apply to about 45 , 000 acres of forest preserve land , including parcels like alice brook that have long been state property and newly acquired land , such as the 14 , 700acre william c whitney tract , which was bought two years ago for 17 million from a company owned by marylou whitney , the heiress and manhattan socialite even taken together , the tracts are minuscule compared with the total of more than one million acres of wilderness and one million additional acres of wild forest within the sprawling park , which runs from about 50 miles north of albany to the canadian border and contains a mix of publicly and privately owned tracts but the pending decision has sparked intense interest , with advocates on both sides packing a series of public hearings that ended on oct 15 in almost every decision it will make , the park agency , whose board is appointed by gov george e pataki , stands to make someone very unhappy when it rules in december or january the final decision rests with the governor , who under state law can reject the board s landclassification plan that decision will be difficult , political and environmental experts said in the past , mr pataki has received high marks from landpreservation groups , but he also relies on strong support in largely republican upstate towns , where snowmobiles and outboard motors are often preferred to boots and paddles last week , mr pataki s aides said he would give no hint of his position until the agency board presented its findings the alice brook tract although the smallest piece of the planning puzzle and a mere pepper fleck on the adirondack map is ground zero in the fight it lies on the northern flank of an ecological treasure called the five ponds wilderness but it also contains an old snowmobile trail that , if restored , could link existing snowmobiling areas that are now cut off from each other as he clambered over a pile of trees knocked down in a wind storm , mr gibbs laid out the debate there s a lot at stake , whether it be economics to the folks living here who need to make a decent wage , or preservation to those folks who may live in long island or syracuse but who feel good that this is here , and will be here forever somehow , he said , there s got to be some kind of a balance to many small adirondack towns , where the economy largely shuts down in winter , a boom in snowmobiling could mean jobs and money hamilton county has 18 percent unemployment in winter , said thomas t bissell , the town supervisor of long lake , which includes the whitney tract and another parcel being considered for changes but to environmental groups , any diminution in wilderness in the 107yearold park even the loss of a tiny fragment like the alice brook tract would set an unacceptable precedent and violate an amendment of the state constitution that made the forest preserves of the adirondacks forever wild there s so little true wilderness in the northeast that we think every acre is valuable , said john sheehan , a spokesman for the adirondack council , a private group that opposes and reduction in protections on forest preserves since 1972 , adirondack park officials have been slowly working their way across the park , studying and then classifying each patch of public land as suitable for some level of use or , if left as wilderness , for hardly any use at all except to wildlife land that had old logging roads , mines , or intermingled private holdings , was given the wild forest classification , allowing more access the delicate politics in the region always demanded rough parity between amounts of wilderness and wild forest in the latest batch of proposed land classifications , the park agency s planners attempted to keep a rough 5050 split but in this case , the details do matter , people on both sides of the debate say
washington , june 17 senators and officials from states with fastgrowing landfills and highways teeming with outofstate garbage trucks used a senate committee hearing today to begin the latest push for legislation limiting the interstate flow of trash the renewed call for federal laws authorizing states to restrict garbage imports is largely motivated by new york city s plan to close the fresh kills landfill on staten island , and at the hearing , a series of witnesses described the noxious threat that they said would be posed if the city s waste came their way but other witnesses described the financial benefits reaped by communities that have constructed modern landfills to handle other people s garbage and representatives of the big waste companies that have invested heavily in private landfills in recent years spoke of the importance of preserving unrestrained interstate trade from the outset , it appeared that the new legislation would face a battle , at least in the committee on environment and public works , which convened the hearing and could scuttle the package similar legislation is now being drawn up in the house of representatives the committee chairman , senator john h chafee , republican of rhode island , said he would need a lot of convincing before he supported a bill limiting shipments of garbage i believe solid waste is fundamentally like all other commodities and should be protected by the commerce clause of the constitution , he said in a series of decisions over the last 20 years , the united states supreme court has affirmed that notion , striking down efforts by individual states to tack fees on imported trash or otherwise discourage this trade the court has ruled that congress can grant the states the authority to limit the flow , and this is the fifth congress that has tried to come up with a law so far , the exporting states , like new york , have been able to fend off efforts , largely because the issue of trash limits has not become hot enough in enough states to gain broad support but this time could be different , people on both sides of the issue said representatives of the large landfill owners say they are treating the legislative moves more seriously because the impending closing of fresh kills presents a focal point and a sense of urgency it has allowed some states to rally and focus , said robert eisenbud , the director of lobbying for waste management inc , one of the big companies vying to take new york city s garbage to its landfills in other states last winter , virginia politicians embraced the issue after mayor rudolph w guiliani suggested that virginia and other states that enjoyed the cultural riches of new york city should share some responsibility for dealing with the city s waste over the last decade , garbage has moved increasingly from places with few disposal options , like new york city , new jersey and new england , to places with large private dumps , like virginia , pennsylvania and indiana the shift has partly been spurred by the supreme court rulings but it has also come about as environmental laws have forced the closing of thousands of small local dumps around the country , most of which have no linings to catch toxic leaks today , senators from ohio , virginia , pennsylvania and ohio all took issue with mr chafee , saying garbage was indeed fundamentally different from other commodities the debate was strictly along geographic , not partisan , lines , with republicans disputing republicans , and democrats taking on democrats senator john w warner , republican of virginia , who is a sponsor of one of the proposed bills , offered to take mr chafee on a tour of the garbage routes in his state i want to invite you to virginia to look at the roads that are laden with the grease and leaking debris from these trucks , mr warner said virginia ranks second behind pennsylvania in the amount of garbage imported from other states mr chafee s state , rhode island , is one of the top 10 garbageexporting states , when the shipments are measured as a percentage of a state s total garbage output we 're trying to simply strike a balance , mr warner said , between the free enterprise system and the right to handle waste and the citizens of several states in their right to look after their safety , their environmental concerns and their quality of life senator evan bayh , a democrat from indiana , a state that takes in much of the garbage generated by chicago , testified that continued unrestricted trade in waste would leave states unable to protect the health of their citizens and would saddle importing states with extra costs for monitoring landfills while exporting states shared none of the financial burden gov george e pataki of new york declined an invitation to testify but sent a letter in which he told mr chafee that his policy , similar to that of mayor giuliani , was that waste from new york would be sent only to landfills in communities willing to accept it mr giuliani also declined to testify senator frank r lautenberg , a new jersey democrat on the committee , said he understood both sides of the debate , because his state sent a lot of garbage elsewhere but now also faced the prospect of acting as a dropoff point for much of new york city s waste while so many of our people work there , contribute to the city s development , we do n't want their trash to follow our commuters back home , he said even some of the strongest proponents of limiting the flow of garbage across state lines acknowledged that places like new york city had limited options in an interview after he testified about the 600 , 000 trips by trash trucks in his state each year , james m seif , the pennsylvania secretary of environmental protection , said it was unrealistic for a big city to be completely selfsufficient new york city does n't have to grow its own food , and it should n't have to dispose of its own waste , he said but mr seif quickly added that states on the receiving end should have some control over how their assets the empty space at their landfills were used photo robert eisenbud , at top ,

in the late 80 s , wired from having attended knicks games , tom brokaw would buttonhole colleagues at nbc news , an ancient mariner with a burning modern question why were africanamericans dominating basketball \? he would not take environment for an answer , and he eventually brushed aside both the cautious and the righteous who warned him that even asking the question could be construed as racist the resulting 1989 documentary and panel discussion , black athletes fact and fiction , was variously criticized as timid , racist , liberal and , most fairly , as inconclusive that was the shortterm reaction the longterm reaction was more telling the question was tabled no one else wanted to push a stick into that scorpion huddle brokaw went on to write a current bestseller about heroic old white men but the documentary s producer , jon entine , has come back after 10 years with a book to be published in january called taboo why black athletes dominate sports and why we 're afraid to talk about it \( public affairs \) this consistently interesting , readable , provocative , possibly wrongheaded book will , if it does any good at all , help reignite public discussion on the fuzzy definition of race , or it will disappear like a stone into the deep well of denial entine s basic premise is that the scientific evidence for black athletic superiority is overwhelming and in accord with what we see on the playing field using tables and statistics , he maintains that athletes who trace their ancestry to west africa have a biological advantage in sprinting and jumping because of proportionately greater muscle mass and percentage of fasttwitch muscles , a higher center of gravity , and more testosterone and anaerobic enzymes east africans , who dominate in distance running , have larger lung capacities , more slowtwitch muscles , a typically slighter body profile and the ability to process oxygen more efficiently whites , according to the scientists entine quotes , fall physically between east and west none of this is startlingly new , and for many it is disturbingly evocative of the socalled race science used by many societies to dehumanize the other one indefatigable champion of the egalitarianism that grew out of the holocaust , world war ii and the drive for human rights , richard lapchick , founder of the center for the study of sport in society , dismissed the 1989 nbc documentary at the time as pseudoscientific prattle last week , he wearily dismissed entine s book by saying , did n't we hear all this in germany in 1936 \? another critic , harry edwards , the berkeley sports sociologist , has said that such scientific data was an underhanded way of saying that blacks were closer to beast than they are to the rest of humanity entine , who seems up for a controversy , agreed in an interview last week that there s a slippery slope out there but it s worth risking because sports can offer such a clear way to frame some important issues that affect all aspects of society he is hardly hardcore on nature over nurture , concluding that the african biological edge is not great , but that it creates a cultural advantage that becomes a biosocial feedback loop , nature and nurture fueling each other sports race science can be viewed as simultaneously silly and dangerous even if valid , it would have no real purpose except to give management another evaluating tool add the ancestry check a nigerian grandmother \?

andy pettitte continually tells his father to focus on his eroding health and forget about baseball , and tom pettitte responds by telling his son to focus on baseball and forget about how he feels the telephone conversations occur almost every day the son lectures the father , the father lectures back and they both hang up reminding themselves to be more emphatic the next time it is a continuing display of mutual stubbornness and affection the father wants the son who tossed fastballs to him when he was 2 years old to excel with the yankees the son wants the father who was dedicated enough to catch thousands of pitches to realize that baseball , even at this level , is not everything but healthy parents are we used to talk about baseball , but not as much anymore , pettitte said after all that he s been through , it just ai n't that important pettitte looked down at the blue carpet in the clubhouse , shook his head and lamented that he could not persuade his father to simply relax when he pitches tom pettitte , 50 , has heard andy s rationale and heard how it does not help his heart to get annoyed and complain when a gorgeous cut fastball on the corner is called a ball while tom pettitte does not disagree with his son , he cannot treat andy s career casually there s no way can i do that , tom pettitte said in a telephone interview yesterday i 've dealt with this guy ever since he was 2 years old that s what i told him the other night when we talked this is part of being a parent all the anxieties , all the goose bumps i 've had them since he was a little bitty kid tom wanted to travel from deer park , tex , to the bronx to see andy pitch against the texas rangers tonight , because he had not been in san diego when his son beat the padres to give the yankees their 1998 world series sweep , having undergone doublebypass heart surgery five days earlier plans had been completed to attend game 2 of the american league division series , but tom experienced a new problem in a recent spate of ailments he learned he had an enlarged prostate and was prohibited from traveling long distances so tom expected to pace from one room to another tonight while deciding if he would watch the game on television as devoted as he is to his son , he conceded last october that he could not watch games on television because even minute criticism of andy bothered him immensely pettitte went 1411 with a 470 earned run average this season , but he started 57 with a 559 era and was nearly traded tonight , pettitte has the chance to continue new york s mastery of texas , with or without his father watching whether i watch it or not , i 'll decide before it starts , tom pettitte said since my heart surgery , it s too hard on me it depends on how i feel if you do n't watch the game , then you 're wondering what s going on , so you 're a nervous wreck anyway it s a catch22 i'm sure i 'll probably wind up watching it three months after tom pettitte had heart surgery , he returned to work at the lubrizol chemical plant in deer park , where he works a 6 pmto6 am shift at 6 feet 3 inches and 300 pounds , he has a chest as wide as a keg and friends who tell him that he looks fine but he had some dizzy spells last june , almost passed out twice and had to call 911 once tom spent three weeks in the hospital as numerous tests on his brain and heart were conducted , but none determined the reasons for the lightheadedness he said he thinks that it could stem from his heart rate not being right yet , and he wonders if he will need a pacemaker or if a 40 percent blockage that was not treated during surgery may have worsened i 've been so paranoid and messed up with my own self , tom said in the meantime , i want to watch my kid pitch , but it makes me too nervous and i have to listen to the negativism because he has n't performed well i'm not using me as an excuse , but i'm sure it has to be a concern to him pettitte , who visited his father in the hospital in june , laughed as he recounted telling him over and over that criticism is a part of being a major leaguer who makes 6 million pettitte , 27 , said that he would face the rangers without worrying about his father s condition i'm able to separate the two because the doctors say his heart is all right , pettitte said i just think he s not in good health he s not taking as good care of himself as he needs to it s kind of catching up to him october has been an eventful month for the pettittes tom did not attend the 1997 division series because he had had 24 inches of his colon removed , and he watched the 1998 world series while clutching a pillow to his chest to prevent stitches from popping open while tom missed andy s first postseason start this year , he vowed that he would be at game 3 on saturday in arlington , tex , and , he hoped , at other yankee games in october i told andy i resent the fact that i have n't been able to make it to the playoffs because of the things going on with me , tom said to me , it s a big deal as a parent , it does n't matter what s going on with you it s your kid you want to see your kid succeed and participate in the things you worked with them for that s all photo when andy pettitte pitches , his father often finds it hard to watch \( mary dibiase blaich for the new york times \)

in an attempt to break out of the slump that has sent them plummeting in the standing and jeopardized their playoff chances , the mets have tried everything short of joining hands to sing it s a small world ah , for the good old days , one week ago , when the mets were just one game out of the division lead and had a firm fourgame grip on the wildcard slot that was before a sixgame losing streak squashed their chances for the national league east title , made them the pursuers in the wildcard race and raised the anxiety level around manager bobby valentine s dugout the mets can still qualify for the postseason , which begins next week , but they need a quick turnaround beginning tonight at shea stadium in the opener of a threegame series against the atlanta braves the braves' threegame sweep in atlanta last week put the mets in a spiral , which continued with three losses in philadelphia you 'd like to think it s some kind of test and if we can get through this , then there s some hope left , said mike piazza , the mets' catcher despite their alarming fall , the mets do have a clear recipe for redemption if they can win their final six games , they will be guaranteed the wildcard spot if they lose one or more , their fate will depend on how houston and cincinnati perform in the final week if the mets do n't qualify , they will have collapsed in the final weeks for the second straight season they lost their final five games of 1998 to miss the playoffs by a game even though they were idle yesterday , the mets lost ground as the reds beat st louis cincinnati is now tied with the astros atop the central division standing , with both teams holding a oneandonehalfgame lead over the mets in the wildcard race the day off was a welcome respite for the mets , according to pitcher rick reed i think getting away for one day is the best medicine i'm not even going to think about baseball i'm not going to watch sportscenter if you have to drive to upstate new york , do that not to cooperstown stay away from anything to do with baseball since the losing streak started , the mets have had two team meetings , and valentine has foreshadowed his firing there has been a lineup switch , a note of dissension from a veteran reliever , and a complete collapse in the standing a week ago , the mets went to atlanta as energetic and frisky as puppies and atlanta essentially rolled up a newspaper , whacked them on the snout , and sent them whimpering away they continued to cower against the phillies sure , the mets could slip into gear as quickly as they slid into a funk , the mantra the mets repeated all weekend but that would mean beating tom glavine , greg maddux and kevin millwood of the braves in the six games they have faced those pitchers this season , the mets have won none , been shut out three times and have scored a total of seven runs not one met got a big hit in the last six days , and nobody came close to hitting his batting average the team left 21 men in scoring position and struggled as much against journeymen like joe grahe and wayne gomes of the phillies as they did against atlanta s john smoltz piazza hit 261 on the trip and he had two home runs against atlanta , but he did not drive in a run against the phillies robin ventura hit an abysmal 150 edgardo alfonzo , who said he agreed with valentine s decision to drop him to the sixth spot in the batting order , hit just 182 valentine talked incessantly about the bad luck that seemed to have enveloped the mets and there were a few hits most notably benny agbayani s hard liner saturday with two on that turned into a gameending double play that might have had a better result but bad luck does n't account for bobby bonilla striking out with the bases loaded in a monumental eighth inning against the braves , a matchup that valentine had anticipated and desired and it certainly does n't explain the week rickey henderson had henderson has been breathtaking this season , hitting over 300 and stealing 37 bases at age 40 but baseball has a way of evening things out , and it leveled henderson last week in the first game against atlanta , he struck out with two on and two out to end the mets' best threat in the final game against philadelphia , with two on , he grounded into a double play to end the game valentine , looking worn and weary himself on sunday , said that his team was exhausted and bereft of the energy it needed to spring it from this rut when i'm on the slopes , i say that fatigue makes cowards of all of us , valentine said that s what mental fatigue is you ca n't concentrate enough because you 're physically tired the mets get one break in that the reds and astros , each with one loss fewer than the mets , play each other twice in the next two days so if the mets sweep the braves and the pittsburgh pirates , they 're automatically in as the wildcard team why \? because if either houston or cincinnati loses both games to the other , it will have one more loss than the mets provided new york can run the table and if the reds and astros were to split their two games , and then win every other game they play , they would end up in a threeway tie with the mets and a threeway tie would be a godsend for the mets the reds and astros would have a onegame playoff for the nl central title , with the results counting on the regularseason record so the loser would have one more defeat than the mets , and new york would automatically be the wildcard team if there is anything more startling than the results of the last week , it is the reaction it has flushed out in the clubhouse the players have remained preternaturally calm , as if they are completely delusional or in denial there is no panic and , at least on the surface , just as little division john franco seemed perturbed that valentine did not use him instead of dennis cook to hold a lead against the phillies , but he was the only player who seemed anything other than frustrated and perplexed by what has happened i do n't think anybody is at the point where we do n't think we 're going to make it the postseason , ventura said you play the games just like you have before when you 've played this game long enough , you 've seen worse with the braves here for a threegame series , the mets may see worse , and pretty soon the scenario this season is almost exactly the same as last the mets set an undesired standard then , and have only one week to avoid a repeat maybe the only consolation is we have a little time left , piazza said it remains to be seen whether that is a blessing or just an extension of this curse photos luis lopez , left , and darryl hamilton lingered saturday in stunned disbelief after another loss to the phillies the word from the coowner fred wilpon is that manager bobby valentine will be back , no matter how the mets finish \( photographs by chang w lee the new york times \)
garden city , ny , feb 5 lawyers for five guards at the nassau county jail who were transferred last month after the death of an inmate lashed out at the news media today , saying their clients were being unjustly depicted as murderous brutes and would eventually be exonerated we 're here to tell you that correction officers are not monsters , said edward p jenks , a lawyer for ivano bavaro , a guard who was working in an area of the jail where thomas pizzuto , the inmate who later died , had been held law enforcement officials have said mr pizzuto , 38 , was savagely beaten on jan 8 while serving the second day of a 90day sentence for traffic violations , then left in his cell , bleeding internally , without treatment he died five days later of a lacerated spleen , and his death has been ruled a homicide no charges have been filed the united states attorney s office in brooklyn , which has taken control of the investigation , has also begun a civil rights inquiry into widespread allegations of abuse of inmates by guards at the nassau jail , in east meadow such allegations have been commonplace during the last decade , officials say , but only one resulted in a prosecution ernest peace , the lawyer for patrick regnier , another correction officer who was transferred after the death of mr pizzuto , called such reports overblown mr peace said he had been practicing criminal law in nassau county since 1962 and could not recall any client complaining of physical abuse inside the jail mr peace backed away , however , from an earlier claim that his own interviews with other prisoners suggested that an inmate might have beaten mr pizzuto no inmate actually said that , mr peace said yesterday he explained that he had reached his initial conclusion by process of elimination since the guards on duty had not attacked mr pizzuto , he said he reasoned , no one but another inmate could have the other guards who have been reassigned to duties that do not involve contact with inmates are edward velasquez , a guard who was working on the tier where mr pizzuto was being held gary pincus , a corporal on that tier , and joseph bergen , another corporal mark barber , president of the civil service employees association bargaining unit for jail guards , said the five guards all had exemplary records none have ever been disciplined or been the subject of an inmate complaint , he said but anthony pizzuto , the victim s brother , said what their records are does n't matter it s what happened that day that matters my brother was still murdered he said his family was clinging to the hope that all those culpable would be brought to justice not just the ones who beat my brother , he added , but who saw my brother and did nothing
the theater composer vernon duke , who died in 1969 , may never be counted in the pantheon that includes gershwin , berlin , porter , rodgers and kern , because his output was modest and none of his shows were hits but in his great seasonal ballads of urban longing , april in paris and autumn in new york , duke introduced a refined impressionism into popular song that was as adventurous as anything composed by his more renowned songwriting peers the cream of duke s output is showcased in a brandnew gem of an album , dawn upshaw sings vernon duke \( nonesuch \) , which mixes worthy obscurities with most of his best known work and on thursday and friday , ms upshaw performed much of the album with a small ensemble at joe s pub the relative formality of many of duke s songs makes ms upshaw an ideal interpreter of his work , since her careful balance of precision and breeziness matches the composer s in so many ways ms upshaw knows exactly how to confide a song without getting lost in its emotions she is adept at sustaining an intimate conversational tone while keeping a graceful musical reserve duke collaborated with a number of lyricists , including john latouche , howard dietz , yip harburg and ogden nash , and sometimes \( as in autumn in new york \) he even wrote his own lyrics nash , at his most furiously clever , could outdo even cole porter in the trickiness and sly lubricity of his wordplay and in dexterous playfulness , the high point of thursday s show was a nonsensical avian mating ritual , the sea gull and the eagull on a more romantic note , another high point was an unpublished ballad water under the bridge \( with lyrics by harburg \) , written for the 1934 ziegfeld follies that suggests the popular standard street of dreams as it might have been conceived by debussy april in paris \( arranged by the show s musical director and pianist , eric stern , with a debussian flavor \) and autumn in new york formed the show s bookends as duke wrote of new york s reviving spirit in the crisp fall weather , it s good to live it again the same might be said of his wonderful music
seoul , south korea as choi yang sook saw it , her place was in the home , cooking for her husband and cleaning up the house and raising their children but the asian economic crisis changed all that , virtually destroying her husband s architectural design business and forcing mrs choi to look for ways to make money herself so now she is enrolled in a course on how to run a flower shop , and she expects to start her own flower business this year i think it s time that women seek jobs , said ms choi , a mother of two teenagers some of our husbands have lost jobs , some have had cuts in salaries , and businessmen have had a hard time so women want to help their husbands and maintain the household in many ways , the asian crisis was particularly harsh on women , and in south korea many companies , cutting costs , laid off women while keeping male employees but the crisis has also forced women into the job market alongside their husbands , and the eventual outcome may be more entrepreneurs and even business executives who are women among asians , korean women have been among the most traditional of wives and mothers a few hundred years ago , when a girl was born , her parents frequently named her gutsuni , or last girl , in hopes that she would be the last girl born to the family even today property is still generally handed down mostly through men these days , young women frequently work after high school or college , but it is common for them to quit after marrying or having children very rarely have women pursued highpowered careers while also marrying and raising children now with family finances crimped , those traditions are fading and women are acquiring greater economic significance in south korea discrimination against women is at least as intense as ever in the business world , but women are nonetheless emerging from the home to help their husbands run startup restaurants , do the banking for a new business , or keep the books for the old company when workers are let go park ai ja , a 55yearold former housewife , was in the office of the sae ki trading company the other day it is her husband s company , importing chemicals , and she sat behind a corner desk , way across the room from her husband s spacious and enclosed office ms park seems a stabilizing force in the business the company is struggling , and none of her three sons will take it over but she says she and her husband are happy because he still has an office , while many of her husband s friends have been forced out of their salary jobs now , her husband s health is poor , and so they are not thinking of expanding or starting anything new we are just maintaining the company , and maintaining our health , which is important , ms park said the office , she added with a wink , is really for her husband s pride if you do n't have a card , if you do n't have a title , people may look down on you other women are also venturing out on their own to make money men usually stay at a company for a long time , said park kyung ja , 55 , who teaches the class on how to open their own flower shops attended by mrs choi they have narrow views but women , whether at a job or at home , are more open their personality is more broad , they are more adaptable to society that does not mean there is no pain in the process , as chang young bun with her topaz earrings , her flowing white overcoat and her lionpatterned shirt knows well ms chang , 43 , started a factory with 18 employees making linens , and when she was married her husband joined the business it grew rather successful over the years , as ms chang began supplying linens to insurance companies , which would then give them as away gifts to their good customers at the peak , she earned the equivalent of 25 , 000 a month from her business then the economic crisis struck in the fall of 1997 and demand for linens dropped sharply as if that was not enough , south korea was hit by flooding last summer , and ms chang s factory went under muddy water that soaked all the curtains , the lace bed covers and sheets her entire inventory i did n't see any friends for six months , said ms chang , who has a 16yearold daughter in high school i was in confinement , and if i met somebody , i would just cry she and her husband have parted ways , and she refuses to discuss the topic further she is raising her daughter alone , and now she has joined ms park s flower shop class and hopes to start afresh with some of her savings ms chang is already showing promise halfway through the threemonth course , she has already received orders for flower arrangements she sent to a friend as a gift , and for days she stayed up until the wee hours cutting , folding , and designing paper flower arrangements i think i can overcome the near comatose state i was in , ms chang said i 've always loved flowers when we had hard times with the bedding business , i would go out to the flower shops to console myself some women who are breadwinners are forced into that situation , especially if their husbands have left them , or divorced them the divorce rate is still very low in korea compared with western countries , and a divorced woman with children may still feel like an outcast in korean society still , chun kyung rye is plodding on a 44yearold mother with a son in sixth grade , she went from running her own piano institute for 17 years to being an investor in the women s wear section of a department store when the department store folded , it took all her savings with it , and she could not return to piano tutoring because of stricter government rules on private lessons now that she is learning how to start up her own flower shop , ms chun is much more cautious about investments , and she may wait awhile before she dives into another new venture i can still manage with my savings for me and my son , she said but i had poured all i had into the store , and now i can barely make ends meet photo the economic crisis has forced south korean women into the job market a class on how to open a flower shop is attended by choi yang sook , left , and chang young bun , center , and taught by park kyung ja , right \( associated press for the new york times \)
knockdown the harrowing true account of a yacht race turned deadly by martin dugard illustrated 243 pp new york pocket books 2495 we have entered the age of celebrity weather from the 1996 mount everest megastorm immortalized in jon krakauer s into thin air , to the wicked nor'easter that wrecked a fishing fleet in sebastian junger s perfect storm to the southern ocean monster that forced three rescues \( and led to as many books \) in the 199697 vendee globe aroundtheworld sailing race , blockbuster disasters have become our most reliable best sellers or so several publishers are hoping , as they rush to print accounts of the last december s tragic sydneytohobart yacht race and none were more hastily published than martin dugard s knockdown it is as messy as the storm that inspired it a melodramatic but nonetheless riveting chronicle of the weather bomb that hit the race fleet just as it entered australia s treacherous bass strait last dec 27 in the mayhem that followed , 100mileperhour winds churned up waves eight stories high , 24 boats were crushed and abandoned , 57 sailors were rescued and six men died dugard s epic tragedy begins as most do , the audience watching with grim foreknowledge as the boats sail merrily to their doom , sails flapping against a clear sky as they round sydney harbor s south head and enter the open sea the fleet is 115 strong , from hulking maxis like sayonara , owned by the silicon valley mogul larry ellison , to local familyowned and crewed yachts like the 35foot midnight rambler to the legendary 52foot winston churchill , a restored wooden veteran of the first sydneytohobart in 1945 herein lies the uniquely aussie appeal of the 735mile race , an epic haul billed by dugard as the everest of the sea unlike other bluewater races , the sydneytohobart allows amateur weekend sailors to compete alongside multinational racing syndicates , the local skippers in their smaller boats often proving the toughest of the bunch as dugard convincingly tells it , this traditional australian nautical grit contributed to last december s debacle the sydneytohobart s grueling conditions and awful seas are points of national pride , and so by the time many skippers decided to turn back , it was too late they were in the eye of the storm the question that still hovers over the illfated race is why on earth did n't somebody call it off dugard does a fine job of outlining the brewing of disaster the wind and wave patterns of the bass strait , the convergence of three weather systems in those shallow waters and the weather bureau s undertstated forecasts , broadcast despite one meteorologist breaking down in tears when he saw the report in an eerie twist , on realtime internet broadcasts on sites like quokka and mountainzone , armchair adventurers , privy to this impending armageddon , as one forecaster called it , tuned in to watch the nautical horror show unfold dugard , a former marketing coordinator who left his job in 1993 to write full time , is making a career of machismo his previous book , surviving the toughest race on earth , chronicles his participation in the ludicrously punishing raid gauloises team adventure race a biographical note on the dust jacket of knockdown says the author is a coholder of the around the world speed record \( new york to new york in 31 hours , 28 minutes \) , but leaves out the fact that he set that record as a passenger on the concorde duggard s writing is fittingly macho on the growing storm the wind is not a gentle tickle on the cheek , but a brooding schizophrenic that can instantaneously destroy on the father of the midnight rambler s ed psaltis he was the sort of decisive man of the sea lesser men dreamed of becoming and on the role of skipper he s playing chess with the gods out there , with his life and the lives of his men the tariff but strip away dugard s chestthumping voiceover , and you are left with a story that simply wo n't let go with rogue waves smashing hatches and snatching men from the decks , with severed fingers and crushed eye sockets and with shredded life rafts and unbelievably daring rescues , readers wo n't mind repetitive detail , abruptly spliced anecdotes from landlubbers and occasionally sloppy prose what might bother them is his mind reading dugard s tale is more vivid for its detailed forays into each surviving racer s emotions but he makes grand leaps into fiction when he offers the blowbyblow thoughts of several drowning men the british olympic sailor glyn charles is able to appreciate the sky and waves and wind with the love of a lifelong sailor up until the very end finally , his limbs no longer moving , his mind knowing contentment after a life of rage and battle , glyn charles slips beneath the waves one last time charles , with five other surely undeserving men , was one of the losers in the sydneytohobart race but like the disasters before it , this tragedy offers more than its share of ordinary heroes severely injured old friends stoically clinging to the remnants of a winston churchill life raft for 28 hours , the rookie rescue swimmers michelle blewitt and kristy mcalister diving again and again into cold black water to save the entire crew of stand aside others must live with their actions , like the crew of the margaret rintoul ii , the boat that passed the sinking sword of orion as charles drowned and like those disasters before it , sydneytohobart raises questions about the lure of adventure and the economics of risk the final rescue price tag was 650 , 000 in civil resources alone the australian military and safety authority continues to be responsible for 29 million square miles of dangerous ocean more and more people seek out such elemental trials as climbing everest , sailing the southern ocean or tackling australia s toughest sailing race as dugard quotes one of the sydney race organizers , i expect the problems we experienced will

mexico city , oct 8 vicente fox quesada , a brashtalking presidential candidate with a bold swagger , thinks he can build the frustration among mexican voters into a runaway victory for the opposition next year he believes he can win without his conservative national action party forming a coalition with the other major opposition party , which leans to the left negotiations over a coalition collapsed last week after mr fox vetoed the deal but mr fox s campaign for the top job faces a debilitating problem he does not have the unqualified support of his own party i need more enthusiasm from the pan , mr fox acknowledged in an interview , using the party s spanish acronym i need more passion the tepid response from the 60yearold party , mexico s oldest opposition group , has become painfully evident since mr fox was officially nominated as its presidential candidate on sept 12 after a nationwide primary although mr fox was the sole contender , he received only 132 , 976 votes , barely 37 percent of the party s registered members he had said he hoped for at least 300 , 000 votes in a show of force by the party supporters of mr fox from outside the party , who were able to take part in the primary by writing his name on informal ballots , outnumbered the party members voting for him by more than 3 to 1 on primary night , when mr fox made what he planned as a bracing acceptance speech to rally his team behind him , he received no messages of congratulations from the party s bestknown leaders the head of the party s delegation in the congress , carlos medina plascencia , gave a short speech expressing his support and left before mr fox arrived at the election headquarters i would make a distinction between the lack of warm support from the leaders of my party and the support i get from the grass roots , where people are working with a lot of enthusiasm , mr fox said mr fox , 57 , who served until recently as governor of the state of guanajuato , began his quest for the presidency two years ago without seeking any endorsement from his party he runs his campaign through a group separate from the party called the friends of fox he is more liberal and less nationalistic than his conservative , catholic party on several key economic and social issues to date , mr fox said , his party has not provided any money for his campaign he said he would receive none until after jan 15 , when the government will turn over special funds to the party for the presidential campaigns in the last six weeks his advertising has dropped almost completely off television and radio because his coffers are empty as it stands now , mr fox will be running in an essentially threeway race between cuauhtemoc cardenas solorzano , the former mayor of mexico city who is the leader of the leftist opposition , and a candidate from the governing party , who will be chosen in a primary on nov 7 a new poll by the newspaper reforma showed mr fox favored by 32 percent while mr cardenas drew only 12 percent but either one of the two leading governing party candidates would come out ahead of mr fox , with at least 35 percent , according to the poll mr fox said he had no regrets about withdrawing from the coalition talks , which reached an impasse over whether to hold a primary to choose a single opposition candidate between him and mr cardenas he said that mr cardenas and his followers came from a culture of electoral fraud and that he feared they or infiltrators from the governing party would tamper with the votes in a primary election
jena , germany when the berlin wall collapsed 10 years ago , stephan schambach was 18 and had never set foot in a capitalist country karsten schneider , then 29 , worked listlessly at the bloated kombinat , a huge communistera electronics factory in this small city south of leipzig today , about their only link to communism is the name of their software company intershop communications , a name they mischievously lifted from east germany s old hardcurrency stores for foreign tourists no one remembers who first thought of it , mr schneider recalled recently but it seemed perfect intershop sales doubled this year to 40 million , and the company employs 500 people worldwide its stock , now publicly traded in germany , has a value of about 2 billion ten years after the berlin wall came down , such buoyancy seems wildly at odds with eastern germany s enduring image of shuttered factories and stagnant growth eastern joblessness is still 18 percent , twice as high as in the west but in the midst of this despair something else has happened parts of the east have become magnets for entrepreneurs and hightechnology startup companies in saxony , eastern germany s most populous state , industrial production is climbing at doubledigit rates , faster than all of western germany in jena the renaissance is striking the old kombinat is dead but the city has been a seedbed for nearly a thousand new ventures in the last few years many fizzled , but just as many have taken off , and unemployment , about 20 percent two years ago , is now about 14 percent i tell my west german friends that we have gone through what they still need to go through , said kurt biedenkopf , the probusiness premier of saxony and a westerner himself east germany , by reason of its peaceful revolution against an allpowerful state , has unleashed tremendous development , he said people here are more adaptable , more elastic it has been painful and they did n't want it , but it was a consequence of their desire for freedom the wave of new companies has yet to offset the loss of old industry nor has it solved what may be eastern germany s most intractable problem high wages partly as a result of efforts to equalize pay in the east and the west , hundreds of thousands of lowskilled jobs that might have been ideal for eastern germany have been lost to lowercost rivals in the czech republic , poland and elsewhere in central europe indeed , eastern germany s textile work force of 320 , 000 before the wall fell now amounts to just 20 , 000 business leaders here also note that there are big differences between fastgrowing southeastern states like saxony and thuringia and much poorer rural states in the northeast we still have hard work ahead of us for the next 15 years or so , said lothar spath , chairman of jenoptik ag , a technology company here that is one of eastern germany s biggest success stories but the process is fundamentally on track the success company rose from nothing jena s turnaround is also the story of mr spath , a wily former politician from western germany who is now this town s biggest employer he is chairman of jenoptik ag , which he carved from the unwanted leftovers of the communistera conglomerate when he arrived here in 1991 , jenoptik was nothing more than a jumble of old real estate and 30 , 000 workers we had no products , none at all , when we started , he said all we had was some good technology and a lot of people this year , jenoptik will earn about 20 million on sales of 15 billion its biggest business is making clean room equipment for computerchip manufacturers around the world at first glance , mr spath hardly seemed like an obvious savior east germany is full of tales of west germans who took over companies in the east only to strip the assets and shut them down west german supermarkets overwhelmed fledgling eastern retailers , as did west german publishers , banks and consumer products from beer to clothing mr spath , a man whom german newspapers have nicknamed the clever one because of his political skills , had abruptly resigned in 1991 as premier of the west german state of badenwurttemberg after accusations that he had accepted favors from industry cronies with huge subsidies from the german government , about half of the jena s old kombinat had been reunited with carl zeiss ag , the west german company that had abandoned its jena factory when the nation was divided after world war ii mr spath , who arrived here first as a consultant , was left with the debris acres of real estate , about 30 , 000 workers and no customers there was no business plan either no one could tell us what the strategy was or what it should be , recalled petra lorenz , one of many midlevel kombinat managers who found herself scrambling in chaos the whole project would have been hopeless had mr spath not been able to extract huge financial help from the german government pledging to save at least a third of the 30 , 000 jobs here , he won about 2 billion in his first year , mr spath laid off 16 , 000 people , and jenoptik executives say about 13 billion of the public money went simply went to cover pensions and unemployment benefits

skopje , macedonia , may 31 if there is an overwhelming sense that emerges from a walk through the squalid refugee camps of macedonia these days , it is despair whether it is the newly arrived refugees who until last week bravely eluded serbian efforts to expel them from kosovo only to flee finally in the face of dwindling food and unending fear , or refugees who have already endured weeks in the overcrowded camps here , kosovars are giving up on their dream of returning home soon and are increasingly desperate to go abroad in recent days , ethnic albanians arriving from pristina , kosovo s capital , described how they spent the last two months determined to wait out the conflict and not bow to serbian pressure after being expelled from their own homes in early april , they simply moved from house to house and village to village for weeks , they said , playing a nervefraying catandmouse game with their pursuers but as each week passed , as april dragged into may , and may turns to june , their desperation grew and determination waned , refugees said sherif krasniqi , 42 , a librarian who fled pristina with his family last monday and now hopes to go abroad , said the daily disappointments were torturous nonstop we were listening to the news , he said , waiting for a change at the same time , among the roughly 100 , 000 refugees who have been waiting in camps here , initial optimism that the conflict would be over swiftly has faded , along with the desire to avoid resettling farther from home the largest single source of tension in the camps is no longer the sometimes heavyhand tactics of the local macedonian police guarding the camps , aid workers said it is the bitter disputes over who gets to be evacuated abroad first journalists , once besieged with requests from refugees to borrow cellular phones and tell their relatives they are alive , are now besieged with requests for help help of any kind to go abroad , though those decisions are handled exclusively by the welcoming countries fatigue is also setting in among the 140 , 000 kosovo refugees who are living in the macedonian community , with both refugees and the families that took them in complaining that they are reaching the breaking point the family we are staying with does n't have any more money , hafiza haziri , 48 , a widow waiting to fly with her two children to relatives in madison , wis , said last week they kept us with food and everything , but now they do n't even have food for themselves some 30 countries have offered resettlement to about 130 , 000 of the refugees who came to macedonia , a number that could expand as the conflict drags on , the rising despair and continuing evacuations abroad are helping president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia achieve what is believed to be one of his primary goals the ethnic cleansing of kosovo , the permanent reduction in the number of albanians in the disputed province , is gradually being cemented in place before the conflict , some 90 percent of kosovo s population was ethnic albanian many kosovars who leave macedonia say they really want to return home as mrs haziri waited to depart for wisconsin , she wept miserably , insisting that all she wanted to do was go back to kosovo bekim berisha , 30 , a doctor who is taking his wife and yearold son to phoenix to stay with relatives , said i do n't know how long it will be i hope it will be over as soon as possible but history is against them in the balkan wars of the last 120 years , few who were forced from home ever went back most of those driven from bosnia during its 199295 war have not returned , some because their homes are still controlled by their wartime enemies , others because the life they were forced to adopt abroad may be tough , but in the long run seems better for them and , most important , their children the pressures that lead refugees to abandon hope of quickly returning home are reflected in the tale of afrim and lumnije murat , two young pristina lawyers who fled kosovo recently and are now struggling to decide what to do when they set foot in macedonia on may 22 after living in hiding for two months , the couple s only thought was of their unborn child for eight weeks , 28yearold ms murat , who is seven months pregnant , lived a nightmare ordered by her doctor to avoid stress , she lived in constant fear of a knock on the door from the serbian police told to have regular prenatal checkups , she had none because her doctor fled and instead of a carefully planned diet for her child , she dined on beans and potatoes , day in and day out , for two months i had one miscarriage before , she said i was afraid it would happen again mr murat , an articulate , boyishlooking 28 , said his father , mother , brother and two sisters fled to macedonia in the first wave of expulsions in late march but he was determined to stay to protect the family home , which his father and grandfather had spent 50 years building and expanding it was by far the family s biggest investment and asset

the enactment of new health care reforms in california shows that state leaders are well ahead of congress in addressing the need for managed care regulation while many states have moved forward with consumer protection laws aimed at health maintenance organizations , the sweep of the california legislation contained in 21 bills , along with similarly broad legislation in texas , sets an important standard by which to judge national reform the most controversial piece of the california package would allow patients to sue managed care plans for compensatory and punitive damages if the patient was substantially harmed by a health plan s action to deny , delay or modify necessary medical care the barrier to suing would be high lawsuits would be allowed only when a patient could show that he had suffered significant harm or significant financial loss but the law does not limit the amount of recovery for those losses the expansion of legal liability has been bitterly fought in congress by the insurance lobby , and will be the focus again as the house begins debate on patients' rights legislation next week but in california , gov gray davis and legislative leaders were able to craft language that should deter frivolous suits while holding health plans legally accountable for improper decisions the insurance lobby s warning that allowing lawsuits would send health costs soaring simply has not materialized an independent study of one million public employees in california who already have the right to sue hmo s found that the number of suits filed was very low and the impact on medical costs minimal the california reforms also guarantee patients the right to an independent review of benefit denials and create a new state agency called the department of managed care to regulate the industry and assist consumers with complaints the package would further tighten medical privacy laws , as well as require plans to provide coverage for severe mental illness , prescription contraceptives and cancer screening other states may follow california s lead if they see that such reforms can improve health care without significantly increasing costs but state initiatives do not replace the need for federal legislation for one thing , none of these protections apply to people in selfinsured plans created by large employers , which are exclusively federally regulated more important , current federal law has long been interpreted to bar patients covered by private employersponsored health plans from suing for damages caused by improper benefit denials , although the supreme court this week decided to hear a case that will review this issue the california legislation tries to get around the legal hurdle by framing the new stategranted right to sue as based on the right to obtain quality care rather than the right to particular benefits that approach will clearly be challenged in court and may well be struck down unless congress closes the loophole in federal law that now shields health plans from meaningful liability more than 20 million californians will benefit from new managed care regulations americans elsewhere need congress to enact basic protections to insure that patients get the care they need
an offduty police officer was shot and critically injured early yesterday in a closequarters gun battle in the bronx with a man who then fled , the police said the officer , who is assigned to undercover narcotics investigations in harlem , was shot once in the stomach , apparently by someone he knew he was taken to jacobi medical center , where he was listed in critical condition last night after undergoing surgery the police withheld the shot officer s name because he works undercover he is a 27yearold bronx resident who has been on the force for five years police commissioner howard safir called the victim an officer with a very fine record the shootout , which also left a bystander wounded , began shortly after midnight near sexton place and east gun hill road in the baychester section the officer was not able to speak with detectives yesterday , but a police official said that he has known the assailant for years , and gave the man s name to medical personnel in the minutes after the shooting the police identified the suspect as lester pearson , 23 , whose last known address was 3029 bruner avenue in the bronx this is our suspect and we certainly want to talk with him , mr safir said if he believes he s not our suspect , he should come and talk to us mr safir said investigators had determined that the officer and mr pearson squared off at close range and fired at least 11 bullets between them police officials said they believed the confrontation was not related to the officer s undercover work four other people were injured in the shooting and the confusion that followed one , a young woman , was shot in the leg as she sped from the scene in a sport utility vehicle , the police said , her vehicle collided with another , injuring three people , none of them seriously the wounded woman was in stable condition at jacobi medical center last night a senior police official said the detectives believed she is mr pearson s girlfriend and were questioning her we are not satisfied with the answers we are getting , he said the police said mr pearson , who has also used the name terrance stallings , was convicted in 1996 for illegal possession of a weapon he served 10 months at rikers island for that conviction he has been wanted since 1997 for failing to appear on a charge of throwing urine at a rikers island guard , for which he was not indicted until after his release , said thomas mccarthy , a spokesman for the city s department of correction last night , the police credited a rookie patrol officer , james dress , of the 49th precinct , who was the first to arrive at the scene with administering first aid and saving the wounded officer s life we almost lost him , a senior police official said yesterday now it looks like he is going to make it a 10 , 000 reward was established for information leading to the gunman s arrest and conviction anyone with information was asked to call \( 800 \) copshot
within 15 hours of the fatal shooting by the police of a hammerwielding man in borough park , mayor rudolph w giuliani met with about a dozen of the neighborhood s orthodox jewish leaders yesterday morning at city hall , where police commissioner howard safir and other top commanders briefed them on the case afterward , the jewish leaders joined mr giuliani at his daily news conference where he defended the police officers involved in the shooting the scene stood in marked contrast to the situation seven months ago when mr giuliani found himself isolated after the shooting of amadou diallo , the unarmed african immigrant who was also killed by the police the mayor became a target of protests , and had few avenues for reaching out to angry members of minority groups with whom he had frayed , and in some cases antagonistic , relations the substance of the mayor s response was also different this time around , reflecting significant differences in the circumstances of the two cases , according to city hall and police officials in the diallo shooting , officers fired 41 times at an unarmed man who had no criminal record , apparently in the mistaken belief that he was reaching for a gun the mayor immediately began to distance himself from the police action , reflecting the early assessment by officials that something had gone horribly wrong in that case but yesterday , mr giuliani , while noting that the investigation was continuing , was confident enough to suggest that the shooting in borough park appeared justified after all , officials said , the dead man had been wielding a hammer , had been involved in other violence and had struck an officer many residents of the closeknit hasidic neighborhood which has strongly supported the mayor in the past continue to express anger yesterday over the shooting but the facts of the case and the mayor s history of close ties to brooklyn s hasidim led administration aides to hope that any political damage from the incident could be contained the situation last night was unfortunate , mr giuliani said at the outset of his daily news conference , where he stood with the police commanders behind him but from everything that we can tell from a preliminary analysis of the facts , the police officers should be given the benefit of the doubt he said he had every reason to believe that the police officers acted in accordance with police procedure on friday , feb 5 , about 37 hours after mr diallo was shot in the vestibule of his apartment building , mr giuliani said , there is n't much more light that we can shed on this because the case is being investigated by the district attorney and the internal affairs bureau of the police department he added , quite honestly we do n't have any more facts than pretty much you have in the newspapers and while the official response in the weeks after the diallo shooting would be characterized most by mr giuliani s ardent defense of the police department , his immediate reaction was far more restrained we are very concerned about it , he said that friday in february we are very concerned obviously about the number of shots officials also have far more information about the shooting of the brooklyn man , gidone busch , on monday night than they had in the immediate aftermath of the diallo shooting in the earlier case , there were no civilian witnesses to most of the confrontation , and none of the officers involved gave statements to supervisors in the brooklyn case , supervisors were present when officers shot mr busch and there were at least seven civilian witnesses so top officials at police headquarters were able to get a fuller account of what happened it may be a futile exercise to speculate which of the shootings may have been more avoidable that of mr diallo , who in the dark of night officers believed to have a gun , or that of mr busch , who although emotionally disturbed and apparently high on drugs , was armed only with an ordinary hammer but it is clear that mr giuliani has been more comfortable in handling the latest case after the diallo shooting , the giuliani administration worked arduously to reach mr diallo s parents in africa and asia and to bring them to the united states but it took four days to get members of the united african congress , a group of african immigrants , to come to city hall for a meeting with the mayor , and even then other african groups criticized the congress for doing so also , mr giuliani s long refusal to meet with the rev al sharpton came back to haunt him as mr sharpton persuaded mr diallo s parents not to meet with the mayor or accept any assistance from the city and later led wellknown elected officials and celebrities in repeated acts of civil disobedience outside police headquarters in lower manhattan in contrast , it took mr giuliani s advisers just a few minutes to arrange yesterday s meeting at city hall i wanted to meet with members of the community so that the police commissioner could directly describe to them the facts that we have so far , which indicate that the police acted in accordance with the procedures that the police department has for handling situations like this , mr giuliani said and the mayor seemed to have a receptive audience yesterday city councilman noach dear , who represents borough park and met with the mayor and the neighborhood leaders , said he believed the community has tremendous respect for the police department and works very closely with the police department and he said that despite complaints about the killing , he believed residents of borough park would ultimately find the shooting justified

hallac , kosovo , june 13 after weeks of unconfirmed reports from traumatized refugees , the first direct evidence that serbian forces carried out mass killings in kosovo and have tried to cover them up emerged today at this village , where freshly turned dirt lies just feet from a wall pocked with 10 bullet holes a month ago albanian refugees who fled this village reported that serbian irregulars had killed 46 people during a twoday rampage in midapril here and in a nearby hamlet , ribar the signs of recent digging here , along with accounts from villagers who stayed behind , indicate that a mass grave as well as individual graves have been excavated and the bodies reburied two dozen burnedout houses in the area also stand as evidence of an attack benjamin p ward , an investigator with human rights watch who has been collecting witness accounts of the attacks in the area , said the scene corroborates what he has heard it represents one of the first direct confirmations of witness statements describing the killings of civilians , he said now we have the first evidence confirming that it has happened residents said that in early may the local police exhumed a mass grave holding the bodies of 20 men , carried out autopsies on the victims and then ordered villagers to rebury the bodies in individual graves in the local cemetery in nearby ribar , 26 individual graves of people killed in an attack by irregulars were exhumed , the bodies examined and then reburied , residents said reburying bodies in individual graves and producing autopsies giving an explanation for the killings could make it more difficult to prove in court that the dead had been executed rather than killed in fighting villagers also said that in the days before nato forces entered kosovo , yugoslav officials transferred as many as 1 , 500 albanians from the prison in the nearby town of lipljan to a jail inside serbia proper ejup pajazi , a 56yearold taxi driver released from the prison on saturday , said he was told that the prisoners were taken to a jail in the city of nis in southern serbia he said he did not know why he was not transferred as well mr pajazi s allegation could not be confirmed , and a guard at the prison , which appeared quiet this afternoon , said its warden was not in other albanians released from the prison were expelled by serbian forces to macedonia last week , saying they were rounded up after nato air strikes began and accused of having ties to the kosovo liberation army but none have crossed the border in recent days severe beatings to force confessions were a daily occurrence , the former prisoners said in hallac , there is a 10footby30foot patch of freshly turned earth in an empty lot , which villagers said once held the bodies of 20 people killed by serbian irregulars two men s shoes and what appeared to be a twisted and torn shirt lay on the surface of the dark soil , presumably dug up in early may villagers , who gave accounts supporting those given by refugees last month , said the killings in hallac occurred on april 19 a dozen serbian irregulars lined up 13 people and shot them in a vacant lot , they said the victims included a

living room , she pointed out what appeared to be a charred human knee joint lying on the floor we tried to gather all of the bones for burial , she said the irregulars forced local gypsies to bury all 20 bodies together , villagers said police officers from lipljan then arrived on may 2 and ordered exhumation of the graves blaming the killings on irregulars they could not control , the police officers said the victims should be buried properly but they barred the villagers from burying all 20 victims side by side in a long row in the graveyard , the villagers said today , 20 fresh graves could be seen scattered in clusters in various parts of the community cemetery a few miles up the road in the hamlet of ribar , 26 fresh graves could be seen in the cemetery the victims there included

for 30 years , the federal aviation administration has rationed landing and takeoff slots to keep la guardia and kennedy airports from being overwhelmed by airplanes but last week the transportation department , its parent agency , proposed phasing out the limits over five years without them , and without new gates or runways , how will those airports avoid chaos \? the same way , federal aviation administration officials say , as the airports in las vegas , nev long beach , calif pontiac , mich , and memphis , all of which have more takeoffs and landings than la guardia or kennedy none have ever had a federal limit on landing slots but none have reached gridlock , either all have airlines that have elected on their own to limit traffic to no more than the runways can handle , officials say and these officials predict the same will happen in new york it s an economic decision for the airlines , said ron morgan , the agency s director of air traffic basically , they 're making decisions based on when their customers want to fly versus the amount of delay that they historically receive if they 're getting 30minute delays , and they have done that consistently for the last 60 days , chances are they are going to reschedule keeping a big jet waiting for takeoff costs hundreds of dollars a minute in fuel , crew pay and lost revenue , airlines officials say robert flocke , a spokesman for the air line pilots association , the largest pilots' union , said that slots are primarily an economic deal as long as the faa minimums for physical separation and time separation are maintained , we do n't care , he said he added that pilots were paid the same and that safety problems would arise only if a jet burned too much fuel sitting on the runway or a delay was so long that a flight crew s shift went beyond allowed limits the scarcity of gates will limit peak congestion , experts say if they really have to have a 1 pm departure , 3 30 may be the earliest they can get a gate , said james k buckles , the federal aviation administration s assistant division manager for air traffic in the region that includes new york not that the two airports run like clockwork now of 361 , 000 landings and takeoffs at la guardia last year , nearly 25 , 000 were delayed by 15 minutes or more , or 68 per 1 , 000 operations up from 49 per 1 , 000 in 1997 , according to the agency s figures at kennedy , there were 357 , 000 operations and 13 , 000 delays , or 36 per 1 , 000 operations , up from 18 the year before delays are growing nationwide the inspector general s office of the transportation department recently studied 2 , 115 domestic routes to and from the 28 busiest american airports \( which include newark , ranked no 15 , but not kennedy , no 31 , or la guardia , no 34 \) , and found that the gatetogate time had grown longer on 1 , 544 routes , or 73 percent taxiing accounted for 56 percent of the increase jeff nelligan , a spokesman for the inspector general , said of kennedy and la guardia , these two airports , as well as newark , have the highest taxiout times in the country but neither kennedy nor la guardia is saturated all the time from the tower at la guardia , it is obvious that the airport has a great deal of spare capacity there is almost always at least a short line of planes at 2 45 pm last friday , eight were waiting for takeoff , and the radarscope showed a similar number waiting to land in a line spread out across about 40 miles of sky but the morning s log sheet a form on a clipboard filled with notations and looking like a baseball scorecard showed that the airport had not reached its peak capacity of 75 landings or takeoffs in any onehour period that day the highest number was 71 , between 8 and 9 am traffic on friday was down slightly because of the pilots' sickout at american airlines , but there are always offpeak hours the peaks at la guardia are a rush of departures about 7 am a slew of arrivals between 8 and 9 am , with another rush of arrivals around 4 pm , and a flood of departures again beginning at 5 it all dies off by 9 pm kennedy , which has seven and a half times the land area of la guardia , can handle arrivals on two parallel runways and departures on a third runway if weather is good , for up to about 150 operations an hour it suffers the same rate of reductions from winds or rain or snow as la guardia because so much of its traffic is international , its peaks are matched to time zones on the other side of the world , but current limits on takeoffs and landings apply only in the afternoons and evenings the federal aviation administration has gotten better at managing planes new displays at controller work stations can show the location of every plane bound for either airport , even if it is on the other side of the ocean or the continent , and can count those due in any 15minute period , even those that have not taken off yet and controllers can slow planes down to keep arrivals at a manageable rate but capacity has fallen rather than grown in the last three decades because not much new concrete has been poured and the mix of planes has changed thirty years ago , we left three miles between airplanes , said carmine w gallo , a traffic management officer at the new york terminal radar approach control , the air traffic office , in westbury , ny , that handles all traffic going in and out of all the airports in the new york area but now there is a separate category heavies , like boeing 747 s , 757 s and 767 s that create such powerful wakes that commuter planes must follow five miles behind instead of three so the interval between takeoffs must be longer pilots of some small planes will elect to take off right behind a heavy and avoid the wake by climbing faster , but the controllers are not allowed to suggest it photos with federal limits on takeoffs and landings at la guardia and kennedy airports expected to end , airlines will have to regulate the traffic to avoid costly delays on friday , la guardia was anything but overcrowded john t kaplun at work in the central air traffic office in westbury , ny its screens now track every plane bound for any airport in the region \( photographs by suzanne dechillo the new york times \)
lisa kron is not someone you would describe as the silent type she is a lively , showy talker , a natural storyteller , and she has made an art out of being just that , with comic monologues about subjects like the horrors of high school reunions it turns out , however , that ms kron also knows about the holes in life that ca n't be filled by descriptive sentences and about the images that can never be captured in photographs in her remarkable new performance piece , 25 minute ride , which opened last night at the joseph papp public theater , ms kron serves up wonderfully evocative , and often seriously funny , strings of words but it s the pauses around and beneath those words , silences that are respectful to the point of awe , that set off the emotional vibrations that wo n't stop and though this family portrait of a monologue is accompanied by a slide show , what s projected onto the walls behind ms kron are blank rectangles of light that is not to say that they are empty 25 minute ride boldly assumes the task of looking for the connections between two very different family outings a recent trip to an ohio amusement park and ms kron s visit six years ago with her septuagenarian father to the auschwitz concentration camp , where her grandparents were killed there s no way you can draw a straight line between these excursions , and ms kron does n't try yet by the evening s end , a wondering , ineffable sense of symmetry has emerged , a wry but reverent feeling for the patterns shaped by time directed with a sure and delicate hand by mark brokaw , 25 minute ride puts ms kron on a level with sterling monologists like spalding gray , autobiographers who combine novelistic complexity with stagesmart impudence the ground she covers in her 70 minutes of fragmented but fluid narrative is staggering her ambition is to create a picture , both for herself and her audience , of her father , who was evacuated from nazi germany in 1937 as part of the kindertransport program she knows that any picture she provides will be incomplete , filtered through filial subjectivity and the incredulity that still overtakes anyone considering the holocaust hence the slide show ms kron uses in her performance , in which she alludes to visual images , even tracing photographic details with a pointer , when all you see is the light of the projector \( the expert lighting is by kenneth posner \) when i try to tell his stories , i begin to hyperventilate , and i do n't know why , she says at one point of her father i can feel the myth , the awe creep into my voice , and it makes me feel sick because what does that have to do with him \? she does conquer those reservations to deliver her father s firstperson account of his experience as an interrogator with the united states army in germany what s extraordinary about the anecdote is its narrator s sense of identification with the guilt of the person he is questioning there are many things in ms kron s performance that make you fall in love with her father , but none more so than this element of moral selfdoubt the vignette comes late in 25 minute ride , which though anything but linear in its chronology is as carefully plotted as a historian s time chart ms kron leapfrogs from droll observations about her family s life in lansing , mich , where she grew up and her parents still live , to sharp and sorrowful accounts of her trip to germany and poland to a description of her brother s recent wedding at a jewish center in canarsie , brooklyn that these shards of history coalesce into an illuminating whole has much to do with the accumulation of seemingly incongruous details , which come to echo off and enhance one another the image of ms kron s father s diminishing eyesight , and of the array of glasses he uses to correct it , acquires increasing resonance so does her mother s refusing to be photographed after a certain age , and the affection of her father , who has a heart condition , for roller coasters that set the heart leaping and the teeth chattering the 25 minutes of the play s title are a reference to the length of one of those rides but i do n't want to say much more about the show much of its impact comes from the ways in which ms kron stealthily plants her seeds of disparate images in your mind and lets them grow organically i should say that those who know ms kron as a hilarious satirist , from such pieces as 101 humiliating stories and her work with the five lesbian brothers , wo n't be disappointed she offers witty , brightly sardonic descriptions of everything from a 24hour superstore in lansing to the culinary fare of poland to the assorted aches , illnesses and eccentricities of various family members yet there is never condescension in her humor it is simply a crucial part of her navigational equipment in finding her way through life s absurd course of non sequiturs toward the end of the show , ms kron describes the emotional aboutface she undergoes at her brother s wedding she had arrived expecting to mock but then , an unexpected thing happened , she says i became enchanted ms kron has steered us so gently and expertly to this point that we understand her response exactly a lot of elements feed into that sense of enchantment , many of them sad it is nonetheless a soaring feeling 25 minute ride written and performed by lisa kron directed by mark brokaw sets by allen moyer costumes by jess goldstein lighting by kenneth posner sound by darron l west production dramaturg , mervin p antonio production stage manager , bess marie glorioso senior director , external affairs , margaret m lioi associate producer , wiley hausam artistic associate , brian kulick associate producer , bonnie metzgar presented by the joseph papp public theater new york shakespeare festival , george c wolfe , producer rosemarie tichler , artistic producer mark litvin , managing director at the shiva theater , in the joseph papp public theater , 425 lafayette street , east village photo solo lisa kron in 25 minute ride \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
washington , july 22 the director of central intelligence disclosed today that the agency had selected just one target in the 11week air war over yugoslavia , and its decision led to the accidental bombing of the chinese embassy in may it was the only target we nominated , the director , george j tenet , said at a rare public hearing of the house intelligence committee after the strike on may 7 , which killed three chinese and wounded at least 20 others , the cia decided that it should go back to its usual business of spying , an american official said today reeling from its error , the agency almost immediately suspended other preparations it was making to forward additional targets to help nato mr tenet also acknowledged publicly that the cia had employees and maps that could have told military planners the correct location of the embassy but they were not consulted , he said while mr tenet and the deputy secretary of defense , john j hamre , recapped a nowfamiliar litany of bureaucratic errors that the administration says caused the accident including outdated maps , faulty computer databases and a lack of safeguards it was the director s remarks on the agency s selection of targets that offered new insights into an accident that has dealt a stinging setback to relations with china from battle tanks to electrical power plants , deciding what to hit in the air war was left largely to military experts in washington and europe but as the air campaign failed to achieve quick success and dragged on longer than expected , the pentagon feared that it would run out of topnotch targets and sought suggestions from the cia we were very much looking for additional targets , mr hamre said at the cia , analysts had long suspected that the headquarters of a yugoslav arms agency was financing the yugoslav military by selling advanced technology to rogue nations , and jumped at the chance to destroy a stubborn nemesis this episode is unusual because the cia does not normally assemble , on its own , target nomination packages containing the coordinates of specific installations or buildings , mr tenet said the inexperience was clear from the start the cia team used a flawed technique for locating the arms agency headquarters , mr tenet said it had the correct street address for the arms agency , no 2 bulevar umetnosti but to pinpoint that location , the analysts used a technique of comparing the number sequence on parallel streets mr tenet said this practice offered only an approximate location and was inappropriate for selecting aerial targets the analysts compounded that mistake by using three maps to locate the arms agency two yugoslav commercial maps from 1989 and 1996 , and a united states government map produced in 1997 none showed the current location of the chinese embassy , which was built in 1996 only after the disaster did the cia turn up in its files two maps that accurately placed the embassy one was a map handed out by a belgrade bank that showed a branch office near the embassy the other listed the embassy and its grid coordinates in its index but did not mark the building on the map itself , an american official said since this was the agency s first time developing a target package , there was no procedure in place for senior officials to review the work , mr tenet said this initial misidentification took on the mantle of fact , he said there was no cautionary language associated with it military planners never caught the mistake , partly because they assumed the location had already been verified , mr hamre said a final backup also failed when several computerized databases of sites that were offlimits to bombing , including embassies , hospital and churches , did not have the current location of the chinese embassy database maintenance is one of the basic elements of our intelligence effort , but it is also one that has suffered in recent years as our work force has been spread thin , mr tenet said the administration has taken steps to avoid a recurrence , including a system to update the databases when bombing cities , mr tenet said , a new policy requires that government officials familiar with the location be consulted and sign off on what a satellite picture says a site is or is n't
is the connecticut tennis center in new haven a gigantic white elephant and monument to imprudent state spending or an ultramodern stadium that may yet fulfill its promise \? whatever one s view , the center \( which towers over the nearby yale bowl \) was built on yale university property with 18 million in stateissued bonds the 15 , 000seat center will be the site of a women s professional tournament for one week in august the only event scheduled so far this year to many , it has become a grandiose venue built less than a decade ago for a tennis promoter whose weeklong men s tournament was lured out of the country two years after he had sold it to another promoter in what was regarded as a better financial deal at a time when many question the prudence of building a stadium in hartford for the national football league s new england patriots at what is expected to be more than 400 million in state funds the track record of the tennis center may stand as a cautionary symbol we can learn a lesson from what has happened , said joseph mcgee , a former commissioner of the state s department of economic development and now a vice president of the southwestern area commerce and industry association it shows that we have to hold sports operators to a much tighter standard in the future mr mcgee did not elaborate , but he could have been alluding to negotiations between the state and robert k kraft , owner of the new england patriots , which have produced what is generally acknowledged to be the best deal ever offered to a professional sports franchise moira k lyons of stamford , the state s new speaker of the house , pointed out that if the patriots decided to leave hartford before their 30year contract had expired , the team s owners would be obliged to pay liquidation damages \( assuming the state had kept its part of the contract \) such money could be used toward the cost of the stadium a formula for that is being worked out now , said ms lyons , who had initially expressed skepticism over the stadium plans no similar arrangement was ever established with the two tennis promoters in new haven i expected the men s tournament would stay in new haven for at least 20 years , said the new haven mayor , john destefano jr , who was the first executive director of the tennis foundation of connecticut inc , which owns and operates the tennis stadium when the tennis center was built in 1991 , it was projected as a catalyst for rejuvenating a city whose image had been largely drawn by crime and poverty the tournament promoter , city officials , civic leaders and many others predicted that hotels , restaurants and other businesses would flourish with the coming of the volvo international tennis tournament , which was first played in a temporary stadium alongside the yale bowl in 1990 but volvo dropped out and pilot pen became the sponsor three years ago , and after last year s competition , the tournament left the city entirely , for austria after william a o'neill , then the governor , succeeded in luring the volvo tournament from stratton mountain , vt , in 1990 with the promise of building a statefinanced stadium paul h johnson , the first president of the tennis foundation , said he agreed with mr o'neill that the tournament would have enormous benefits for the state and john daniels , then the mayor of new haven , predicted that the tournament would result in great economic benefits for the city in truth , while the men s tournament whose field was diluted somewhat each year because of a competing event in indianapolis attracted media attention to new haven , it had scant economic impact on the area one reason , as several studies have shown , is that the vast majority of spectators have been from towns within about a 45mile radius and rarely went to restaurants or bars in the city or stayed in its hotels indeed , an economic impact study conducted by students at the yale university school of organization and impact showed that during the tournament s first year in 1991 , 85 percent of the 704 million in direct spending related to the tournament was spent at the new stadium itself that was far below the annual figure of 10 million that some members of the tennis foundation predicted would be generated for new haven area businesses supporters had also estimated that the event would produce as much as 500 , 000 in annual tax revenue to the city from a 3 percent surcharge on tickets to the men s tournament as it developed , the city has received far less additionally , backers of the stadium proposal said that revenues from a 10 percent admission surcharge would be enough to pay the debt service on the 20year general obligation bonds that , with interest , are expected to cost the state around 33 million over the first four years of the stadium s existence , revenue from the admission tax went to the legislature s general fund but at the request of mayor destefano , then the executive director of the tennis foundation , the state agreed in 1993 \( the year mr destefano was elected mayor \) , to let the foundation keep all revenue from the 10 percent admission surcharge if that had n't happened , the foundation could no longer have operated , said christopher perillo , the current executive director of the tennis foundation and its lone fulltime employe
belgrade , serbia , april 1 three american soldiers captured along the border with macedonia will appear before a yugoslav military court that could charge and try them , the state news agency , tanjug , said today according to the report , a judicial officer in the kosovo capital , pristina , said that the court investigation of the three could begin as early as friday the united states government said a yugoslav courtmartial of the americans would violate international law the men staff sgt andrew a ramirez , 24 , of los angeles staff sgt christopher j stone , 25 , of smiths creek , mich , and specialist steven m gonzales , 21 , of huntsville , tex , were paraded on serbian state television today , but the main broadcast this evening led with another news event , an unexpected meeting between the yugoslav president , slobodan milosevic , and a prominent leader of kosovo s ethnic albanians , ibrahim rugova on the broadcast , the two leaders , looking relaxed , signed a document calling for a peaceful end to the kosovo crisis through political means mr rugova was a part of the ethnic albanian delegation that signed a westerndrafted peace treaty rejected by the serbs with serbian forces now driving to destroy the kosovo liberation army and forcing tens of thousands of civilians from the province , mr rugova s seemingly uncoerced meeting led a spokesman for the ethnic albanian rebels , jakub krasniqi , to call it high treason but other than the television images , which carried today s date , there was no confirmation that the men had actually met today mr rugova , who has long advocated a nonviolent political solution to the problem of kosovo , appeared relaxed , chatting with an evidently cheerful mr milosevic but it was only on wednesday that serbian television announced that mr rugova had sought the protection of the serbian police and showed him nervously asking nato to stop its bombing although the three captured soldiers , grimfaced and nervous , were shown on television here throughout the day , the serbian evening news did not even mention them until deep in the broadcast , and then in the context of a commentary first , it showed mr milosevic meeting representatives of the greek orthodox church then it showed the serbian president , milan milutinovic , foreign minister zivadin jovanovic and the leader of the serbian orthodox church , patriarch pavle , meeting separately with archbishop jeanlouis tauran , sent here by pope john paul ii to call on all sides to observe a weeklong easter truce , that would extend from the western observance of easter , april 4 , through the orthodox observance on april 11 , a suggestion the allies have already rejected then a delegation of russian members of parliament was shown meeting various officials only then did the announcer mention the capture of the american soldiers on yugoslav territory as another development casting doubt on the western interpretation of events at first nato said the soldiers were captured about three miles inside macedonia , though later top officers said it was unclear exactly where they were caught there was only one gloating touch on television the western aggressors , the announcer said , have overnight forgotten the humanitarian crisis that is their ostensible reason for intervention and have now directed all their attention to three of their soldiers who were captured this puts the american fuhrer in the most uncomfortable position because he is the one who launched the theory that america would win without a single casualty western officials were debating today why mr rugova might have met with mr milosevic nato s secretary general , javier solana , said in brussels that mr rugova might have been under duress i do n't see that rugova is freely doing what he is doing , mr solana said , adding that he would feel much more relaxed if he had been able to speak to him while the americans originally backed mr rugova , who was reelected as the leader of the ethnic albanians last april , his credibility was sharply diminished by the rise in support for the insurgents of the kosovo liberation army unity among the ethnic albanians has been fragile , and with the serbian military trying to destroy the kosovo liberation army in the current fighting , some western diplomats suggested by telephone , mr rugova may be hoping both to restore his position and to save what is left of kosovo from catastrophe he may think that half a state is better than a killing ground and a wasteland , said a western diplomat who left belgrade before the bombings began he drew a possible comparison with the palestinian leader , yasir arafat , who has sacrificed palestinian claims to parts of the west bank for a palestinian authority likely to become a state but it is not clear whom mr rugova now represents as thousands of ethnic albanians are driven out of kosovo , some will view him as a traitor , quisling or worse , while others will regard him as trying to save something from the rubble
president mohammad khatami hopes to strengthen the rule of law in iran and repair ties with the west but his efforts are threatened by the dubious espionage charges that clerical prosecutors brought against 13 iranian jews mr khatami , who has been trying to limit his conflicts with conservative clerics before an important parliamentary election , has been cautious in speaking out on this case but this is a case he cannot condone if he wishes to improve ties with the west the arrested jews are accused of giving military information to israel and the united states until the past few days , they had been held incommunicado they are still being denied family visits , kosher food and legal representation although no trial has yet been held and no incriminating evidence made public , influential iranian clerics have all but declared the 13 jews guilty and called for their hanging under iran s islamic constitution , the jewish community is an officially recognized religious minority currently , about 25 , 000 jews live in iran , a nation of nearly 70 million people more than 50 , 000 jews have emigrated since the 1979 revolution those who remained have had to contend with two decades of government hostility to israel and several previous espionage prosecutions against jewish iranians , although none on this scale now there is worry that militant clerics frightened by mr khatami s more tolerant views could strike back against vulnerable iranian jews mr khatami has tried to reassure the jewish community and has spoken out publicly in defense of the legal rights of its members but he has not challenged the abusive handling of this case outside iran there have been many expressions of concern israel has worked hard to mobilize international attention the united states has called on iran to free those arrested , as have germany , france and the european union the iranians should understand that the persecution of jews will throw iran s relations with the west into a new freeze , crippling iran s attempt to revive its stagnant economy mr khatami seems loath to risk accusations of endangering national security by interfering with the prosecution of alleged spies but so far , this case seems to be less about foreign espionage than about a campaign by mr khatami s domestic enemies to sabotage his program of reform and dialogue with the west the iranian people have already paid a high price for the international isolation they have endured for two decades it would be a pity if mr khatami s reforms were now undermined by a contrived spy case

with the finding of a buried rifle 11 days ago , the authorities in the buffalo area say they have gathered enough evidence in the october slaying of dr barnett slepian to begin presenting a murder case to a state grand jury as early as next week a federal grand jury has already been addressing the slaying under laws that prohibit violence against providers of abortion dr slepian was the mainstay of buffalo s only abortion clinic before he was shot to death oct 23 at his home in suburban amherst but the decision by frank c clark , the district attorney of erie county , to begin presenting evidence to a state grand jury suggests that he has amassed enough material to support a criminal indictment for homicide we 've gotten to the point where we know what we want to introduce before a grand jury , mr clark said in a telephone interview yesterday although the authorities are not saying who the suspect is , all of the attention so far has fallen on james c kopp , a 44yearold antiabortion protester who had been traveling around the country from demonstration to demonstration for years officially , mr kopp is being sought as a material witness in the case mr clark said it was easier to seek extradition of an indicted suspect from another state or a foreign country than of someone wanted as a material witness for now , though , that would be a theoretical advantage since the authorities have admitted they have no idea where mr kopp is mr clark said there was no question that the finding of the rifle was important in his decision to seek an indictment the rifle was discovered april 8 buried one foot below the ground , about 200 feet behind dr slepian s house it is undergoing testing at the fbi laboratory in washington , but the authorities have said it resembles the kind of highpowered rifle used in the slaying mr clark said other evidence that prosecutors might present includes a strand of human hair found at the wooded firing site that has a high likelihood of matching mr kopp s hair and testimony from a jogger who spotted mr kopp s car near dr slepian s house at 6 am ten days before the shooting there also are videotapes of mr kopp s car crossing the canadian border around the days in 1994 , 1995 and 1997 that three canadian doctors who perform abortions were shot at none of those doctors were killed if a suspect is caught and charged in both state and federal courts , a state trial would likely precede a federal one , giving the authorities two chances to prosecute new york state doublejeopardy laws would make it difficult to prosecute a suspect who had been found not guilty at a federal trial denise e o 'donnell , the united states attorney for the western district of new york , declined to discuss what federal charges were being pursued in the slepian case but she said that in a case like this , potential charges would be abortionrelated violence , the use of a firearm in an act of violence , crossing state lines to commit a crime , and , if the suspect s act was tied to an organization , violation of the socalled rico statutes , which prohibit an organized criminal enterprise dr slepian , 52 , and the father of four boys , was shot to death at 10 pm as he stood chatting with his wife in the kitchen of their home in an affluent enclave in amherst , which is the largest buffalo suburb
seth ruskin , a global equities trader in florida who is about to change jobs , made it a point to insist on one thing from his new employer , wanger asset management of chicago the firm had only a few computer terminals providing the bloomberg financial data service , and he wanted to be sure he had one everybody s using it , he explained recently through the bloomberg service , he said , i'm in contact with everyone , and it s so easy to use just as federal express created a new paradigm in the 1980 s , revolutionizing the shipping of documents and small items , bloomberg lp in the 1990 s created one for the dissemination and use of business and financial information in the process , the company changed the landscape of the 7 billion financial data industry , marginalizing onceproud competitors like dow jones s telerate system as much as any founder could , michael r bloomberg shaped his company in his own image beginning in the early 1980 s with a business that provided arcane financial data to bond traders , he built a unique information powerhouse whose news reports are published in newspapers worldwide , whose television programming in 102 countries and whose data flow to about 111 , 000 trading desks , executive suites and newsrooms anywhere that instantaneous financial information is in demand in the process , the dapper mr bloomberg , now 57 , became a billionaire but what it takes to forge a revolution is not the same as what it takes to govern mr bloomberg s challenge now is to guide his company through its transformation into a corporate giant stable enough to manage a huge , competitive business and nimble enough to outsmart other entrepreneurs the men who would be bloomberg these days , the privately held bloomberg lp is now coping with the problems of a mature company cost controls have a new , high priority a lavish bonus system has been reined in the sales force has been beefed up as the company sets its sights on foreign markets , where every gain will be hard won all this as the eponymous bloomberg box through which the data flow is being phased out in favor of a personal computerbased system yet for all the changes , the company is still an unmistakable reflection of its founder like the system he built , mr bloomberg is enormously complex he is generous the company pays well , and he is an active philanthropist he is also an obsessive worker , and numerous employees complain of a punishing work schedule he has been aggressive in hiring women , but is not shy about using brusque sexual language in the office though he can be tough in pushing longtime associates aside , he is slow to dismiss anyone as the company has grown to nearly 5 , 000 employees and has expanded around the globe , mr bloomberg has withdrawn slightly , devoting more time to philanthropy and nurturing gossip about possible political ambitions at the same time , his company must grow in many different directions at once if it is to maintain its momentum of growth and culture in a recent interview at his manhattan headquarters , mr bloomberg , dressed impeccably in his trademark dark suit , white shirt and dark tie , said bloomberg s future would depend on its ability to reinvent itself the world is such that you have to constantly provide the public whether the public is an institutional public or a retail public with new things , he said partly because they get bored but also because the competitors out there , whether it s better kinds of cereal or widgets or information or whatever it is , they 're doing it better that leaves bloomberg watchers with two fundamental questions first , where will new growth come from , when the company must confront the londonbased reuters group plc on its home turf overseas and watch out at home for internetbased services that offer much less but come far cheaper \? reuters had worldwide 1998 revenue of 5 billion from financial data systems and news , photo and video services compared with an estimated 15 billion for bloomberg last year , bloomberg had net installations of 19 , 800 systems , just 500 more than the previous year , according to company figures the growth of its installed base was 22 percent hardly a poor showing , but lagging behind the 1997 rate of 28 percent and the 1996 rate of 25 percent with bloomberg in the united states , i think they 've reached a peak , said angela wilbraham , an editor with waters information services of new york , a leading research organization in the financial information and services field the second question concerns the company s corporate culture , which was forged in a period marked by hyperenergetic work schedules , hypergrowth in dataprocessing capacity and a sometimes hypercritical management can bloomberg outgrow its adolescence and achieve steady , if less spectacular , growth , while managing its expanding work force in a more measured way \? mr bloomberg is betting that the increasing complexity of the financial world will inexorably bolster demand for a system like his a system intended to make opaque financial data transparent if securities prices were all that mattered if everything was open , high , low , close on the new york stock exchange yahoocom could do it fine , and we 'd be out of business , he said
albany , nov 8 for nearly a year and a half , state authorities say , dozens of prison employees spent their workdays tending to personal affairs and then falsified time sheets to cover their tracks the scheme might never have been uncovered , the authorities say , had the employees not committed one minor blunder using their stateissued ezpasses and cellular phones wherever they went the trail of billing records generated from the ezpass and cellular phone use allowed auditors for the state comptroller , h carl mccall , to pinpoint where the state employees actually were at various times that they said they were in their offices details of the findings were in a report that mr mccall s office released today mr mccall s auditors found that 38 employees for the state s department of correctional services collected 65 , 000 in pay for hours they apparently did not work the audit , conducted from april 1996 to august 1997 , focused on investigators in the state agency s offices here and in long island city , queens the investigators , among other things , track down inmates who have escaped from prison in a statement , mr mccall said the abuses resulted from the agency s failure to oversee and monitor the activities of its investigators properly , noting that agency officials were warned of similar problems in the past he reserved his harshest words for the agency s commissioner , glenn s goord , saying mr goord had done nothing to correct the situation despite those warnings time and again over the last year and a half , we have reached out to the commissioner and his department of correctional staff , urging them to take corrective action , or to provide evidence that these findings are wrong , mr mccall said they have failed to do either mr mccall s office referred the matter to officials at both the attorney general s office and the inspector general s office , where a criminal investigation can be opened but officials at the state agency dismissed the findings in mr mccall s report james b flateau , a spokesman for the agency , raised questions about the methods mr mccall s auditors used he said that agency investigators often shared stateissued ezpasses , making it difficult to determine who was using a given pass on any given day ezpass records , he said , track the epass , not the person but theresa bourgeois , a spokeswoman for mr mccall , said auditors were careful not to rely entirely on the ezpass records ezpasses , which are mounted on windshields , are read electronically at toll gates , allowing the fares to be automatically deducted from customers' accounts , and the location of the transaction recorded ms bourgeois said that auditors interviewed 20 of the 38 investigators who were the subject of the investigation and that none of them said they had swapped ezpasses with their colleagues as part of their explanations in addition , she said , auditors found that the billing records from ezpass accounts were generally consistent with many of the notes the employees had written into their daily logs the auditors obtained ezpass records for a total of 2 , 806 days over all , the auditors found 1 , 800 occasions in which the ezpass records suggested that the prison employees were on the road when their time sheets indicated that they were at work

miami beach , feb 17 hoping to build on its electoral successes last november , the aflcio approved its most ambitious political effort ever today a 40millionplus , twoyear program of grassroots lobbying and campaigning involving thousands of union members union leaders gathered here for the aflcio s winter meeting said the plan was bigger , and they hoped more effective , than any previous labor political effort because they were gearing up far earlier than for any previous campaign the effort , which would not involve direct support for any candidate , is in many ways an expanded version of the labor federation s 1998 strategy , in which unions mobilized tens of thousands of members and helped the democrats pick up five seats in the house of representatives while labor leaders said they would support candidates based not on party but on their stand on labor s issues , they indicated that they wanted their effort to restore a democraticcontrolled congress and strengthen republican moderates in their struggle with conservatives we 're starting much earlier to reengage people over our legislative issues , said gerald mcentee , chairman of the aflcio s political committee and president of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees then hopefully we 'll be able to move that kind of enthusiasm and action into the year 2000 campaign much of the new effort , labor leaders said , will focus on six swing states with heavy union membership ohio , illinois , michigan , new jersey , pennsylvania and wisconsin they said the democratic presidential candidate next year will need to carry almost all of the states for a victory all told , the campaign calls for largescale political operations in about 35 congressional district and 20 states john j sweeney , president of the labor federation , repeatedly emphasized at a news conference today that none of the money , as much 46 million , would go to political candidates or to party campaign committees instead , the money will be used for political literature , phone banks to get out the vote , to broadcast issue advertisements and to register voters those efforts would focus on union members and groups that often share labor s agenda , including black groups , women s organizations and retirees' associations there will be a continuous effort to support candidates who have been supportive of working families , and that s regardless of party , mr sweeney said there will be endorsements of republicans as well as democrats republican leaders were quick to condemn labor s political plans it s ironic that the union bosses are meeting in sunny miami and staying at fine resorts plotting to buy influence among goregephardt democrats rather than using union dues to improve the quality of lives of their hardworking members , said scott hatch , executive of director of the national republican congressional committee this should be a wakeup call to every working american and every business owner that if they do n't participate in the 2000 cycle , the liberal elite and unions will attempt to buy the next congress to install their agenda of backroom politics demonstrating labor s political clout , important democrats are pouring into this seaside resort among them are vice president al gore , representative richard a gephardt of missouri , the house democratic leader , bill bradley , the presidential candidate and former senator from new jersey , and and representative david e bonior of michigan , the house democratic whip mr bonior paid homage to labor s political prowess , saying he owed his victory last november to unions their ground effort was amazing , he said on election day , when i got up at 5 am and went into my headquarters , i had 300 auto workers at 6 am ready to work the neighborhoods to get the vote out the plan with the new strategy was approved unanimously by the labor group s executive council , made up of presidents of 54 union leaders the labor leaders said it would be financed by having individual unions contribute 1 this year and 1 next year for each of the labor federation s 13 million members they said another 15 million to 20 million would come out of the federation s regular budget the new strategy aims to improve on the old by engaging more union members sooner the labor movement plans to immediately mobilize union members to speak out and distribute literature on issues like social security and a higher minimum wage next year , the unions will use those members for the november campaign labor leaders noted , for instance , that more than 25 , 000 union members in california campaigned last june against a ballot proposition , ultimately defeated , that would have limited unions' ability to use members dues money for politics by keeping those members mobilized through november , labor leaders said , unions played a major role in bringing about the election of gray davis , a democrat , as california s governor union officials repeatedly asserted today that the more than 40 million in political spending because it is spread over two years is actually a decrease from the 35 million the aflcio spent last year on political education and getting out the vote republican and business groups asserted that by spending so much , organized labor had used its financial muscle to buy election victories but steven rosenthal , the aflcio s political director , called that criticism absurd in 1996 , labor was outspent by corporations 11 to 1 in 1998 , it went up to 15 to 1

bafgh , iran as an emmywinning documentary film director , rob gardner has called cut ! in many farflung locations , from egypt to antarctica but none of his previous ventures have called for quite the tact and daring required for his current project , as the first american filmmaker to be allowed to work in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 coming to iran is only the half of it in a country where islamic hardliners still gather to shout death to america ! on major anniversaries of the revolution , mr gardner has chosen the one topic that oddsmakers in iran and elsewhere might think most likely to detonate in an american filmmaker s hands the history of islam as a faith , a culture and a civilization , with pivotal sequences in the story reenacted by a cast of 150 iranian actors and extras in this desert town 350 miles southeast of tehran , mr gardner , 53 , has gone a step farther for a threepart series titled islam empire of faith that is on the pbs schedule for next fall , he has been filming sequences that involve the life and death of muhammad , the muslim prophet , a subject so sensitive that the merest hint of a slight , however unintentional , could sink the project in a moment in bafgh , as in five other iranian towns where mr gardner has filmed , power still resides with the mullahs , or muslim clerics , men with a network of eyes and ears to scan for any hint of apostasy although much in iran is changing under a reform movement headed by muhummad khatami , a muslim cleric who was elected president in 1997 on a pledge to curb the clergy s powers , almost every day brings word of some new miscreant s arrest on allegations of insulting islam if this suggests that mr gardner and his american crew have to operate in a climate of rigid conformity , the reality is otherwise about the only stifling thing on the set in bafgh has been the heat , which was pushing toward 100 degrees on a recent morning as the iranian cast recreated the scenes in ad 632 , when word of the prophet s death in mecca reached his distraught followers in medina , a muslim holy city in what is now saudi arabia in medina , muhammad raised the army that conquered mecca , setting the stage for the rapid sweep by arab armies that eventually carried islam across arabia , westward through north africa , sicily and spain , and north and east as far as modern turkey , iran and central asia the pbs series will begin with the life of muhammad and end with the reign of suleiman the magnificent , the 16thcentury ottoman emperor whose era many historians regard as one of the most glorious in the islamic story for hours , mr gardner , shielded from heat and dust by a flowing turban , shot and reshot the mourning scenes in an old caravanserai , a mudwalled structure once used as a staging post by camel trains crossing the desert with women in flowing robes and face masks wailing in a recess , a small army of ferociouslooking men , in white robes and turbans , each with a luxuriant beard and mustache , waved curved swords in the air in a trancelike dance of grief during breaks , americans and iranians alike relaxed and chatted over glasses of sugary tea and cocacola , still available here after 20 years of american economic boycotts with the atmosphere more like that of a party than a film set , mr gardner chuckled at a visitor s suggestion that the entire project , involving more than 40 days of filming in iran , was the filmmaker s equivalent of a highwire act exhilarating , but poised at the brink of disaster in 30 years of filming , i 've never experienced the same degree of simpatico , said mr gardner , who is based in baltimore the more connected we 've become with the people here , the higher the comfort level has become we have n't had a single problem with the mullahs in fact , they 've leant over backward to help us out i think they 've concluded that we can help carry the message of islam to the world , and as long as we are doing it in a way that s sensitive to their beliefs , they 're happy he added , if that seems strange to americans , i guess it s because , psychologically , we are forever referencing the hostage crisis of 1979 , the seizure of the united states embassy in tehran in the early months of the revolution , and the 444 days of captivity for american diplomats that ensued in the american consciousness , it was the worst thing the iranians could have done but to make this project work , all of us on this project have had to get past it , and we have when they came to iran last fall to scout locations , mr gardner and his wife , char , 53 , an assistant producer on the 15 million project , were struck by the fact that filming costs in iran , lowered by the iranian rial s steep devaluation against the dollar since 1979 , were lower than in morocco , tunisia , egypt , israel and turkey , other countries they considered the abundance of eyecatching iranian locations desert sand dunes , waving palm trees , bluetiled mosques was another attraction

in a string of news conferences yesterday , mayor rudolph w giuliani and police commissioner howard safir defended the police department s handling of the fatal shooting of a hammerwielding , mentally ill brooklyn man , while the man s family criticized what it described as false statements made by city officials immediately after the august shooting the comments by the city officials and the family were in response to an article in the new york times yesterday that found sharp differences between initial police accounts of the shooting of the man , gidone busch , and evidence that has emerged in the month since the shooting mr safir , in the hours just after the shooting , said mr busch was shot 12 times to stop him from attacking two officers with a hammer , but investigators now believe that none of the six officers at the scene of the aug 31 shooting in borough park had been struck with the hammer , and that no witnesses could be found to confirm mr safir s version of events speaking at separate news conferences yesterday , the mayor and the commissioner called the article premature , noting that a brooklyn grand jury is investigating the case who did what in that nanosecond , that is what the grand jury process does , and that is exactly what the grand jury will report on when it is finished with its deliberations , mr safir said it would be inappropriate for me to comment on that now , and it was inappropriate for the new york times to comment on that mr safir said his comments in the initial hours and days after the shooting were preliminary , but he said the public was entitled to some explanation of the events my version and whatever i reported that day was based on the facts that were reported to me by internal affairs , who were investigating at that time , he said , speaking at the 19th precinct station house on the upper east side mr giuliani , at his daily press briefing , called the article about the cheapest shot you guys have taken at the police department the reality of the situation , he said , is a situation in which the police commissioner will turn out to be right , so let s talk about this in a week the morning after the aug 31 shooting , commissioner safir said that the department had seven eyewitnesses who told investigators that the mr busch was shot to save the life of an officer who had just been hit with the hammer this account was repeated several times by police officials but investigators said witness accounts and the location of the shell casings discharged from the officer s weapons suggested that mr busch had run past the six officers who surrounded him and that he was not in contact with any of them when he was shot yesterday , mr busch s parents held a news conference in which they accused the police of ignoring what actually happened that night and trying to dig up as much negative information as possible about mr busch by interviewing friends and neighbors , so as to manipulate coverage of events our family has suffered a terrible loss , norman busch , the father , said we lost a son we were shocked and angry that the police commissioner and the mayor came out with false statements before they had all the facts the family has hired three lawyers , barry scheck , johnnie l cochran jr and peter j neufeld , who are handling the abner louima and amadou diallo cases photo at a news conference yesterday were barry scheck , a lawyer , left norman busch , gidone busch s father doris busch boskey , the mother glen busch , a brother , and state assemblyman dov hikind \( fred r conrad the new york times \)
like a nation s highway system , the internet has traffic rules that prevent chaos and gridlock but an increasingly popular type of multimedia traffic is turning out to be a cyber road hog that flouts the rules and creates traffic jams this scofflaw traffic , known as streaming media , is widely hailed as the future of home entertainment , capable of eventually delivering highquality audio and video programming over the internet unfortunately , network experts warn , it may drive everyone else off the road streaming media is analogous to broadcast media in that the audio or video material is produced as soon as a computer receives the data over the internet the problem is that the streaming data does not respond to network congestion in the way other internet traffic does when a computer sending conventional data encounters congestion , it significantly slows its own transmission rate , but a computer sending streaming data will reduce the flow only slightly so if streaming traffic competes with conventional traffic for the same congested strip of roadway , the streaming traffic , like some vip motorcade , just assumes the right of way and lets all other data traffic pile up the difference , said van jacobson , chief scientist for cisco systems inc , a leading maker of internet traffic routers , is that conventional traffic is polite this stuff is impolite people writing software for that traffic they do n't care , mr jacobson said of streaming media in the long term , it s a problem by its very nature , streaming media has to flow continuously to the user s computer , so it cannot follow the same traffic rules as conventional data but even so , it is possible for packets of streaming data to interact civilly with other traffic on the internet the reason they do not , mr jacobson said , is that streaming media providers have no incentive to comply with traffic rules today , he said , if real networks is polite and microsoft is n't , then real looks crummy even elbowing all other data aside , today s streaming media produces a very low quality of entertainment most of the time much of that lack of quality today is due to slow modems at the user s end in three to five years , when cable modems and soupedup digital telephone lines are expected to be common , most internet users may be listening to live webcasts or playing highquality radio on their computers in 10 years , movies and commercial television might very well be carried over internet channels this increasing demand will add vast amounts of streaming traffic to the internet and could lead to what mr jacobson calls congestion collapse the internet equivalent of gridlock internet service providers are also concerned tony blake , vice president for marketing and business development for att labs research , calls the trend disturbing , adding , what people are saying is , 'if my stuff gets through , that s all i care about' he said att and other internet service providers were pressuring the producers of streaming media to head off the problem before it grows out of control streaming media traffic is also of growing concern to the internet engineering task force , an industry group that is the closest thing the internet has to a governing technical body mr jacobson , an active task force participant , said the group has not yet formally addressed the issue because it s not big enough to kill the net not yet anyway but a number of internet service providers are getting nervous mr jacobson said he would like to see streaming media use congestion controls that are compatible with those used for conventional datapacket traffic today , according to measurements by the national laboratory for applied network research at the university of california at san diego , none of the existing streaming media providers are using such controls real networks , the largest streaming media provider , declined to respond to the growing criticism , although a spokesman , jay wampold , said the company was trying to address congestion problems over the last year , he said , real networks had installed a network of computers for delivering the company s broadcasts that bypasses the internet s main traffic routes kevin unangst , lead product manager for windows media , the streaming media division at the microsoft corporation , said the company was working with network companies to route its streaming data around the internet s main arteries we know bandwidth and optimizing bandwidth is a huge , huge issue , mr unangst said , using an industry term for transmission capacity , and we 're covering all the bases but mr jacobson said that while actions like those taken by real networks and microsoft might help , they would not resolve the problem the bottlenecks are not on the main thoroughfares , he said , but on the side streets and access roads as you get out to the edge of network , closer to users , that s where the bandwidth gets limited , he said while cable modems and digital subscriber lines will increase bandwidth to the home , a truly significant increase in internet bandwidth would require ripping out 300 million copper wires and replacing them with fiber that s not going to happen fast , mr jacobson said the remedy , experts say , lies in providing incentives for streaming media providers to comply with traffic rules
for the time being by annie dillard 205 pp new york alfred a knopf 22 this is not a pleasant book to read , nor is it intended to be annie dillard writes with the fury of someone obsessed with an idea the idea is causing her great pain , and she wants to transmit some of that pain to us , for if she does n't at least make us flinch , she will have failed in her enterprise the obsessive idea is both simple and , to date , unresolvable if an allmerciful , allpowerful god exists , how is it that evil also exists \? the question is an old one , of course , and it is not clear what makes dillard want to dredge it up just now still , there is a certain logic in the fact that the author of pilgrim at tinker creek and teaching a stone to talk should choose to follow up her earlier investigations of spirit and matter with this one the subject , at any rate , unleashes annie dillard s most impassioned rhetoric why did god let the romans flay an 85yearold torah scholar \? she asks , after recounting in gruesome detail the way the currycombs separated the man s skin and muscles from his bones in the execution of rabbi akiva nor does she limit her examples to the deaths of martyrs she is also confounded by birth defects confounded , but also weirdly attracted like a diane arbus in reverse , a viewer rather than a maker of luridly clinical photographs , dillard lingeringly describes to us the things that can go wrong with the gene pool babies with feet growing directly out of their loins , faceless or spotted or mewing infants , birdheaded dwarfs with huge eyes and tiny chins all disturb and compel her , causing her to question her own faith she imagines herself hollering at god the compassionate , the allmerciful , what s with the birdheaded dwarfs \? in her search for answers , dillard looks to paul tillich and teilhard de chardin , the baal shem tov of the hasidim and rabbi lawrence kushner of sudbury , mass she visits china and israel , contemplates vast archeological digs , speaks with palestinian bus drivers and dutch tourists none of this eases her evident distress toward the end of for the time being , she reports for tillich , god s activity is by no means interference , but instead divine creativity the ongoing creation of life with all its greatness and danger i do n't know i do n't know beans about god but she cannot end on this note the philosophertheologiannaturalist in her may be wedded to huge unanswerabilities , but the writer , the storyteller , wants closure and specificity so dillard , after listing for us the deaths of hundreds of thousands in floods and earthquakes , millions in acts of genocide , billions in the course of human history , ends with the rescue of a single teenage girl she gives us , in suspenseful increments , the news story of suri feldman , a lubavitcher hasid girl lost in the connecticut woods for several days in 1995 but ultimately returned safely to her brooklyn family dillard knows perfectly well that this one salvation cannot compensate for the millions of unjust , unfair or excruciatingly painful deaths still , she is drawn to suri feldman s tale as a miracle of sorts with a combination of hope and misgiving , she quotes one of the searchers in the woods it says in the bible that to save a life is to save the entire world this concern about the relationship of the one to the many the individual death , for which we feel grief , set against the incomprehensibly numerous deaths pervades dillard s book who were the families whose loessburied hearths genghis khan rode over on ponies , the people stalin killed , the 792 billion of us now dead , the 59 billion of us now alive , the stublegged 3yearold girl exuberant in underpants and hair bows who held out her arms , or isaac luria in exile \? how can an individual count \? she asks in one of several sections labeled numbers but here is where we begin to see the weakness in dillard s effort to instill pity and terror in us she herself is aware of the problem , as she indicates by quoting a headline from the hartford courant headspinning numbers cause mind to go slack dillard follows this up with an injunction but our minds must not go slack how can we think straight if our minds go slack \? the damage , however , cannot be so easily repaired wishing a thing to be different will not make it so the job of the writer even , or especially , the philosophical or theological writer is to rope in the unapprehensible , to make us feel the reality of things that otherwise float beyond our ken that job must be accomplished partly , or even largely , through tone and tone is what most often betrays dillard the fatal flaw appears as early as the first paragraph of the introductory author s note , where dillard characterizes her nonfiction narrative its form is unusual , its scenes are remote , its focus wide and its tone austere its pleasures are almost purely mental well , is n't that for us to say \? dillard s failure to allow for her readers' response to gauge it accurately , to trust it when necessary , to employ it effectively as narrative glue and to tread delicately on its soft , bruisable spots is the primary shortcoming of for the time being i would call it a failure of wit wit does not just mean humor , though here too there is a problem i most often had trouble with annie dillard s prose when i thought she was trying to be darkly funny it is never easy to find good fill for construction , she says dryly , before starting in on a discussion of how many people have been used , dead and alive , for landfill i know i am supposed to find such comments blackly humorous , eyeopeningly shocking , but instead i merely feel imposed upon my sense is confirmed when , two pages later , dillard observes that mass killings and genocides recur on earth does not mean that they are similar each instance of human , moral evil , and each victim s personal death , possesses its unique history and form banal sentimentality of this kind sits oddly with shockvalue humor , making one doubt the authenticity of the bleak , black view to be truly shocking , black humor must be truly felt otherwise , it is just a pose as a jewish atheist with little or no feel for nature , i am admittedly not the ideal reader of for the time being \( the jewish part is important , for it means that dillard s frequent references to the baal shem tov and rabbi isaac luria lack , for me , the appeal of exoticism \) but i think this is annie dillard s problem as much as mine a book like this should not speak just to the converted unbeliever that i am , i can be made sympathetic to the ideas and concerns expressed here and have been made sympathetic to them by such recent artistic accomplishments as errol morris s film fast , cheap and out of control and w g sebald s book the rings of saturn both these works use dillard s narrative strategy \( the conjunction of seemingly disparate facts and stories that eventually add up to a complex whole \) , and both are obsessed , as she is , with the relationship between the finite individual life and the longer , larger universe but for reasons mainly of tone , they succeed where she nobly , courageously and with the best of intentions ultimately founders drawing
santa fe , nm , aug 6 the santa fe opera , now in its 43d summer season , regularly draws over half of its audience from out of state the quality of the productions is usually high but what particularly brings visitors is the company s spectacular openair theater in the mountains north of the city , and its commitment to unusual repertory the 2 , 100seat , acoustically impressive theater has gone through some recent renovations , including , this summer , a new electronic libretto system mounted on strips running across the back of each row , the system is virtually identical to the one introduced at the metropolitan opera in 1995 indeed , the same team of engineers were responsible for it in terms of innovative repertory choices , santa fe regulars have come to expect more of this company among the 116 operas presented here in total , 9 have been world premieres and 39 others have been american premieres this summer s offerings are not particularly adventurous new productions of bizet s carmen and mozart s idomeneo revivals of strauss s ariadne auf naxos and emmerich kalman s viennese cream puff of an operetta countess maritza the most interesting is a new production of poulenc s dialogues of the carmelites directed by the provocative francesca zambello the talented american director s productions are always newsworthy this one , which i attended on wednesday night , finds her in strong form poulenc s 1957 opera is based on a true incident involving a convent of carmelite nuns in paris who were executed during the french revolution if ms zambello s many critics were expecting her to update the story , muddle it with symbolism or uncover some psychosexual subtext , they have been disappointed this is a humane and historically sensitive production alison chitty s set is not its strong point a tall , thick wall that can be spun around dominates the stage one side represents the world of the aristocratic marquis de la force , the other takes us to the cloistered domain of the nuns their convent , their chapel and , eventually , the prison in which they are condemned the design concept is strong , but the wall itself is a cumbersome , drab thing that leaves the singers little room at times for movement ms chitty s costumes , however , are perfect , especially the plain burlap brown robes of the nuns ms zambello has received so much criticism for her staging concepts that her excellence as a director of singers is often overlooked she draws fulldimensional and affecting performances from her cast , none more so than the blanche of the soprano patricia racette some admirers of this opera may find ms racette s interpretation too largescale and tempestuous blanche is usually presented as a young , overprotected , painfully timid aristocratic woman who seeks the convent as a refuge from her own life and the crazed times she lives in but ms racette s gleaming voice and dramatic intensity reveal the force of the inner demons that drive blanche to the convent and you believe that among her sisters she truly finds the solidarity to heroically embrace martyrdom the contralto sheila nadler , as the old , informed prioress of the convent , gave an unforgettable portrayal of a woman who preaches firmness , moral judgment and acceptance of god s will in life , but succumbs to blank fear , doubt and selfpity in the face of harrowing illness and death the fine young soprano christine goerke summoned her lustrous voice and quietly commanding stage presence for her portrayal of madame lidoine , who provides sureness and spiritual calm to the sisters after the shockingly undignified death of the prioress and the soprano lynette tapia was beguiling as the chatterbox sister constance , who beneath her girlish cheerfulness possesses a simple wisdom that inspires her sisters to courage judith christin as the martyrdomfixated mother marie , who paradoxically escapes death herself , and richard stilwell as blanche s father , the marquis , were also effective the one serious miscalculation in ms zambello s work was her decision to let the audience witness the actual executions by guillotine of the 15 nuns the libretto specifies that as the carmelites are marched one by one into the place de la revolution , the audience sees them climb the scaffold , then disappear into the darkness downstage their beheadings are represented musically , however , in the horrific slicing orchestral chords that keep interrupting the sisters' brave singing of the salve regina in poulenc s tender setting instead , ms zambello gives us an ineffective stage trick we see the heads of the nuns supposedly falling into a large basket all this does is distract our attention from the powerful music as the salve regina is sung first by 15 , then 14 , then 13 , voices and so on , until only constance s voice is left alone the french conductor stephane deneve , in his american debut , led a supple , vividly characterized performance that did not wallow in the music s religiosity for all its beauty , this is a passionate and , at times , violent score , and mr deneve conducted it that way the santa fe opera first presented kalman s countess maritza in 1995 this revival was back , apparently , by popular demand , and the audience on tuesday seemed to have a whopping good time i did n't share in it the operetta is a piece of fluffy silliness with a few catchy tunes the story , set in hungary , is just a conceit a wealthy , soughtafter countess falls in love with an impoverished count who is working incognito as her estate manager to support his younger sister if presented with wry wit or comic restraint , this 1924 work could possibly come across as an amusing , stylish remnant of a bygone era but the director daniel pelzig encouraged all manner of overacting , prankish antics and inanity at one point , a chorus line of hungarian cabaret cuties , as they are called , come out to dance and sing inexplicably they all start clicking their tongues , like anita in west side story singing puerrrrrto rrrrico the score was conducted spiritedly by john crosby , the company s founder sheri greenawald tried to maintain some dignity as the countess two tenors , kevin anderson as the impoverished count and gert henningjensen as a lusty hungarian baron , were impressively nimble at the legsplits and leaps they were called upon to execute but all in all , this vestige of musical theater from vienna in 1924 just made the vitality of what was happening on broadway at that

the actor danny glover , whose discrimination complaint against a taxi driver last month spurred a city crackdown on cabbies , said after a public forum last night that any driver who fears black people perhaps needs to get another job in the month since he filed the complaint , in which he reported that a cabby had refused to allow him to ride in the front seat , mr glover said , he has learned to smile goodnaturedly when black friends rib him if i stand next to you , can i get a cab now \? he says they ask he has also learned that being a cabby is far more complicated in new york than in san francisco , where he moonlighted 20 years ago as a driver and got most of his passengers by radio dispatch , the actor said mr glover , speaking at a news conference after a forum at pace university , said he was sympathetic with many drivers' concerns but if a driver fears for his life if he takes a black person into his cab , he added , then perhaps he has to have a total different understanding of who black people are and perhaps he needs to get another job he has to have another educational process that i ca n't help him with it means that he fears me , he fears my daughter , and he fears this young woman or whoever mr glover s lawyer , randolph m scottmclaughlin , who is a professor at pace , organized the forum in response to the incident on oct 9 , when mr glover , who is 6 foot 4 and says he has a bad hip , asked to ride in the front passenger seat of a cab because he found the back seat too confining a request that city officials say should have been honored the driver threatened to call the police , mr glover said earlier that day , mr glover said , five cab drivers passed him by at 116th street and adam clayton powell jr boulevard in harlem less than a week after mr glover filed his complaint on nov 3 , mayor rudolph w giuliani announced an undercover operation in which the city threatened to seize the cabs of drivers who refused to pick up minority passengers at least 25 drivers have been cited on charges of refusing customers because of their race or destination , as well as other offenses mr glover made only a brief statement at the forum and spent much of the rest of it listening to accounts from drivers and passengers several participants acknowledged the power of the celebrity of mr glover , 52 , who has starred in films like the color purple and the lethal weapon series bruce schaller , a taxi industry consultant , said that in november there were 222 newspaper and magazine references worldwide to mr glover s complaint theodore m shaw , 45 , associate director of the naacp legal defense and educational fund , said , it should not have required a celebrity to publicize this issue , but we 'll take what we can get certainly , the forum drew media attention about half of the audience , which numbered fewer than 100 , appeared to be representatives of the news media the others were mostly taxi industry representatives , cab drivers and civil rights and other advocates eric blair , 63 , a retired city maintenance worker from brooklyn who is blind , said he is doubly discriminated against for being black and disabled he said that at kennedy airport , despite the presence of a taxi dispatcher , cab drivers still pass him by he proposed that the city s taxi and limousine commission share penalties levied against drivers with complaining passengers there would be an incentive for passengers to file complaints and for the commission to pursue and follow up violations , he said bhairavi desai , 27 , an organizer for the new york taxi workers' alliance , a drivers' group , noted that most cabbies often need at least half of a 12hour shift to cover the costs of leasing the cab , gasoline and maintenance , so many drivers stay in manhattan and avoid other boroughs , where they may believe there are fewer fares but , she added , none of this justifies people being denied service farooq bahti , 43 , who heads a drivers' group called pak brothers' yellow cab drivers union , said that the market price of a taxi medallion is more than 250 , 000 and that competition is keen yet the taxi commission requires only 80 hours of training before certification as a cab driver in london , it takes three years to become a cab driver , he said mr bahti said , mr danny , accept our apology for what happened with you photos above , danny glover , right , and his lawyer , randolph scottmclaughlin , at a forum yesterday on bias among cabbies at left , bhairavi desai of the new york taxi workers' alliance explained the cabbies' side \( photographs by dith pran the new york times \)
citing the number of minority faculty members at westchester community college in valhalla , a new study in a washington trade journal says the the college is one of the country s top 50 twoyear colleges the college was ranked 44th for black faculty and 37th for hispanic faculty , compared with other schools , according to community college week , a professional journal published every two weeks of the 1 , 048 full and parttime faculty members at the college in 1997 , the time covered by the study , 66 or 6 percent were black , and 24 or 2 percent were of hispanic background the college s president , dr joseph n hankin , said , it s a sad commentary to have so few minorities and still be in the top 50 , although many colleges have none dr hankin said the college has tried to hire more members of minority groups but has been unable to increase its percentages he said the community college reaches out to graduate schools with a high percentage of black , hispanic and asian students and advertises faculty positions in black and hispanic publications he said that about 34 percent of the 20 , 000 students at the college are from minority groups community college week compared faculty members at 1 , 250 community colleges nationwide and based the rankings on data from the united states department of education scott w wright , editor of the journal , said miamidade community college in florida topped the list for hispanic faculty , with 865 of 2 , 782 faculty members or 31 percent kennedyking college in chicago had the most black faculty , 424 out of 571 or 74 percent
elizabethville , pa in the frosty hours before dawn yesterday , i carefully extracted a northern sawwhet owl from a nearly invisible mist net , set up on a mountaintop in central pennsylvania the owl , migrating south , had been lured into the net with a taperecording of its call as with the halfdozen others i 'd caught earlier that night , i banded the tiny , fistsized owl , weighed and measured it , part of a study supported mostly by nonprofit groups on the migration of this littleknown species then , one last step i swabbed the inside of one wing with alcohol , made a tiny prick in a vein and drew a few drops of blood for testing the owl , none the worse for wear , was returned to the night the odd , slightly ghoulish procedure was well suited for an october night , but it was also chilling in a different way these owls , which rank as one of the cutest and most appealing of north america s wild birds , may be spreading several nasty diseases into new parts of the country the samples from this owl and others will eventually go to researchers exploring the role migratory birds play in spreading tickborne ailments , like lyme disease and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis , a sometimes fatal illness only recognized in 1994 the birds do not transmit the diseases to humans directly instead , they pick up the infected ticks and fly to uninfected areas , where the parasites drop off the birds may also carry the microbes in their bloodstream , infecting new ticks that bite them because birds can cover thousands of miles in a matter of days or weeks , they can be astonishingly effective in spreading illness , which may explain why lyme disease cropped up so quickly in so many parts of the country this topic has fresh urgency , of course , thanks to the discovery of a west nilelike encephalitis virus in queens this summer that has spread and killed six people in the metropolitan area now the disease is presumably moving south with some five billion migratory birds that sweep across north america each autumn where the virus , and the disease , may eventually wind up is anyone s guess , as is the eventual impact on bird populations themselves while there is an exotic old world novelty to the west nilelike virus , human disease carried by birds is nothing new some of the deadliest epidemics , including influenza , have been spread by birds \( or by domestic fowl in the case of flu \) birds also carry several strains of encephalitis more commonly found in the united states , including st louis and eastern and western equine in short , we are simply awakening to the fact that wild animals have always served as a bridge for a few infectious diseases that can jump to humans in fact , the problem is n't birds , but humans we have shrunk the world with jet travel and global trade , breaching the oceans , the last great barriers to the spread of disease we have tampered with the planet s climate , making it likely that otherwise tropical diseases will push north into temperate zones where before they had been absent once a disease escapes into the wild , as the west nilelike virus has done , it is all but impossible to stop the answer is n't to spray malathion everywhere , but to keep a closer watch on our borders through increased medical and agricultural inspections , in the hope of blocking , say , a smuggler carrying african parrots infected with a new disease one possible explanation for the appearance of the west nilelike virus in new york city but we also must accept that no safety net is perfect and that new microbes will slip through every so often belatedly , but perhaps in time , science is trying to understand the dynamics that link birds , humans and pathogens which is why i 'll be out on that cold mountaintop again tonight , waiting , with open nets , for owls
assistant district attorney carlos f ramirez took a deep breath yesterday afternoon and delivered the first sentence of his trialopening statement with as much gravity as a young prosecutor could be expected to muster on the date of june 30th , 1998 , in new york county , the defendant , the man you see sitting here in front of you , punched a police horse in the nose , mr ramirez solemnly told six jurors in a manhattan courtroom and then he repeatedly punched it across its hind quarters so began the odd trial of james hornacek , a 35yearold union electrician who is the first person to be charged with attempted policehorse injury in legal parlance attempted killing or injuring of a police animal for as long as puzzled courthouse regulars say they can remember \( in other words , since roughly the 1970 s \) mr hornacek is accused of suckerpunching a police horse named snewser , also known as daily news 1 , during a raucous demonstration by 15 , 000 construction workers in midtown manhattan last june according to the criminal complaint , the defendant attempted to injure a police animal while such animal was in the performance of its duties mr hornacek denies striking anyone or anything and , in fact , says that he loves animals his lawyer , stanley r kopilow , said mr hornacek offered to apologize to the horse and give him an apple , but prosecutors would have none of it mr hornacek , who was also charged with disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration , faces up to a year in jail if convicted mr hornacek complains that his life has been turned upside down by the abuse charge he said his home in hazlet , nj , has been so besieged with threatening calls from enraged animal rights activists and furious pet lovers that his wife and two young children are terrified we put a block on the phone , he said but mr ramirez said in his opening statement that mr hornacek had attacked the horse intentionally and repeatedly , moving away to avoid being kicked and then striking the animal again mr ramirez promised to produce three witnesses , including police officer john reilly , snewser s rider at the time , who would testify that mr hornacek looked police officer reilly in the face and at that point punched his horse dead in the nose but mr kopilow said he would produce five defense eyewitnesses all construction workers who would testify that mr hornacek committed no such attack with snewser unable to testify , it will be up to the jury to decide which humans are telling the truth the panel of six was chosen in a curious jury selection process the prospective jurors were earnestly asked if they were pet owners , if they had any special feeling for animals , if a horse can feel pain , and if they thought the case was silly mr ramirez , the prosecutor , dismissed two people who said the case was silly mr kopilow , the defense lawyer , said he used gut sense to reject certain jurors , not the fact that they owned or did not own a pet
the misery of the kosovar refugees has tugged on heart strings across america but it tugs a little less frequently now , with the crisis two months old and american television networks showing fewer pictures of the camps abc , cbs and nbc have all scaled back the number of correspondents they have stationed in albania and macedonia and have reduced the number of reports filed from the refugee camps to an average of one a week , for each network , the last four weeks since the school shootings in littleton , colo , on april 20 , television coverage of the entire yugoslavia conflict has declined , and coverage of the refugees' situation has declined even faster refugee stories made up about 30 percent of the overall coverage in the first month after the refugee exodus began , and they make up less than 10 percent now , according to the tyndall report , which tracks subjects covered by abc , cbs and nbc although the networks still have correspondents covering the combat inside yugoslavia , nbc now has only one correspondent covering the refugees \( from a peak of five \) abc has one \( from three \) , although peter jennings , the anchor of world news tonight , plans to go to the camps this week , and cbs has none cnn has five , a cutback by one correspondent , and fox news channel brought home its own crews and relies now on its partner b sky b for coverage two main reasons are given for the cuts the refugee outpouring has tapered off , and the shootings in littleton diverted attention and resources as the refugee crisis has eased , we 've been airing fewer reports from the camps , but we 've kept enough resources in the area to cover any developments , said bill wheatley , vice president of nbc news , which also feeds the msnbc cable network now you see occasional flurries of refugees coming across , maybe 5 , 000 or so in a day , but not comparable to what was happening in the early days of the war , when the tide often reached 30 , 000 a day major newspapers have also cut back slightly on correspondents in albania and macedonia the washington post and the new york times have each shifted one reporter out recently , going from four apiece to three lawrie mifflin photo a tv soundman at work in albania on friday \( agence francepresse \)

thoughts about off broadway and off off broadway in its early years from five people who were present \( and active \) at the creation in the 1950 s and 60 s , and a look at working there today by four members of the younger theatrical generation judith malina a founder of the living theater we were around before the 60 s our theater opened in 1947 it was called the living theater what we want is a truthful , nonviolent , anarchist revolution , and in a certain sense all of our work over the years has been to encourage people to create a better world everybody wants to live in a world that is free of poverty and wars i think the purpose of art is to give people the idea , the hope , that they can create a world they want to live in i was a student of the german director erwin piscator and i was much inspired by piscator s concept of a theater with real meaning to get up and talk to people only when you have something to say the living theater , as julian beck and i began it , wanted to create new theatrical forms it is 50 years later and the company is still doing that some of our hopes were realized and many have not been but we are working to expand consciousness and the sense of the possibility of change our latest play , not in my name , is against the death penalty it is put on in duffy square in times square whenever a prisoner is executed in the united states the living theater tries to find an active role for the audience we do n't want a class of people that speaks and a class that is silent if you can change people in the theater , maybe you can change them in life it s fun to work in revolutionary theater in revolutionary times but it s more important to do revolutionary theater in prerevolutionary times hopefully , that is what we are in now ellen stewart artistic director of la mama experimental theater club i had no interest in theater , but i had an interest in people , which i do to this day i started making theater in a little tiny base ment on east ninth street it was big enough for 25 people and i called it my pushcart my papa diamond my dybbuk said , you get a pushcart and i'm going to help you push it papa diamond was this little jewish man who came from romania , and he had a pushcart on orchard street he was dead by the time he told me this but i could hear him as clear as could be he told me i must not push the cart for myself but for others and voila , la mama in 1962 we did one arm , a play by tennessee williams i did n't know it was about a homosexual in jail god and edward koch made la mama grow each time i had to move we got a bigger place and each playwright had to write a bigger play i was always watching for the police , so i did n't see much that i put on i was a clothing designer and my intention was to continue working in fashion so i could pay the rent for my pushcart then , in 1965 , we took our productions to europe because , with the exception of jerry tallmer , none of the critics would come my mama always told me to find a way , so i crossed the seas people in europe , asia and the middle east know us today because that is our territory la mama is not just one thing it is a lot of things i brought grotowski to america and tadeusz kantor it s very fashionable now all the things that people in the 90 s think are new we have been doing for 30 years richard schechner artistic director , from 1967 to 1980 , of the performance group \( performing garage \) it was preposterous and arrogant maybe , but we were trying to make a theater that would be a model for a new society we did n't want a theater that was a reflection of life it was very much related to the politics of the time the black freedom movement first and then the antiwar movement we wanted to make theater that you would not find on broadway or in the newly formed regional theater it would not be naturalistic but would carry on the european experimentation of artaud and others it would be a participatory democracy , less hierarchical , more collective and noncommercial the theater thought of itself as active it went into the streets and into strange new venues la mama etc was a club the performing garage was a metal stamping factory these were nontheatrical spaces that we were claiming for ourselves soho \? there was n't a fashion store in the whole damn place today there is no real artistic neighborhood in new york then , neighborhoods were affordable you could live much more cheaply the city did n't know what to do with some of the new spaces these places were n't theaters they did n't have seats or a stage sometimes city inspectors were bollixed you could work in your space and have the public come in the public was very curious they came the same people would go to 18 different places the audience was also a community there was a core of different groups the old dance theater workshop grand union trisha brown the kitchen mabou mines judson church was a fabulous venue it was the farthest north that we went
arlene gibson , the headmistress at spence , remembers the bad old days , the early 90 s , when girls' schools had to convince parents of the benefits of singlesex education one used to have to make the case , especially to fathers , for why girls' schools , she said you do n't have to do that anymore there is a sense now that they know the issue of girls and computers , they know the research on who talks in class , there s a general awareness actually , it has gone well beyond awareness , into a kind of frenzy , for manhattan s seven private girls' schools most had 10 applications for every 17 , 000plus kindergarten opening for this coming fall , more than the average for new york s private schools and the only public girls' school in new york city , the threeyearold young women s leadership school in harlem , has also been deluged with applications but the gender research and attention to girls' special needs that have spurred increasing interest in girls' schools are also reshaping the coeducational private schools although coed schools defend themselves as being more in step with the modern world and say they represent the most basic diversity in education , over the last few years , most of the city s private coed schools have made explicit efforts to insure that girls will not be overshadowed many have started genderequity committees and projects reconsidering everything from the boyschasethegirls game at recess to who controls the mouse during computer time and who supervises the computer lab we 've videotaped teachers at different levels to see if there are unconscious biases , said elisabeth krents , the admissions director at dalton we 've analyzed leadership roles to see if they 're divided among girls and boys we do n't say , 'ok , boys into the dressup corner , girls into the block area , ' but we build it into everything we do in second grade , right now , they 're studying grimms' fairy tales , analyzing the gender stereotypes applications at manhattan s private girls' schools have increased 69 percent since 1991 , according to the national coalition of girls' schools , with many applicants coming from beyond the traditional upper east side milieu nationally , the coalition said , applications at girls' schools are also rising , though at less than half the rate of the manhattan schools but no other city has anything like the number of singlesex options that manhattan offers much of the interest in singlesex schools has grown out of the publicity following the american association of university women s 1992 research review , how schools shortchange girls , which concluded that girls face constant bias from kindergarten through high school and the coalition of girls' schools , founded a year earlier , has touted the benefits of schools where girls get , as they put it , not just equal opportunity , but every opportunity the writings of people like carol gilligan and mary pipher , too , promoted the idea that girls entering adolescence often lose confidence in themselves and begin to falter in selfesteem and fall behind in math , science and computer classes more recently , a crop of new books on boys' emotional and developmental needs has spurred interest in boys' schools as well , though that is just beginning the most recent research shows that boys and girls both thrive in good coed schools but with everyone from politicians to educators stressing higher educational standards and backtobasics learning , the rigor and traditional style of girls' schools and those plaid or pleated uniforms that so many public schools are now also adopting seem not impossibly oldfashioned , but right in tune with the times admissions anxiety gets an early start as a result , many parents have concluded that singlesex schooling will help insure that their daughters have room to shine i just did n't want to ruin my daughter s feistiness , said marion markham abood , an upper west side mother whose daughter is in kindergarten at nightingalebamford i did n't want to chance that her spirit would be quashed in any way at a coed school if she wants to be president of the country , who am i to ruin her chance by having her overshadowed by some boy \? preschool directors far from the upper east side have been especially struck by the widening circle of applicants to girls' schools none of our parents used to consider singlesex schools , but there s been a significant shift in the past five or six years , said sheila wolper , the director of beginnings , an east 16th street nursery school that sends about 35 children off to kindergarten each year this is not to say that coed private schools are lacking for applicants they , too , have had a banner year , in what has become an increasingly anxious admissions season , echoing the college scene while parents and admissions directors alike seem to believe that kindergarten competition is getting more intense , the schools will not release admission statistics , so it is difficult to assess how much is reality and how much is nervous parents' applying to more and different kindergartens than they used to sometimes upward of 10
stratford , conn , aug 11 michael reekie has a thing for american flags , especially miniature ones the size of school notebooks i buy them by the case , he said proudly he also strings them up by the case , so that the front of his corner deli , on nichols avenue here , looks like a cross between a patriotic usedcar lot and an independence day float these are not offensive in any way , mr reekie , 34 , said with some annoyance , as he sat under 99 miniature cloth flags fluttering above the deli s front door it s a string of american flags he is annoyed because , offensive or not , around here his little flags are illegal they fall under bannersslashstreamers , said gary lorentson , stratford s planning and zoning administrator and , as he pointed out , according to section 167 of the town code , banners and streamers are strictly prohibited , as are sidewalk sandwich boards , strobe lights , signs made of nonrigid material and anything else that flutters , flashes , spins , buzzes , wags or otherwise moves faster than an ice floe in stratford , even whirling barber poles are against the law this bluecollar town of white church steeples and woodframe houses has its reasons for all the tough rules nestled between long island sound s north shore and the western bank of the housatonic river , stratford , now in its 356th year , is intent on distinguishing itself from downmarket neighbors bridgeport and milford like its neighbors , stratford s economic lifeblood is manufacturing most of its 49 , 000 residents have long ridden the fortunes of sikorsky aircraft corporation , whose plant here builds the army s black hawk and comanche helicopters and , like principals that require their pupils to wear uniforms , local officials believe neat appearances beget selfesteem that many flags , no matter how you arrange them , could be very chaotic , said mr lorentson , a tall , thin man who wore a winnie the pooh tie on tuesday it s not a matter of patriotism , it s just clutter the town feels so strongly about removing mr reekie s miniature flags or banners , depending on which side you are on that it dispatched gravely worded letters , fined him 70 \( which he refuses to pay \) and will soon haul him into court he ca n't wait to tell all this to a judge i'm not taking any american flag down , you ca n't make me , said mr reekie , a stratford native with moussed blond hair and tattoos crawling up his arms my lawyer told me i could legally burn them , he added derisively , but do n't show them , do n't show any pride in your country since the town ordered his flags removed about three weeks ago , local folks have lined up behind mr reekie behind his deli counter , he keeps a handwritten petition with 315 names on it , demanding that mr lorentson back off he has a card from the national association of naval veterans in neighboring bridgeport , expressing support a local vietnam veterans group even called this week to ask whether they could hold a flagfilled demonstration outside his deli none of this fazes mr lorentson , who has presided over stratford s strict zoning laws since 1984 i can take it , he said wearily he can also dish it out in a typical year , he and his staff send about 400 official warning letters an average of one for every 123 residents to people who have put up illegal signs or violated other zoning laws residents have fought zoning laws in the past , and won in 1985 , town officials ordered a local christian group to stop gathering in a local house not zoned for use as a church the city lost that case in connecticut superior court , mr lorentson said four years ago , on the advice of the town attorney , mr lorentson backed down and changed a prohibition on displaying political signs outofseason to a mere recommendation , after one resident refused to remove a candidate s placard from his lawn , months before the fall election most times , though , people simply comply with the zoning laws then there is mr reekie , whose deli has become a libertarian cause celebre i 'd rather be driven out of business than cave in to these people , it ai n't right , he said , then corrected himself is n't right other local business owners have their own thoughts on stratford s advertising rules the zoning here stinks , said michael pantano , 53 , who owns a car dealership on barnum avenue , the town s main commercial strip he tried many times to put up something to attract business streamers , banners , sidewalk signs , you name it but each time a town zoning official came by , sometimes within hours , and order it removed i hung a banner once 'we finance' they told us to take it down , mr pantano recalled i 've tried streamers running from the building to the cars , they told me to take them down i cannot put anything on cars , i ca n't even put advertising on the antennas if i had known that coming in here 13 years ago , i would n't have bought this property one evening a few years ago , a town zoning official drove by mr pantano s dealership at night , noticed a sign buy here , pay here illegally stationed on the sidewalk , and removed it himself mr pantano had to drive the quartermile to the town hall the next day to get it back i feel like we 're in russia , he said now , his dealership is a model of zoning compliance no signs , no banners or streamers , just eight large american flags flapping legally above a row of used cars down the street , at laurel harley motorcycle accessories , owner dennis conroy said his one american flag posted outside was all he could do to attract attention to his little shop i 've had people say they drove by here for three or four years and never knew i was here until they saw a motorcycle out front , he said he does not know mr reekie , but he sympathizes with him he s probably in the same boat i am , he said he s just a corner store trying to catch a customer s eye if mr reekie hates stratford town hall and he does so much that he recently started a campaign to change the town manager s job into an elected office he has his reasons in january 1997 , he was fined 53 for refusing to take down a flashing neon beer sign from his deli s window later that year , he was warned that a threebythreefoot banner he had put up announcing fresh cappuccino required a permit real offensive , right \? he said , unfurling the banner , made to resemble an italian flag i bought a 6 , 000 cappuccino machine do you know who i can advertise it to now \? no one it s sitting in my garage it did not end there last year , mr lorentson s deputy came by to tell mr reekie to remove a small sidewalk sign advertising his supply of beanie babies you ca n't make a living in this town , he said for his part , mr lorentson said he was indifferent to mr reekie s bannersslashstreamers we 're just enforcing laws , he said and yes , he said he enjoys seeing real american flags displayed on homes and businesses around town and even displays one himself at home on occasion but not right now the holder broke photos the stars and stripes , strewn from strings at the corner deli in stratford , conn , violate a ban on banners and streamers , town officials say a flag aficionado , michael reekie , the owner of the corner deli , has refused to take down his flags and may be hauled into court he says he ca n't

when jonathan miller s production of le nozze di figaro opened at the metropolitan opera last year , its success was virtually guaranteed no company could have assembled a starrier cast bryn terfel as figaro , cecilia bartoli as susanna and renee fleming as the countess , for starters the production itself had a simplicity and directness that were refreshing after the quirky jeanpierre ponnelle staging that had been in the met s repertory since 1985 , although mr miller adopted the easy symbolism of the ruined manor look that ponnelle had taken to extremes now the atmosphere is calmer in the environs of this figaro , which had its first performance of the season on thursday evening the cast , though not as packed with household names as last year s , represents the standard level of the met s figaro stagings , with ferruccio furlanetto in the title role , heikyung hong as the countess , susan graham as cherubino and dwayne croft as the count there were also a few notable house firsts , including rebecca evans s understated but moving susanna and delores ziegler s jaunty , brighthued portrayal of marcellina and edo de waart , conducting the work for the first time at the met , moved the performance at a comfortable pace comfortable , in fact , was the operative word here as a group , the singers moved easily through the opera , none straining vocally or dramatically that was a doubleedged sword the comic side of the work was allowed to speak for itself , without the toocute mugging that can be a distraction when susannas and cherubinos overdo it the work s more touching moments seemed natural consequences of the action rather than dramatic contrivances yet there were moments when this easygoing figaro grew pale that said , there was some fine singing all around ms evans sounded dry at first , but her soprano quickly blossomed by the time of deh vieni , non tardar , in the last act , one could hardly have wished for a lovelier sound ms hong s performance unfolded similarly , as it has in past appearances as the countess her opening porgi , amor was emotionally blank , but the rest of her portrayal touched on all of the countess s conflicting emotions and conveyed the regal bearing that makes her appearance at the end of the work such a transformative moment and her dove sono was a highlight mr furlanetto s figaro was also a joy , both for its deep , rounded timbre and its wry comic pacing ms graham conveyed cherubino s adolescent ardor without overstatement , and she used her honeyed mezzosoprano to superb effect mr croft sang the count with assurance and fluidity , and ms ziegler , paul plishka \( as don bartolo \) , danielle de niese \( as barbarina \) , thomas hammons \( as an unusually inebriated antonio \) and michel senechal as don basilio \) all contributed solidly photo dwayne croft and hei kyung hong in the metropolitan s nozze di figaro \( sara krulwich the new york times \)

well , sort of it has long been one of professional wrestling s canards that matches are scripted , lacking even the slightest spontaneous move while that is mostly true for the larger leagues , which plan everything for television and do not pretend that the pain they portray is real , the smaller leagues , which operate outside the media s eye , are somewhat looser when it comes to blood though wrestlers at jersey allpro wrestling and other , similar leagues do plan most of their matches in advance , the techniques they use are more dangerous than those in the big leagues , and are meant to meet an expectation in the crowd that actual beatings will occur some of the pain and blood is fake some is quite real which , of course , is the point let s face it , the fans want blood , said mr iadavaia \( pronounced eyeadaveyuh \) , one of jersey allpro s founders they like it here because we 're not politically correct they 're gonna see people getting smashed with chairs there s gonna be heroes there s gonna be hate no one knows how many independent leagues like jersey allpro wrestling exist throughout the country the small outfits , which are often no more than a promoter and his stable of up to 30 wrestlers , have no governing body , and promoters and newsletter writers who follow the sport say there are so many new leagues popping up each month that it would be impossible to countthem all jersey allpro , which began in this bluecollar enclave , is a typical example of an independent league , and mr iadavaia , a bayonne native who wrestles under the name lightning lou diamond , embodies the passions that characterize it a thickwaisted , ebullient man of 26 , he founded jersey allpro in 1995 while working as an administrative clerk by day and manager of an auto body shop at night though he said his first shows were depressing failures no more than a dozen fans showed up he found what he needed to draw in the fans when he discovered violence i was doing all kinds of things back then to bring in the fans , he said then i happened to pick up a chair and whacked somebody with it and the roof blew off the place right there is where i decided i just told everyone , 'let s go out and bleed' jersey allpro is one of the bloodier independent leagues barbedwire walls are sometimes placed around the perimeter of the ring , to the detriment of any wrestler whose opponent can maneuver him into it it is also one of the more sexually provocative leagues , occasionally promoting matches in which women wrestlers wind up wearing only string bikinis a regular feature is what mr iadavaia calls a weapons match as the spectators paid their 10 and filed into charity hall , they brought along a staggering array of clubs and bludgeons and put them in the ring for the fighters to use once they entered hockey sticks , baseball bats , even a kitchen sink pressed against the metal barricades separating the stands from the ring , the spectators including some children as young as 10 whooped and cheered for their favorite wrestlers , while greeting those they did not like with obscene gestures and a deafening stream of obscenities the audience was an eclectic bunch cooks from western pennsylvania , local firemen , chubby highschool girls and sternfaced cops they were of both sexes , different races and many ages , all united by their raw enthusiasm and throaty shouts for blood
who is that sleek young time bomb of a man \? at moments , he seems as frightened and helpless as a 4yearold who has lost his parents at the fair at other times , he is the soul of patrician urbanity , your ideal whitetie dinner partner then the eruptions come in nasty bolts of anger and they are n't half as scary as when his face freezes into a grim , affectless mask what is he called again \? oh , right nero yes , that nero , the roman emperor whose name has become a byword for cruel and unusual despotism , and who , as embodied by toby stephens , is holding compellingly tormented sway over the majestic theater at the brooklyn academy of music in the second of two imports from the almeida theater of london it is n't the familiar fullblown tyrant with violin that mr stephens is portraying in the crackling production of jean racine s britannicus that opened on friday night it s something far more intriguing a manboy on the cusp of monsterhood , someone who , in the course of the evening , will take that last step into a state beyond moral redemption you do n't have to look far to see what propels him there it s mom , of course , the scheming , powerhungry agrippina , and she is played to a savory faretheewell by diana rigg this fine actress would have seemed to have provided the last word on strangulating maternal figures in her sublimely creepy performance in the television drama mother love here , however , she offers an equally forceful portrait that is also much more nuanced under the direction of jonathan kent , ms rigg and mr stephens perform a motherandson duet that works both as enjoyable political soap opera and unsettling psychological portraiture , kindling the histrionic sparks that are oddly absent from their teamwork in racine s phedre , which runs in repertory with britannicus through jan 17 it s a shame that britannicus has been allotted only 4 performances \( the remaining two are on thursday and friday \) to phedre s 10 during the almeida s visit to the academy you can understand the logic phedre is a known quantity , at least to anyone who took introductory french literature , and the title role , essayed here by ms rigg , has been a testing ground for great actresses for centuries yet the almeida s phedre is crippled by a palpable awareness on the part of its creators that they 're tackling something big , with an attendant stiffness that is n't entirely offset by ms rigg s visceratwisting performance in contrast , all involved in this britannicus exude a relaxed , pleasurable confidence they 're having a fine old time undoubtedly you will , too , while getting to know , under the best possible circumstances , a play that does n't deserve its obscurity among englishspeaking audiences what a play it is a pianowiretaut piece of work that obeys the aristotelian unities while opening windows onto all sorts of levels of contemplation although it deals with the corrosive effects of obsessive love found throughout racine , it is far less monolithic than usual in its approach phedre , as the poet paul valery noted , turns into a monologue in the memory britannicus is a concert of voices vying for dominance , none of which are as onenote as you might suspect it s as entertaining a tale of roman decadence and cutthroat politics as robert graves s i , claudius , but it resists turning its characters into mere players in a sinister chess game of good and evil the motives of the power jockeys in britannicus are n't entirely clear even to themselves alliances are untrustworthy precisely because human personality is so fluid anyone following the current breakneck reversals in the reallife drama of the american presidency will have no difficulty giving credence to the evershifting world of britannicus it was racine s great inspiration , in reshaping accounts from the annals of tacitus , to present a fledgling emperor who had not yet become the eponymous nero of legend the 22yearold has ruled rome for only six months when the play opens , and he is just starting to bristle under the control of agrippina , whose machinations landed him on the throne at the expense of his rival and stepbrother , britannicus \( kevin mckidd \) nero especially resents his mother s having arranged the engagement of brittanicus to the chaste and exquisite junia \( joanna roth \) , and has had the girl made a prisoner in the imperial palace this political move is complicated by the emperor s response on having seen junia for the first time as he tells one of his tutors , narcissus \( julian glover \) , nero is in love mr stephens does a lot with that simple line , inflecting it with a combination of regal arrogance and embarrassment he and mr kent consistently and effectively emphasize racine s idea of nero at a crossroads his divided potential , to become an honorable leader and a selfindulgent tyrant , are embodied by his two advisers , the canny but virtuous burrus \( david bradley \) and the devious narcissus , both persuasively portrayed
when i joined the homeless on the streets , it was with a social conscience inflamed by hillary rodham clinton and rosie o 'donnell after they made headlines criticizing mayor rudolph w giuliani for arresting the homeless in new york city , i worried that they were neglecting their own communities who was protecting homeless rights in the suburbs where ms o 'donnell and mrs clinton own homes \? what was it was like to be down and out in nyack and chappaqua \? i let my beard grow for three days , put on grubby pants and parka , and on saturday afternoon headed up to the village of nyack it was a cold and windy day to be walking the streets , but i found refuge next to the brick wall outside pretty penny , the 22room mansion once owned by helen hayes and bought by ms o 'donnell in 1996 i sat down in a sheltered alcove just off the sidewalk , at the foot of a pillar outside the driveway gate a sign warned of guard dogs above the walls were motion detectors and a video camera trained on me a man in a leather jacket soon came from behind the gate and said i was blocking the driveway i told him i was just trying to keep out of the wind , but he insisted i clear out so i moved a few feet from the driveway and lay down along the public sidewalk , with my back pressed against the wall dozens of pedestrians and hundreds of cars passed , and many of the people slowed to look at the prone hooded figure one woman stopped her car and took photographs no one offered any help until a police car pulled up to the curb officer j m coyle emerged and approached warily , asking my name and demanding an identification card do n't make any sudden moves , he warned as i dug out my driver s license a computer check showed my record was clean , but he kept asking questions was i homeless \? did i need help \? what was i doing in nyack \? did i know who lived in this house \? i dodged most of them and demanded to know why i could n't lie in peace on a public sidewalk a normal person does n't lie on the sidewalk , he said that s not normal behavior when it s 28 degrees the people around here do n't know what to think when they see you he warned that i could be arrested for obstructing a sidewalk \( in fact , i 'd left plenty of room for pedestrians to get by \) he resolved the situation with an ultimatum you can either move along , or take a ride with me back to the station it was precisely the same choice that the new york city police is giving during the current crackdown if a man on the sidewalk declines to be helped to a shelter or a hospital , he s told to move along or face arrest on a minor charge new york s police actually seem less draconian than nyack s , to judge from the experience of david lefer , a reporter for the daily news last week he spent two days and nights on the city streets posing as a homeless man without being bothered once by the police the response to me might have been especially quick because it was a celebrity s house , but the police later told me that i would have been given the same ultimatum on anyone else s sidewalk i elected to move along to chappaqua i crossed the hudson and headed to the 17 million house on old house lane owned by the author of it takes a village but mrs clinton s village was even less hospitable than nyack , and not merely because of the secret service agents in her driveway i could n't legally sit down anywhere near her home there were no sidewalks on her cul de sac or on nearby roads , and it was illegal to park except in private driveways it might seem hypocritical for the author of a communitarian tract to live in such an exclusive preserve , but there s nothing unusual about mrs clinton s choice , or ms o 'donnell s it s the same choice made by countless other liberals who have fled to affluent suburbs in recent decades they appreciated the communitarian ideal of the city where rich and poor could live together and mingle on the sidewalks but they did n't like stepping over derelicts on the front stoop as the city streets became more menacing , they headed for suburbs with orderly sidewalks or none mr giuliani stayed behind and did something about the public spaces here you can fault him for poor public relations , but what s so radical about his determination to keep layabouts like me from taking over public spaces \? why should it take a village to make people feel comfortable when they walk out the front door \?
louisville , ky , april 30 three of them bring horses and intriguing tales to their first kentucky derby two others have been here before one wears a black cowboy hat and needed a judge s ruling to get his horse into the starting gate another survived the destruction of her tokyo home during world war ii , taught asian studies at the university of kentucky and did n't begin training horses until 1993 there is also a graduate of d wayne lukas s finishing school , a hall of famer and a budding training star who came within a length and a half of winning here last year at least for two minutes saturday , dallas keen , akiko gothard , dallas stewart , scotty schulhofer and elliott walden will be linked in the 125th running of the kentucky derby their horses valhol , k one king , kimberlite pipe , lemon drop kid and ecton park have been lumped together in the race s mutuel field for horse racing aficionados , that means the churchill downs oddsmaker , mike battaglia , determined these five horses were the least likely to win in a crowded 19horse field the horses are grouped this way out of necessity the churchill tote board can handle only 14 betting interests \( a 20th horse , aljabr , was scratched today \) for casual fans , however , necessity means sort of a price club bargain opportunity think of it as buying in bulk a 2 bet on no 14 in the program brings five horses for the price of one in one of the most open fields in kentucky derby history we 're all here because we think we have pretty good horses in our barns , said stewart , the lukas protege we all think we got a good shot to win the horses do n't know the odds , stewart added , shrugging off the 121 odds on his kimberlite pipe and the rest of the field horses the field had been bet down to 71 by tonight history has not been kind to horses that toil in the field they have won only three times in 124 years the most recent victory came in 1971 when canonero ii part of a sixhorse field circled wide from 15th place into the winner s circle and paid 1940 on a 2 bet to win but the trainers choose to ignore the low rate of success and none more than keen , the cowboyhatted colorado native who has been a force on the modest louisiana and texas circuits his valhol became the most infamous kentucky derby entry in recent times when arkansas racing officials withheld the 300 , 000 firstprize money the gelding earned by winning the arkansas derby the dispute , which has yet to be resolved , centered on whether valhol s rider , billy patin , applied an illegal electrical device , or buzzer , to valhol in order to goose him to a victory spurt for two weeks , the 41yearold keen has been in virtual quarantine at barn 42 as first uncertainty , then legal maneuvers , swirled about his horse on the eve of the deadline for derby entries , valhol s owner , jim jackson , won an injunction that forced the arkansas racing officials to release the money the winnings got valhol in the race but did not quiet the bitter words on the backstretch if i saw what they saw , and i owned that horse , i 'd be embarrassed to show up at the derby , said the trainer randy morse , whose colt , torrid sand , failed to make the field now keen , who has denied knowledge of any wrongdoing , has only one thing to comfort him his horse this is a nice colt , he said the first time he came to this track , it was like he 'd been here every day he s got some cool , and i got to believe in that stabled around the corner from valhol is gothard s colt , k one king gothard is 68 and the only female trainer with a horse in the race she came to the united states in 1957 , earned a psychology degree and joined the faculty at the university of kentucky but by 1970 , gothard was seduced by the bluegrass country s major industry and began buying and selling horses she picked up a nice colt named john henry for 1 , 500 , had him gelded and sold him for 25 , 000 it was shrewd trading even though john henry went on to win more than 5 million , barreled into racing legend and was twice named horse of the year in k one king , gothard may or may not have her first john henry as a trainer the runnerup in the galleryfurniturecom stakes is an improving colt who has been impressive in workouts here bringing the horse to the derby is as difficult as writing a dissertation , said gothard , whose everpresent smile has made her one of the most welcome sights on the backside it s made me more philosophical what you put in life good and bad is what you take from it stewart , the other firsttime derby trainer , learned his trade from lukas , the latest hall of fame inductee stewart was an exercise rider for the lukastrained filly winning colors , who won the derby in 1988 he was an assistant trainer when the stable won the derby in 1995 and '96 with thunder gulch and grindstone like his mentor , the 39yearold stewart is among the first at the barn and the last to leave , and the hard work has transformed kimberlite pipe from a 11 , 000 yearling to the louisiana derby winner and a triple crown hopeful he gave me a lot of rope , stewart said of lukas he was n't always breathing down on me he gave me an example and taught me a lot rounding out the field entries are two trainers who have had their hearts broken here last year , walden s victory gallop ran second to real quiet in the derby and again in the preakness before catching him at the wire in the belmont to thwart his rival s triple crown bid walden also trains the current third choice , menifee , but his ecton park is part of the field ecton park , a forty niner colt , was favored in the arkansas derby but failed to get a grip on the track and finished fourth but after ecton park donned blinkers early this week and blitzed a workout in 1 minute 2 seconds over five furlongs , walden perked up he stubbed his toe a little bit in arkansas , walden conceded i like them to have a little confidence going into the biggest race of their life he was super today it was left for schulhofer , the lone hall of famer among the trainers of the mutuel field horses , to inject reality into the current situation he came here in 1987 with the florida derby winner , cryptoclearance , and ran fourth in lemon drop kid , he has a spectacularly bred horse that won more than 222 , 000 last year and is suited for the oneandaquartermile distance here but the kingmambo colt has been a disappointment as a 3yearold he s a good horse who is as ready as he s ever going to be , schulhofer said in his lilting south carolina drawl the question is is he good enough and is he lucky enough \? the odds may be long that any of the field horses prove either good or lucky but if one of them somehow earns the blanket of roses , the odds are 100 percent you 'll hear a good story photos akiko gothard , with k one king , is the only female trainer with a horse in the derby \( agence francepresse \) dallas keen , right ,

washington , aug 5 representative tom delay , the house majority whip and conservative field marshal , said today that republicans would spend next year s anticipated 14 billion budget surplus and had intended to do so all year long we 're going to spend it , and then some , mr delay said from the getgo , the strategy has always been we 're going to spend what s left the plan , mr delay , a texas republican , said , was for republicans to drain the surplus out of next year s budget and force president clinton to pay for any additional spending requests out of the social security surplus , which both parties have pledged to protect the only way he can get all that spending is to spend the social security surplus , mr delay said , referring to the president s domestic budget the republican strategy , mr delay said , will also force the president to sign the party s spending bills for next year which , except from the defense budget , have been cut by roughly 26 billion from this year s levels or break his pledge to keep his hands off social security funds if the president wants to spend the social security surplus , he s going to have to go to the american people and convince them , mr delay said mr delay s comments were the first explanation of such a plan to come from the house republican leadership the remarks came as a surprise to some senior members of the house appropriations committee , which is in charge of the spending bills that finance the government but none of those members would publicly criticize or question mr delay or his strategy the spending described by mr delay would turn the projected surplus into a deficit he said the first federal budget surplus in 30 years was almost certainly going to disappear as a consequence of the senate s passage on wednesday of a 74 billion emergency aid package for farmers the house will have a similar bill , he said he called the agriculture measure the atomic bomb that blows up the whole strategy trent tried to hold off the mules and wagons , but he got rolled , mr delay said , referring to efforts by senator trent lott of mississippi , the majority leader , to stop the emergency agriculture bill and we 'll get rolled over here if we try to stop it still , he said , even if the spending had swallowed the surplus , republicans had a plan to use various budgetary mechanisms that would allow them to say they had stuck to the spending caps they imposed in 1997 we 're going to do everything we can to hold on to the caps , he said but what s more important to us is not spending a dime of the social security surplus the confrontation that mr delay anticipates has high stakes the current fiscal year ends on sept 30 , and the president has indicated he will veto some of the spending bills because of the deep cuts imposed by the republicans if the argument is not resolved by sept 30 , congress must pass a continuing resolution to allow federal agencies to spend money or shut down the government the republicans have had two showdowns like this with mr clinton since taking control of congress in the 1994 elections each time , the republicans have lost in october 1995 mr clinton embarrassed republicans by forcing them into a politically disastrous government shutdown and last october , he outmanuevered them again congress crammed 21 billion in emergency spending into a lastminute bill , mostly for programs the president favored not this year , mr delay vowed we will negotiate with the president , after he vetoes the bills , on his knees , he said and he indicated that if the spending caps were lifted , that was acceptable as long as the american people understand it s the president busting the caps , not us mr delay spoke as congress , staggering toward an august recess , struggled to pass two more spending bills the senate , after days of negotiations over amendments favoring the oil , gas and mining industries that were attached to the 141 billion interior department spending bill , gave up work tonight the house late tonight narrowly passed a hotly disputed bill financing the commerce , state and justice departments by a partisan 217 to 210 vote the president has vowed to veto both measures with 18 working days left before sept 30 , only 1 of the 13 spending bills financing the government was ready for mr clinton s signature the house has passed 11 of the bills , and the senate 9 , but a housesenate conference must smooth out differences before the bills can be sent to the white house
this is a story of triumph by a government regulator , a triumph so unusual that every side praises the agency the new york state public service commission and points to its procedures as an enviable model for states nationwide the telecommunications act of 1996 promised consumers the benefit of competition subject to rules that would be written by the federal communications commission and negotiations with state regulators , the legislation would require local bell companies to rent their wires , switches and phone services to competitors like att , mci worldcom and sprint so that they could enter the market for local service in return , the bell companies would be permitted to offer longdistance service the fcc issued rules , but many were set aside by the courts , leaving the states to negotiate in a legal vacuum in new york , negotiations bogged down as bell atlantic declared its systems ready to accommodate competition and rivals disagreed but in the last 18 months , the commission has broken the logjam it has won praise for putting politics on hold , overseeing a technically sophisticated staff and , most novel , sending squabbling lawyers to the sideline while the engineers and other technicians took over the task of solving problems the commission s basic challenge was to set rules by which customers could switch their local service from bell atlantic to , say , att purely by having att s computers talk to bell atlantic s the goal was to cut as many people as possible out of the process to reduce mistakes and eliminate opportunities for bell atlantic to sabotage efforts by competitors to lure away customers the first key decision the commission took was to set up a collaborative process in the fall of 1997 for resolving technical disputes technicians from all sides were called to testify before administrative law judges the lawyers were pushed aside the process worked because technicians , confronted by claims that their systems did not work , wrote better software rather than engage in legal histrionics next , the commission struck a clever deal in april with bell atlantic that guaranteed the company would relinquish its choke hold over local service no matter how the supreme court settled challenges to the telecommunications act the commission in turn agreed to support bell atlantic s federal application to enter longdistance service if bell atlantic could meet its commitments , including passing a test of its support systems the test would be designed and evaluated by a third party , kpmg under the test , bell atlantic s computer systems had to perform hundreds of tasks involved in switching customers to another phone company for example , competitors would need to tap bell atlantic records to find out what services a customer used until the test began , bell atlantic contended that its software was up to the task but now , seven months into a test that was supposed to take only about six weeks , bell atlantic s systems have failed more than 40 times the problem , stephen minnig , a senior manager at kpmg said , reflects the complexity of the task a complexity that no one anticipated besides identifying glitches , the test has also eliminated the fingerpointing , basing decisions on evidence and not paper debates , said harry davidow of att mr davidow , chief regulatory counsel for att in new york , said the test also turned bell atlantic s incentives upside down it no longer made sense for them to try to win by papering over their system deficiencies in reports to the commission now their only recourse was to fix their systems to the satisfaction of kpmg despite spending 15 million so far on the test , bell atlantic has not yet fixed dozens of glitches kpmg identified some rivals worry that the commission will declare victory for bell atlantic before every one is resolved or before bell atlantic has satisfied other conditions set out in the telecommunications act that are not included in the kpmg test though bell atlantic and its competitors remain deeply suspicious of each other , none has criticized the commission mci worldcom cited the commission s record as one reason it has announced plans for aggressive marketing of local phone service in the state and mr minnig said kpmg had been under no pressure except to do the test right john rubino of the commission staff dismisses fears that the agency will change course , vowing that the kpmg test will not be over until all the glitches are appropriately resolved if so , bell atlantic will pass the test not because it pressured the commission , its staff or kpmg , but because it will have painstakingly repaired every glitch that may not happen this month or next but approval will almost certainly come soon , making bell atlantic the first bell company into the longdistance market paul crotty , regional president of bell atlantic , said that the end result will be customers who know that there has been an exhaustive process that will lead to a bulletproof conclusion that the market is irreversibly open to competition regulators are not used to such praise from those they regulate no wonder regulators in massachusetts , pennsylvania and texas are rushing to adopt the new york model drawing \( niculae asciu \)
berlin , march 18 my peace is gone , gretchen sighs as she contemplates her woes in goethe s faust so too , it seems , is that of the great poet who created her in a secret operation in 1970 , east german scientists exhumed the body of goethe , loaded his corpse onto a cart , dragged it off to a nearby museum and worked on its preservation for three weeks the remains were then returned to their crypt in the city of weimar reiner schlichting , an official at the weimar classics foundation , which oversees the city s cultural heritage , said today that the operation was undertaken to strengthen goethe s bones and give his sarcophagus a new lining but , he added , nothing else was changed details of the extraordinary exhumation , carried out at night on nov 2 , 1970 , by the former communist state , are in a file with an appendix of several photographs that had lain unnoticed in the national goethe museum in weimar for the last 29 years mr schlichting confirmed the authenticity of the file , whose existence was first reported today by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung even by the standards of an east german state that doped its athletes and was a master of cloakanddagger spy operations , the nocturnal removal of goethe s body from its tomb , clandestine transport on a cart , and later treatment with various chemicals appears outlandish the frankfurter allgemeine today printed photographs apparently taken in 1970 of goethe s vacated stone coffin and a detailed account of the scientists' findings drawn from their report concerning the inspection , removal , maceration and return of goethe s mortal remains in november 1970 the term maceration refers to the technique used by the scientists remaining fragments of goethe s flesh were stripped from the corpse by steeping in fluids before the poet s bones were cleaned and strengthened with a special preserving agent , mr schlichting said goethe , whose most famous work , faust , tells of one man s pact with the devil , has lain since his death in 1832 in a crypt that also contains the corpse of the great poet and playwright friedrich von schiller , who died in 1805 it was widely believed until today that the repose of the poets , who both lived in weimar , had been uninterrupted like martin luther and frederick the great , goethe was among the great figures of german history that the former east german state used to buttress the patriotism of its citizens and its claims to represent the true germany beside a decadent west germany the tombs of all three men lie in what was east germany the report makes clear that the scientists considered preserving goethe s remains in a glass coffin , like lenin s , but later abandoned the idea as impractical , before carting the corpse back to its tomb by night the disclosure of goethe s grooming comes at a delicate time weimar has just embarked on a series of celebrations and performances to mark the 250th anniversary of goethe s birth and the city s selection by european union culture ministers as europe s cultural capital for 1999 it is the first city of the former soviet bloc to be honored in this way apart from the maceration and bonereinforcement , an intricate operation was undertaken to strengthen the laurel wreath that was found attached to goethe s skull the leaves of the laurel wreath were washed and disinfected in alcohol , the report said , before being treated in a solution to protect them against mold later , the dried leaves were flattened between warmed polyethylene films the wreath was then reattached to goethe s skull , a cranium that had conjured up some of the greatest literary works known to man but was found by the scientists to contain only a dustlike mass the report made public today said that seven people , including the former rector of jena university and a director of the museum of early history in weimar , carried out the work on goethe s corpse they loaded his body onto a cart as night fell on nov 2 , 1970 , and pulled the contraption the short distance to the goethe museum none of the people involved in the operation could be reached for comment today it was unclear how many of them , if any , are still alive but weimar officials were emphatic in confirming that the exhumation did take place they said the report , which had been kept in the anatomy department of the museum , was found last year , but its existence was not made public until today this is something that people would not dream of doing today , said angela jahn , a spokeswoman for the weimar classics foundation but it was simply an attempt to preserve for eternity the mortal remains of a great poet the operation had begun as an attempt to repair a broken lock on the sarcophagus , but when the advanced state of decomposition of goethe s remains was discovered , a more elaborate project was devised , the report said it added that the poet s skeleton was 5 feet 5 1 2 inches long , giving him a probable living height of 5 feet 6 1 2 inches , about average for his time one other alteration was made to goethe s remains , the report said his shroud was removed and sent to berlin , then the east german capital , for examination but communist bureaucracies being what they were , the examination was delayed as a result , the shroud did not return in time to be reburied along with goethe s rehabilitated corpse the garment was kept hidden in the schiller museum in weimar , where it remains today in the former east germany , weimar was a major tourist attraction , known as the kulturstadt , or city of culture during the 18th and 19th centuries , the city attracted some of europe s greatest writers and composers , including goethe , schiller and liszt later , walter gropius , the founder of the bauhaus school of architecture , lived in the city that was also the birthplace in 1919 of modern germany s first , and illfated , democratic republic the report by the east german scientists said goethe s high forehead , pointed chin and sharp nose were all strikingly similar to the portrait of him painted at the time of his death by friedrich preller weimar s tangled history more tangled still in light of the posthumous prettifying of the poet was darkened by its role in world war ii the concentration camp of buchenwald , where 60 , 000 people died under hitler , lies

new york state will embark on one of the nation s most aggressive programs of collecting dna samples from convicted felons , building a computer database that the police can use to solve crimes , under an agreement reached late thursday night by gov george e pataki and legislative leaders law enforcement officials predict that such dna databases will be a tremendous breakthrough , becoming to crimefighting in the next century what fingerprints have been over the last century the systems will allow the police to take dna profiles gathered from the tiniest scraps of evidence at crime scenes hair follicles , bits of skin , droplets of blood , even saliva and enter them into a computer and learn within minutes whether they came from known criminals i think it s one of , if not the most important development in forensic science in law enforcement , said ronald s neubauer , the president of the international association of chiefs of police , and the police chief in st peters , mo and in the 21st century , i not only see dna being a tool to solve crimes , but a way to insure that innocent people are not being convicted of crimes they did not commit civil libertarians have objected to the wholesale collection of dna for databases , and there have been legal challenges in most states and on the federal level , but none have been successful under the deal here , starting dec 1 , anyone convicted of any of a long list of felonies will have a dna profile entered into a state computer the state now uses blood samples to collect dna , but could move to taking cells from inside the mouth with a cotton swab , a technique used elsewhere the law will apply to about half the defendants convicted of felonies , or about 25 , 000 each year the crimes that will put people into the database include murder , manslaughter , assault , sex crimes , drug dealing , robbery , burglary , grand larceny , and the most serious categories of drug possession , attempted murder , arson , kidnapping and attempted burglary exempted would be most drug possession crimes , as well as child abuse and drunken driving all 50 states have begun some kind of dna database , and five years ago the fbi began a federal database , which can be linked to the state systems most of the state databases are not yet on line , though virginia and florida have had theirs working for several years new york , like most states , now collects samples only from people convicted of sex crimes and a few other violent offenses about 8 percent of felons each year most states exclude robbers , kidnappers , burglars and those convicted of attempted crimes but under the new law , new york will include a wider range of felons than all but eight states alabama , maine , massachusetts , new mexico , tennessee , vermont , virginia and wyoming also , new york will collect samples from everyone now in prison , on parole or on probation for one of the crimes on its list , about 100 , 000 people in all some states do not apply the testing retroactively , to people convicted in years past , and only a handful include people who are on probation and parole when we get these samples into the databank , right away we will have matches against evidence from unsolved cases , said katherine n lapp , mr pataki s criminal justice coordinator that s why the retroactive pool is such a critical feature forty percent of felony offenders return to prison for a new crime within three years , so it s fair to say there s some unknown number of offenders already in the system who 've committed other crimes we do n't know about last year , mayor rudolph w giuliani and his police commissioner , howard safir , called for dna testing of everyone who is arrested , an approach that is used in britain but nowhere in the united states mr safir has also urged that the state help local police departments pay for the training and equipment they will need to take advantage of the system , funding that state lawmakers did not include my reaction is that it is a good first step , but it does not go far enough , mr safir said yesterday of the state plan we should be collecting it from everybody the only ones who have anything to worry about from dna testing are criminals but the new york civil liberties union objects to any expansion of the program we 're concerned that perhaps this is the beginning of leading new york into a brave new world where new yorkers' private genetic codes are available to the government , said norman siegel , the group s executive director it is a mistake to equate dna samples to fingerprints fingerprints are representations of the physical attributes of the tips of our fingers they are used only for identification purposes dna is that plus much more civil libertarians contend that dna samples could eventually be used to extract personal information , such as susceptibility to disease , that could wind up in private hands and violate individuals' rights to privacy mr siegel said he did not anticipate suing to block the law
call them neoromantics , neotonalists or postmodernists none of the labels are adequate all are attempts to define the music of those american composers richard danielpour , aaron jay kernis , even john adams who look to the past for inspiration and care little about the modernist obsession with originality no one is bolder in his embrace of a tonal , lyrical and romantic past than lowell liebermann and not coincidentally , perhaps , mr liebermann , a 37yearold new yorker , has been blessed with enthusiastic audiences and bigname performers , many of whom rarely champion contemporary music just now , mr liebermann seems to be everywhere at once his opera the picture of dorian gray , based on the novel by oscar wilde , will receive its american premiere on friday at the florentine opera in milwaukee the english maestro steuart bedford , who led the premiere in 1996 at the opera de monte carlo , will conduct two weeks ago , the dallas symphony orchestra and its music director , andrew litton , appointed mr liebermann composerinresidence , a threeyear position to take effect in the fall the residency includes one major commission per season \( to celebrate the orchestra s centennial in 2000 , mr liebermann is to write a large symphony with chorus and organ \) the new york philharmonic has scheduled the premiere of his trumpet concerto in may 2000 and bmg classics recently released a disk of his flute music , played by james galway diehard modernists dismiss mr liebermann s music as reactionary , and 20 years ago , when he was studying composition at the juilliard school , his stylistic tendencies were even more unfashionable in the early 80 s , he had an epiphany , he said recently i was studying berio and nono , and learning to play the boulez second piano sonata , and suddenly i said to myself , 'i'm really not enjoying this music' no longer would mr liebermann clothe his compositions in drab , angular and dissonant garb he returned to tonality and adopted traditional genres like sonata and concerto as frames for his compositions he even went so far as to assign his works opus numbers , a custom so archaic that stravinsky , for one , had dispensed with it in 1908 it was a statement that i saw myself as part of the continuum of the western classical tradition , mr liebermann said i realized that i was taking a risk and that part of the compositional establishment would simply not be interested in my music just because of the titles and opus numbers in 1992 , mr liebermann embraced fullblown romanticism the flute concerto , though unabashedly tonal , was lightly scored but the second piano concerto was a bigboned , grandiose effusion in the best 19thcentury manner mr litton , the conductor , and stephen hough , a pianist , both former juilliard classmates of mr liebermann , were pleasantly shocked when i first heard lowell s second piano concerto , it struck me that it could have been rachmaninoff s fifth or prokofiev s sixth , mr litton said , what the next concerto might have sounded like had they lived to write it i thought , 'how fantastic that someone had the nerve to do this' mr hough , who gave the concerto its premiere and later recorded it for hyperion , elaborated i do n't know another piece in the repertory with the same visceral thrill it s an absolute gift for pianists it s unashamedly part of the tradition of the great romantic piano concertos i think there s a real progression from liszt to tchaikovsky to rachmaninoff to prokofiev to barber to liebermann the piece gets an extraordinary reception every time i do it mr galway receives a similar response when he performs the flute concerto it s music that appeals to people , because it runs the gamut of human emotions , he said every time i 've played the sonata or concerto , there s been thunderous applause , and often a standing ovation cynics might wonder whether this rapturous reaction simply reflects the music s seeming familiarity it is not that the piano or flute concertos quote from any earlier work , but they speak in a language rich with historical resonances , one not likely to challenge listeners we 've proved that no musical language can challenge an audience beyond a certain point and be successful , mr litton said the death of 12tone music is a key example we can deride strauss for 'rosenkavalier' or copland for 'appalachian spring , ' but they were guys who realized , 'i 've gone as far as i can go' lowell simply said , 'this is how i'm going to write music and remain true to myself' still , nagging questions persist , and they are hardly unique to mr liebermann s work if his music alludes so generously to shostakovich , prokofiev , bartok and rachmaninoff , what makes it more than derivative \? and what brands it as music of the 1990 s , rather than , say , the 1930 s or 40 s \? mr liebermann , his supporters insist , reinterprets the past by filtering it through a contemporary sensibility his music , mr hough has stated , looks not backward at tradition but forward with tradition the composer himself responds testily to the word derivative

highland lakes samantha the bear came from the wawayanda state park into susan and vincent kehoe s woodsy backyard and acted outrageously cute , lolling on her back , eating from their hands and , over the years , bringing about 15 cubs to visit the kehoes keep a framed 8by10 photograph of samantha in their kitchen samantha is a real new jersey black bear fat and healthy , prolific and willing to charm humans this last quality has been , for bears , a very useful trait as human habitat has grown and sprawled in new jersey , bear habitat has grown and sprawled faster a population of fewer than 30 in the 1970 s has grown to about 650 , and is spreading from its base here in the state s northernmost reaches of sussex county but the humans , by and large , do n't mind and while december was to have brought the state s first bear hunt since 1970 , under recommendations that the division of fish , game and wildlife made last year , public opposition headed it off the result is a break for bears and a standoff among people with the hunt opposed even by the head of the department of environmental protection , the division s parent agency , wildlife officials abandoned their proposal for a oneday bear season when they drew up the annual hunting and fishing code at the same time , legislation that would protect bears by banning hunting is stalled in committee in both the assembly and senate we think that at some time the public will decide what s enough , said bob mcdowell , director of the fish and game division , who said nuisance complaints about bears were rising quickly while wildlife officials were hardpressed to find places to relocate the problem bears bob eriksen , the department s supervising wildlife biologist , said last week that the unofficial count for 1998 was 900 , up from 547 last year none involved serious threats to people there are no reports of black bears in eastern states ever killing a human , and injuries are minor and rare but farmers are irate about damage and livestock kills , and mr eriksen said there had been about a dozen incidents of bears breaking into houses you ca n't tell a 400pound black bear he ca n't go in , he said blueberry muffins smell real good to a bear walking by the potential for conflict is aggravated , wildlife officials say , when people attract bears by offering food or garbage and then complain when a few of the foragers , having lost their fear of humans , behave badly ms kehoe agrees , which is why she stopped the backyard feedings and started working with a group that encourages homeowners to keep bears away from their property you really do n't do this , she said wistfully while watching a videotape from the days when her husband would dip into an entenmann s box and hand cookies to a cub for one thing , ms kehoe said , feeding is now forbidden by ordinance in her township , vernon , as in neighboring west milford and since several new houses were built nearby , there are kids , she said , and you ca n't have them hanging around finally , she agrees with the wildlife biologists that for their own good bears should be frightened of humans but ms kehoe , who works as a secretary in boonton and lives on a dirt road near a mountain lake , is appalled by the idea of a bear hunt these guys walk around with loaded guns and fuzzy brains , she said , looking apologetically at her husband , who hunts rabbits and birds but cannot bring himself to shoot a deer ms kehoe added that there would be a lot of injured bears , especially since hunting would take place just before hibernation , when the animals have grown thick coats and layers of fat even as wildlife officials report increasing complaints from lakeside communities like this one , a survey cited in its bear management plan found this vicinity to be overwhelmingly hospitable to bears of 300 residents in northern sussex and passaic counties , just 28 said the local bear population should be reduced and 15 favored a hunt when asked if they had had encounters with bears , 217 said yes , and of those , 185 said the experience was positive at ariane s restaurant here , the owner , steve imbarrato , said bear sightings in the area had become common only in the last four or five years i think they 're cool , he said people who want to hunt bear that mystifies me well , a lot of people will shoot bambi , too theodore muller , a semiretired carpenter and handyman who had stopped for coffee , said he heard recently about a bear breaking into a house and polishing off freshbaked pies but when asked if he could support a hunt , mr muller , who moved here in 1947 , said , oh , i hate to see anything get killed this sentiment is persuasive to the commissioner of environmental protection , robert c shinn jr when the fish and game division proposed the hunt in its bearmanagement report in 1997 , mr shinn responded with a letter saying that that was not the department s plan i did n't think we had exhausted other solutions , mr shinn said in an interview in the department s subsequent hearings on the issue , he said , the public was very significantly against hunting i'm not closed to a hunt , he said in an interview , but i think it has to be a last resort animalrights advocates would rather limit development than bears they do n't overpopulate , said angi metler , director of the new jersey animal rights alliance we do since bear hunting was prohibited in 1971 , the bear and human populations have burgeoned in the same places sussex , warren , passaic and morris counties the wildlife agency projects that by 2006 the state s bear population will exceed 900 a number that it says can be supported by the environment but not by human neighbors the agency places the ideal bear population at about 300 mr eriksen said bear country had already spread south from interstate 80 to interstate 78 one bear was recently knocking at the door of trenton , on the rider university campus in lawrence , he said , and another was sighted in hamilton township , south of route 1 the black bear s recovery follows a nationwide pattern bears are found in 42 states while hunting is allowed in most of those with bear populations over 1 , 000 , including pennsylvania and new york , it is prohibited in 14 of the 15 states with fewer than 550 bears but for bears , wildlife officials say , there s no place like new jersey these are the biggest bears in north america , mr mcdowell said they reproduce more rapidly here than anywhere else mr eriksen , whose small staff must corral and relocate bears that wander into urban areas , said one advantage of a hunt would be to make them more wary of people there s not likely a bear alive in new jersey today , he said , who really has had to live in fear of his or her hide photos the kehoes no longer feed samantha , and would not welcome bear hunting susan and vincent kehoe in their backyard in highland lakes samantha , a black bear , used to visit from wawayanda state park , and the kehoes keep snapshots , insets \( photographs by frank c dougherty for the new york times \)
trenton , april 20 gov christine todd whitman and her attorney general conceded today for the first time that some state troopers singled out black and hispanic drivers on the highway , and that once they were pulled over , they were more than three times as likely as whites to be subjected to searches mrs whitman and attorney general peter g verniero made the acknowledgement , after years of denials from state officials , as mr verniero released the results of a twomonth study of selected motor vehicle stops by state troopers the study concluded that racial profiling had been conducted by some troopers in their zeal to stop drug trafficking the governor said that while no official policy permitting such racial profiling existed , management styles , coaching of state troopers by superiors and a system that rewarded both aggressive ticketwriting and drug seizures had combined to create an atmosphere that went beyond simple racism to a problem that is more complex and subtle than we first realized she said she was surprised to see numbers that indicate that fully 77 percent or more of those asked to consent to a search of their vehicle during a stop are minorities is extremely disturbing , she said it is not something that any of us had any reason to anticipate , because they are numbers that none of us had seen before yet black and hispanic drivers and even some former state troopers have testified to the existence of a pattern of racial searches , and dozens of criminal cases resulting from arrests during highway stops are being contested by defendants on the ground that the stops were the result of racial profiling , which courts have ruled to be illegal under the fourth amendment s protections against unreasonable search and seizure significantly , in releasing his report today , mr verniero announced that the state would drop its appeal of a march 1996 state superior court ruling that dismissed criminal charges against 17 black defendants in gloucester county in that case the judge ruled that the defendants had been stopped because of their race now the state can expect dozens of similar motions for dismissals , mr verniero acknowledged he added that defendants would still face a high threshold of proof , but defense lawyers seemed poised to bring today s report to court whenever i have a state police case , i file a suppression motion based on racial profiling and alleging that the stop was based on color of skin and therefore illegal , said robin kay lord , a trenton criminal defense lawyer who said he had a dozen such motions pending and now guess what \? the state agrees with me ! the black ministers council of new jersey , which has been one of the most persistent and pointed critics of the state police and the whitman administration s handling of racial profiling allegations , called the report a first step what has happened today is that the easy part has been done , said the rev reginald jackson , executive director of the council we do not believe that any reasonable person in new jersey is surprised at all today to hear racial profiling acknowledged now , however , comes the hard and difficult part , and that is the process of ending racial profiling today s report also added another term to the racial profiling lexicon by disclosing the practice of spotlighting , which consists of troopers parking their patrol cars at right angles to the highway at night and illuminating the interior of each passing vehicle with their headlights the position of the cars makes radar guns ineffective and would seem to support the suspicion that these officers had taken race and ethnicity into account , the report said mr verniero s report comes a day after he announced the indictment of two state troopers , who are accused of altering arrest records , or ghosting , to conceal the disproportionate number of black and hispanic motorists they stopped the two troopers , john hogan and james kenna , who have been suspended from the force , are also under investigation in the shooting and wounding of three men whom they pulled over on the new jersey turnpike last april although the incident involving troopers hogan and kenna focused the most attention on the practice of racial profiling , the issue had been bubbling for years in the northeast , where interstate 95 was seen as a conduit for drug traffic and where many black and hispanic drivers had long complained of being harassed by officers looking for drugs in recent weeks , racial profiling has become a major issue in mr verniero s nomination to the state supreme court , as prominent black clergy members questioned whether his office , which oversees the state police , had moved quickly enough to stop the practice the same criticism could surface during mrs whitman s campaign for the united states senate next year so the two republican officials fielded questions about the report from behind defensive positions built of assurances that most state troopers were honest men and women
i am finding special joy in discovering the depths to be plumbed in the simplest lyric of ira or the tiniest harmonic sparkle of one of george s melodies mark lamos wrote those words in the hartford stage program for the gershwins' fascinating rhythm in may 1997 by the time the 25th of 26 gershwin songs comes along in the mixedup , dumbed down nerverackingly manic broadway version that opened last sunday , the cast of 10 sits on stools , finally discovering the depths and conveying the harmonic sparkle of they ca n't take that away from me , in consonance with mr lamos s reflections , as he titled his regular column when he was hartford stage s artistic director the calm lasts as long as that song then they 're all out of control again , gyrating and carrying on in the final listed song , hang on to me even a lastditch healing moment is undone the broadway version , mr lamos said in a recent interview , offered a chance to rethink , weed out and shorten an overstuffed 2 1 2hour show in hartford , fascinating rhythm was raucous , overproduced and wildly popular it did not misshape gershwin altogether , only somewhat for older audiences , the revue was enough of a reminder of the sophisticated , truly embraceable theater songs they needed to hang on to younger audiences , ripe for discovery , were sufficiently entranced but instead of being saved , the show was slaughtered see how the great savion glover , with the delightful ayodele casel , spread joy in a fred astaireginger rogers number , all funk , all tap , all high style , in mr glover s off broadway show , downtown live communication there is the spark of inspiration it takes to bring the treasured music and forms of the past to a new audience it is the antithesis of the attack on gershwin , which is incessant , forced , doowop , disco , r and b , r and r , mtv and whatever passes for contemporary clearly , the producers of fascinating rhythm thought that broadway was the stop before las vegas many regional theater productions could not be performed without the enhancement money of producers at the ready for a commercial move it worked for other people s money , which went directly from hartford to off broadway , intact this demolition job could not be worse for the image of hartford stage , or for mr lamos , a classy director with an extraordinary , ever expanding track record , ranging from shakespeare to albee , with significant operatic stopovers including an electric wozzeck at the metropolitan opera where he is to stage a new work , the great gatsby in december now he is the target of critical trouncing unusually severe even in this woebegone musical season on broadway but then , a broadway credit , however dubious , is more marketable than almost two decades mostly of triumph in regional theater a shrewdly marketed broadway show can succeed without critical endorsement broadway reviewers called fascinating rhythm assaultive , tasteless , inelegant , vulgar , and yes , vegasy but weeks from now , no one will remember the reviews , though the word of mouth on this show was disaster up to a point , gershwin sells \( or presells \) at a recent preview , one frenchman , in town for only four days , had time to see only one show he chose fascinating rhythm when asked the inevitable question , why , his fractured response in english was a paraphrase of the immortal line i love a gershwin tune a regional theater production is meant to fulfill a vision a broadway show sells a product it is hard to believe that mr lamos himself believed in the purpose of a tacky show and it is reasonable to wonder why he did n't call the whole thing off understandably , regional theater feeds broadway , which hardly needs more junk food as broadway gets more desperately hungry , the integrity of the regional theater movement is in greater danger of being compromised if producers are looking for a genuine tryout house , there is none grander than the shubert if the threeweek run in february and march of the civil war was a test case in the restoration of the new haven showplace s historic reputation , better try again although it was reported that the musical was changed , shaped and that the esteemed director , jerry zaks was officially put in charge in new haven , the civil war \( which opened on broadway on april 22 desperately needing resuscitation \) is more provocative for the questions it raises post mortem than for the music , entertainment or enlightenment it provides did the show devolve in new haven \?

scottsdale , ariz , feb 14 the letter to the football player , scribbled in crayon , carried a message that sent a chill down the damaged spine of mike utley i wish , wrote the young fan , i could switch my legs for yours , so you could play one more game utley s response was humble you read that , he said , and what else is there \? you better find a way to make it and so he has more than seven years ago utley , instantly paralyzed when he fell on his head during a game , flashed a thumbsup sign to his horrified detroit lions teammates while being wheeled off the silverdome playing field , a painfully poignant image of the unspoken dangers in sports in a phoenix hotel on monday , utley plans to rise from his wheelchair and take his first public steps since he broke his neck there will be no hidden wires , no david copperfield magic , no faith healing just the payoff from painstaking and intense rehabilitation it will be an opportunity to publicize the mike utley foundation s pursuit of a cure for spinal cord injuries utley tries to use his fame to promote a greater good this is my chance to tell people that life is not over after an injury like this , said utley , 33 , who took his first steps since the injury in a gym last december this is a chance to tell people that anything is possible if you have the desire to make it happen push the envelope utley pushes though he is medically defined as a quadriplegic , he has extensive use of his arms he drives cars and boats he scuba dives and rides seadoo personal watercraft he snow skied until he separated a shoulder he kayaks he even skydives none of this comes easily when your body is broken in fact , his problems only grew bigger after he landed on his head while pass blocking against the los angeles rams on nov 17 , 1991 since then , he has broken his nose , his foot and a toe his body struggles with functions most people take for granted , among them the ability to sweat losing that ability makes regulating body temperature tricky yeah , i 've had my share of adversity , he said but that wo n't stop me utley was a funloving , motorcycleriding , hairbleached free spirit before the injury , and his attitude remains the same saturday , on a gorgeous february day in the desert , he enjoyed a barbecue with friends and staff members from the foundation as they prepared for the monday news conference then , flanked by his friends rob fredrickson and bill lewis , both football players , and wearing special shoes and leg braces , he will stand and take baby steps and hope the television cameras beam that image into the minds of potential donors to the foundation , as well as the homes of the estimated 200 , 000 victims of spinal cord injuries in the united states not that every one of them can expect recovery similar to utley s he has said that , in a strange way , he was lucky when he fractured his sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae in medical terms , his injury was incomplete , meaning he was able to regain limited feeling beyond the point of injury and through wise financial planning and what he called generous support by the national football league they really took care of me , he said utley could afford top medical care years of rehabilitation at the craig hospital in denver , three months each year of biofeedback therapy at the university of miami school of medicine , and now daily work with a chiropractor , a physical therapist and a personal trainer at gold s gym in wenatchee , wash , where he lives for part of the year dr barth green , chairman of neurosurgery at the university of miami school of medicine and president of the miami project to cure paralysis , said of utley he s not one who sits around waiting for something good to happen he s extremely committed to his wellness and his rehabilitation even with that , it does n't mean someone will improve neurologically in only a few percent of cases is there such a spectacular recovery blair mchaney , utley s trainer , said that rehabilitation normally focuses on strengthening muscles that are still functioning the unorthodox exercise regimen utley began a year ago focuses on muscles in the legs and buttocks in which there was no function slowly , utley showed progress he stood in november and took his first steps in december he took about nine steps and everybody in the gym , their jaws just dropped , mchaney said by telephone from wenatchee it was pretty emotional the place got real quiet mike said it was amazing it was pretty intimidating just seeing him tower over me at 6 feet 6 to me , he had always been 4 feet 2 in the chair mchaney introduced utley to dani andersen , a paramedic , at the gym utley pestered her until she accepted a date riding seadoos they have been together for a year mike is so much fun to be with , she said as much as he does for himself , he 'll do anything in the world for you when he is not working on rehabilitating his body , utley works on motivating others the former starting right guard who opened holes for barry sanders tries to open doors for victims of spinal cord injuries who feel shut out from life i go to hospitals and talk to kids and teenagers and moms and dads , he said i tell them the injury ca n't change you unless you allow it to he wo n't allow it he is building a house in scottsdale so he can be more involved with the foundation , which awards grants for research , rehabilitation and educational programs his 6foot6inch body , down to 240 pounds from his playing weight of 315 , is packed into a wheelchair , but not confined by it we 've got to find a cure , that s what the foundation is about , he said i want to be fixed i want to be normal i want to get married and have kids i 've

night after night , the parking lots are jammed with expensive cars as patrons crowd into four restaurants along the twomile strip of northern boulevard between great neck and roslyn in the spring of 2000 , another one will open on the strip , and a sixth is 10 miles down the road in east norwich these are not places where you will learn the names of obscure french mushrooms and the presentation will be so artful you wo n't want to mess it up these are steakhouses , where the menu needs no translation and the food laps over the plate in spite of more than two decades of warnings about the dangers of red meat , there are more steakhouses feeding more steaks to more long islanders than ever before leading the way are the establishments on northern boulevard , a k a steak row peter luger , the north shore steak house , bryant and cooper , burton doyle and rothmann s , with morton s scheduled to join the lineup next year while each of these restaurants claims to be different , they all share stratospheric prices , a clubby atmosphere , dark wood and subdued lighting , jampacked bars miasmic from cigar and cigarette smoke , and addresses near the assetrich zip codes from which they draw their customers though steak rules , they all serve lobsters , fish and a variety of other meat dishes like lamb chops and veal and they all profess not to care about the competition down the road to be sure , steakhouses never vanished from the long island restaurant scene the granddaddy of them all , peter luger , has been going strong in great neck for 39 years but five steakhouses in a twomile stretch of northern boulevard \? what gives \? people are going back to eating steak because they 're reacting to what happened 10 to 15 years ago when , all of a sudden , every doctor in america was telling their patients to lay off red meat , that red meat and cholesterol were taboo , said dr john c peters , an internist and cardiologist at st francis and north shorelong island jewish hospitals we had an extreme opinion you could n't even go to a cocktail party where everyone was n't discussing their cholesterol levels now we know that there s no reason not to have red meat once or twice a week , he said moderation is really the answer to everything consuming meat this way does n't change cholesterol significantlyy , he said , but warned that exercise was important and that taking cholesterollowering drugs does n't mean that you can have steak and haagendazs every night jon marin , a 61yearold businessman from east rockaway and a frequent patron of bryant and cooper in roslyn , said that he had high cholesterol , took his cholesterollowering pill every day and gave up smoking 11 years ago i eat lots of chicken , but as long as i take the pill , i'm entitled to eat steak once or twice a week , he said , echoing the sentiment heard among a wide swath of steakhouse customers who grew up in the 1950 s , 60 s and 70 s and are now rolling in cash and imbued with a feeling of entitlement i work hard , i deserve this ! steak is a symbol of doing well , and with so many people doing well in the island s redhot economy , it makes sense that more people are eating it it s also reminiscent of the meatandpotatoes meals many customers remember mom making , and thus is a comfortable way to splurge when people are paying top dollar , they do n't want to experiment , said one maitre d'hotel who asked not to be identified they want old , reliable standbys at peter luger , which the zagat restaurant guide called carnivore heaven , the manager , robert szkolnicki , said none of his customers worried about consuming meat , including doctors in fact , they 're the first ones here , he said gillis poll , a coowner of bryant and cooper , said that his roslyn steak house drews a large clientele from st francis and north shorelij who come in to unwind , meet on occasion with pharmaceutical salesmen and eat steak a lot of the doctors have told me that it s not the cholesterol that will kill you , he added maybe it s the stress the cholesterol scare is an old wives' tale , said seth bromberg , general manager of burton doyle , which opened in roslyn on july 26 as the newest addition to steak row mr bromberg would certainly get an argument from dr frederic vagnini , a former heart surgeon at north shore university hospital and owner of cardiovascular wellness centers in westbury and manhattan the studies have n't changed , he said people need constant education to remind them that the higher intake of saturated fat associated with steaks puts them at a higher risk for heart attacks , strokes and prostate cancer dr vagnini said that he recently saw seven patients who suffered heart attacks or severe chest pain after eating a highfat meal they should have a tunnel from these restaurants to the cardiac catheterization labs of st francis and north shore , said dr vagnini , who recently cowrote the carbohydrate addict s healthy heart plan i would n't be surprised if the cardiologists had an interest in the restaurants
san bernardino , calif , sept 13 for more than a decade , representative george e brown jr , an oldline liberal democrat first elected to congress in 1962 , was a top target for republicans eager to win a seat in california s sprawling inland empire of semidesert suburbs and commuter communities and more than once , mr brown came close to losing , so when the congressman died in july at 79 after complications from heart surgery , a close race to succeed him seemed all but inevitable but for the moment , that close race is between two democrats vying for their party s nomination in a special election on sept 21 and the contest , the first congressional election of the 2000 cycle , says much about the changing demographics of a district where the first mcdonald s drivein opened in the years after world war ii once a solid bluecollar steelmaking center on the path of route 66 , the area became a beachhead of reagan republicanism , and in recent years there has been a steady rise in the influence of hispanic voters , who are expected to exert growing power in california s politics in the coming years both leading democratic contenders are hispanic mr brown s widow , marta macias brown , who was also his chief adviser and press secretary , is hoping to hold on to the family seat but is facing a stiff challenge from state senator joe baca , an aggressive local politician who in recent years had been nonetoosubtly hinting that it was time for mr brown to step aside the republican party s first choice for the seat , state senator jim brulte of rancho cucamonga , decided not to run the leadership s current choice is elia pirozzi , a businessman who lost to mr brown by 15 percentage points last year since the beginning of the 1990 s , republican registration has dropped from about 39 percent of the voters in the district to about 33 percent now , with the democrats , fueled by newly registered hispanic voters , picking up the difference it s very much what s happening in california , said richard ross , a veteran sacramento political consultant who is advising mr baca it s probably a little ahead of a lot of the rest of the older suburbs ten candidates will appear together on the open primary ballot on sept 21 , and if no one gets a majority , the top finisher from each party will advance to a general election on nov 16 to fill mr brown s unexpired term until the regular election in november 2000 mr baca began the race as the perceived frontrunner , and is still said to lead in private polls of likely voters he and mrs brown have similar stands on most issues , including support for a patients' bill of rights and broader access to health insurance or , as mr baca put it in a debate here tonight , no person should go without fear of knowing that there is no insurance but in this year of highly publicized gun violence , mr baca has been criticized for his longtime resistance to gun controls say it ai n't so , joe , another democratic contender , mayor david eshleman of fontana , said in the candidates' forum , denouncing mr baca s acceptance of contributions from the national rifle association and his status as the gun lobby s favorite democrat in sacramento in june , mr baca was the only democrat to vote against a bill later signed by gov gray davis banning assault weapons , and in early july he was the only democrat to vote against barring californians from buying more than one handgun a month but after declaring his congressional candidacy , mr baca abstained from voting on a bill to ban cheap handguns that he had opposed , and supported a measure to require trigger locks on handguns and another regulating gun shows he said in the debate tonight that he favored good laws and good policies with respect to gun owners , and emphasized his support for the death penalty and other anticrime credentials mrs brown accused mr baca of flipflopping , and said afterward that mr baca s longstanding opposition to most gun controls was one of the defining issues of the race mrs brown has won the support of groups like emily s list , which raises money for democratic women who support abortion rights , helping her raise more than 244 , 000 through sept 8 , most of it from individuals mr baca raised nearly 120 , 000 in the same period , most of it from union political action committees none of the candidates have been able to afford television advertising this is the hardest place on earth to communicate , because of the cost of tv , said bill carrick , a democratic consultant in los angeles not involved in this race this one is being fought out in the mailboxes photo david eshleman speaks at a recent candidates' forum also seeking the democratic nomination to congress are from left , marta macias brown , bernard mcclay , joe baca , hal styles , rick simon and john ballard \( monica almeida the new york times \)
what sort of paralyzing procrastination could possibly hold a man hostage almost the entire month of december and leave him scrambling on christmas day itself in search of a present for his wife \? well , just ask carlos serafina , footdragger extraordinaire with the yuletide shopping clock far past the zero hour , mr serafina was prowling the aisles of an uptown rite aid drugstore at 9 on christmas morning , trying to make a truly lastminute choice the hamilton beach blender or the box of russell stover mints the decision \? wisely , both the giftwrap \? sadly , none look , i work six days a week morning , afternoon and night , said mr serafina , a baker at an allnight bagel shop so yes , ok , i'm a little late but after work i usually go straight home to sleep a little late \? dashing to macy s at 6 pm on christmas eve might to a friendly audience qualify as a little late but slipping out to the 24hour drugstore while your wife is still at home asleep \? that s more than a little late , it seems remarkably , though , mr serafina was not alone at what could have been the most shamefilled store in manhattan yesterday shirkers and malingerers of all types were there not to mention those poor souls who were simply caught off guard danixa perez had barely rubbed the sleep from her eyes on christmas morning when she found out that an old family friend had just arrived ahem , uninvited from new jersey ten minutes later , she and her brother joe were standing in the cosmetics aisle at the rite aid , at broadway and west 110th street , hoping to find some perfume or a tube of skin cream that their friend might like she s back at the house now helping grandma cook up christmas dinner , ms perez said , as her brother weighed the merits of a plasticwrapped loofah sponge we had to come up with some excuse so we said we were going out to get some batteries rudolf scott had no excuse , however , but his transgression was less severe on friday night , mr scott , 67 , a maintenance man , simply forgot to take the silk blouse he had bought for his wife out of the car now , mr scott stood in the cashier s line buying some wrapping paper and cellophane tape , trying to figure out how on earth he was going to outsanta santa claus i 've got to get this thing in the house any way i can , he said , his face tense with concern maybe when the grandkids come over then i 'll just smuggle it in although the length of upper broadway was silent as smoke throughout the morning a long alley of shuttered storefronts and empty sunsplashed asphalt every few minutes , it seemed , another 11thhour shopper came zipping down the sidewalk , making that painfully embarrassing turn into rite aid didi pope , 30 , a saleswoman for xerox , came to find a present for her grandmother , emma , and wound up buying several a proctorsilex coffee maker , a set of four matching 14ounce ceramic mugs and to complete the package a can of maxwell house coffee , french roast yeah , i know it s crazy , she said , but i just ran out of time time was also on carmen rivera s mind , but not the way you might think browsing through the perfume section , mrs rivera , 56 , said she had purchased all of her gifts well in advance this year she had turned up at the store on christmas day looking for something a little different good deals sometimes you find specials , certain items that were n't priced like this before , said mrs rivera s daughter , alexandra , who was considering a bottle of vanilla musk you 'd be surprised at how cheap stuff gets today for erwin frankel , however , the visit to rite aid was not about bargains it was about finally righting ancient wrongs four years ago , he promised to make a photo montage of his friend s family for hanukkah well , just yesterday he bought the disposable camera for the job you want to talk about being late \? mr frankel said , glancing at all the lesser procrastinators waiting behind him in line i'm not even buying a christmas gift for today i'm buying a hanukkah present from 1995 photos didi pope was among the afterthelastminute shoppers yesterday i just ran out of time , she said at the rite aid at broadway and 110th street , joe perez on christmas morning looked for a gift for an unexpected guest \( photographs by edward keating the new york times \)
as the united nations enters a new century of challenges , we must find new ways to defeat the ageold enemies of peace and prosperity in fulfilling this task , the secretary general is accorded a central role by the united nations charter , by history and by the trust placed in him by member states i believe , therefore , that it is important for our friends and critics alike to judge the united nations and my office with what isaiah berlin called a sense of reality by this i mean a realistic appreciation of the promise , limitations and responsibilities the organization and the officeholder face above all , this means acknowledging that the secretary general s office will have the potential to advance the interests of all states only so long as it does not appear to serve the narrow interests of any one state or group of states this is the precarious balance to which any secretary general owes his office , his strength , his effectiveness and his moral authority every secretary general before me has had to maintain this balance , through more than 50 years of geopolitical change it is sometimes tempting to give in to one s feelings of personal outrage at a specific transgression , especially when to do so would win political popularity in some quarters but that would imperil the secretary general s ability to work effectively to prevent aggression and preserve peace it is a luxury i cannot afford the integrity , impartiality and independence of the office are too important to be so easily sacrificed the end of the cold war transformed the moral promise of the role of the secretary general it allowed him to place the united nations at the service of the universal values of the charter , without the constraints of ideology or particular interests in my two years as secretary general , i have sought to pursue this role in two distinct ways first , i have sought to speak out in favor of universal human rights and in defense of the victims of aggression or abuse , wherever they may be for americans , the presidency has been seen as a bully pulpit , at least since the days of theodore roosevelt i have sought to make the office of secretary general a pulpit , too from new york to teheran to harare and to shanghai , i have sought , without attacking specific regimes or individuals , to use it as a vehicle for promoting the values of tolerance , democracy , human rights and good governance that i believe are universal second , i have used my office as a bridge between two or more parties wherever i believed an opportunity for the peaceful resolution of disputes existed to do so , i have embarked on many missions , confronting not only the doubts of others but my own as well i have at times been as skeptical of a leader s true intentions as anyone , and i have entered every war zone without any illusions about the prospects for peace or the price of misrule but i have persisted , because i must deal with the world not as i would wish it to be , but as it is i must confront it with a sense of reality about how far a leader can be pushed by peaceful means , and how long it will take to bring peace where a state of war exists does this make me , or anyone in my position , morally blind \? can a secretary general not tell good from evil , or victim from aggressor \? of course he can , and precisely for that reason he must persist , for it is ultimately the aggressor more often than the victim who will benefit from isolation and abandonment by the international community impartiality does not and must not mean neutrality in the face of evil it means strict and unbiased adherence to the principles of the charter nothing more , nothing less of the missions i embarked on last year , none was fraught with as much risk to my office and to the united nations as the one involving iraq confronted with a crisis in the relations between iraq and the security council , i went to baghdad last february seeking to break an impasse and to return the united nations special commission unscom to its vital work of disarming iraq s weapons of mass destruction briefly , but significantly , iraq returned to compliance and unscom inspectors were able to enter sites to which they had been denied access for more than seven years i say briefly because iraq subsequently decided to place new obstacles in unscom s way a flagrant , deeply troubling violation both of the memorandum of understanding that i secured with baghdad and of iraq s longstanding obligations to the security council since then , we have gone from crisis to crisis , punctuated by fleeting moments of cooperation between unscom and the government of iraq this backandforth culminated in last month s air strikes clearly , we stand at a critical juncture now between the use of force and the peaceful compliance i have always sought , between securing the disarmament of iraq and the threat it would otherwise pose to the region , between looking to a future when iraq s longsuffering people can live free and unhindered lives , and continued isolation and impoverishment for civilians who bear no responsibility for their country s calamities members of the security council are now actively engaged in seeking a way forward , a way that can restore the council s unity while maintaining the disarmament of iraq and alleviating the suffering of the iraqi people for those who still remember the days of the cold war , the unity of the council in such an important matter will be recognized as a signal accomplishment it is also what makes iraq such a priority for me as secretary general a divided council can , and has in the past , paralyzed the united nations i must and will do all in my power to avoid such a fate whatever means i have employed in my efforts in dealing with iraq , my ends have never been in question full compliance with all relevant security council resolutions the disarmament of iraq reintegrating its people into the international community securing the stability of the region , and insuring the effectiveness of the united nations as a guarantor of international peace and security by precedent , by principle , by charter and by duty , i am bound to seek these ends through peaceful diplomacy ultimately , however , the peace we seek , in iraq as everywhere , is one that reflects the lessons of our terrible century that peace is not true or lasting if bought at any cost that only peace with justice can honor the victims of war and violence that without democracy , tolerance and human rights for all , no peace is truly safe to apply those lessons wherever and whenever possible is a secretary general s highest calling and foremost duty to himself , to his office and to the united nations my great predecessor , dag hammarskjold , once said that it is a question not of a man , but of an institution it is , therefore , for the united nations itself , and the hopes and aspirations that it has embodied for more than half a century , that we must succeed illustration \( ray \)
london earlier this month , british airways reported its worst fiscal quarter in seven years the company s profit fell 84 percent in its first quarter , compared with the quarter a year earlier , as discount fares and a decline in the number of firstclass and businessclass passengers ate into results the stock has suffered too , returning a negative 76 percent over the past 12 months , closing at 415 pence on friday british airways later said it planned to remedy the problem by cutting service by 12 percent , dropping its least profitable routes and using smaller planes on routes where it had been flying with empty or deeply discounted seats it also said it would be sending pink slips to 1 , 000 employees chris avery , an airline analyst at j p morgan here , took time last week to reflect on the woes of british airways , how it plans to turn itself around and what its hardships mean for the airline industry here are excerpts from the conversation q in a nutshell , why is british airways facing problems \? and did you expect them to be so bad \? a the industry has been heading for a profit problem ever since the asian crisis began to break what we are now seeing is the practical effects of that excess capacity showing through in all of the european carriers' profitability and ba is suffering in its reported earnings slightly more than its european competitors because it has the added problem of sterling s strength which means it is no longer competitive with northern europe it is like delta not being able to collect traffic from the midwest it is taking away a part of its feed , a part of its heartland q do you expect the slowdown to continue \? a i think the overcapacity on the atlantic , which is the crux of the industry s problem , is reaching a peak three major european carriers have cut back on their capacity plans ba , swissair and klm however , there are still carriers putting excess capacity growth into the atlantic market until that starts to go down , the industry is going to continue to be soggy for profitability q how does the british airways plan address those problems \? a they sat back and had a long , hard strategic think about what they wanted to do in this industry nobody else has ever done that they decided that they could not keep on selling tickets at below the fully allocated cost per seat which everyone else is doing at the moment at the back of the bus so they asked why do we even offer that capacity \? if we offered smaller airplanes we would not need to fill the really cheap transatlantic round trips just to fill the plane if you can fill your seat at halffull price then you do n't need to go to 80 percent off full price that is essentially the game ba is playing by restricting its own capacity so it does n't need to join in the bargaining for the last few passengers where the prices really go down to the very , very low levels below the fully allocated cost it is extremely brave no other airline has ever had such a fundamental repositioning and reevaluation of what it wants to be the downside is that there will be a lot of unhappy people who wanted to fly at cheap fares q do you expect other european carriers to follow suit and cut capacity \? a it is so unusual none of the airlines have ever done this before and all of the major airlines are clearly saying , well , that wo n't work , will it \? and the lowcost airlines are holding their hands out saying , this is great this is like christmas , because they have a cost base that can cope with low fares q so british airways is trying to hold on to the highestpaying passengers from which it gets the most revenue yield in industry parlance while cutting costs will it work \? a it is brave i think in the long run it will work it s not without risk the biggest risk is that continued excess capacity from other carriers results in further deepening discounts in the business cabin such that ba does n't hold its price this requires ba to keep its yield in the premium cabins ba has held on to yield and let market share fall q how do you think this will affect the company s stock price \? a i'm very interested in the airline at this price the share price has halved and earnings estimates have gone down but ba was hit hardest for the longest period and yet it is the one that looks most interesting q when do you expect to see a rebound \? a gains will begin to show in next year s results as soon as they start dropping even a few aircraft worth of the really low fares you will start to see an improvement in the airline s overall yield the financial community will be looking for the yield to increase at some point that will be the proof that the strategy is working photo chris avery
the game behind the game goes on this week simultaneously with the game itself the yankees defeated the atlanta braves , 65 in 10 innings , in the third game of the world series last night , but three coaches on the two teams had other action going don baylor , the braves' hitting coach , has been no 1 on the mostwanted list of teams seeking a new manager willie randolph , the yankees' thirdbase coach , interviewed with the milwaukee brewers yesterday for their managing vacancy before he went to yankee stadium for the game at hand chris chambliss , randolph s colleague on the yankees' staff , is scheduled to meet with brewers officials today he was interviewed for the cleveland indians' job last saturday baylor s name has been linked most prominently with the chicago cubs an announcement of his appointment appeared on the cubs' web site last weekend , but club officials labeled it erroneous and premature yet a general manager of another club said yesterday that it was a done deal , that the cubs had offered the job and baylor accepted baylor denied that by now familiar report once again baylor , manager of the colorado rockies for their first six years before he was fired a year ago an act the owner recently acknowledged was a mistake has also been pursued by the brewers and the anaheim angels the brewers want him so badly they would probably hand him a blank contract and tell him to fill in the blanks , if only they could get close enough to put the contract in his hands the pay for managers , at least the most desirable managerial candidates , has risen dramatically in recent weeks the brewers fired phil garner as their manager , and the detroit tigers hired him , doubling his salary from 600 , 000 to 12 million a year everybody should be fired with that prospect awaiting them chambliss has not created that kind of demand he has interviewed for many jobs he said that last winter was the first in seven or eight years he had not had an interview but he remains a coach at least for now in a somewhat bizarre twist , newspaper articles have recently suggested that he may be fired as the yankees' hitting coach chambliss said he was aware of such talk as far as i'm concerned , as always with the yankees , i'm working right now , he said whatever happens next year is going to be determined by joe torre and brian cashman and , of course , george steinbrenner i have n't heard any word of what i 've read i'm not going to worry about it during his reign as the yankees' owner , steinbrenner has been notorious for firing hitting coaches and pitching coaches he has made those moves , though , either when the hitters were not hitting or the pitchers were pitching poorly , or when he wanted to get at the manager but stop short of firing him art fowler , for example , was billy martin s good friend and drinking buddy as well as his pitching coach , and steinbrenner often threatened to fire him and did actually fire him once but steinbrenner has no apparent reason to get at torre , and the hitters have hit well enough in chambliss s four years as hitting coach to have the yankees closing in on their third world series championship in that period only speculative reasons exist for steinbrenner s possibly wanting to dismiss chambliss the best is that the yankees may want to bring back don mattingly as a coach , and hitting would be the job they would want to give him another theory had some of the yankees' hitters upset because when they have wanted to take extra hitting , chambliss has not always scheduled it chambliss said he had no idea where that idea would come from extra hitting has always been available here , he said they can hit all they want that s a complete lie extra hitting is available every day for the players they 've always been afforded the chance to hit extra that s completely untrue we hit extra on the road , we hit extra at home , we hit in the cage i 've never said no to anybody has he ever had problems with players \? quite the opposite , chambliss said i 've had a very good relationship with everybody if there are any problems , they have n't been brought to me joe torre s with me every day whenever there s something joe does n't like or sees , he usually tells me none of that has happened i feel good about what i 've done here unlike randolph , chambliss has managerial experience he managed for four seasons in the braves' minor league system , from 1989 through 1992 chambliss has since been a major league coach i 've never lost hope , he said of his efforts to get a major league manager s job i feel confident that someday i might get a chance to manage if i do n't , i do n't until then , i will continue to accept the interviews and keep striving to better my position in the game chambliss was asked about the managers who keep getting jobs even after they are fired elsewhere it does n't get to me , he said it s unfortunate sometimes i learned a long time ago not to worry about things like that , things i ca n't control what i can control is myself and what i can do i feel like i can manage , i have managed and if i do n't get a chance to manage , it wo n't be because i did n't try that s where i'm going to leave that i feel good about my career i would n't change anything that s happened i'm with the best team in baseball as a coach i would n't trade what s happened i'm just going to take it a year at a time if i become a manager , then i 'll become a manager if i do n't , i wo n't
the special twocar excursion train chugged cautiously along rusty tracks into sleepy cooperstown , ny it had been 18 vexing miles from colliersville , a dicey journey across a railroad spur virtually unexplored since the turn of the century but this was no ordinary passenger train and its riders no ordinary travelers and after that day , june 12 , 1939 , cooperstown would never again be an ordinary upstate new york farm town stepping off the train just inside the village that morning were babe ruth , connie mack , walter johnson , cy young , honus wagner , tris speaker , eddie collins , napoleon lajoie , george sisler and grover cleveland alexander ty cobb would arrive later so would 32 major leaguers to play an exhibition game sixty years ago tomorrow , the national baseball hall of fame staged its first induction ceremony , an event that has become a standby of the american summer they came that day in 1939 , 11 honorees and nine eventual hall of famers still in their primes , to celebrate something unprecedented a sports hall of fame how they spent that day is a story of a different america and its pastime ruth , for example , arrived in the village needing a shave he marched up main street in a tan doublebreasted suit and buck wing shoes with a retinue of children following at a respectful distance at the lone main street barber shop , the line was long for the three chairs inside ruth waited at the back of the line cobb , meanwhile , came into town in a mad dash , like a man trying to steal second base , gatecrashing the ceremony by climbing over a railing and jumping down onto the makeshift dance band stage mack , born during the civil war , stood throughout the proceedings as resolute as the high , whitestarched collar he wore beneath his threepiece blue suit the concept of a baseball hall of fame had been created three years earlier but the museum was built to open in 1939 so that baseball could mark the 100th anniversary of the game s founding a recent special commission verified the allegorical tale that placed abner doubleday in a cooperstown cow pasture laying out the ground rules for the game in 1839 and even if subsequent research has proved those findings specious at best , 60 years ago it went largely unquestioned each of the country s major league ball parks closed for the day and nbc radio broadcast the festivities nationally it was 22 days before lou gehrig had his famous day at yankee stadium , 80 days before nazi troops would storm poland , and 186 days before gone with the wind had its atlanta opening fifteen thousand people choked cooperstown s main street i took a lot of pictures because none of us could believe this was happening in our town , said homer osterhoudt , who as the 21yearold son of a local farmer worked on the construction of the threestory brick museum mixing mortar for the threestory colonial edifice catherine walker , a lifelong cooperstown resident who has worked as an attendant at the hall of fame for the last nine years , remembers sitting on her father s shoulders as an 8yearold i was watching babe ruth walk up main street heading for the barber shop , walker said at the hall of fame this week my eyes were as wide as saucers howard talbot would become the hall of fame s director for 25 years , but in 1939 he was a 14yearold escorted to cooperstown by his father from his nearby home it was a pretty big day for a little burg like cooperstown , talbot said you have to remember there was no tv it s safe to say that at least 90 percent of the people there that day had never seen a major league game played i know i had n't if today s baseball hall of fame induction ceremonies are highly orchestrated affairs , painstakingly planned to weigh security and a crush of spectators , the first induction ceremony was folksy , uncomplicated and homespun there was a camaraderie even wagner and cobb , once bitter rivals , avoided another conflict by avoiding each other cobb , ever the competitor and aware that ruth had seriously taken up golf since his baseball retirement four years earlier , left this note in ruth s shoe after ruth had changed to participate in the exhibition game i can beat you any day in the week and twice on sunday at the scottish game unlike today , when induction ceremony speeches can be emotional or caustic and almost always lengthy , the speeches delivered by those honored in 1939 were exceedingly brief mack spoke first and thanked baseball officials , writers and cooperstown , among others speaker followed mack to the microphone and essentially said connie mack said it all thank you when the ceremony ended , the new hall of famers and the players who came to cooperstown for the exhibition game two from each of the 16 major league teams marched in a parade up main street to doubleday field , the mythical home of baseball s first game there , wagner and collins chose sides and soon mel ott was playing catch with charlie gehringer dizzy dean and lefty grove were tossing the baseball back and forth wagner s team beat collins s team , 42 a highlight was a pinchhit appearance by ruth , who delighted the crowd with mighty swings , even if the last one was a foul popout cobb went on the radio broadcast with mel allen during the game to explain that he was late for the ceremony because he was looking for a hotel room the inductees , after all , were paying their own expenses at the stately otesaga hotel after the game , 14yearold fred st john watched as ruth puffed on a cigar at the hotel entrance the maitre d' called the babe and others in for supper and i asked babe if i could take his picture , st john said he was all alone and i'm trying to line up the photograph he said 'wait a minute you 've got your finger on the lens' he got me lined up right and i took the picture he said , 'there , i do n't want anybody to take a bad picture of me' the photo is in the hall of fame the next day , the train that rumbled into cooperstown with guests of honor left with the same passengers i never thought it was something that would become a yearly thing , recognized around the world , said talbot , who along with the others who witnessed the first induction will participate in a 60thanniversary celebration tomorrow i just thought it was a nice day for cooperstown instead , it became the first day that cooperstown became a word for baseball immortality photos the first baseball hall of fame induction ceremony in 1939 was folksy , uncomplicated and homespun \( baseball hall of fame library \) the

huntington beach , calif beachgoers who become thirsty while strolling on this surfing town s pier had better like coke every vending machine on and around the pier offers only cocacola beverages the selection is just as limited in the city s parks and civic center as on all municipal property here , there is little evidence that pepsi , coke s main competitor , even exists in an effort to raise money , huntington beach in february sold cocacola exclusive rights to soft drink sales on its property for nearly 6 million in cash and services the next 10 years that goes a long way in putting grass in the soccer fields for kids and repainting city hall , said donald r schulte , president of the public enterprise group , a consulting company that helped huntington beach negotiate its soft drink deal none of it would come from taxpayers nearly a dozen cities across the nation have since approved similar contracts with softdrink companies the largest to do so is san diego , where the city council voted in november to make pepsi its official softdrink in exchange for at least 67 million the next 12 years softdrink companies believe that buying rights to city property is good business for several reasons in addition to eliminating competition , they hope the access will allow them to build customer loyalty and create a sense of goodwill in the community officials in huntington beach , a middleclass city of 200 , 000 in the los angeles suburbs , chose to solicit a softdrink contract in an effort to increase revenue and make park improvements a city consultant , who has experience selling sporting event sponsorships , approached the major softdrink companies with the idea both pepsicola and the cocacola bottling company of southern california submitted proposals the city council eventually approved cocacola s proposal , which offered 300 , 000 a year in cash and 300 , 000 a year for inkind maintenance in exchange for the money , cocacola got exclusive access to sell its soft drinks , bottled water and juices on three miles of city beach , 60 parks and handful of city buildings the company can install up to 180 vending machines on city property and use huntington beach s surf city logo in its advertising peter green , the mayor , who prefers to drink tea rather than softdrinks , applauds the deal for helping to balance the city s budget fears that cocacola would flood the city with unattractive advertising have proved to be unfounded , he said in fact , he added , the agreement prohibits such practices it s not like we now have cocacola pier , mayor green said it has n't been intrusive at all in fact , i have n't noticed at all cities are not the first government entities to negotiate softdrink rights school districts , for example , have been selling softdrink companies exclusive access to school property for at least the last few years but bundling all of a city s municipal property for such a contract is a relatively new phenomenon negotiating a deal for a large territory is more practical for a softdrink company than doing business parkbypark , the softdrink companies said the marriage of big business and government worries some consumer advocates they complain that sponsorship deals subvert government oversight of corporations that contribute money to the community s budget it s not just the pragmatic problem of a municipality pushing a brand that overcaffeinates and oversugars children , said jamie court , advocacy director for the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica , calif it s also the symbol that government can be bought for a small pittance and branded with a cola company s emblem sanctioning a company also raises fears of price gouging mr court said that eliminating competition on city property could allow softdrink companies to raise prices whether prices in huntington beach have increased since cocacola eliminated its competition is unclear for a 20ounce coke , the company charges 150 at the beach and 1 at city hall bob phillips , spokesman for cocacola bottling of southern california , based in los angeles , said the company always charges fair prices with or without competition and does not have exclusive access to the handful of restaurants on city property people have to remember that city property is only a very small portion of the total land mass of any municipality , mr phillips said yes , at this park , there may only be a machine that carries our products but you can walk across the street and buy pepsi from someone else how much extra revenue is flowing to cocacola because of the deal is unknown the company s vending machines at the pier did not muster a single sale over an hour on a recent cool friday afternoon , but they will almost certainly attract more business during the summer when the beach is blanketed with thousands of people cities with outdoor activities are particularly attractive targets for softdrink companies looking for an exclusive contract , said david dececco , spokesman for pepsicola , a unit of pepsico , based in purchase , ny residents in such places are more likely to visit a park and work up a thirst , he said i do n't know if we would get as much out of a city in saskatchewan as in southern california , mr dececco added that is not to say that northern cities have no chance to enlist in the soft drink wars pepsicola sponsors amherst , ny , and lynn , mass , while coke is the official softdrink of east lansing , mich some cities , like san francisco , are philosophically opposed to the notion of exclusive softdrink contracts san franciscans tend to be very independentminded and promoters of small business , said kandance bender , spokeswoman for mayor willie l brown i ca n't imagine that this would be something that san francisco would do mr schulte , huntington beach s consultant , said that the city may enter into other corporate deals worth millions of dollars a year one idea is to sell the exclusive right to install automated teller machines on municipal property for the most part , residents and visitors were unaware or did not care about the city s contract with cocacola james gonzales , a college student who was carrying his surfboard past the vending machines at the pier simply shrugged his shoulders when told about the deal and said coke or pepsi , what s the difference \?
washington , jan 15 the republican prosecutors asserted today that monica s lewinsky s grand jury testimony was far more credible than president clinton s , and one of them told senators sitting in judgment in the impeachment trial that it s the president who is not telling the truth if you believe the testimony of monica lewinsky , you cannot believe the president or accept the argument of his lawyers , said representative bill mccollum of florida , opening the second of three days of arguments by house managers the senate must decide which to believe , he said , adding , if you have any significant doubt about monica lewinsky s credibility or testimony , you should have us bring her in here and let us examine her face to face as it had on thursday , the question of calling witnesses , with most republicans in favor and most democrats opposed , wound its way through the day s proceedings like a wagnerian leitmotif the issue will not be decided until the week after next , but several republican senators who said they had doubted the wisdom of witnesses said they were changing their minds mr mccollum , the main republican speaker today , delved into sexually explicit material to support his contentions , something no one had done previously during the trial he cited sworn testimony by mr clinton to the effect that he had never kissed or fondled her breasts or touched her genitalia , and sworn testimony by ms lewinsky that he had done so repeatedly , as well as corroboration by friends who said she told them at the time excerpts , pages a1214 referring to ms lewinsky , the lawyer vernon e jordan jr and others , mr mccollum said , time and again , the president says one thing and they say something entirely different the florida lawmaker s approach dramatized one of the dilemmas that republicans face some of their strongest evidence in support of the perjury article involves precisely the sort of material that caused much of the public to sour on the presentation of the special prosecutor , kenneth w starr , and the proceedings of the house judiciary committee without going into it , and not questioning witnesses whose testimony conflicts , their case is weakened going into it with live witnesses runs the risk of alienating voters further with a spectacle reminiscent of the clarence thomas confirmation hearings representative bob barr of georgia , who filed the first impeachment resolution over campaign financing in the house in november 1997 , concluded for the republicans with typically vivid language that produced a chilling moment of television as he urged the senate to strike down these insidious cancers that eat at the heart of our system of government , cnn showed mr clinton , returning from a trip to new york , stepping from his helicopter and calling to his dog , buddy mr barr also prompted the first brief clash of the trial several times , he referred to the senators as jurors , which prompted senator tom harkin , democrat of iowa , to rise to his feet and insist that the senate was sitting as a court , not as a jury until then , the senators had sat mute , except for the majority leader , trent lott of mississippi , who had spoken exclusively about housekeeping details chief justice william h rehnquist , issuing his first ruling from the chair , said that mr harkin s objection is welltaken the seemingly petty intervention had a large political point , democratic senators said mr harkin , who has backed mr clinton as fiercely as mr barr has attacked him , told colleagues he was worried that the word jurors would lead the public to conclude that the senate s job was merely to find mr clinton guilty or not guilty , whereas in his view they also needed to decide whether the president s crimes , if any , constituted impeachable offenses , and whether removing mr clinton from office would serve the national interest mr mccollum , a mildlooking man who wears aviator glasses , is known in the house as a detail man of unflagging persistence those qualities were on display today as he extensively examined ms lewinsky s aug 6 , 1998 , grand jury testimony , now one of the most familiar items in the case it was then that she said , as the white house never tires of pointing out , no one asked or encouraged me to lie she was testifying about a latenight telephone conversation with mr clinton on dec 17 , 1997 mr mccollum made two points one , that the entire sentence at issue was , no one asked or encouraged me to lie , but no one discouraged me , either two , that ms lewinsky later said , i knew what he meant pressed , she added that she knew that as we had on every other occasion and every other instance of this relationship , we would deny it mr mccollum then asked can there be any doubt that the president was suggesting that she file an affidavit that contains lies and falsehoods \? much of what the republicans presented ended with rhetorical questions like that much else involved phrases like not plausible , not reasonable , logical common sense says no , you may infer , and so on mr barr , a former cia analyst and former prosecutor , was at pains to insist , perhaps because of this , that circumstantial evidence was not to be denigrated , no matter what commentators or the president s lawyers might say
washington , may 10 in confusing the chinese embassy in belgrade for a yugoslav arms agency , the central intelligence agency relied on educated guesses rather than on firsthand information , government officials said today defense secretary william s cohen attributed the bombing to institutional error and announced corrective measures he said he hoped that such steps would shore up the procedures used to identify targets and prevent incidents like the bombing of the embassy on friday , which killed 3 people and wounded 20 among the measures he outlined were improved procedures for gathering information about targets , including new methods to update maps instead of sometimes identifying targets only through secondhand information , intelligence analysts will be required to try to verify possible targets with people who are familiar with specific areas of a city the secretary also said two pentagon agencies would quickly set up new procedures to update critical databases on buildings that must not be hit , like embassies , mosques , churches , schools and hospitals this is important because the geographic coordinates of targets are checked against the databases to try to avoid civilian casualties in the case of the chinese embassy , the pentagon map was drawn in 1992 , updated in 1997 and reviewed last year , but it still did not include the current site of the embassy and left the building there unmarked , officials said the new embassy was built in 1996 the maps still had the embassy in its former location , american officials said today none of those maps indicated that it was the chinese embassy that was being targeted , mr cohen said after briefing president clinton it was not a human error or mechanical error it was an institutional error the intended target , the headquarters of a yugoslav arms agency , is about 200 yards south of the embassy as part of the new review , all addresses for all embassies are being checked , intelligence officials said from now on , mr cohen said , the state department will tell intelligence agencies when foreign embassies move or when new ones are built but senior intelligence officials said that in the rush of war , they could not guarantee such an accident would not occur again this target was vetted and worked against the databases , a senior intelligence official said , but there is always a compromise between time and speed , and how far you want to check one more map , one more source , and things like that intelligence officials said it is impossible to develop a failsafe system , especially because analysts are being stretched thin by demands to review targets in potential hot spots from the balkans and persian gulf to north korea a worldwide database , even a database for a city the size of belgrade or a country the size of yugoslavia , is a daunting challenge to maintain , current and accurate , the intelligence official said we can only do the best we can and we ca n't , you know , guarantee that something like this will not happen again indeed , the pentagon agency that drew up the map of belgrade , the national imagery and mapping agency , is the same one that prepared the maps for the marine corps jet that struck a skilift cable last year near aviano , italy defense lawyers contended that the crew was not to blame because the cable did not appear on the pentagon map if failing to locate the chinese embassy was the first mistake , misidentifying the intended target , the yugoslav federal directorate of supply and procurement , was the second intelligence officials said today that they had determined the street address of the arms headquarters , no 2 boulevard of the arts , and then sought to match it on the outofdate maps using the addresses of other sites in the same area but the target was put on nato s bombing list after the air war began on march 24 , after which the united states embassy in belgrade closed , so no american official on the ground could verify the site an american official said no one considered using a yugoslav to check , and no one considered checking the planned targets with the american officials who had just left the city so in essence , officials said today , it was bombing by deduction because this extrapolation process is less than precise , that s why you have a system that has multiple checks , both within the cia , within the intelligence community and within the department of defense , a senior intelligence official said but after the backup systems failed in this case , one intelligence official acknowledged that from now on there will be an ironclad requirement to review targets with people who have with firsthand knowledge that step may help solve the problem of identifying buildings on the ground but on airborne reconnaissance photographs used to derive the geographic coordinates that were plugged into satellite guidance systems for the bombs , officials said today , there were similarities between the embassy and the arms agency for that reason , intelligence experts said , a decision made in 1996 may have contributed to the problem of interpreting such photographs the cia photographic intelligence center , which analyzes reconnaissance photographs , was folded into the pentagon s mapping agency , prompting many of the government s most experienced photographic analysts to leave
in bridge , the triple crown belongs to a player who has won the world team olympiad , the bermuda bowl and the world pairs one of the six living owners of that title is jeff meckstroth of tampa , fla , who specializes in making impossible contracts playing earlier this month in the cavendish pairs in las vegas , he found himself as south in three hearts he knew that west held diamond length and a fourcard spade suit , and that east held club length west led the ace and another heart , removing the chance that south would ruff two spades in dummy south won the second trick with the heart king and led a club , hoping that the defense would be unable to play a third trump luckily for him , west had to win with the king the spade queen was led , and after winning with dummy s ace , south led the club queen , ruffing out the ace the position was now this diagram if you were meckstroth , how would you set about making six more tricks \? it is easy to make five , with a spade trick , a diamond , a club and a trump in each hand but where is the sixth trick \? he found an exotic solution reading the position exactly and analyzing brilliantly , he led the spade ten he expected west to win and return a spade then his plan was to throw a diamond from dummy and win with the king there would follow the diamond ace , a diamond ruff and a club ruff a trump lead would endplay east , with dummy scoring two club tricks at the finish the club nine would be the elusive sixth trick none of this happened because west mysteriously played low when the spade ten was led so that card became the extra trick that meckstroth needed diagram
united nations , jan 26 president saddam hussein , who barred the return of arms inspectors to iraq after american and british air strikes in december , is still actively trying to conceal past and present illegal weapons programs , the chief inspector told the security council in a report this week the report says that iraq s deputy prime minister , tariq aziz , is among a handful of officials close to mr hussein who devised and still run the concealment effort he is mr hussein s chief liaison with the outside world the report , possibly the last to be submitted by the united nations special commission , known as unscom , the body specially created to disarm iraq , says for the first time that credible information on iraqi concealment efforts continues to be supplied to the inspectors by iraqis outside the country and by others who have dealt with mr hussein over the years it has created new tensions in the security council between the united states and russia , which wants to lift sanctions on iraq russia , which now refuses to recognize unscom and is demanding the dismissal of its executive chairman , richard butler , has effectively suppressed the publication or distribution of the 262page report , even within the united nations system copies of it were made available by diplomats and officials eager to see its conclusions made public before a debate on iraq resumes on wednesday the security council is now facing a decision , largely forced by russia and france , over whether to declare the active disarmament phase over in iraq , a necessary step to lifting the oil embargo , which was instituted after iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 the report , however , recommends that if intrusive inspections are to end or be scaled back , any monitoring system that takes their place will require a doubling of the inspection budget and considerably enhanced access to hundreds of sites around iraq the report documents that iraq has never really intended to cooperate with the un despite a history of agreements to do so , said peter burleigh , the american representative on the council he said in an interview that the report reflects the consistent pattern of concealment as well as confirms that there are many basic unanswered questions with regard to the disarmament of iraq in all weapons of mass destruction areas iraq insists that it has met all disarmament requirements and poses no danger to its neighbors the report attempts to catalogue exhaustively why inspectors do not accept that assurance we continue to receive reports from iraqis outside iraq diametrically opposed to what iraq is telling us , said charles duelfer , deputy executive chairman of the commission are we supposed to ignore them \? half a dozen proposals are now on the table for discussion when debate resumes a number of council members appear prepared to strip the special commission of its autonomy and make it part of the united nations secretariat the comprehensive report is largely a summary of what is already known about iraqi programs , and as such serves as a handbook for council members who argue that it would be dangerous to reward president hussein for his defiance it surveys at considerable length the area of biological weapons and iraq s potential ability to deploy or use them more concerns surround the biological program than any other in recent days , the international atomic energy agency , a united nations agency that has been monitoring iraq for nuclear activity while the commission watched biological , chemical and missile programs , has waded into the debate with an unofficial report by the agency s director , mohamed elbaradei , that criticized the commission as being too insensitive and adversarial needless confrontation can only detract from the efficiency of the verification process , the paper said it described the best kind of inspectors as international career civil servants who have loyalty to the verification organization some diplomats see this as support by the iaea for demands that the special commission , a body of independent experts loaned by national governments , be folded into the united nations bureaucracy the iaea has had disagreements with the special commission david albright , president of the independent institute for science and international security in washington , said that while there may a need for a shakeup of both the special commission and the iaea , which has its own independent action team working on iraq , you do n't want a culture that would rather avoid confrontation than face it head on when dealing with a leader like mr hussein france s representative on the council , alain dejammet , who has also called for lifting the oil embargo but retaining financial and disarmament restrictions on iraq , has told reporters in recent days that a standoff in the council helps no one but mr hussein no inspections have taken place in iraq since early december , and the program will remain frozen until there is a compromise

washington , aug 11 faced with lawsuits charging racial bias in body searches , the customs service today announced changes intended to revamp how the agency examines thousands of people suspected of smuggling drugs into the united states raymond w kelly , the customs service commissioner , told reporters that the agency had decided to scrap its confusing and contradictory guidelines that allowed inspectors wide latitude to search almost anyone , including people who seemed nervous or too calm , wore sun glasses or loosefitting clothing in their place , the agency is instituting a system based on criteria that focus on a behavior and such factors as whether a suspect has given inconsistent answers to an inspector s questions , is the subject of an intelligence report or has been detected by a drugsniffing dog personal searches are used to detect drug swallowers who ingest drugs or those who hide drugs in their clothing or body cavities last year , more than 50 , 000 people , of more than 715 million air passengers who passed through customs from overseas flights , were subjected to some form of search on arrival in the united states most of those searched were only patteddown , but about 2 , 000 people were subjected to more intrusive body searches , including xray inspections , monitored bowel movements or examinations of body cavities a classaction lawsuit filed in chicago by about 90 black women who had been subjected to body searches said customs inspectors arbitrarily subjected black women to intrusive and humiliating physical searches but found drugs in less than a quarter of the searches other lawsuits have been filed against the agency s practice but none are classaction suits mr kelly said the agency had never had a policy of singling out blacks or other minority members for searches it s not part of our policy , he said we want to make certain that is not part of our practices to protect the rights of passengers suspected of carrying drugs , mr kelly said that beginning on oct 1 , the agency would notify a federal magistrate anytime a passenger arriving at an airport from overseas is held for more than four hours suspects have been held for far longer periods without judicial notification the customs service , which acknowledges that its own recordkeeping was sloppy , will begin collecting centralized data that will help agency managers determine the success rate of searches and whether specific groups seem to be unfairly singled out for examinations critics of the searches said the changes were a positive but timid first step and that much more needed to be done edward m fox , a lawyer who represents the 90 black women who were subjected to searches after they landed at o'hare international airport in chicago , said , it s a good start but they will need to go much further for example , mr fox said , most searches , including what he said were abusive body examinations , were conducted within the fourhour period set by customs for asking a federal magistrate to rule on whether there are reasonable grounds to hold a passenger for a personal search as a result , he said , the decision to seek a magistrate s approval was window dressing the changes , some of which have already been put into effect , are intended to increase managerial control over the system , improve its efficiency and eliminate the number of searches that turn up nothing and reduce the perception that the search process is arbitrary , unfair and racially biased
at the shootaround in the garden on friday afternoon , the talk was not about contracts or labor unrest or sneaker endorsements , but about the return of the garden s greatest player stephon marbury god gave him something no one else got , said derek wooten , as he tied his defender in a knot with a crossover dribble he s going to tear it up , show the world what coney island s all about , said jay wright , pulling down a rebound the names wooten and wright do n't appear on the game roster of the knicks or the st john s red storm , or any other team for that matter this court was not at madison square garden , but the other garden , the one on a windswept patch of blacktop between surf and mermaid avenues in the coney island section of brooklyn , where the name marbury is synonymous with basketball glory when marbury , the star point guard with the minnesota timberwolves , was traded to the new jersey nets on thursday , the news reverberated across the basketball world , but it had special meaning in the coney island projects , where marbury grew up and honed the skills that will earn him nearly 71 million over the next six years at the real garden , where marbury now lights up the scoreboard and makes nolook assists when his team passes through , he has friends who drive imported cars and wear fur coats but in the garden of marbury s youth , the old friends barely have enough money to catch the subway out to herald square i ai n't got jack , said horace bowe , 24 , fidgeting with two rumpled dollar bills but i love the man , do n't resent him a bit marbury , 22 , is coming back a winner , a man who got out and made it back to his own turf on his own terms these halfdozen men are happy for their friend , who still returns to the neighborhood , in a black limousine , just to get a haircut but marbury s homecoming , they said , is also a bittersweet reminder of their own struggles to get out , of being stuck , of what could have been , of dreams left on the court you know why they call this place the garden , do n't you \? mr bowe asked no one in particular because none of us here ever thought we was going to make it to the primetime garden every man has a dream , mr bowe said it s just that in his neighborhood , some people lose sight of the prize as teenagers they dream of bigdollar sports contracts school , of course , is never a thought for mr bowe , the dream is becoming the heavyweight champion of the world his uncle , riddick bowe , is a former champion , and the younger bowe hopes that his uncle s skills , and success , are embedded somewhere in the family s genetic code but with a swollen lip and gnarled fists , and an 112 professional record , the closest he may ever get to a championship bout in madison square garden is on payperview , where he planned to watch last night s fight between evander holyfield and lennox lewis it takes a lot to get out of this neighborhood , said mr wooten , 24 , a short , stocky man who shot ball as his two young sons looked on mr wooten played basketball at abraham lincoln high school and was cut the same year that marbury joined the team , which won the public schools athletic league and new york state titles in 1995 that same year , mr wooten dropped out of school but with his old friend returning to town , those old dreams resurfaced in the cold afternoon me \?

the hospital seemed to her to be full of mystery and concentrated energy at dawn , there was already a surge of sounds doctors' names crackled over the loudspeakers , were repeated , then repeated again nurses glided down the hallways , their crepesoled shoes squeaking , attaching intravenous drips and taking care of little things a pushy patient bleated for his breakfast another , presumably void of hope , chanted , die , why do n't i just die \? the sterile scent of recently cleaned linoleum filling the air , a dull roar of the unknown resounded inside her head she glanced up at the clock 7 o'clock her name was dr jennifer james she was an intern beginning three years of postgraduate training in the medicine department at st luke sroosevelt hospital center in new york and she had no idea what she should be doing it was a doctor s first day on the job observing pensive nurses drawing blood to the insistent cheep of the monitoring machines , she stood rigid and said in her succinct way i'm really nervous right now i do n't know who s nice and who s not , and i do n't want to get yelled at it seems people are either for you or against you there s no middle ground she greeted an intern who had had the sorry distinction of being on call the day before , even though her internship had not officially begun whorls of dark hair looped over her face her eyes bugged out how was it \? dr james asked horrible , she moaned stayed up all night i'm wrecked yesterday i learned how to set a ventilator for the first time , dr james volunteered if you set it wrong , the patient dies i asked a lot of questions in medicine s impenetrable parlance , dr james was a pgy1 \( postgraduate year 1 \) in a groundfloor conference room , similarly fraught with anxiety , edward lathan was being lectured on the mechanics of emergency medicine on the 12th floor , bryan holland was getting started in pediatrics , in that department s intensive care unit , tending to babies too tiny to be imagined on this first day of july 1998 , they were 3 of 95 incoming interns , fanned out into 16 departments , from surgery to otolaryngology , young men and women entering medicine at a singularly baffling time an era of cost contraction that seemed to argue against learning , that insisted on increased speed and diminished resources and raised the very question of what it meant to be a doctor in this country today everything seemed to be on fast forward compulsively , constantly , dr james and her classmates worried about a barrage of things , but not much about the press of commerce and the managedcare revolution right now , she said , i'm just thinking about how to survive the year it was the small details in this bestirring world that gnawed at her where were the bathrooms \? did you ever get to eat \? could you use the nurses' microwave \? and there was a disconcerting habit from medical school she sometimes fainted she had low blood pressure she passed out after delivering her first baby she hit the floor when she saw a baby s hernia being repaired , crumpled during several other operations now she made sure she ate regularly she drank gatorade she wore support stockings to keep the blood running up her legs she was a doctor and a doctor was definitely not supposed to faint above all else , she did not want her first patient to die no freshly minted medical school graduate wished to begin her metamorphosis from student to doctor writing a death certificate on her first official patient yet it could happen all too easily in hospitals now , you saw largely the sickest of the sick to get admitted , a patient practically had to be pounding on heaven s door and so here was this woman , 83 years old and assailed by congestive heart failure , lying in the intensive care unit , her sagging spirits visible in her eyes her patient ! she edged closer to the rack of charts , plucked some out and scanned the wellthumbed pages of scribblings , finding ways to keep busy until someone told her what to do nurses bustled by , acting as if she were invisible so many of dr james s firstday apprehensions were the worries of interns from time immemorial , but she , dr lathan and dr holland actually represented a new generation of interns , one molded in the shifting world of managed health care they came to medicine with a mix of idealism and subdued ambition in terms of power , image and income not surprisingly , all three had chosen primary care , since that was where the jobs were for them , medicine was a career and not a sacramental commitment they felt entitled to a life beyond the stethoscope given these muted expectations , they were not especially cynical about the many fundamental changes in medicine they did not mourn a gold rush they had never put a pan to managed care \? they had read the headlines and , from their medical school experience , they frowned on certain jarring extremes after all of the schooling , we 've learned to do the best for the patient , so i do n't think it s appropriate for someone who only has a high school degree to tell you not to do an mri , dr james said
washington , july 22 the director of central intelligence disclosed today that the agency had selected just one target in the 11week air war over yugoslavia , and its decision led to the accidental bombing of the chinese embassy in may it was the only target we nominated , the director , george j tenet , said at a rare public hearing of the house intelligence committee after the strike on may 7 , which killed three chinese and wounded at least 20 others , the cia decided that it should go back to its usual business of spying , an american official said today reeling from its error , the agency almost immediately suspended other preparations it was making to forward additional targets to help nato mr tenet also acknowledged publicly that the cia had employees and maps that could have told military planners the correct location of the embassy but they were not consulted , he said while mr tenet and the deputy secretary of defense , john j hamre , recapped a nowfamiliar litany of bureaucratic errors that the administration says caused the accident including outdated maps , faulty computer databases and a lack of safeguards it was the director s remarks on the agency s selection of targets that offered new insights into an accident that has dealt a stinging setback to relations with china from battle tanks to electrical power plants , deciding what to hit in the air war was left largely to military experts in washington and europe but as the air campaign failed to achieve quick success and dragged on longer than expected , the pentagon feared that it would run out of topnotch targets and sought suggestions from the cia we were very much looking for additional targets , mr hamre said at the cia , analysts had long suspected that the headquarters of a yugoslav arms agency was financing the yugoslav military by selling advanced technology to rogue nations , and jumped at the chance to destroy a stubborn nemesis this episode is unusual because the cia does not normally assemble , on its own , target nomination packages containing the coordinates of specific installations or buildings , mr tenet said the inexperience was clear from the start the cia team used a flawed technique for locating the arms agency headquarters , mr tenet said it had the correct street address for the arms agency , no 2 bulevar umetnosti but to pinpoint that location , the analysts used a technique of comparing the number sequence on parallel streets mr tenet said this practice offered only an approximate location and was inappropriate for selecting aerial targets the analysts compounded that mistake by using three maps to locate the arms agency two yugoslav commercial maps from 1989 and 1996 , and a united states government map produced in 1997 none showed the current location of the chinese embassy , which was built in 1996 only after the disaster did the cia turn up in its files two maps that accurately placed the embassy one was a map handed out by a belgrade bank that showed a branch office near the embassy the other listed the embassy and its grid coordinates in its index but did not mark the building on the map itself , an american official said since this was the agency s first time developing a target package , there was no procedure in place for senior officials to review the work , mr tenet said this initial misidentification took on the mantle of fact , he said there was no cautionary language associated with it military planners never caught the mistake , partly because they assumed the location had already been verified , mr hamre said a final backup also failed when several computerized databases of sites that were offlimits to bombing , including embassies , hospital and churches , did not have the current location of the chinese embassy database maintenance is one of the basic elements of our intelligence effort , but it is also one that has suffered in recent years as our work force has been spread thin , mr tenet said the administration has taken steps to avoid a recurrence , including a system to update the databases when bombing cities , mr tenet said , a new policy requires that government officials familiar with the location be consulted and sign off on what a satellite picture says a site is or is n't
they told this joke in denver in the late 1980 s a man dies and goes to heaven , where he is told that heaven has all the happy pursuits of his former life , including football taken to heaven s football field , the man notices that the players are wearing letters on their jerseys hb , lb and wr instead of numbers they signify a player s position , the man is told you know , 'hb' is for halfback , 'lb' for linebacker , and so on what s 'je' \? the man asks , pointing to another player oh , that s god , the man is told he thinks he s john elway nearly a dozen years later , and a year after his only super bowl championship , the pro football community and the rocky mountain region are hesitantly , if giddily , approaching something new the inevitable mortality of john elway , football player it is a celebration of a landmark career , and though elway s retirement is not yet official , it is fitting that he is being celebrated on pro football s grandest stage , the super bowl , which is only proper given the lifelong stage presence of sunday s guest of honor at 38 , elway is no longer the lissome , playful , allthingsarepossible pup of a quarterback who dashed into his first super bowl with the broncos 12 years ago , but he is no less the star as he starts his fifth super bowl , a record for a quarterback he is a national icon , and simultaneously a peerless symbol for denver s growth as a western capital these last two decades he is as famous for his accomplishments as he is for his successive super bowl failures he was embraced for his stoicism in defeat as much as for the unfettered ebullience he showed in victory a year ago he has been a part of the american sports theater for so long that he is one of our most easily recognized athletes adored in denver , respected in 30 other national football league cities , filled with talent and yet admired for effort and now , by most accounts , he is playing his last game in one of the biggest games of his career super bowl xxxiii , where the broncos will face the atlanta falcons on sunday in miami i almost wish i could step back and watch john play this game myself , shannon sharpe , denver s glib tight end , said last week take pictures , soak it in it s history because no quarterback will play exactly like him again success , yes , but perseverance , too denver s offensive coordinator , gary kubiak , came into the nfl with elway in 1983 and has gone from being his backup to his roommate to his coach sixteen years of observation have afforded kubiak a wealth of elway perspective john s career is not a simple , easy success story , kubiak said in an interview last week it s a long story , with enormous highs and tough times , too he stuck it out and not everyone would have sharpe said he showed everybody people learned you do n't tug on superman s cape and you do n't mess with john elway elway s wild , gaudy , recordsetting career has evolved for nearly a quarter century now , dating to 1978 when he was the country s most heavily recruited high school quarterback he is one of those modern athletic stars whose time in the spotlight dates to his adolescence if he walks a bit like john wayne , maybe it s because he has lived with a movie star s celebrity since he was 16 born in the state of washington but raised in the los angeles area , elway is the only son of jack elway , the denver broncos' director of pro scouting and the former head coach at san jose state and stanford offered college scholarships throughout the land , elway chose stanford just as his father was beginning his career as coach at san jose state the stanford assistant coach in charge of recruiting elway was jim fassel , the current giants coach when i met john , the first thing he wanted to know from me was how he could get better , fassel said i never met a young player so eager to make something of himself that s what we talked about what we could do for him , what he could do for the university and what he could do for himself from the minute he stepped on campus , he was like , 'when do we get started \? ' from the minute elway stepped on the stanford campus , he was also enveloped in expectations elway was supposed to lead stanford to a host of rose bowl titles , perhaps even a national title none of those things happened , though he did finish second , to herschel walker , in the heisman trophy balloting as a senior he set five major national collegiate athletic association records he added to his budding legend at stanford , elway also met his future wife , janet fassel remembers elway s coming to him in his office early in his senior year , unsettled about his relationship with janet i really like her , elway told fassel so what s the problem \? fassel asked she s so busy , she does n't have a lot of time for me , elway said fassel remembered that later in elway s senior year , as the star of the game one afternoon , elway left the field as the center of attention for a horde of celebrating fans , teammates and news media members standing with janet , fassel watched as elway glided past , waving to the crowd
hempstead , ny , dec 13 just kidding sort of that was a respectful keyshawn johnson , who turned his attention today to next sunday s opponent and the man who will be guarding him , the redoubtable deion sanders johnson was magnanimous in praising sanders , the dallas cowboys' dangerous cornerback , as a player and the best defender but johnson was also feeling on top of his game , with three onehanded catches , two touchdowns and a dominating 11reception , 144yard performance in the jets' 2820 victory over the miami dolphins on sunday maybe , johnson said as he thought about sanders , who has played for four major league baseball teams , i 'll make him go play baseball johnson realized that even after his career high of 11 catches , that may have sounded too harsh something close to bragging , or a putdown and he quickly added , maybe he 'll make me retire being modest is hardly johnson s style certainly not after he described himself today as the best receiver after four years ever in football including the likes of jerry rice johnson is about to become the player with the most receptions after four national football league seasons he has 293 catches , 16 from surpassing andre rison , whose first season was with the colts and whose next three were with the runandshoot offense in atlanta even johnson , though , seemed especially impressed with what he did against the dolphins of his first touchdown catch , a 26yard strike early in the final period , he said nobody gets to that but me nobody you ca n't throw that to nobody else you would n't have been able to throw that to none of our other receivers you 'd be able to throw it to only a couple of guys in the nfl johnson made a running , outstretched grab with the defender in front of him his second score was a onehanded snare with the conference s interception leader , sam madison , hanging on him of his catches over the middle , johnson said , other guys would get hit and come out of a lefthanded grab , reaching down , fighting off a defender , he simply smiled when asked if he were ambidextrous i think i'm righthanded , he said he has bonded with his latest quarterback , ray lucas , the seventh player to throw him a pass since johnson came up in 1996 in the last two games , lucas has found him 21 times in lucas s six starts , the two have collaborated for 40 catches and 4 touchdowns yet , while coach bill parcells will grant both players a good game , he will not be effusive about either one the coach says that lucas cannot always spot johnson , who may change his route if the coverage is too tight parcells believes the more experienced but injured vinny testaverde could get the ball to johnson at those times still , parcells conceded that lucas , who is 33 as a starter , was closing in on the job as the primary backup for next season lucas has thrown 130 passes without an interception there are 11 quarterbacks in the league who had never started before this season of those , lucas has the secondhighest rating behind the rams' kurt warner lucas has the lowest interception rate \( 11 percent \) among the group and the secondhighest completion rate at 608 percent he needs to be this efficient because he does not usually generate much yardage \( 554 yards an attempt \) and as for johnson , parcells says he needs more patience and that he still gets distracted by things referring to the coach , johhnson said , i 'll never be the receiver he wants me to be parcells also suggested that johnson would have his hands full this week he added , he s playing against a good guy who will study him and do a good job it was uncertain how the cowboys would use him , but johnson expected single coverage from sanders sanders does not talk to the news media until wednesday johnson said he met sanders in 1996 , when johnson threw himself a party in los angeles then to celebrate his selection as the league s top overall draft pick out of southern california he said sanders had given him good advice about playing in the nfl then in the pro bowl last february , johnson caught a pass with sanders defending him but johnson graciously explained that sanders was injured after i caught it , i kept expecting him to hit me , but it never came , johnson said but he was hurt now sanders whom dick steinberg , the jets' former general manager , once described as the best cornerback in history is healthy he was even used for 11 passing plays in sunday s victory against the eagles and he will face the hottest receiver in the league when the jets pay their first visit to dallas since 1971 despite johnson s sense of where he ranks in the pantheon of receivers , he knows he is not a finished player i do n't have a ring , he said i'm naked extra points after this season , bill parcells is going to assess possible reasons for the worst string of injuries in his coaching career this is alarming to me , he acknowledged i 've never had anything like this nine starters have missed at least one game and four remain out for the year but steve atwater s hamstring injury may not sideline him for the season , as parcells had originally feared still , omar stoutmire will probably replace him at free safety bill hampton , 70 , served as the jets' equipment manager for the 700th time on sunday he has missed only one game in the preseason , regular season or postseason since joining the jets in 1964 the 58 jets are one of 13 american football conference teams still mathematically in playoff contention photo jets' keyshawn johnson celebrated a touchdown

washington , dec 1 the choice of a new chaplain might have been expected to draw together the members of the house for a rare moment of spiritual harmony instead , last week s announcement of the selection of the rev charles parker wright has left bruised feelings , partisan rancor and charges from a leading candidate and some involved in the search that senior house republican leaders passed over a priest because he was roman catholic mr wright , like every other person who has held the post , is protestant mr wright , a presbyterian who has long been associated with the national prayer breakfast , was chosen by speaker j dennis hastert of illinois and representative dick armey of texas , the house majority leader , from three candidates submitted by a house select committee representative richard a gephardt of missouri , the minority leader , dissented , but then allowed his name to be used on the official announcement for months the 18member committee , evenly divided between republicans and democrats , had painstakingly screened more than 40 candidates the panel took secret ballots to determine the three finalists and the candidate who emerged with the most support , according to committee members , was the rev timothy j o'brien , a catholic priest and longtime professor of political science at marquette university the committee s chairman and its ranking democrat both said that while they did not rank the three candidates in their submission , the house leaders were told that the committee thought father o'brien was the best choice mr wright had come in third in the balloting , with mostly republican support , committee members said the rev robert dvorak , who is superintendent of the east coast conference of the evangelical covenant church , ran second in the rancorous aftermath , several democrats said they thought house leaders were trying to placate the religious right or were uncomfortable with naming a catholic priest as a member of the house and a member of the committee and as a catholic , i'm offended and resentful , said representative anna g eshoo , democrat of california father o'brien said he believed that if he had been the committee s overwhelming choice and also of any mainline protestant denomination his appointment would have gone unquestioned i hope and pray that the 1960 presidential election did do away with the idea of catholics as not being fully americans , he said in an interview i'm not convinced that that prejudicial view is gone , and i do believe that if i were not a catholic priest i would be the house chaplain mr hastert s spokesman , pete jeffries , said the speaker knew that father o'brien was of catholic faith and the house had not had a chaplain of catholic faith but he said that after interviews with the three candidates , the speaker favored mr wright as the one who would jell the best with the members and their families another aide to the speaker said mr wright had a very strong interview michele a davis , the spokeswoman for mr armey , said her boss was looking for which one would be the guy members would be most comfortable with , who they could turn to when they needed personal counseling representative thomas j bliley jr , a virginia republican who was the committee chairman and who is catholic , said he was surprised by the selection of mr wright but did not know what caused it late today , two house republicans who are catholic rick a lazio of long island and christopher h smith of new jersey called a reporter unbidden to say that neither mr armey nor mr hastert had ever shown any bias against catholics there has never been any hint whatsoever but of complete respect , mr lazio said the house chaplain is responsible for opening each daily session with a prayer and also serves as a counselor to house members , their families and their staffs the post is filled by house vote and has been in existence since 1789 mr wright will have to be formally elected when the house returns in january in recent years there has been little experience in selecting a chaplain the rev james ford , a lutheran minister , has tended to the chamber for 21 years members of both parties said the search committee had none of the usual partisanship of the house the group narrowed a list of about 47 candidates to 17 , who were then interviewed six semifinalists were reinterviewed in secret balloting the committee chose the final three representative earl pomeroy of north dakota , the ranking democrat on the committee , defended mr hastert the speaker , he said , had never told the committee that it would select the chaplain , only that it would put forth three candidates i think some of the grousing is really a matter of individual preferences not being met , he said but representative henry a waxman , democrat of california , said some democrats on the committee had started writing a letter to their leader that was made moot by the selection of mr wright in hopes of avoiding a situation where the chaplain was picked on a partisan basis that passed over the first choice of the whole committee the appointment of father o'brien would have been a breakthrough , mr waxman said father o'brien said that in his interview with house leaders he was a bit shocked when mr armey indicated that he came from north dakota originally and was raised in a very anticatholic environment , and i thought that was kind of a strange comment to make ms davis , mr armey s spokeswoman said the congressman had been responding to someone s remark that he was from texas she said mr armey said , actually i was raised in north dakota where there s lots of lutherans , who always complained about catholics she noted that mr armey s son had converted to catholicism and that many of his staff members were catholic father o'brien said that in his second interview before the committee he ran into an evangelical protestant line of questioning from republicans , including a request that he identify three scriptural passages by which he lived his life , a question about how his moral character could be judged if he was not married and an inquiry about whether his wearing of a collar would be divisive several of the republicans he named denied that they had asked precisely the questions he mentioned representative dave weldon , republican of florida , said he had not asked father o'brien to cite scripture but rather to share a verse of scripture or a story from the bible or a book of the bible that was important to him and mr weldon said that while father o'brien was not his first choice he voted for him as one of the three names to be submitted he said that although his wife was protestant and the couple now attended a protestant church , he had been reared catholic i thought it would have been a nice touch for it to be a catholic , mr weldon said photo the rev timothy j o'brien , a catholic priest and

piauengaly , france , july 20 lance armstrong rode a brilliant tactical race in the tour de france today , then turned on the afterburners and showed that he remains powerful as well as brainy the american leader of the united states postal service team did not win the daily stage but , barring injury or illness , he sewed up the overall victory when the threeweek tour finishes in paris on sunday with a sly smile afterward , he tried to disagree with that judgment the stage tomorrow is long and hard , he said , trying to find reasons not to claim victory but when asked if he was optimistic , he replied , i'm always optimistic , and looked like a man without a doubt in the world declining to contest the final sprint for second place , armstrong finished fourth behind fernando escartin , a spaniard with kelme alex zulle , a swiss with banesto , and richard virenque , a frenchman with polti in the lordly manner of miguel indurain , a fivetime winner of the tour and armstrong s idol , the american dropped back in the last 500 meters and let zulle and virenque battle it out escartin had crossed the line 2 minutes 1 second earlier for his deserved victory the spaniard is a strong climber who usually finishes in the top 10 in any mountain stage but who had never before won one in seven previous tours he was timed in 5 hours 19 minutes 49 seconds , a speed of 32 kilometers an hour \( 20 miles an hour \) on a sweltering trek over six climbs and 173 kilometers \( 107 miles \) from st gaudens to the barren resort of piauengaly in the pyrenees the crowds were small i 've dreamed of this day , escartin said i 've won stages in every other big race , but never the tour is this really my eighth tour \? he also vaulted from fifth place over all to second , 6 19 behind armstrong zulle remained third , 7 26 behind , as abraham olano , the spanish leader of once , dropped from second to eighth by losing more than seven minutes to the winner and five minutes to most of the other leaders but the day really belonged to armstrong , who used his team and his rivals to perfection other postal service riders , especially kevin livingston and tyler hamilton , gave armstrong strong support , while his rivals seemed flummoxed by his coolness and control the man in the yellow jersey knew this stage from a reconnaissance ride he did in may over its six peaks , five of them rated first category and one second in an ascending scale of four to one in difficulty none of the climbs was rated beyond category , the mostdemanding class we previewed the stage and at the time decided it would be the hardest day of the race , he said monday at a news conference it s not as long as sestriere or alpe d'huez , he added , referring to the two alpine stages , but with six climbs , it should be decisive that it was , or at least tantalizingly close to decisive early in the day , armstrong replied to cycling attacks by his opponents , including escartin , by accelerating after and joining them he rode stonyfaced , giving away nothing of his physical state he was playing a waiting game , forcing his rivals to choose whether they should do the work of chasing escartin and laurent dufaux , a swiss with saeco , who had opened a lead that , at least on the road , allowed them to overhaul olano and zulle in the standings if those two speeded up , armstrong would have a free ride behind them if they stayed put , he would lose no time to them on the fifth climb , the american began accelerating , leaving most of his group behind except for zulle when the swiss faded , armstrong waited for him , knowing that two men working together use less energy each than one man does alone starting the final 13kilometer climb to the finish , armstrong began riding like a man looking for victory but it was too late to overtake escartin and armstrong was content to ride in with zulle and virenque and then allow them free passage the last test he faces in the pyrenees is made up of four major climbs on wednesday followed by a 60kilometer \( 37mile \) descent in which riders left behind on the peaks usually catch most of the first men over the top armstrong had to deal with one other matter today , a report in the french newspaper le monde that said a number of riders , including armstrong , had small traces of certain antiinflammatory drugs known as corticosteroids in their urine when tested earlier in the race corticosteroids are banned except when used for medical purposes a belgian rider , ludo dierckxsens , was kicked off his team on monday , with the team alleging that dierckxsens had told a race doctor , but not the team doctor , that he had used a corticosteroid to treat a knee injury the le monde report said the traces in armstrong s sample were too small to be classified as positive and armstrong , when asked for a response , said , this is the first i know of this jeanmarie blanc , director of the tour de france , said , we 're not scientists , but as far as i can see from the article , the riders have a trace , 02 percent , of the corticosteroid that , blanc said , seemed to be less than the amount in an average person photos lance armstrong , wearing the leader s yellow jersey , riding downhill with a nearby teammate ready to help out during yesterday s 15th stage of the tour \( agence francepresse \) \( pg d1 \) fernando escartin of spain on his breakaway to victory yesterday \( agence francepresse \) \( pg d5 \)
washington , aug 19 more than 200 people in minnesota and north dakota have become sick and four children have died over the past two years after becoming infected with a drugresistant germ that until recently had been confined to hospitals and nursing homes , federal health officials said today the fatalities are the first to be reported in the united states and are worrisome because they suggest that a lethal strain of the germ , staphylococcus aureus , may threaten the public it is not known whether the germ has spread to other parts of the country , although some cases were reported last year among youngsters in chicago and tennessee these serve as a warning sign , sort of like the canary in the coal mine , that there may be problems that lie ahead , said dr tim naimi , the medical epidemiologist who investigated the outbreak for the centers for disease control and prevention , a federal agency whose headquarters are in atlanta it s sort of like an old fox has gotten into a new and much larger henhouse staph germs exist in the nostrils and skin and can be passed through handtohand contact , but are typically harmless unless they enter the body through a cut or a scrape , which enables them to travel through the bloodstream and attack a variety of organs there are drugs that kill the resistant strain but unless doctors have tested for it , patients may not be treated in time and because it is difficult to tell when a patient is infected , the cdc is urging healthcare providers to obtain cultures from people who may have illnesses caused by bacteria dr naimi said parents should not be alarmed but should take commonsense precautions , like cleaning out infected cuts , washing hands frequently and seeking medical care if their children appear sick but other experts said the deaths , which are being reported in friday s issue of the agency s morbidity and mortality report , were a frightening development that s scary , said dr stuart b levy , director of the center for adaptation genetics and drug resistance at tufts university dr levy said it was particularly unsettling that robust youngsters lost their lives , as opposed to newborns , the elderly or people with immune disorders , who are more vulnerable if we have kids dying of staph aureus infection in our communities , he said , it tells us there is something wrong the identities of the dead children were not made public , and the disease control agency provided only sketchy details of their cases the children ranged in age from 1 to 13 and had a variety of symptoms , including extremely high fever , rash , dangerously low blood pressure and difficulty in breathing all were treated in hospitals with very powerful antibiotics that should have worked but they did not because the children s doctors had not expected to see infection with a drugresistant germ and thus did not realize quickly enough that the children needed such strong medication the physicians were essentially blindsided , dr naimi said , because this problem is so new the victims included a 7yearold africanamerican girl from urban minnesota , who died in july 1997 after doctors diagnosed an infection in her right hip joint that eventually spread through her bloodstream to her lungs a 16monthold american indian girl from rural north dakota who died in january 1998 , two hours after being admitted to a hospital with a fever of 105 degrees , dangerously low blood pressure and a rash a 13yearold white girl from rural minnesota who died last january , seven days after she arrived at a hospital coughing up blood , with pneumonia eating away at her lung tissue , and a 1yearold white boy from rural north dakota who died last february after suffering a lung infection that rapidly developed into pneumonia that the cases were scattered across the two states and the children are racially diverse suggests that the germ is widespread across the region , dr naimi said he called the deaths the tip of the iceberg and said at least 200 other people , most of them children and healthy young adults , had also been infected those cases were not included in friday s article and because they were still being investigated he said he could not elaborate except to say that the patients had recovered for the past decade , experts have been warning that misuse of antibiotics is creating a wave of drugresistant bacteria , or superbugs , and that doctors are running out of medications to control them the current outbreak , experts say , is another another unsettling example of that trend people are getting staph infections all the time , said dr joshua lederberg , a leading expert in antibiotic resistance at rockefeller university in manhattan habitually , we have just reached for the nearest antibiotic we have n't worried about it now we have to worry about it staph is a common organism about one in five people carry the germ , and in most of them it causes no harm the earliest cases of the drugresistant strain described today by the cdc were reported in hospitals in 1968 and were given the abbreviation mrsa , for methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus \( methicillin is a close cousin of penicillin \) eventually , the bacteria became resistant to two large families of drugs , the penicillin family and the cephalosporin family , which together make up a class known as betalactam antibiotics if treated quickly enough , the germs will succumb to an antibiotic called vancomycin , but doctors regard it as the drug of last resort they try to use it as infrequently as possible so that germs do not develop resistance to it , too betalactams are the most widely used antibiotics , both in outpatient clinics and in hospitals , dr naimi said by 1997 , the disease control agency said , half of all hospitalacquired staph infections were resistant to these drugs , up from 2 percent in 1974 these infections often kill the hospital patients who acquire them in new york city alone , methicillin resistant staph infection killed 1 , 409 people in 1995 , said a recent report by the institute of medicine , an arm of the national academy of sciences until recently , most experts believed that only intravenous drug users or people in hospitals or nursing homes became infected with mrsa germs but last year the journal of the american medical association published a study that documented cases of communityacquired mrsa in otherwise healthy children in chicago dr naimi said there had also been recent cases in a daycare center in tennessee but dr levy of tufts university said some experts refused to believe the reports he gave a talk about the recent infections at a conference of microbiologists in may , he said some people denied that it exists , he said , insisting that the infected patients must have passed through a hospital at some point none of the children who died in minnesota and north dakota had visited a hospital or nursing home , dr naimi said , nor were they exposed to anyone who did he said the lethal bacteria appear to be a slightly different strain from those typically found in hospitals , suggesting that the staph bugs did not escape from the hospital , but rather mutated in the environment we do n't know how it happened , he said
with only two weeks to go until the oscars , my local movie theater is running a promotional spot for this year s academy awards show there they are , all the memories james cameron crowing , david niven fielding the streaker , cher winning for moonstruck in the bird headdress in a pitch meant to trumpet oscar s glory it s the night that brings the whole world together and sets hollywood apart ! the ad exclaims since when do we need reminding \? at the very least , america s lovehate relationship with the most divine of traditional awards shows should mean a redcircled date on the calendar yet each year , the academy of motion picture arts and sciences comes closer to weakening its franchise and its hold on our collective imagination little gold gentlemen abound this very evening , the screen actors' guild will be handing out its own oscar clone \( the saggy \? \) , a svelte statuette that is now poaching on the academy s terrain for the fifth year in a row at least from afar , this looks like a reasonable alternative and the screen actors' guild did n't forget to nominate joseph fiennes what s more , the academy must still be reeling from its splashiest challenge yet january s golden globe awards telecast , in which the year s hottest screen celebrities lit up a rival television show while thanking the hollywood foreign press association from the bottoms of their hearts to its credit , the once tacky golden globes event has become so glittery that it s now a serious spectacle in its own right even if the small , starstruck hollywood foreign press association could better spend its time explaining why jack frost is a top10 hit in ireland than annointing great artistic achievements of the year with substance so easily eclipsed by flashy packaging , we are fast approaching the time when a glittery television show and a prize for gwyneth paltrow will be enough to guarantee any awardgivers' credibility but however quickly these backpatting rituals proliferate , and however interchangeable they become , the bluechip status of the academy awards miraculously survives why \? because it s a leap of faith that we still choose to make it s a link to the past magic of american filmmaking and the hope , against heavy odds , that such magic still exists it s the memory of fabulous , halfimaginary hollywood in the face of the workaday film industry and business as usual and it s the essence of our current awardsshow fever none of this copycat hoopla would exist if the oscar show itself were n't such an addiction though period pieces men with guns and women with handmaidens dominate this year s nominations , oscar night always works as a barometer of current attitudes that remains a large part of its fascination we can always look back and headscratch about what brought forth the year of gandhi or forrest gump and this time we can wonder not so much about the preponderance of war stories and costume dramas as about the striking absence of films dealing with contemporary life among this year s various nominees , the few that do grapple with the present are either fraught with pain \( affliction , a simple plan , american history x , a civil action , one true thing \) or fearful of an orwellian future \( pleasantville , the truman show \) as the best original screenplay nominee bulworth demonstrated , a film that tries to take on contemporary political or social realities is such a rarity these days that it s a shock to the system count on the television cameras to seek out warren beatty not only when that screenwriting prize is handed out but also when elia kazan receives his lifetime achievement award as the director of reds , mr beatty should be among those whose reactions to that controversial choice will be most revealing outspoken opposition to this overdue honor for mr kazan has already colored this year s event but the facts remain that he is a figure of vast and enduring artistic influence , one of the visionary directors of this century , and that acknowledging such work is part of the academy s mandate political censure never has been it will be an important measure of the academy s mettle if audience members can make their feelings known without diminishing the dignity of the evening \( that remains the job of outrageouslydressed actresses and winners who wo n't shut up \) the hard decision to honor mr kazan is consistent with other difficult choices to be made this year the best picture category is always a tough horse race , but this year it s a killer at least there is one ringer amid such formidable nominees as saving private ryan , shakespeare in love , the thin red line and life is beautiful elizabeth , a flamboyant throwback to the days when academy voters imagined themselves to be edified by historical spectacle , even though sex , violence , scheming and fancy royal costuming were really all any audience had in mind i have yet to encounter anyone who learned much about england s 16thcentury religious wars by watching a saucy young queen with a gifted hairdresser find her way to the throne

atlanta four weeks ago to the day , the mets barreled into town full of heady pretensions and the fragile confidence of a team that was having its first dreams of the top after a decade of mediocrity they had put distance between themselves and cincinnati in the national league wildcard race and had pulled within a game of the braves the foe they have chased for so long in the east division with three games at turner field , the mets were certain they would come out even with atlanta at the very least instead , the mets were humbled they suffered three confidencedraining losses that set the stage for one of the wildest rides in franchise history disaster in atlanta three more demoralizing losses to lowly philadelphia , then two more defeats to atlanta at shea suddenly , the mets had tumbled from the lofty quest of a division championship to the desperation of a team trying to back into a wildcard playoff the mets returned to atlanta last night not with the same swagger of september , but with the firm , nononsense confidence of a team that had gone to the depths and back a humbled team that respected all and feared none once again , they failed to conquer the mountain that atlanta has become , but the mets team that lost , 109 , in 11 innings , in no way resembled the team that was chased away in september this could be the beginning of a new winning era the manner of the mets' loss early this morning a basesloaded walk was inconsistent with their play of the last three weeks when they issued no easy passes what happened to this team between sept 21 and oct 19 is a baseball story to close out the decade fittingly last night s game 6 was the mets' season in a neat frame the ups , the downs , the sense of being lost and suddenly finding a center atlanta scored five runs in the first inning and chased al leiter out of the playoffs just as their obituaries were being written , the mets scored three runs in the sixth inning atlanta scored two more runs in the bottom of the inning to boost the lead back to 73 and provide a desperately hoped for comfort zone but this was not that kind of party anymore after 12 regularseason games with atlanta , so many one and tworun frustrations and that 15inning game 5 marathon in new york on sunday , this was not about hoping anymore in the seventh , facing the former cy young award winner john smoltz , the mets produced a rally capped by the wounded mike piazza s tworun home run scoretied then the mets took an 87 lead in the eighth inning benny agbayani singled and melvin mora knocked him in game over \? these are not the same old mets what happened in that fourweek period \? when we came here before , we were thinking , 'ok , we can maybe get two out of three , maybe sweep these guys , then we 're tied up or ahead in the division , ' recalled darryl hamilton , the mets' center fielder , who joined the team in a midseason trade then we thought we can take care of business at home but when that snowballed into a losing streak , guys realized the only thing that was important is the game you go out and play with their division dreams crushed to pieces , the mets put themselves back together with what was left the young players snapped out of a daze and the veterans faced up to reality that time was passing the team grew , the team jelled , the team matured the mets swept a threegame series against pittsburgh , then won a wildcard playoff game against cincinnati they disposed of favored arizona , suffered three straight losses to atlanta in the championship series , then scored backtoback victories , the second in that 15inning classic on sunday so the changed mets came back to atlanta all those miles traveled , the ups , the downs , the upheavals all the steep inclines and plummets our attitude s a little different right now , hamilton said that losing streak was a very humbling experience we realized that , no matter how good your ball club is , usually the best team does n't win we think we have a very good ball club but we lost a lot of critical games at the end and it almost cost us a playoff berth guys really appreciate where we are right now we understand that it can go away at any instant the mets have taken a harrowing fourweek journey from georgia to pennsylvania to new york to ohio to arizona back to new york and now georgia again and believe it has built a resolve the mets may not have had four weeks ago i just think we ran out of gas , hamilton said in the mets' somber clubhouse kenny rogers gave everything he had benitez gave everything he had he did n't have much left but he gave it all it s just tough at this point to say that it s over but it is really over the mets will certainly make some adjustments , some additions , some subtractions but they have an infrastructure that could introduce a new decade of winning this was a beginning we had destiny in our own hands , we lost destiny , we got it back in our own hands , said steve phillips , the mets' general manager they have erased the losers stigma and the label of underachievers if things had gone differently , we could have won the division and gotten here the same way , phillips said but the way we 've gotten to this point is going to be so much more fulfilling when it s all said and done because we overcame something and a label can never be attached to us again we did n't choke we did n't fold we won photo kenny rogers , who walked in the run in relief that ended the mets' season \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
after christmas , shares of active apparel group , a clothing wholesaler , were swept up in the market enthusiasm for retailers doing business on the internet active apparel promoted its internet debut in a news release and on cnbc , and though the company had not yet sold any goods in cyberspace indeed , its web site was not up and running when the first release went out investors bid up the stock as high as 25 , from 125 on christmas eve several officers and directors , meanwhile , took advantage of the stock s surge to sell close to 1 million of their shares after those sales , the price of active apparel shares quickly fell back into the single digits on friday , they closed at 46875 , meaning investors who still own shares bought during the frenzied days of late december have big losses neither active apparel nor the insiders who sold have been accused of any wrongdoing but for the buyers of those shares , it was a painful lesson , and not an isolated one outside investors do not always fare as well as insiders when companies advance amid internet euphoria the tide that has lifted internet stocks the last few months has brought with it plenty of flotsam companies with only the most tenuous connections to the internet but whose shares were bid up as if they were the next yahoo or amazoncom now as the tide recedes and even the biggest internet stocks fall sharply from their highs , some investors find themselves with the equivalent of driftwood stocks in companies whose insiders have bailed out at higher prices and in companies whose promoters issued research reports because they were paid to do so generally , insiders of companies that issue new stock to the public agree not to sell for a lockup period of up to six months but companies that are already publicly traded and that suddenly announce an internet plan are not under the same restrictions that makes investors particularly vulnerable to a downdraft caused by insider selling the securities and exchange commission has taken action against some companies and promoters that have not fully disclosed their practices , and regulators are warning investors to proceed with caution more companies , legitimate and illegitimate , seem to be getting onto the internet every day , said chris ullman , an sec spokesman technological developments have made it so that it does n't take much to set up a web site many of the newly christened internet companies , of course , may bounce back from recent stock declines active apparel , for example , now has a fully operating web site its stock , which had been threatened with delisting from nasdaq s biggest market when its market value fell below nasdaq s requirements , is trading on nasdaq s smaller , less prestigious smallcap market gene marbach , an outside spokesman for the company , said that the recent stock sales by insiders are no reflection on the company s prospects in most cases , the sales represented only a small portion of their total holdings , mr marbach said , and some insiders have bought stock the last year in addition to exercising options and selling stock those explanations are not likely to comfort individuals who bought active apparel stock at high prices when insiders were selling , however give me hope ! , wrote one such investor , a california woman who goes by the screen name portofoy , on the yahoo message board for active apparel stock yes , folks , i bought aagp at 22 , repeat 22 , she added , referring to active apparel s stock symbol too much caffeine that morning , i guess is there hope \? should i hold on \? i'm hurtin' for certain obviously , timing is everything in the fastmoving , volatile world of internet stocks and insiders have key advantages consider connect inc , a mountain view , calif , company that distributes software allowing companies to sell goods over the internet on nov 30 , as investors heard reports of the crowds flocking to internet shopping sites over the thanksgiving weekend , shares of connect , which has since changed its name to connectinccom , soared to more than 15 , up from less than 2 the previous day only weeks later , after the shares fell back into the single digits , was it disclosed that on the very day that its stock price soared , insiders sold nearly 15 million shares , at prices ranging from 5625 to 124375 greigory park , the company s chief financial officer , said the sales were timed to take advantage of a run in the stock that was pretty much speculationbased he said the company had issued no news to account for the sixfold increase in its stock price the run in the stock was a complete surprise to everybody here , he added at the time , the company was under notice from nasdaq that its stock might be delisted because the company had only 11 million in net tangible assets , versus the 4 million minimum nasdaq requires but the company s efforts to raise money to put it in compliance with the listing rule came at a much more lumbering pace than that insiders displayed when they were selling their own shares in november
perfection is as elusive in wine as it is in life there is no single perfect wine for a special dinner the season , the menu , one s pocketbook and palate all contribute to the decision of which wine to serve consider the season with the approach of fall , it is time to put away the lighter wines that went so well with summer s bounty moving on from wine spritzers and beaujolais village does not mean forsaking them forever a change from triedandtrue wine choices will spice up one s dinner and life a new set of flavors is a reminder of how wonderful autumn in new york can be eating out or cooking at home , one should look for the essence of autumn the earthy flavors of wild mushrooms and the intense taste of game dishes now is the time to try amarone , the great big red wine of italy recioto della valpolicella amarone is the official name it comes from the veneto region of northeastern italy many fine wines originate in these vineyards , including soave , bardolino and valpolicella but amarone is at the top of my list the availability of amarone is more limited than others because of the production techniques used the ripest grapes of the fall harvest are spread out on large trays and left to dry this technique , called appassimento , concentrates the flavor and sugar of the grapes , reducing the volume by about 30 percent as the water evaporates take care when shopping for amarone if the label reads recioto della valpolicella , then it is a semisweet wine , not the recioto della valpolicella amarone for that special dinner recioto della valpolicella amarone , after further fermentation , converts the sweetness to dry perfection the veneto region of italy centers on venice , the regional capital another product of the area that approaches perfection is point de venise lace like wine making , the art of lace making dates back centuries think of all those grand portraits of kings and grand dukes , their wives and assorted infants and princes collars , cuffs , knee garters and even shoes were adorned with point de venise lace venetian lacemakers exported their tracery all over europe for hundreds of years there was a time , back in the 1950 s , when point de venise lace tablecloths were priced at 1 , 500 a yard in manhattan even a relatively modest cloth would require a minimum of three yards more likely was an investment of 6 , ooo or 7 , 5oo for a tablecloth for important parties , and none of those prices included napkins firsttime customers would hope for a discount because there seemed to be stains on the lace a salesman would patiently explain the cottage industry nature of lace making , where the women of the households of the veneto would make lace as they sat and gossiped and had a glass of wine where they put down those glasses a spot might remain , years later and oceans away woe to the matron who expected perfection in a spotless cloth there would not be a markdown on point de venise lace tablecloths so obviously handmade there are not too many bargains in amarone , either prices start around 20 or 25 at a wine shop and rise higher and higher at restaurants the wine lasts a long time in the cellar and a long time in one s memory , too the alcohol percentage can top off at more than 15 percent its aging potential means that amarone can also come to the table last , with the cheese course amarone s great body is a perfect complement to a chunk of parmigianoreggiano , a few figs , a pear or two all those earthy flavors bring to mind the rich aroma of harvest , autumn , fulfillment look for amarone from shippers like bolla , the largest producer of amarone bolla was the first to bring the wine to commercial prominence , starting in the early 1950 s other producers to look for are bertani , masi and tommasi buy two bottles of recioto della valpolicella amarone use one for that perfect weekend dinner and put one in the cellar in 5 or 10 years , when that second bottle of amarone is opened , you will have a better appreciation of a perfect wine , and you will be closer to perfection as well , the better to enjoy this treasure of the veneto
a sad little group of children gathered yesterday afternoon outside a public housing complex in the bedfordstuyvesant section of brooklyn as they mourned a friend , the discussion turned to the meaning of colors blue is for crips , said a plump 7yearold girl with pigtails red is for bloods , said her friend , a girl of 10 there was a brief disagreement over the meaning of yellow one 9yearold boy said yellow was the color of a gang known only by the initials abg no , no , said kierra adams , 11 yellow is for latin kings abg wears black they were standing in a play area just a few feet from where kelvin mcginnis , 11 , was shot and killed on thursday by three young men who sprayed bullets as they raced past on bicycles the police , who have arrested a 17yearold boy , arturo sealey of the brownsville section of brooklyn , have said they believe that kelvin was the innocent victim of a revenge shooting between members of the bloods and the crips , local versions of the more notorious los angeles gangs but not connected to them the police said they continue to look for the two other suspects asked to describe kelvin , kierra paused she looked at a handlettered sign perched on the bench where kelvin had been sitting moments before his death stop the killing , the sign said the letters were blue and red he was gentle , kierra finally said of kelvin , her classmate at public school 137 at her side stood kelvin s best friend , a slim , slight boy named anthony cox this is the first friend i ever lost , anthony , 10 , said quietly and then , more forcefully , he watched my back anthony said he had cried and cried for kelvin , and his grief was reflected in the hundreds of people who came to the saratoga village housing project yesterday to mourn and protest and give comfort to kelvin s family they lit votive candles and sang hymns , and they piled flowers and teddy bears beneath a wreath in kelvin s memory in hushed tones , they shared their sense that gangs in this part of brooklyn have simply and suddenly gotten out of control it s madness , said the rev walter alston , whose parish , the metropolitan baptist church , is across the street from the housing project we 've got children killing other children , and they 're going to jail , and they 're ruining everyone s lives this shooting was particularly agonizing , mr alston said gunshots from bicycles gunshots into a play area full of boys and girls and young mothers with baby carriages when the shots rang out near the intersection of saratoga avenue and hancock street , frantic parents rushed from the housing project my son is outside , kelvin s mother had cried out before running down the stairs from her 10thfloor apartment , reaching kelvin just as he took his final breath shawnda payne , 17 , who lives on the 11th floor , lay nearby with a head wound two other young men , believed to be members of the crips , were also wounded , the police have said ms payne remained hospitalized last night gangs have long flourished in this lowincome neighborhood , but they had been viewed as more of a menacing background noise rather than an immediate threat yes , gang slogans like crips for life can be found in the stairwells of saratoga village and yes , young men flashed gang signs and wore the colors and did the secret gang handshakes in the surrounding streets but their world and whatever tensions it produced seemed disconnected , to the point that parents believed that their children were safe playing outside nobody ever thought anything like this would ever happen here , said sheron james , one of kelvin s uncles none of the residents of this building saw this coming when mr alston called on mourners to form an ongoing movement against gangs , his plea was met with vigorous applause representatives of a police officers' group , 100 blacks in law enforcement who care , stopped by and called for increased patrols in the neighborhood they , too , were greeted warmly the rev herbert daughtry , a prominent brooklyn civic leader , said he had met privately with kelvin s relatives and had urged them to become wounded healers kelvin was raised by a family of helpers and healers his uncle works in a drug abuse center a greataunt , trina james , is a cadet in the police department \( he was every parent s dream , she said yesterday \) another greataunt , caron james , is a manager in the queens public library system early yesterday afternoon , she was approached by dorothy drumgoole , whose lips quivered as she told her story ms drumgoole said she had been in the play area on thursday right next to kelvin , with her 3yearold daughter and 9monthold son when she heard shots , she called for everyone to get down but kelvin did not follow her instructions instead , he pushed her son s stroller toward the shelter of a nearby wall and then turned , which was when she believes he was shot in the chest , she said 'kelv , get up , ' her daughter kept crying , ms drumgoole recalled 'kelv , get up' ms drumgoole could barely tell her story i do n't know what to do , she whispered through tears i wish i could give her back her son it was then that caron james wrapped her arms around ms drumgoole hush , hush she said gently photos a photo of kelvin mcginnis , 11 , of brooklyn , sits in the wreath in the memorial shrine created for him in saratoga village in

in a troubling decision this week , the supreme court granted immigration officials virtual carte blanche to target illegal aliens for deportation based on their lawful political associations and activities the case involved eight noncitizens who the government conceded had been targeted for deportation proceedings because of their leafletting , speaking , fundraising and other political activities in support of the popular front for the liberation of palestine , which the government regards as a terrorist organization lower courts had supported the aliens' claim that they were being subjected to selective prosecution others with similar technical visa problems were left alone none of the eight had been accused of committing any crime , or engaging in any violent or terrorist activities the fbi concluded that if they had been us citizens , there would be no basis for their arrest a year ago , a unanimous federal appellate panel in california ruled that the deportations could not proceed without a showing of specific intent to further the palestinian group s illegal ends overturning that ruling , the justices , by an 8to1 vote , held that a 1996 law designed to speed deportations barred federal courts from assuming jurisdiction in deportation cases until the administrative process had been concluded and there was a final order of deportation the practical result in some cases will be to prevent meaningful judicial review unfortunately , the justices did not stop there a slimmer , 6to3 majority pronounced that illegal aliens had no first amendment right not to be singled out for removal because of their political activities and beliefs this pronouncement runs counter to the general trend of according aliens the same due process and first amendment rights as citizens when the court agreed to hear the case last spring , it said it would review only the jurisdictional issue the parties were told not to argue the more fundamental first amendment questions handing down major rulings without fully exploring the arguments is not a way to produce thoughtful decisionmaking by the nation s top judges the court s rationale could bar federal court intervention to block deportations based on an immigrant s ties to any group or cause out of favor with the government the inevitable result will be to chill the freespeech rights not just of illegal immigrants , but also of legal immigrants awaiting final confirmation of their status that is not an outcome that the court , or the nation , can feel proud about
jacquelyn gilbert had just finished 20 weeks of chemotherapy and 4 weeks of radiation treatment in her battle against breast cancer she was , by her own description , wiped out not exactly someone you would expect to see working out at a health club donna brunton had finished her treatments for breast and colon cancer also recovering from a hysterectomy and still taking tamoxifen , an antitumor drug , she is not a woman you would imagine to be pumping iron but ms brunton said of herself , of ms gilbert and of other members of the group of cancer survivors with whom she exercises we really have a common bond there are all these people at the club who are so physically fit we 're there to say , 'we just want to be healthy' the group is taking part in a new program run jointly by the zalmen a arlin cancer institute of the westchester medical center in valhalla and club fit , a health club in jefferson valley the program combines traditional oncological treatments with aerobic workouts , strength training and relaxation techniques the idea is to offer patients a new way of coping with their disease and recovery proponents of the concept say that mild exercise , along with training in stress reduction , can help those recovering from cancer to feel better physically and emotionally a focus on wellbeing in the middle of illness , as well as returning a sense of normalcy to lives that have suddenly been wrenched off track , reflects a strategy of treating the whole person , not just the illness , dr tauseef ahmed , chief of oncology at westchester medical center , said we ca n't have tunnel vision of what a given person s sickness is , dr ahmed said part of that is looking at the whole person and treating the entire body being fit always makes life easier it s incumbent on us to try to provide something positive for people and make them feel better dr ahmed said he was not suggesting that exercise cured cancer or deterred a recurrence rather , he said , it may help some patients manage the side effects of their treatments better given that overwhelming fatigue is a major side effect of both radiation and chemotherapy treatments , it would seem that the last thing a recovering patient would want to do is exercise but dr ahmed said physical activity can release endorphins , a natural compound , which can promote a feeling of energy and combat feelings of fatigue the women taking part in the new program said that they were delighted when they learned of it it sounded like a godsend to me , said ms gilbert , 69 , who lives in yorktown by the time you have finished with your treatment , you have n't moved a muscle , so you are entirely out of shape for me , even walking up the stairs was a problem i am a person who has tried to be relatively fit and active all my life , and i was dismayed another woman , who is still undergoing treatment for breast cancer , said , i really need the structure and support , because when the treatment is finished , i want to get back to other activities , and i do n't want to discover that i 've lost every muscle that i 've owned the woman , who agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity , added , of course , none of us know how this is going to play out in the long run , but certainly what strength we have going into it is going to be good while studies have been conducted suggesting a link between exercise and the prevention of some cancers , there has been comparatively little research about the benefits of working out once the disease has been diagnosed this is a very hot issue right now for patients as well as for the american cancer association , said colleen doyle , a spokeswoman based in atlanta most of the research right now is looking at the issue of whether being active reduces fatigue for cancer patients the research is also looking at qualityoflife issues does being able to go back to activity give patients a sense of control \? is there an impact on treatment \? probably not but it s a pretty new area of research , and we 're really looking into the science behind it to see what we can recommend to patients and their doctors ms doyle said that the cancer society has been receiving an increasing number of calls from cancer patients , many of them referred by their doctors , who want to know when they can return to exercise and what exercise would be appropriate connie engleking , an oncology nurse who is the executive director of the arlin cancer institute , said that when she began working with cancer patients 25 years ago , the focus was on how to keep them alive the quality of of their lives became an issue only gradually , as survival rates improved today , there are more than 10 million cancer survivors , and even people who are not cured can live 15 to 20 years with active cancer , she said the program in westchester , open to women and men , offers classes both at club fit in jefferson valley and at the arlin center in valhalla diane pulleyblank , exercise manager at club fit in jefferson valley and the supervisor of the program , said the goals of the program include building cardiovascular endurance and increasing muscle strength , building confidence and restoring a sense of vitality to participants and introducing participants to a variety of mindbody activities like yoga , stretching and meditation the exercise program at club fit runs for 10 weeks , with the group meeting twice a week for 90minute sessions participants use both machines and handheld weights an eightweek session of the mindbody exercises is offered at the arlin institute a doctor s permission is necessary before enrolling in the program , which is free of charge ms engleking stressed that one of the greatest benefits of the exercise program is that people feel they are taking action in their own recovery it is about being proactive , she said it s not just getting the drugs or radiation but also doing things to help yourself ms brunton concurred it s important for cancer patients and cancer survivors to feel that they have some control over some things in their life , she said i feel that i try to take care of my body more now , knowing much more than i did before i had cancer of course , i'm afraid of recurrence , so i want to do the things that i have control over as best i can , which means diet , exercise , yoga and meditation the program is not right for everyone , said ms engleking , who is also an oncology nurse some patients are too ill to take part and for others it simply holds no appeal our goal is not to pressure people , she said it s about offering a menu of options it does a disservice to people who may not choose this kind of approach to feel they are not doing the best they can we will be cheering people on in whatever way will be helpful to them

quoted the powerful wife of president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia , mirjana markovic , as saying that the owner of a belgrade daily newspaper said he supports the united states in its desire to bomb serbia the writer of the article then continued , this is , of course , slavko curuvija these commentaries were like a death sentence , said a senior serbian journalist at the funeral mr curuvija , who had become a man of means , was once close to ms markovic but he took his publications down an increasingly independent , serious and outspoken path veran matic , the editor in chief of the onceindependent radio station b92 taken over last week by the milosevic government said mr curuvija s slaying was meant to be an example to anyone who intended to take the same road mr matic said he believed that the killing would boomerang , reminding serbs that free speech can be easily lost but the true effects can be known only when nato s bombings stop , he said , because it is almost impossible to criticize the milosevic government while it is defending the country from outside aggression we 're all collateral damage from nato s bombs curuvija , b92 , the democrats , said another senior editor of b92 mr curuvija himself , before he died , spoke against the bombing and bemoaned the inability of democrats and dissidents to speak out during what he called this war fever aleksandara joksinovic , an official of the democratic party , said , i was concerned that many people would be too afraid to come to the funeral it s a horrible , tragic moment , she said , but i'm glad people were not afraid to show their disgust at such brutality this killing really was too much , to eliminate people with different opinions while the country is at war we are against the bombs , of course but serbs must be united against the aggression , not fighting one another that is a point made with increasing urgency in the last few days by the most liberal member of mr milosevic s government , deputy prime minister vuk draskovic , who has been the only official voice condemning mr curuvija s slaying and the manipulation of patriotism for the political advantage of ultranationalists and leftists mr draskovic has also condemned parliament s vote to bind yugoslavia in an illdefined union with russia and belarus , attacking those who would return yugoslavia to the failed anachronism of communism but as this funeral took place , across town at his presidential palace , mr milosevic was greeting the autocratic president of belarus , aleksandr lukashenko , with a red carpet and a big fraternal hug it was the first time mr milosevic had been seen in the flesh by journalists since the bombing began after their meeting , mr lukashenko said that mr milosevic remained opposed to any foreign soldiers entering kosovo under a peace settlement , and that yugoslavia would accept civilian peacekeepers only under a united nations banner , and only if none came from nato countries that suggestion is so far from nato s demands for an armed international security force with a nato core as to be a nonstarter mr draskovic did not attend the funeral , but his wife , danica , was there , along with other opposition party leaders like vuk obradovic of the social democrats and vladan batic of the christian democratic party speaking at the small chapel , where wreaths of white calla lilies , tulips , jonquils and carnations were mounded around the coffin , liljana smajlovic , the foreign editor of evropljanin , remembered mr curuvija s last staff meeting on the day the bombing began , march 24 , when he suspended publication i 'll always remember two things slavko curuvija said he would not publish newspapers for the censors and , second , that nato s aggression against yugoslavia was illegal , illegitimate and immoral , ms smajlovic said he was a brave man , she said , braver than those who shot him in the back like cowards , and braver than those who bombed him from the air speaking over the coffin at mr curuvija s grave site , as reporters and mourners jostled each other on the jumbled tombstones of others , voja zanetic , an editor of the dnevni telegraf , said , it is impossible to describe today s situation in a headline , or even in an entire newspaper as he put copies of mr curuvija s publications into the grave and weeping family members bent to toss clods of earth onto the coffin , mr zanetic called the spot holy ground then workers in blue overalls , with public enterprise , belgrade cemeteries embroidered on their pockets , filled in the grave , their shovels clanging against marble and granite as some sobbed and others turned away , the workers heaped the memorial wreaths and bouquets for mr curuvija on top of the raw grave , until the pile of flowers rose above the headstones another senior serbian journalist noted as he walked along that few of the mourners were wearing the bull seye logo that has become de rigueur at antinato rallies this is normal belgrade , he said , gesturing to the crowd in a way this is a funeral for normal belgrade the war was not far away on the outer wall of the cemetery , next to mr curuvija s death notice , there was another , announcing the death of bandur mihajlo , known as miki mr mihjalo , the notice said , died on april 8 , at 25 you died bravely defending the homeland , our dear and beloved son , the notice read it was signed by his father , stevan , and his mother , milka , and it bore a picture of a babyfaced mr mihjalo , his hair shorn , in his uniform photo mourners yesterday carried the coffin of slavko curuvija , an independent publisher who was assassinated by gunmen on sunday , from a belgrade church some at the funeral feared further killings

even with the major market indexes up splendidly this year , the stock market remains a place where the havenots vastly outnumber the haves stocks dipping to new lows dominate those reaching new highs and while the nasdaq composite closed on friday at a record high , up 7116 percent in 1999 , 848 percent of nasdaq stocks are down 10 percent or more from their highs of the year , according to salomon smith barney for months , the bifurcated market has frustrated investors unlucky enough to own shares in companies that are doing fine but that are not market darlings now the market s extreme segmentation is posing genuine problems for the federal reserve , whose policy makers meet tuesday aiming to keep the economy from overheating , the fed has raised interest rates threequarters of a percentage point since june rate increases usually put a damper on stock indexes , but not this year that is because the technology and internet stocks that are propelling the indexes to record highs are impervious to rising interestrate pain their capital needs are satisfied at low cost by venture capitalists and stock market investors , who have money to burn and pay no attention to rates but the recent rate increases have hurt interestrate sensitive companies like financial institutions and oldfashioned industrial concerns by increasing their costs of capital companies whose shares are in the doldrums cannot turn to the stock market for cheap capital they must go to banks or the bond market and rates have risen in both yields on 30year government bonds jumped from 616 percent to 638 percent and so the fed finds itself in a corner on one hand , inflation does not seem to be in evidence across the country but the economy is considerably stronger than the fed would like it to be , largely because of consumer spending and what is driving the consumer into the stores \? none other than the rising stock market according to international strategy and investment , an investment advisory group , retail sales closely parallel the stock market s gains , especially around christmas in the fourth quarter of 1997 , for example , retail sales inched up 1 percent the standard poor s 500 index rose 3 percent in the fourth quarter last year , retail sales climbed 11 percent and the s p jumped 17 percent as rising stock indexes stoke the hot economy , they are also minimizing the effects of the fed s recent rate increases but because these indexes do not reflect the fortunes of all stocks , the fed s next moves are made much trickier if the fed wanted to rein in runaway stock prices by raising rates , it would have to go well beyond the onequarterpoint moves it is accustomed to making that could be dangerous one trader likened the situation to a lawn with a clump of weeds far outgrowing the grass if you administer too many chemicals to kill the weeds , you could kill the entire lawn , he said to stop this mania , it s going to take several doses of harsh medicine christine a callies , chief united states market strategist at credit suisse first boston , said the fed is concerned about an equity bubble that blunts the influence of fed policy but i think it s politically unrealistic for them to conduct monetary policy with the goal of cooling off the stock market so the party goes on and the stakes rise ever higher graph seasonal parallel' shows change from the third to the fourth quarter of each year from '95 to '99
before last night s game 2 of the american league championship series , chuck knoblauch was discussing a defensive lapse in the alcs this time , knoblauch was speaking freely and even smiling this time knoblauch hustled away from a controversial defensive play without causing serious damage the yankees and the red sox were tied , 33 , with a runner on first and none out in the 10th inning of game 1 on wednesday night when scott brosius fielded john valentin s grounder to third and whipped the ball to knoblauch at second to start a potential double play but the ball popped off the webbing of knoblauch s glove and fell on the dirt it was 373 days ago when knoblauch failed to retrieve a loose ball in game 2 of the alcs and instead bickered with the first base umpire while two runs scored the indians went on to defeat the yankees , 41 , and tied the series at 11 had knoblauch done it again \? the answer came quickly rick reed , the secondbase umpire , lifted his right arm and ruled that knoblauch had dropped the ball in the transition from catching it and trying to throw to first the putout counted you never say never , but i have rarely seen that call made where the guy is called safe , knoblauch said rick reed is a very good umpire if he was n't , he would n't be umpiring in this situation i do n't know if they showed me , but i was n't worried maybe knoblauch was not , but reed admitted that he had made the improper call after he watched a videotape of the play the red sox would have had runners on first and second base with no outs , which is still no guarantee they would have scored against mariano rivera but , when bernie williams followed with a massive leadoff homer in the bottom of the 10th to catapult the yankees to a 43 victory , boston felt deprived obviously , knoblauch was relieved but when knoblauch was asked if he thought back to last season after being involved in another fielding play that dominated many postgames discussions , he shook his head knoblauch said that derek jeter has helped him to forget what transpired i did n't think back to last year , knoblauch said one thing i learned from jeter is that no matter what happens , whether it s good or bad , you ca n't change what just happened knoblauch , who led the yankees with 26 errors this season , did not make an error in the last 13 games of the season and played well against texas on defense during the division series he still floats his throws to first on grounders hit at him , but makes much stronger throws on double plays or when he has little time to think
if major league umpires plan to strike in support of the 22 umpires who are scheduled to lose their jobs next thursday , they will know before that day if they would be risking their own jobs in an illegal walkout daniel silverman , director of the new york office of the national labor relations board , said yesterday that the board will have a decision next week on the unfair labor practice charges filed by the umpires union against the leagues on aug 3 meanwhile , a leader of a group of umpires opposed to the union leadership said yesterday he would reserve a decision on what he would do if the proleadership faction did strike the national and american leagues but john hirschbeck was also severely critical , in a telephone interview , of richie phillips , the union s lawyer and chief negotiator , calling for a change in that position as soon as possible , probably through a vote of the union membership silverman said we recognize our responsibility to inform the parties of any decision before sept 2 we have the responsibility and we fully intend to meet that responsibility he declined to discuss the board s investigation if the board were to find the union s charges valid , it could , as the union has requested , seek an injunction in federal court blocking the leagues from accepting the resignations of the 22 umpires such a finding also would enable the umpires to walk out and label their action an unfair labor practice strike the board could also dismiss the charges if it did , and the umpires walked out , the leagues could fire them because their labor contract prohibits them from striking labor experts on both sides of the labor line expect the board to dismiss the charges phillips said yesterday that the union filed additional charges late tuesday stemming from the leagues' hiring of 25 minor league umpires last month the union contends that the leagues did not have to hire the umpires , certainly not when they did the new umpires have quickly become part of the division that has grown between the union s two factions , primarily along league lines eight of the 13 umpires the nl hired have joined the union , but none of the 12 new al umpires has joined hirschbeck , a veteran al umpire , said the union leadership had not even attempted to recruit the new al umpires as members it just shows how richie likes to pick and choose and take care of the people he wants to take care of , hirschbeck said it s not a democratic union hirschbeck , ending weeks of silence on the intramural union battle , said he and other umpires who feel as he does have not abandoned the union we 're very prounion people , he said it s not about guys they call dissidents this is about guys who are prounion but against what richie phillips has done for several years now , and that s run a union that s not a democracy but a dictatorship the socalled dissident umpires feel as bad as anyone about the 22 umpires' losing their jobs , hirschbeck said , and are prepared to do whatever they can to help them regain their jobs we 'll negotiate with baseball to try to get their jobs back when and if our time will come , he said we have to move forward and part of moving forward would be to help those guys get their jobs back hirschbeck said the union needs a change of leadership as soon as possible this is nothing personal against richie phillips , he said it s against his way of doing things and what he s been doing to the union , the path he s leading the members down i do n't want to see more members lose their jobs , like the air traffic controllers hirschbeck said a strike , even if the board accepted the union s charges , would not be the right way to negotiate i feel very strongly about that , he said phillips declined to respond to the umpire s comments any response by me would lend a measure of dignity to his comments , phillips said
brussels , april 29 a straying nato missile fell on the outskirts of bulgaria s capital , sofia , on wednesday night , going through the roof of a house without exploding nato , which hopes to get permission from bulgaria to use its airspace for bombing attacks against yugoslavia , today expressed regrets about the incident it was the fourth time an allied missile had strayed into bulgaria , according to allied officers none of the errant missiles , including the latest , has killed anybody the latest missile was fired by an allied plane on wednesday night after a yugoslav antiaircraft missile radar system locked onto the jet the missile kept flying 40 miles east after the radar was turned off and landed without exploding on a twostory house in the suburb of gorna banya , an allied spokesman said bulgaria s president , petar stoyanov , visited the area to inspect the damage and kept his representative in brussels on the telephone to the alliance most of wednesday night to find out what had happened , nato officials said allied warplanes also carried out the heaviest attacks of the war on wednesday and today on montenegro , a part of yugoslavia whose elected government is opposed to president slobodan milosevic and his war against the ethnic albanians of kosovo montenegro s population of 600 , 000 includes a sizable minority of serbs and albanians the alliance spokesman , jamie p shea , said nato had had no choice but to attack yugoslav military planes that were using the airport at podgorica , the capital of montenegro , and posed a threat to allied soldiers based not far away in albania the agm88 harm missile that landed on a house near sofia is fitted on a variety of allied planes from various countries , seeks out radar signals after being launched but is essentially unguided if it cannot find any the warhead automatically disables itself when the missile nears the end of its range , up to 50 miles , allied officers said in operations yesterday , a nato aircraft was illuminated by a serbian surfacetoair missile radar and fired a missile , mr shea said after the radar was turned off , the missile strayed and landed in bulgaria thankfully , there were no casualties , he said we regret any damage he added that the alliance would try to clarify what happened and to minimize the chances of its happening again bulgaria is also a leading applicant for membership in the alliance but there is powerful opposition in the bulgarian parliament , which is expected to vote soon on whether to give permission to nato to fly over bulgaria in the course of air operations against yugoslavia reports from bulgaria on thursday said the bulgarian army had detected an unidentified plane in violation of the country s airspace about 30 miles north of sofia shortly before the missile landed it was the second mistake the allies have had to acknowledge this week on wednesday , the allied command acknowledged that at least one laserguided bomb had missed its intended target and gone off in a neighborhood of civilian houses in southern serbia on tuesday afternoon serbian officials said at least 20 people had been killed the bombing of serbian military targets in kosovo and beyond continued into a 37th day today , command spokesmen said , after pounding the airfield at podgorica overnight with almost 30 strikes the allies had previously avoided striking targets in montenegro , except for yugoslav antiaircraft defenses there , because its government under president milo djukanovic has distanced itself from yugoslavia s war against the ethnic albanian civilian population in kosovo while we would have preferred not to have attacked sites in montenegro , podgorica airfield is becoming an important operating location for the federal republic of yugoslavia air force , said brig gen giuseppe marani , the allied military spokesman aircraft driven from their main bases by nato attacks are using the airfield as a dispersal base , he said only a few dozen miles away from the nearly 10 , 000 allied troops in albania , aircraft based at podgorica could also pose a significant threat to those soldiers , general marani said thus we see our attack as prudent selfdefense , he said the strikes were aimed at military hangars , fuel tanks , air defense radars and singleengine yugoslavmade super galeb aircraft parked on runway aprons or in protected shelters , general marani said mr shea said some military planes had been destroyed in the attacks serbian news media had reported bombing on wednesday night near the main montenegrin port , bar , but general marani said allied planes had not made any attacks on port sites central belgrade hit again belgrade , serbia , friday , april 30 \( reuters \) nato

gov george e pataki and legislative leaders in albany have reached a consensus that some of the money from the settlement of the national tobacco lawsuit should be used to provide health care for new york s swelling number of uninsured democratic lawmakers have often discussed using some of the money an estimated 1 billion a year over 25 years to help the uninsured but now , mr pataki and the most powerful republican in the legislature , joseph l bruno , the senate majority leader , are voicing support for their initiatives in the past , mr bruno has spoken almost exclusively about using the tobacco money for tax cuts the republican governor s advisers would not offer details of a specific program nor the dollar amount to finance it , but they confirmed that they would like to see some part of the money used to help the working poor gain health coverage we will announce an initiative in the near future that will use some portion of the tobacco settlement to provide insurance for lowincome new yorkers who are currently uninsured , said john signor , a state health department spokesman mr bruno said he was motivated in part by his mother s death years ago , which he said was hastened by a lack of insurance he said he thought 25 to 35 percent of the settlement money should go toward health care initiatives , with a large chunk reserved for dealing with the uninsured , many of whom suffer from cancer and other smokingrelated illnesses that have drained medicaid pools in recent years a lot of the health care system has been disrupted because of illnesses related to smoking , mr bruno said in a telephone interview last week the tobacco settlement money is of great benefit if it is used properly the democratic assembly speaker , sheldon silver , has already said he is interested in using some tobacco money for the uninsured the speaker has said he sees the money used for combating teenage smoking , for school infrastructure and to establish a pool to address the needs of uninsured new yorkers , said patricia lynch , his spokeswoman every state is engaged in discussions in some cases allout battles over how to spend the nearly 246 billion from cigarette makers that will result from lawsuits brought against the tobacco industry to recover some of that medicaid money proposals range from antismoking programs to repairing sidewalks to new hospitals but in new york , many health care professionals , especially those that serve the poor , have insisted that the majority of the money go for the uninsured , whose numbers rose 191 percent in 1997 , versus the national average of 176 percent nearly one in five new yorkers under age 65 have no health insurance in new york city , the public hospital system can barely keep up with the numbers of uninsured , which are estimated at 28 percent of the population mr bruno recalled the story of his mother , who died at 44 after years of complications from a botched gallbladder operation and was frequently forced out of the hospital because his family could not afford health insurance most painful , he said , was the time that his mother arrived home from a hospital in an ambulance , which sat in front of his house all afternoon while his father went door to door borrowing money from neighbors to pay for it while his mother lay mortally ill inside i saw as a kid what happens when you do n't have adequate health care and when you do n't have funds for doctors , he said this has a lasting effect one of the things that is important in my life is that there be adequate health care for people some advocates feared that mr pataki would never support using tobacco money for the uninsured , given all the competing interests but health care experts noted that the governor was once lukewarm to committing money for uninsured children , then did so with fanfare last year by approving the child health plus program , which insures children of families with somewhat higher income than the medicaid limit in this year s budget , 2 billion in state funds was used to cover the uninsured of that , 15 billion was used for charity pools to help hospitals that serve that population , and nearly all the rest to insure children through child health plus the administration plans to spend millions more on enrollment and marketing campaigns for the program while any early promise made in albany stands a chance of falling apart by summer , health care experts and advocates said the bipartisan support was promising three people make all the decisions in albany , blair horner , legislative director of the new york public interest research group said , referring to the governor , the senate majority leader and the assembly speaker it is also hard for me to believe that the governor would turn his back on the uninsured , mr horner added , noting that this is the year that the state s health care reform act is up for debate and renewal a large part of that act is concerned with the charity pools while none of the leaders would specify whose program each supports , health professional groups , health care advocates and antismoking groups have started to descend on the state capitol with their ideas for uses of the settlement money the most ambitious proposal is a joint venture between the new york city health and hospitals corporation and 1199 , the union run by dennis rivera their program , family health plus , would offer affordable private coverage to working uninsured new yorkers on a slidingscale basis , aided by the tobacco settlement money this plan , which its advocates say would cost at least 1 billion a year , would be available to those families who earned more than the child health plus requirements but still could not afford insurance , single adults , pregnant women and others the group s plan , which is supported by dozens of health care advocacy groups , is modeled on the child health plus program , which , with 256 million a year in federal money , seeks to cover children in families with incomes of up to 250 percent of the poverty line , or 41 , 059 a year for a family of four you 're going to see an army of people backing this , said kenneth raske , president of the greater new york hospital association this money was built on the pain and suffering of dying cancer and heart disease patients and it should be put back into health care we think it has a great chance of passing
gudermes , russia , dec 9 russian officials vowed today to return the flood of refugees in a neighboring republic to russiancontrolled areas of chechnya by the end of the year the reverse migration of thousands of people appears intended to demonstrate that russia is making progress in stabilizing chechnya , that it is containing the problem there and that talk of a human disaster is overblown russian officials insist the move will improve the plight of the refugees , who have been trapped in primitive camps in the neighboring republic , ingushetia i want the people out of the tent camps and rail cars of ingushetia , nikolai koshman , the russian deputy prime minister who serves as moscow s senior representative to chechnya , said in an interview the conditions there are really bad whether russian authorities are prepared to care for the refugees they are planning to bring back is another question at the same time they are encouraging refugees to return , the russian military is urging civilians in grozny estimated at anywhere from 15 , 000 to 50 , 000 to leave for those same camps the russian military has laid siege to the chechen capital and has urged the civilians to leave so it has a free hand in pummeling rebels who have taken up positions there a few days ago russian warplanes dropped leaflets over grozny urging residents to escape the city or face a deadly bombardment after strong criticism from the west , moscow softened its tone , but did not remove the threat of a decisive assault on the islamic militants there to handle the influx of returning refugees , russia is hastening to complete several tent cities in chechnya but the capacity of the camps totals only about 15 , 000 to 17 , 000 thousands of other chechens would have to settle in towns that only recently were war zones and which are still without basic services the difficulty russia is having in restoring chechen towns was evident today in gudermes , chechnya s secondlargest city the grim city , which still bears the scars of the first war in chechnya , is being used as the administration center of the russiancontrolled part of the republic russian officials have touted gudermes as something of a showcase and they announced with fanfare several weeks ago that gas and electricity was being restored residents who gathered in the mudfilled square in front of the town s administration building said today that the city was calmer than it was a few weeks ago but today the electricity was on the blink , forcing deputy prime minister koshman of russia to hold a meeting with local officials in a darkened room a local hospital was without heat , and had to deal with the sick almost entirely on an outpatient basis residents complained that they received little food or other basic assistance we need help , said khamzat akhmadov , 46 , who said he had received two cans of stewed meat and 15 pounds of flour for his sixmember family since the beginning of the latest chechen war , the plight of chechnya s refugees has been a wrenching and explosive problem tens of thousands rushed to the border when the russian bombs began to fall as the refugee camps grew in ingushetia , the russians temporarily sealed the border , leaving thousands of people stranded in chechnya and setting off an international outcry ingush authorities say more than 200 , 000 people have sought refuge on their territory , but russian officials and some chechens here maintain that ingushetia has exaggerated the situation to obtain extra financial aid , and that the current total does not exceed 100 , 000 the focus of the russian effort involves thousands of refugees in rail cars or in tents not fit for winter russia also hopes to lighten the burden on ruslan aushev , ingushetia s president , who has complained about the enormous difficulties his republic is facing either way , the figure is enormous , especially since many of the refugees are living in trying conditions some are being housed in railroad cars to hasten a resolution , prime minister vladimir v putin of russia signed a decree last month ordering russian authorities to disband the refugee camps in ingushetia by december 25 and to move the people there to chechnya today , mr koshman said that was still the plan , though he said the deadline might slip a few days all the conditions are being created for their return , he said i think people will want to come back but whether all the refugees will want to return in the face of russian occupation is not clear to handle the refugees , tent cities are being built at znamenskoye , sernovodsk and asinovskaya the tent cities at znamenskoye , which workers are still rushing to finish , have gas heat and are close to schools , making them relatively comfortable by the standards of other camps but capacity is just part of what seems to be needed mr koshman said he expected many refugees to return to their homes in newly captured cities like urusmartan , which recently fell to russian troops that would reduce the crunch at the camps assuming the cities in chechnya can be repaired and supplied with heat and electricity if suitable accommodations cannot be found for all of the returning refugees , the russian government is considering moving some of the rail car shelters from ingushetia to chechnya , duplicating the conditions it is trying to avoid though mr putin talked about disbanding the refugee camps in ingushetia , mr koshman insisted that none of the refugees would be forcibly returned it is up to them , he insisted we will provide electricity , and i think people will come back photo most chechen refugees will have little to return to in the russiancontrolled town of tolstoyurt , 12 miles north of grozny , conditions are grim \( yuri kozyrev for the new york times \) \( pg a14 \) map of chechenya showing the location of gudermes gudermes still bears the scars of the first war against moscow \(

washington , feb 13 christmas was still six days away , but the holiday mood evaporated on dec 19 for senator olympia snowe of maine as she watched the house of representatives vote to impeach president clinton from her coastal home in falmouth , the moderate republican felt a sense of foreboding as she viewed the vicious partisan brawling that preceded it i knew that christmas was over that day , she recalled on friday after the senate , and she herself , had found mr clinton not guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice she knew , too , that the senate could not allow such a spectacle in its dignified chambers the president s lawyers and top political advisers were also in a grim mood on dec 19 as they gathered in the office of john d podesta , the white house chief of staff they were anticipating the vote that day that would mark mr clinton forever as only the second american president to be impeached , and were determined to make a new assault on the charges but they were not prepared for the bombshell that came first the announcement that representative robert l livingston , the speakerdesignate , was leaving the house because of reports of marital infidelities , and that mr livingston was urging the president to follow suit we were shocked , said one senior member of the president s legal team who was present as the group fell silent i felt , jesus , we 're at a point where we 're eating our own it genuinely scared me i was shaking the whole thing seemed to me to be very , very mean and very unstable the third set of actors in the senate drama the 13 house managers who presented the case against the president were in a different mood over the holiday season just before new year s , they gathered in the judiciary committee conference room , called the war room , to plan the prosecution they were almost giddy about the new role as prosecutors as they pictured a full trial with witnesses galore , fiery crossexaminations and , finally , the removal of the president the three major players had differing objectives going into the trial , and each achieved some of their goals the senators , who wanted a short and dignified trial , emerged less bloodied by the fiveweek proceeding than the house the president , after his lawyers made a far more aggressive defense than they did in the house , was acquitted by a wide margin but hardly vindicated and the managers made their defiant stand for principle but gained not even a simple majority for their charges and did little to repair the image of house republicans as hellbent on embarrassing the president the house prosecution team walked away with the fewest spoils their wish list of witnesses was whittled down to three monica s lewinsky , vernon e jordan jr and sidney blumenthal none of the actors could claim victory after 13 months of revelation and public revulsion but the constitution bore up well under the strain , and the president and congressional leaders vowed to try to forget the agony and the anger of the journey just ended mr clinton , in a brief rose garden statement on friday , called for a time of reconciliation and renewal for america and indicated he was prepared to forgive those who tried to get rid of him in the senate , members traded congratulations on the floor and said the trial might even have strengthened the institution i think we preserved the dignity of the senate , said senator phil gramm , a texas republican , who voted to convict mr clinton on both impeachment charges it ended as the founders intended it to gathered with his prosecution team in the house judiciary committee hearing room where the impeachment proceedings began last fall , henry j hyde of illinois was bowed but not resentful i have no regrets , he said quietly going to trial shared goal preserving dignity the telephone calls from jittery senators , haunted by the house impeachment proceedings , followed senator trent lott of mississippi , the majority leader , everywhere during the christmas break his cell phone rang in the middle of the cotton bowl , where he sat with senator kay bailey hutchison of texas at his side it rang as he bounced his baby granddaughter on his knee at his son s house it rang in the car , in the office and at home in pascagoula , miss mr lott spoke so often to senator thomas a daschle of south dakota , the minority leader , that the two practically had a hot line some senators insisted to mr lott that they wanted a short trial with no witnesses others wanted a full trial with live testimony all of them fretted about the impact on the senate , and they wondered if they could trust each other republicans and democrats to keep it civilized senator joseph i lieberman , a connecticut democrat , called an old friend , senator slade gorton , a washington republican , and one of mr lott s confidants , who was heading to hawaii with his family before you say anything , i know why you called , mr lieberman remembers mr gorton saying i was about to call you for the same reason we have got to start talking about how the senate handles impeachment the conversation was the genesis of a plan that would set the tone of cooperation that mr lott and mr daschle hoped to establish

east rutherford , nj , march 4 the nets are not a good team that is playing poorly they are not a solid club experiencing difficulties because of injuries they are a weak basketball team it is that simple what else do you call a group of players who allow one of the lowliest clubs in the national basketball association to strut into their house and whip them \? beat them like a college intramural team \? dunk and prance and celebrate in their faces \? the charlotte hornets who came in with a 310 record , with their stars glen rice and anthony mason on the injured list , with the haggard 34yearold chuck person starting at small forward , with a 17point loss to orlando the night before still fresh in their minds beat the nets 9682 tonight at continental arena the 312 nets , who have lost eight of their last nine games , are the worst team in the east and were it not for the los angeles clippers \( 014 \) , these supposed conference contenders would be the worst in the league and the game was not the only loss for the nets their center , jayson williams , who has played the entire season with bruised and broken bones , left the game four minutes before halftime after being dunked on ferociously by derrick coleman williams apparently aggravated his left thumb , which already had ligament damage , and was taken to a hospital nets coach john calipari said williams would have a soft cast placed on his thumb but probably would practice on saturday and play sunday against the knicks he came out and said he could n't grab the ball , calipari said knowing jayson , he 'll play sunday but that does not mean relief from this disaster is in sight williams had no points and only one rebound in 11 minutes in this game that was billed as the battle of the eastern conference doormats but this was no battle charlotte , even in its shabby form , is head and shoulders and torso above the nets the hornets proved that by running to an unfathomable 17point lead \( 2710 \) after just 6 minutes 58 seconds of play they proved that when charles shackleford snuffed a keith van horn dunk attempt , when person \( 21 points \) imitated the sharpshooting rice in exposing the nets' slow defensive rotations , when they increased the lead to 25 points in the third quarter the nets made no excuses for their sorry performance because there were none what do you say after a loss like this , point guard eric murdock said this is rock bottom to lose a game like this , a game that was a winnable game for us to lose like this is embarrassing it was embarrassing to be out there on the floor i do n't know what to say i do n't know how to fix it van horn , who led the nets with 28 points but made just 10 of 26 shots , met with calipari after the game and said he voiced his concern about avoiding team dissension i was letting him know that myself and some of the other guys on this team are going to try and keep everyone on the same page , van horn said i understand the time clock is ticking , but if we stick through this , we can fight through this thing and maybe we can salvage the season person , charlotte s unlikely leader , hit 5 of 7 3pointers bobby phills followed with 20 the hornets made 10 of 22 3pointers the nets , looking pitiful despite playing in their new and fashionable gray uniforms , got 17 points from kerry kittles the hornets made 10 of 22 3point attempts against the nets' molassesslow defensive rotations unbelievably , person , who used to be known as the rifleman but rarely loads up anymore , was the hornets' hero he made 4 of 4 3pointers in the dominating firstquarter run coleman , smiling as he was booed at the home of his former team , had 11 points and 15 rebounds and in keeping with the theme of average players looking like allstars , j r reid had 17 points and 12 rebounds doug overton , the point guard who signed with the nets on wednesday , had 13 points and 5 rebounds in 32 minutes the starting small forward , kendall gill , having his minutes reduced to 16 , had just 2 points calipari , trying to stay positive while drowning in a sea of negativity , plans to do just that , saying that no changes would be made when you 're 312 there s one guy held more accountable than anybody else , and that s me , calipari said and i'm going to try to do everything i can to get this ship right i'm not losing faith i'm losing sleep i'm not looking to make wholesale changes and break down a team that won 43 games we 're in a shortened season we 're in a screwed up situation this is about the long haul when i walked in here , i said it s going to take time we jumped ahead of ourselves last year and now we 're going to try to recover and really see where this organization is photo hornets' j r reid scoring over keith van horn last night at the meadowlands the nets could do little right \( michelle v agins the new york times \)
park ridge , ill inside a giant dominick s supermarket here , sam ventura was buying some highgrade pork chops at 399 a pound , mr ventura was not fretting this is n't a steal , but the price is fine , he said , unloading a cart of groceries at the checkout counter as his 5yearold son , vinnie , looked on we eat pork every week , and you never hear bad things about it none of that madcow stuff but to rick dean , a hog farmer in leroy , ill , two and a half hours south of this chicago suburb , the price was a disgrace while the pork products from just one of his hogs yields about 304 at the supermarket , he was paid just 29 apiece when he took his hogs to market a few weeks ago down from about 110 a year ago we 've got a lot of financial stress , said mr dean , a thirdgeneration hog farmer it s pretty discouraging what is happening to all that money \? federal officials are looking into that question after hog farmers around the nation complained that something unusual was going on , something unfair perhaps even illegal for more than six months , a glut in the number of hogs being raised sent hog prices plummeting to depressionera lows yet the price of pork at the meat counter has barely budged so while much of the nation is splurging on pork chops , ham and bacon , allegations of pricegouging are being leveled against the meatpackers that turn hogs into pork products , and to a lesser extent against the giant supermarket chains that sell them we 're very concerned about the prices producers are getting paid , said cynthia cunningham , a spokeswoman at the national pork producers council in des moines something is n't right meatpackers and retailers counter that government figures fail to reflect a significant drop in prices because they do not measure the amount of pork sold at a discount almost everything we sell moves at a special price , said tim hammonds , president of the food marketing institute in washington , a trade group that represents some of the nation s largest grocery chains retailers are aggressively featuring pork they also argue , with the support of many economists , that the traditional market forces of supply and demand largely explain why hog prices have plunged even though the price of pork has not fallen nearly as much prices for live hogs have bounced off their lows in recent days , with prices reaching 19 cents a pound on tuesday , according to the department of agriculture up from a low of 10 cents a pound in december it is no surprise that the farmers' crisis has caught washington s eye federal officials acknowledge that some pricing data could be faulty , but they are also concerned about the growing gap between hog prices at the farm level , which are down 65 percent , and pork prices at the retail level , which are down just 2 to 3 percent a spread that economists say is one of the widest on record agriculture secretary dan glickman has asked the justice department and the federal trade commission to look into possible pricefixing or anticompetitive pricing by meatpackers and the national farmers union is urging federal officials to investigate competition in the pork industry , where 75 percent of the packing is controlled by just six companies smithfield , ibp , swift , excel , farmland and hormel foods several large meatpackers say that they have cut prices about 30 percent from a year ago , and that they are working overtime to slaughter and process a record number of hogs , more than two million a week 10 percent more than a year ago there are hogs everywhere , says jens knutson , a spokesman for the american meat institute in washington , which represents meatpackers the prices are really what is necessary to clear the market these are market forces at work because of that glut , meatpackers are bidding down the prices when farmers call to say they want to deliver a truckload of pigs some farmers say they no longer shop around they simply ask if and when a packer will take delivery this gives packers tremendous leverage leverage that industry officials say may be battering farmers and enriching packers several big meatpackers acknowledge that for them these are good times indeed there s no question packers are making good money , said gary mickelson , a spokesman at ibp in dakota city , neb , one of the nation s largest meatpackers but ultimately it s the law of supply and demand as a result , after two years of losses , ibp has been posting record profits , up more than 125 percent in the third quarter of 1998 , and its shares jumped more than 37 percent in 1998 hormel , the large meat processor based in austin , minn , also reported record profits of nearly 140 million in 1998 pure greed is hardly the issue , though economists say that a more complicated set of factors is at work the probability of collusion or anything like it is near zero , said glenn grimes , a professor of agricultural economy at the university of missouri at columbia i just think the american people are n't that priceconscious one reason retail prices have not fallen sharply , economists say , is that soaring demand for pork means retailers are under less pressure to lower prices but that is only part of the answer

ellen young was one of the lucky ones like other residents of taiwanese heritage in new york city , including the many taiwanese immigrants in flushing , queens , she dashed for a telephone the minute she heard that an enormous earthquake had struck in the early morning in taiwan , where her elderly father and mother live at first , ms young , an immigration consultant who lives in elmhurst , queens , heard a recorded message yesterday saying that all circuits were busy now and could she please try again later tears welling up in her eyes , she punched her parents' phone number repeatedly until , after a few more attempts , she finally heard her mother s hushed voice saying she and her father were fine and that they were going to lie in bed and wait for the daylight no , no , ms young heard herself say , almost shouting , find a flashlight , look for cracks in the ceilings or the walls and if you see anything , get out right away , now ! but , to her horror , her mother said , we 're old and our life is near the end at last , ms young , 47 , persuaded her mother to inspect the house , which seemed to be sound news of the deadly earthquake in taiwan spread quickly by radio , television and word of mouth among ethnic chinese residents of new york city many of the approximately 100 , 000 taiwanese immigrants in the metropolitan region have settled in flushing , said mark lii , 45 , director of the flushing chinese business association , a leading taiwaneseamerican business group if the result of the earthquake is very serious , we will do something to try to help , said mr lii , owner of the ten ren tea and ginseng co , which has stores in manhattan , queens and brooklyn the earthquake hit about 1 47 pm yesterday \( 1 47 am today , taiwan time \) barely half an hour passed before the telephone started ringing furiously at the chinese information and cultural center in manhattan , which frances soong , the spokesman for the center , described as the de facto taiwanese consulate taiwan s official , and contested , status as a chinese province prevents it from having either a consulate or an embassy taiwanese residents here were desperate for information about the earthquake and especially how to reach loved ones , since the telephone lines to taiwan were jammed , mr soong said everyone is quite concerned about casualties , he said , but the center had little information at the flushing chinese business association , community leaders met last night to plan a parade in october celebrating the nationalist chinese revolution of 1911 but the talk inevitably turned to the earthquake , how to organize fundraisers and raise medical supplies , and perhaps even send a delegation from queens especially alarming to the community leaders gathered last night were the initial reports that the earthquake registered anywhere from 73 to as much as 81 on the standard seismic scale that measures earthquake force the quake that devastated turkey in august measured 74 on the scale moreover , taiwan s dense population was another cause for alarm twentytwo million taiwanese live on an island about the size of maryland and delaware combined , whereas the turkish quake was spread over a wide region in a country the size of texas whatever the ultimate dimensions of the taiwan disaster , the politics of chinese relations are never far from anything involving taiwan timothy chung , 48 , heard the earthquake news from a friend about 4 pm in his queens store , chinese herb and healthy food but none of the other chinese in the store appeared to react to the news , he said my customers are mainly from mainland china , and they did n't feel as much shock as i did , mr chung said that s all right i was n't angry , because in my mind i was already trying to call my uncle , who lives in a small town in the middle of taiwan he was unable to reach his uncle
ron dayne has set rushing records during his fouryear career at wisconsin he has collected honors in the past week and tonight earned college football s most prestigious the heisman trophy but none of that matters more to him than the prize that is 2 years old and growing , his daughter , jada she was with him last night at the downtown athletic club and smiled when her father was named the runaway winner of the famous trophy by a better than 21 margin 2 , 042 points to 994 over georgia tech quarterback joe hamilton just as she was in the stands at camp randall stadium in madison , wis , on the afternoons when dayne crushed big ten conference records , became the major college career rushing recordholder and had his no 33 retired jada is the reason dayne passed on the national football league to return to college for his senior year she is the reason he is determined to complete the 12 credit hours he needs to finish his degree in africanamerican studies he reminded his daughter of that again tonight if i'm having a bad day at practice or i'm having a bad day at school , i can look at her and forget all about it , said an emotional dayne , who was voted the firstplace finisher by 586 of the heisman s 922 voters i want to thank jada for being the biggest inspiration in my life dayne spoke often tonight of family , perhaps because he has worked so hard to build one he survived a fractured childhood in southern new jersey his father , ron dayne sr , was abusive to his mother , brenda his mother struggled with drug addiction when the couple divorced , dayne and his younger sister , onya , moved in with an uncle , rob reid , a minister in woodbury , nj dayne dedicated the trophy to reid and thanked his parents , who also were on hand by the time he showed up at wisconsin , dayne was not only far larger than his teammates eddie faulkner , his backup of four years and former roommate , thought the 254pound dayne was a nose guard but he was far more mature his coach , barry alvarez , quickly recognized this from the beginning , alvarez s prize recruit was a persistent visitor to his office and rarely confined their conversations to football dayne was a listener , not a talker he said alvarez taught him to be a father alvarez says dayne gave far more than that back to wisconsin football he was an instant celebrity in madison , alvarez said he has epitomized our program with his no cutting corners and going about his business dayne s natural reserve at times hampered his heisman campaign his postgame responses were often as concise and punishing as the hits he put on the unfortunate defensive backs who were often the last obstacle before the end zone halfway through the season , steve malchow , the wisconsin sports information director , urged dayne to smile more when speaking to reporters a lot of people have ron wrong , faulkner said he is passionate about people , and i think that is far more impressive than anything he has done on the field and yet dayne s bruising , straightahead running style has also been criticized despite his extraordinary numbers he topped 200 yards in three of the final four games this season as he led the badgers \( 92 \) to the big ten title and a second straight rose bowl berth he was the nation s secondleading rusher with 1 , 834 yards on 61 yards a carry with 19 touchdowns dayne broke the major college career rushing record set last year by ricky williams , then at texas , with a 216yard performance in a 413 victory over iowa in four years , he carried the ball 1 , 115 times for 6 , 397 yards and 63 touchdowns he was also awarded the maxwell award as college football s best allaround player and the doak walker award as the best running back he s fun to watch from behind , the badgers' captain , offensive tackle chris mcintosh , said as far as football company goes , the other heisman finalists represented the best of the college game hamilton , who was voted first on 96 ballots , returned georgia tech \( 83 \) to national prominence and won the davey o'brien award as the nation s outstanding quarterback he completed 203 of 305 passes for 3 , 060 yards and 29 touchdowns , and ran for 730 yards and 6 more scores vote margins for third to fifth place were very narrow by finishing third , virginia tech s michael vick joined herschel walker of georgia in 1980 and clint castleberry of georgia tech in 1942 as the highest freshman finishers in the award s history i only had dreams about a season like this , said vick , who has led the hokies \( 110 \) to the national title game against florida state in the sugar bowl his most likely rival for the heisman next year , drew brees , a junior at purdue , finished 11 points behind him , and chad pennington , a senior quarterback from marshall , was fifth vick completed 90 of 153 passes for 1 , 840 yards with 12 touchdowns and 5 interceptions while rushing for 580 yards on 110 carries brees triggered one of the nation s most potent offenses , completing 301 of 494 passes for 3 , 531 yards and 21 touchdowns pennington , an academic allamerican who won the national football foundation s vincent de paul draddy award as the top scholarathlete , led the nation with 37 touchdown passes and completed 275 of 405 passes for 3 , 799 yards with only 11 interceptions none of them begrudged dayne his moment he has been a great player , and deserved it , hamilton said dayne acknowledged the classy football company he kept for the evening but what mattered most was the family he has brought together jada sat

do you recall how bill bradley , the former senator , kept insisting during the senate impeachment trial that a special election for president be held if bill clinton were convicted \? remember the way he complained that vice president al gore s automatic ascension to the white house would give him an unfair leg up in next year s national election \? what s that , you say \? none of this sounds familiar \? of course not it never happened mr bradley was well aware that the constitution calls for the vice president to step in when the presidency is vacant , and that s that and the old athlete in him knew that you do n't try changing the rules deep in the game , no matter what the consequences may be for your own presidential ambitions what does this obviously absurd hypothetical situation have to do with new york \? only this a movement is afoot to change the city charter , in effect new york s constitution it says that the public advocate , mark j green , automatically becomes mayor should rudolph w giuliani move on after the 2000 election to the united states senate or other fertile fields this is going to shock you , but the most prominent politician banging the drum for a rules change happens to have his eye on city hall himself that would be alan g hevesi , the city comptroller \( it may also shock you to learn that mr green thinks the present charter is just dandy when it comes to mayoral succession \) here comes another jolt mr hevesi would rather not run against an incumbent mayor green , even if incumbency has not always proven gold for unelected chief executives just ask the golfer gerald ford officially , mr hevesi says he has taken no stand on charter change unofficially read in reality he has told fellow democrats that democracy is not well served by letting mr green waltz into city hall better a special election to decide who fills out mr giuliani s term in 2001 while he is off teaching fellow senators the art of compromise by now , you may be stifling a yawn and looking to flip the page fair enough no one is sure yet that mr giuliani will run for the senate , let alone win nor is it clear that mr hevesi s idea of a special election will get off the ground leading democrats like assembly speaker sheldon silver and the bronx borough president , fernando ferrer , another wouldbe mayor , give it two thumbs down still , this is more than an exercise in political inside baseball how this issue is resolved may well determine who governs new york come 2002 so it warrants discussion now , including these points from mr hevesi it is silly to compare the public advocate to the vice president the city charter is not the united states constitution , and mr gore is mr clinton s political soul mate , while mr green is mr giuliani s polar opposite also , holding a special election is not such a radical thought the charter already contains provisions for one just not , to mr hevesi s misfortune , one that could come in time to help him if next year brought us senator giuliani another hevesi point is that precious few voters understand that the public advocate stands first in line to move suits , ties and toothbrush into gracie mansion they should decide directly who gets to be mayor , whether for one year or four when in doubt , the comptroller said , let the voters decide now to mr green , who will get the last word to him , this move to change the rules in midgame does not pass the smell test , however cloaked in democratic imperatives it may be he notes that the public advocate and his political antecedents , including the city council president , have stood next in line to the mayor since 1830 , with the transition carried out three times in this century why change now \? just because fate decrees that it may work to the advantage of mark green \( assuming he is not so unlucky as to have the pendulum swing and the crime rate start soaring on his watch \) \? besides , mr green says , to change the charter in time you probably need to put it on the ballot this november , in an election year that has no major races the turnout would most likely require a microscope to be detected is that , he asks , how a city s constitution should be revised \? it s an appealing but glib phrase 'let the people decide , ' mr green said but is n't it really a fig leaf to cover up someone s political motivation \?
the ancestors of africans and nonafricans split apart almost 200 , 000 years ago , much earlier than previously thought , a study of dna in living populations has found the estimate is so early that it precedes by 70 , 000 years the first known fossils of modern humans the authors of the study say they cannot tell in which branch of the split the genes that shape modern humans first developed , but they believe the genes spread quickly throughout the other branch because of the advantage they conferred the study , published in today s proceedings of the national academy of sciences , also reports the first fixed dna difference between african and nonafrican populations the difference , which may be rendered less absolute when more people are tested , is in a single chemical unit of dna that has no functional significance several geneticists said the finding did not alter the wellestablished fact that different racial groups differ very little at the genetic level the new finding , if sustained , is surprising in light of two widely held assumptions about human origins one is the view that modern humans evolved in subsaharan africa and , in a later split , a small band then emigrated to populate the rest of the world the other is the expectation that only a handful of minor genes underlying superficial characteristics like hair and skin color would show sharp differences between major population groups the gene under study is part of an enzyme , known as pyruvate dehydrogenase , which controls an important step in glucose metabolism today s report , by dr eugene e harris and dr jody hey of rutgers university in new jersey , suggests that the archaic human population split first , probably in africa , and that the modernity typical of people today developed later dr hey said that he and dr harris selected the pyruvate gene purely for reasons of convenience it lies on the x chromosome , and by studying the gene in men , who have only one copy of the x chromosome , they had to determine the sequence of dna units only once in each individual they sequenced a 4 , 200unitlong segment of dna from the pyruvate gene in 16 africans , 19 nonafricans and 2 male chimpanzees the forebears of chimps and of humans are believed to have split into separate species some five million years ago , which yielded a time scale for measuring the rate of mutation in the dna segment though the number of dna samples was small , the researchers said their statistical analysis produced a meaningful result the rutgers biologists noted 25 positions in the dna segment at which their human subjects tended to have different chemical letters from the chimp sequence the differences are caused by successive changes or mutations in units of dna , allowing a family tree of the changes to be constructed assuming the mutations occur at regular intervals , like a steadily ticking molecular clock , the rutgers biologists concluded that the ancestral hominid sequence is 186 million years old this is about the time of an archaic human species known as homo habilis , and confirms the idea that much of the genetic variation in living populations is very old much later , at about 189 , 000 years ago , the researchers said , the gene tree split into african and nonafrican branches , a point marked by a new mutation found only in the nonafrican subjects at a place in the gene where africans have the chemical sequence gcg , nonafricans have gca , the letters standing for different units in dna in the genetic code , both gcg and gca specify the same amino acid unit of a protein , so the difference has no practical effect however , the date it implies for an african nonafrican split is substantially earlier than estimates so far derived from other parts of the human genome , which range from 100 , 000 to 156 , 000 years ago dr hey said these estimates did not take into account , as his does , the subsequent flow of genes between the separate branches , an omission which lowers the apparent splitting date the rutgers biologists cannot say from their study where the split took place , though presumably it was somewhere in africa but from the amount of variability seen in their dna sequences , they can estimate the effective size of the ancestral human population , which they put at a mere 18 , 000 people estimates from other genes range from 11 , 000 to 18 , 000 , numbers thought not to have been greatly exceeded until a population expansion began some 50 , 000 years ago dr hey said that 18 , 000 people , even huntergatherers , did not take up a lot of room , and that the african nonafrican population split could still have left the two groups close to each other , even if geographically separated when the gene changes that led to modernity evolved , they would have reached and quickly spread through the other because of the powerful selective advantage they conferred dr hey said his genetic data gave no clue on whether the genes for modernity first evolved in the african or nonafrican subpopulation given that the transitional fossils and many of the earliest modern fossils appear in africa , the african population seemed to him the likelier candidate , he said
gov george w bush s refusal to give a yes or no answer when asked if he had used cocaine had been old news since his first campaign for governor of texas in 1994 then , he rebuffed the question with the words what i did as a kid \? i do n't think it s relevant there the question and answer stood , basically unchanged , as the governor rose to national political prominence he gave the same answer to the new hampshire station wmurtv in february , and to the washington post last month in the meantime , droves of reporters came through texas and asked questions to date , none has reported evidence of cocaine use but in the last three weeks , the alchemy of repetition made the old question new news in some news outlets on wednesday and thursday , mr bush made it even newer news by changing his answer the process highlighted the changed dynamics of political reporting in this presidential campaign , which is being brought to voters by more news and entertainment outlets than ever before it also reveals rifts among journalists as they decide what is appropriate to ask , and what is appropriate to publish a question about possible prior cocaine use is a fair question to ask , said richard a oppel , the editor of the austin americanstatesman , in a telephone interview but it s also worth asking , 'how many times can you ask the same question without becoming a major part of the story \? ' mr oppel added we should not be part of the story where there s a clear fox hunt going on , it raises questions about fairness and the credibility of the press john f stacks , an executive editor of time magazine , framed the question differently in an essay in this week s issue of the magazine it s not hard to comprehend a national disinclination , postmonica , to paw over the dark moments of yet another politician s life the problem is that using cocaine , unlike having a bit of sport with the ladies , is illegal , and the country has decided to dole out harsh prison sentences to many people caught with the drug and , mr stacks wrote , the rationale for probing has only grown easier in this postideological period , since so many politicians are essentially saying 'elect me because i'm the better person' is there not then a compelling need to know just how good a person that politician is \? and , several journalists noted in interviews , questions by the news media about rumors about a candidate even those planted by the opposition take on a new life in the era of the internet , when widely consulted web sites like the national journal s hotline duly record every question , and latenight joke , about every candidate the bushcocaine question has bounced around washington and been referred to in the hotline for months , getting frontpage treatment in a wall street journal article in may the journal article , which looked at political rumors and how they arise , said there was no evidence that the governor had used the drug which would be illegal in every state the journal article documented how far the rumor had spread , and also offered it to a new audience the cocaine talk continued , but it did not approach critical mass until aug 4 that morning , the senate minority leader , tom daschle of south dakota , was the guest at a regular washington breakfast for journalists the subject of media inquiries into private lives was the topic of the day , and mr daschle made the point that compared with the treatment journalists had given president clinton , hillary rodham clinton and vice president al gore , governor bush was getting off easy a few minutes later , mr daschle was asked if it was legitimate to ask candidates about cocaine use it s a legitimate question , he said at least three reporters came away with the impression that mr daschle was challenging the news media to question mr bush about cocaine although others thought the two comments were unconnected mr daschle himself denied siccing the news media on governor bush but by the time his denial was issued , editors of the daily news in new york had taken up the challenge daschle threw down the gauntlet , said debby krenek , the editor in chief of the news shortly after the breakfast , she and other editors had decided to ask all 12 presidential candidates about cocaine an article by timothy j burger the next day showed the results 11 denied it , and governor bush held to his old response the next day , the cocaine question was the centerpiece of the fox news channel s public affairs program hannity colmes , which repeated the question about possible cocaine use three times in teasers before its discussion actually began accounts of the daschle breakfast were published in the chicago tribune , the omaha worldherald and papers in every large city in texas but the evening news broadcasts were leaving the issue alone , as were the new york times and the los angeles times the washington post had only an aug 11 article about the propriety of pressing the cocaine question
wallace rosenwach , a master builder of the rooftop water tanks that decorate the skyline of new york city , died last monday at mount sinai medical center in manhattan he was 77 and lived on long island he died after a brief illness , said his son , andrew the rosenwach tank company was founded in 1896 by wallace rosenwach s grandfather , and has been building water tanks that look like the tin man s hat ever since andrew rosenwach said that one of his father s achievements was in devising a way to construct a rooftop water tank in just 10 hours previously , mr rosenwach explained , it would take weeks to replace a water tank , and to go without water for that long was not just an inconvenience affecting things like drinking water and toilets , but also a serious fire hazard he had 15 or 20 competitors when he reduced the time to 10 hours , and pretty soon he had almost none , andrew rosenwach added but the rosenwach company , which has its headquarters in long island city , queens , does not have the field to itself its main competition , isseks brothers in manhattan , has been in business since the 1890 s and the two are the hatfields and mccoys of the business however , scott hochhauser , a coowner of isseks brothers , said the elder mr rosenwach had been an honorable competitor , and praised him as having helped to transform the industry from just answering calls to urging customers to do preventive maintenance rather than wait for their tank to break and flood their building water tanks are not cheap a standard tank for a residential building six or more stories tall must hold at least 8 , 500 gallons and may cost about 25 , 000 but they are often long lived in an interview in 1975 , mr rosenwach said , half the tanks put up by my father in the 1920 s are still there more recently , he told another interviewer that he had probably walked into every building in new york at one time or another so i feel very much a part of the city mr rosenwach explained that the material of choice for water tanks is wood rather than metal because the wooden tanks are more durable and substantially cheaper to build and maintain you put up a wooden tank and forget about it , he said put on a steel tank and there s continual costly maintenance rooftop water tanks are necessary in taller buildings to provide water for hallway standpipe reserves , emergency sprinkler systems and a regular water supply the croton reservoir ca n't pump water with enough pressure to these high buildings , mr rosenwach continued so you store water on the roof and release it down from there the standpipe reserve and sprinkler systems of a building are designed to provide water during emergencies , like fires or water main breaks born on oct 17 , 1921 , mr rosenwach grew up in brooklyn , earned a degree from new york university s school of engineering and attended the small business program of the harvard business school in addition to his son , andrew , mr rosenwach is survived by his wife , alice his daughter , barbara , and two grandchildren while most of mr rosenwach s customers were in the market for rooftop water tanks , he liked to recall that over the years there had been some interesting exceptions at one time , new york state winemakers used his tanks for wine storage one client bought several tanks for storing lipstick pigments others used them for keeping photoprocessing chemicals some years ago , a customer asked mr rosenwach to build a tank he could live in the result was a huge twostory tank , 34 feet in diameter and 18 feet high , with a spiral staircase in its center three men assembled it in three days it still stands , his family says photo wallace rosenwach , right , and his son , andrew , with some of their rooftop water tanks their company , rosenwach tank , has made wooden containers for new york city s taller buildings since 1896 \( roberta grobel intrater \)
business suits and briefcases \? yes , you 'd expect to see those on the metronorth commuter railroad and it s not unreasonable to expect a station to have a shelter to shield commuters from the rain , and maybe even a place to buy a fresh cup of coffee but a train station might not be the first place you think to turn for a dry cleaner if you have spilled red wine on a jacket , or if your favorite charity is seeking a place to hold a party all those and more are part of the life of the 18 stations along the new haven line of metronorth it s unlikely that many passengers will switch to a different station just for better amenities , but bragging rights are at stake here s how the stations stack up new haven if stations were rated on the frequency of public displays of affection , this one would rank near the top couples kiss or cuddle on the benches in the waiting area or at the platform , perhaps because the station s size allows moments of affection to go unnoticed amid the crowds travelers are n't the only ones charmed by the station , which was reopened in 1985 after major refurbishing before that , its main part had been closed for 18 years recently , officials of aids interfaith network chose the station as the site of their annual gala , and the local girl scouts selected it for their 85thbirthday celebration parking there are 900 parking spaces in a sixlevel garage and another 200 in an outside lot cost is 75 cents an hour , 7 for a maximum of 24 hours , or 60 for monthly permits tickets sales offices and information on ground floor food dunkin donuts and subway restrooms ground floor other amenities two atm machines dry cleaner a newsstand , union news , on ground floor milford please do n't ask mary van etten , assistant manager of the new haven taxi cab company , if she sells train tickets her office may be tucked into a corner of the milford station , but she does not work for metronorth four signs remind visitors that none of the taxicab workers are employed by metronorth still , customers of both companies find common ground inside the small station on the new yorkbound side you ca n't exactly call it a transportation center , but it is a waiting area for both the train passengers and taxi customers , ms van etten said on the new havenbound side , the milford fine arts council occupies a former train station , a brick building built about 1880 , the council s home since 1995 there is no waiting area it s quiet during the day , but at night it comes alive with photo contests , art shows , plays , movies , pageants , craft lessons and jazz parking 450 spaces 475 per day , 35 per month , 131 per six months , 220 per year tickets not sold at station buy on board food vending machines inside waiting room on westbound station restrooms on both sides of the track reading newspaper vending machines on platforms plans the state will take bids next year for a 25 million project to bring the station in line with federal standards for the disabled stratford when edith lipper catches the train at stratford to spend the weekend at her apartment in manhattan , she waits in her blue oldsmobile until the train arrives basically , this is the station where you come just in time to get the train , ms lipper said there are no conveniences if you want to hang around she s right unless you count a small coffee shop nearby that serves breakfast from 5 30 am until 10 , or the shell station restaurant , which is open for lunch and dinner but if you walk outside the parking lot and cross the street you will find the de facto station , a shopping area called station house square among the stores are the whistle stop bookshop and stationhouse restaurant parking 308 spaces 240 reserved for drivers with sixmonth permits , which cost 100 60 are for daily commuters , which cost 5 8 are for the handicapped tickets buy on board amenities coffee stand open on westbound side in morning the shell station restaurant on site restrooms available and newspapers on sale at coffee stand bridgeport judy tower , site security manager of the bridgeport station , walks into the women s restroom when she wants to show a visitor how much the station has changed see \?

seattle , nov 30 four members of president clinton s cabinet and hundreds of other american officials came to seattle this week to push america s agenda on free trade instead , they spent the day trying to negotiate their own free passage with demonstrators and tear gas mingling on the streets below , the united states trade representative , charlene barshefsky , was unable to leave her hotel to start the fourday , 135nation negotiation that was supposed to begin in an aging downtown theater the secret service would not let her into the streets secretary of state madeleine k albright and secretary general kofi annan of the united nations did not fare any better and by midafternoon the millennium round of trade negotiations that were supposed to start here this week were reduced to a series of frantic telephone calls between hotels europeans , asians , africans and americans who cannot see eyetoeye on trade could not even meet facetoface many of the midlevel american officials ended up in the lobby of the westin hotel , sipping lattes and waiting for security officials to signal that it was clear for them to venture outdoors but even then , there was no assurance that they could get to various meeting sites , because hotels were ringed by protesters mr clinton s aides here were clearly angered that the authorities in seattle , after a year to prepare , were unable to prepare a secure corridor that would have enabled the negotiators to get to their meetings but in public they refused to directly criticize the seattle police they faced a difficult situtation , and difficult choices , said gene sperling , the president s chief economic adviser at this point , none of us have enough facts to criticize how they handled it it was an embarrassing beginning to negotiations that the administration had once been reluctant to hold at all but , in a move many american officials clearly regretted today , the white house reversed position and president clinton volunteered to play host to the session here , in hope that opening the talks at home would give washington bigger sway on the agenda so far the focus has been on the streets instead of on the talks and it was not only downtown seattle that was suffering from gridlock so were the negotiations europe and the united states dug in their heels on one of the most contentious issues , an end to europe s subsidies for farmers similarly , there was no real progress on one of the big questions that the protesters were shouting about getting the world trade organization to regulate working conditions around the world india has so far blocked any real discussion , and american officials were scrambling , cell phones permanently attached to their ears , to drum up allies in their struggle to get a working group within the organization that for the first time in the history of trade talks would make labor conditions an explicit topic naturally , all sides were trying to use the protests for political advantage the french were delighted to see protesters echo their longtime complaint that free trade in agriculture hurts local farmers and forces them to market foods of suspect origin what s happening outside is having an effect on the negotiations , the european union trade commissioner , pascal lamy , said today the american desire to wipe out government subsidies in europe that make it difficult for american farmers to export their goods is even less possible , given the tenor of the protests , he said the american delegation , milling in the lobby and conference rooms of the westin hotel , insisted that the protests underscored the importance of moving labor rights to the top of the agenda the clear expression of concern by ordinary workers has to be taken into consideration , said sue esserman , one of ms barshefsky s top deputies , who recently traveled to india in an attempt to persuade its leaders that a discussion of labor rights would be in their national interests and that s exactly what we have done , she said american officials went to some lengths to argue that the protesters had not really disrupted their work the real give and take goes on in back rooms and over the phone anyway , they noted , as countries try to protect their most powerful constituencies and search for tradeoffs we are using all the time available , ms esserman said , though she acknowledged that the lines are jammed because hotel switchboards were overloaded mike moore , a former boxer and prime minister of new zealand who is director general of the organization , announced that the confusion has not stopped our work but without two of the world s biggest economic powerhouses in attendance , it was a bit like beginning an opera with the soprano and the tenor stuck in traffic while most of the thousands of officials here saw the cacophony of democracy on the streets , a few suspected there was a conspiracy at work one ambassador of a developing nation said he was certain the clinton administration had orchestrated the protests in hopes of shortening the time for real negotiation that , in turn would put pressure on smaller nations to give in , he said photo police officers in seattle used tear gas to disperse protests against the world trade organization yesterday \( associated press \)
washington , nov 9 split along party lines , the senate today approved a republican plan to raise the federal minimum wage by 1 an hour over three years , to 615 , and provide a variety of tax breaks mostly to the owners of small businesses the republican plan passed 54 to 44 before that vote , the senate rejected , 50 to 48 , the democratic alternative , a 1 hourly increase in the minimum wage over 13 months and more limited tax relief neither plan stands a chance of enactment this year , but it is a fair bet that one way or another , the minimum wage will be raised before next year s election president clinton has promised to veto the bill the senate approved if it reaches his desk in a white house statement today , mr clinton accused republicans of using a minimum wage increase as a cynical tool to advance special interest tax breaks in the house of representatives , minimum wage legislation has been stymied for months because of three factions , none of which commands a majority republicans , including the leadership , who oppose any increase in the minimum wage most democrats , who favor the alternative rejected today by the senate , and a coalition of many republicans and a few democrats who support a bill similar to the one passed by the senate except that it has even more generous tax breaks this afternoon , the house ways and means committee approved the tax component of the bill favored by the bipartisan coalition it would reduce taxes by more than 30 billion over the next five years more than half of this cost would result from lowering the inheritance taxes of wealthy families the minimum wage issue has divided democrats and republicans for generations , and the arguments have hardly changed since the first minimum wage , 25 cents an hour , was introduced in the 1930 s democrats generally hold that the lowest paid workers deserve a larger share of the country s growing bounty republicans usually maintain that an increased minimum wage would go mainly to teenagers , not to primary breadwinners and that businesses would tend to lay off workers rather than raise their pay in that vein , senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , argued today that the hardest working americans deserved a pay increase at a time of extraordinary prosperity without an increase , senator kennedy said , the buying power of the minimum wage will become the lowest in decades but senator pete v domenici , republican of new mexico , quoted studies showing that twothirds of minimumwage workers are parttime employees , more than half are younger than 25 and only 8 percent are female heads of households but the battle today was more over politics than substance in public opinion polls , more than 80 percent of americans say they favor raising the minimum wage democrats want to press that advantage republicans want their own bill to keep democrats from getting the political credit the last time congress voted to raise the minimum wage was before the 1996 elections in two stages , the level was increased to 515 from 425 the political imperatives have led both sides to refuse to split their relatively small differences democrats seemed perfectly happy to have the issue spill over into next year , an election year following the vote today , senator kennedy said , if we 're not going to win in the early part of next year , we 'll win at the ballot box the senate bill would raise the minimum wage by 35 cents next year , 35 cents in 2001 and 30 cents in 2000 , and would lower taxes by 18 billion over the next five years it would also allow selfemployed workers to take an immediate tax deduction for all their health insurance premiums , give employees a deduction if their companies do not pay most of their premiums , make pension rules more generous to business owners and better paid workers and allow 80 percent of the cost of business meals and entertainment to be deducted , up from 50 percent and it would rewrite basic labor law so that employers would no longer have to count bonuses , commissions and some other forms of compensation when calculating how much overtime pay workers were owed this provision directly challenges a law sacred to labor unions and might have been designed to taunt democrats these minimum wage and tax measures were added as amendments to a bill , favored by banks and credit card companies but opposed by many consumer organizations , that would make it harder for people to avoid paying debts by declaring bankruptcy scores of other amendments to the bankruptcy bill are pending , and its fate is very much in doubt as congress tries to wind up the session on the narrow vote today rejecting the democratic version of the minimum wage bill , the solid block of democrats were joined by four republicans lincoln chafee of rhode island , james m jeffords of vermont , olympia j snowe of maine and arlen specter of pennsylvania senator chafee s vote was noteworthy in that it was his first opportunity to break with his party since he was sworn in last week to replace his father , john h chafee john chafee , who died last month , often broke party ranks , though he rarely cast a decisive vote that led to a republican defeat many in the capitol have been watching closely to see the extent to which the son follows in his father s footsteps on the vote approving the republican plan , only two senators crossed party lines max cleland , democrat of georgia , voted for the measure , and george v voinovich , republican of ohio , opposed it
leading a wave of condemnation among the city s black politicians , representative charles b rangel , harlem s most powerful political figure , yesterday called for a boycott of a planned youth rally , saying racially charged speeches and violent clashes with the police at last year s rally proved that it is impossible for any good to come out of the event we hoped last year if there was an increase in the kids coming , the good would overcome the hatred of the organizers , mr rangel said at a news conference in harlem with councilman bill perkins , who reported that he was assaulted on monday by organizers of the sept 4 rally , called the million youth march but after the events of last year , we would not encourage anyone to get involved in the event other prominent black politicians came forward yesterday to condemn both the march and its organizers the statements marked a shift among the city s black leaders , who last year condemned the march s leader , khallid abdul muhammad , for his derogatory remarks about jews and whites , but grudgingly accepted the event as a way to mobilize young people , and in some cases even encouraged them to attend assemblyman keith l t wright of harlem , who last year tried to mediate between march organizers and city officials , issued a statement yesterday under the headline , enough is enough why the million youth march should not take place in harlem the state comptroller , h carl mccall , the only black holding statewide office , said in a statement yesterday i cannot abide by khallid muhammad s evil message , and i cannot support his march and c virginia fields , the manhattan borough president who earlier this week spurned a plea for assistance from march organizers , issued an appeal for all residents to douse the flames of divisiveness the efforts to isolate mr muhammad were driven by outrage over last year s rally which resulted in injuries to 14 participants and 16 police officers and by anger at the treatment of mr perkins , a harlem democrat who said supporters of mr muhammad surrounded him at a political event on monday night and shouted , we are going to kill uncle toms like you mr perkins , who said he was considering pressing charges , was offered police protection by commissioner howard safir during a meeting yesterday at a raucous news conference outside the apollo theater in harlem last night , as his supporters mixed threats toward white reporters with chants of black power , mr muhammad and other organizers said the calls for a boycott did not reflect popular sentiment in the community , and they accused black political leaders of pandering to whites unfortunately , the black elected officials are so far removed from their own constituents that they are afraid to stand up for the people , said shaunette daniels , a spokeswoman for the march mr muhammad again denied that his supporters had assaulted mr perkins , but then he added bill perkins is my brother and he is a member of the black nation , but he is a tom that bootlicks white people the organizers have yet to secure a city permit for the saturday rally , which is scheduled to be staged along the section of lenox avenue known as malcolm x boulevard in their latest request to city officials , the rally s organizers have said that , starting at 11 am , they want to march from 135th street to 118th street , and then conduct a program of educational speeches from 2 to 6 pm between 118th and 124th streets mr muhammad vowed yesterday to march with or without a permit , warning that there will be a state of emergency in harlem if the police department attempts to block the event he said the organization was committed to focusing attention on high unemployment , high dropout rates and a raging asthma epidemic among black youth we represent vision , selfdetermination and , above all , courage , mr muhammad said at a city hall news conference yesterday , mayor rudolph w giuliani denounced the organizers as reprehensible , but declined to say whether the city will issue a permit instead , he blamed the news media for paying too much attention to mr muhammad and his organization , the new black panther party you are creating them , he chided reporters they do n't have support they do n't have political support , they do n't have social support , they do n't have support in the community and by constantly focusing on them , you are creating them , and i want to say as little as possible to give them attention but for all the public criticism , mr giuliani s aides have been quietly negotiating for weeks with mr muhammad s lawyers over the terms of a rally daniel s connolly , the city lawyer handling the negotiations , declined to discuss his conversations with the rally s lawyers mr connolly , however , has told march organizers that the city will abide by a federal appeals court s decision last year that allowed the youth rally to assemble for four hours on six blocks of malcolm x boulevard

washington , aug 5 are the republicans , or perhaps the democrats , driving off a political cliff on the 792 billion tax cut adopted by congress today \? almost all republicans in congress and their presidential candidates favor it almost all democrats and president clinton are against it , and there is an election next year rarely have both parties sounded so contradictorily confident about the political benefits they think their policies , which they insist have been decided on principle alone , will bring with each side sated with polling data and focusgroup results , the conflict suggests that at least one side is taking a big chance on the voters but the polling data are not that clear people think their taxes are too high , but they are not very excited about the issue that offers room for ideology and , in fact , most republicans , though probably not the 982 percent represented by the 216to4 republican vote in the house , believe in cutting taxes and federal spending similarly , most democrats , though not the 976 percent their 201to5 negative vote represents , worry that big tax cuts could starve the government of revenue they think it needs to spend the bill would cut all five incometax rates by one percentage point , lower capital gains rates and eliminate taxes on estates the senate s 50to49 vote approving the measure tonight , after house approval by a vote of 221 to 206 \( one independent voted no \) , completed congressional action but the bill will not be sent to mr clinton for the veto he promised again tonight until september , when congress will be back from vacation page a17 today s votes , especially in view of the expected veto , have almost nothing to do with national politics as robert teeter , a veteran republican pollster , observed today , what s happened is they have both lost sight of the fact that most american politics is decided in the middle instead , mr teeter said , what they are both doing is playing base politics , appealing to their districts' more ideological , most reliable voters perhaps as many as 400 of the 435 house members are in safe seats , where they do not have to worry about swing voters in the senate , some republican moderates represent swing states , and tonight four defected but the republican leaders not only come from safe seats , but most also served in the house and reflect its way of doing business but why should republican presidential candidates have a similar perspective when the white house is not a safe seat for anyone \? today gov george w bush s spokesman , scott mcclelland , said mr bush commends the effort to cut taxes and believed that the money should be sent back to the people who earned it the taxpayers another hopeful , patrick j buchanan , even complained , the republican tax plan has been delayed too long in implementation and it is too modest but , mr buchanan said , the republicans are on the right side of this issue in fact , the candidates' situation is similar to that of their congressional allies none are yet running for president , after all what they are running for is the republican nomination for president , and the voters who make that decision are among the most conservative republicans around neither side gives the other much credit for intellectual honesty representative david r obey , democrat of wisconsin , said the republicans were not passing a tax bill but a political press release that they knew would be vetoed then , mr obey said , they could go to smallbusiness leaders or their favorite lobbyists and say that they had tried to help but that mr clinton had stopped them he said democrats , while they would like to be for tax cuts , too , knew from the 1981 tax cut that serious deficits hurt the country representative david dreier , the california republican who heads the rules committee , said he thought republicans were showing courage in voting to cut taxes when polls did not indicate that the public strongly favored the action representative jennifer dunn , republican of washington , said democrats' opposition to cuts that might curb spending was so intense that they would spend august telling lies about the bill if the pollsters did not provide obvious policy directives for either party , it was clear that their focus groups had helped write the scripts , as some words and phrases kept reverberating through the serial speechmaking that passed for debate the tax on large estates , which the bill would gradually abolish , was repeatedly called a death tax by republicans the increase of deductibility of business meals from the current 50 percent to 60 percent by 2007 was labeled by democrats as government sponsorship of the threemartini lunch , a bibulous interlude too much for even the senate on a slow day among democrats , representatives david e bonior of michigan and karen mccarthy of missouri , kept calling the bill risky representative rosa delauro of connecticut said it was an irresponsible specialinterest tax giveaway among republicans , the message was that the money was the people s , not the government s the chairman of the ways and means committee , representative bill archer of texas , said the democrats believe washington knows how to spend the people s money better than the people do we disagree we think it belongs to the people who earned it in the end , of course , 1999 is not forever even if the bill dies this year , this congress has another 17 months to go next september , for example , if polls that really matter to candidates suggest that a somewhat smaller tax cut would help incumbents of both parties , compromise could materialize in a great big hurry
the arguments have become familiar and , despite their poignancy , so have the images more than two months into the nato bombing operation , people who said at the start that they were following every move now see the war over kosovo as a story with a recognizable cast of characters and few plot surprises the only mystery how it will all end is not gripping enough to sustain attention i have n't been watching tv i 've been working , painting and quilting , said david gammons , a white plains artist who intently followed the first weeks of war against president slobodan milosevic it s still going on , i know , he added , but just shoot the man and be done with it it s enough already it s news that went on and went on and what else is new \? while nato members debate more intensely than ever whether , when and how to send in ground troops , the slow dance of diplomacy and consensusbuilding cannot compete with more personal concerns for the attention of many in a group of white plains residents who have been asked their views periodically since the bombing began two months ago i feel at this point i have given up , because i feel it s not going anywhere and nothing is determined , said dilia theodosakia , a retired secretary who had once been deeply troubled by her conflicting feelings about the kosovo war after we bombed the chinese embassy in belgrade , she added , that began to kind of shake things up and i was wondering whether something would happen , something would get resolved but then that kind of straightened out again mr gammons and mrs theodosakia have not changed their views on the war he is convinced that the united states should fight to protect kosovo albanians , and she believes that the bombing only hurts both serbs and albanians none of those interviewed retirees , merchants , government workers have changed their initial views , but almost everyone in this small sampling of public opinion expressed fatigue with a conflict that has lasted longer than any of them imagined it would still , those who supported the war said they did not believe the united states and its nato allies could walk away from it now nobody wants to be in a war , said kurt olson , the owner of a film processing shop , photofinish , in downtown white plains clinton does n't want it they are doing it because they feel they have to mr olson said he no longer devoted the attention to kosovo news that he had when the bombing started and he was trying to educate himself on the players and issues i guess i 've been moving on to other things , like the school shootings , he said , and lately kosovo really has not been a big part of the news at all but even as the war has become background noise in his life , mr olson has kept up with nato s internal debate on how to proceed the main point for him has always been that the attack is an alliance act , not only an american one he said he was worried now that nato members appear divided over the issue of ground troops the objections of smaller nato countries are not as troubling , he explained , because they know the united states and britain would probably supply most of the troops anyway but , he added , if you do n't have a unified nato force there , without germany and the others without at least a majority of the big countries represented then it ca n't be called a nato action still , unless it wins its point , he said , he does not see how the alliance can stop its attacks without damaging itself and the united states at this point , he added , there has to be a decision on how to end the whole conflict but the worst thing would be to stop now if a few countries say they ca n't send ground troops , and then we stopped , that would be worse than just few countries saying we 've got to continue mr gammons , the artist , said events in his own neighborhood had made him impatient with the idea of americans' getting involved in other peoples' conflicts he and some neighbors are up in arms about immigrants who have recently moved into rented rooms in singlefamily homes in their battle hill area of white plains that s having a direct impact on me , much more than kosovo , he said i am about to become an activist in my own community , so i ca n't even think about that it s not in my own backyard he said he still supported the aims of the war because he believed atrocities were being committed against the kosovo albanians but he said he did not want problems from far away to affect his life he has started to view at least one aspect of the war in yugoslavia the decision to resettle 20 , 000 kosovo refugees in the united states through the prism of his immediate concerns i would not want them to be brought to white plains , mr gammons said of the refugees i know that sounds awful and i do feel terrible for them but if there s a moral obligation , it s the moral obligation i have to myself , my neighbors and those who have invested a lot here martha mccauley , a white plains retiree , disagrees unlike most of the others interviewed , she still avidly reads about kosovo in the newspapers , as she has since the first days of the bombing , and tenaciously defends her full support for the war as a moral duty accepting kosovo refugees , she said , is also an obligation after all , we are a superpower and we are all different nationalities anyway , said mrs mccauley , who is the granddaughter of irish immigrants i think it s wonderful we 're finding places for them to go if nothing else has been accomplished , she added , the war has revealed to her the character of mr milosevic and the plight of albanians expelled from their homes in kosovo it s good he s been exposed , she said it took a long time to get him exposed , and now he could n't keep doing it without the whole world knowing it mrs theodosakia has tried to put herself in the place of the serbian people and , as an orthodox christian , she has found herself in great sympathy with them as victims of nato bombs she said she still felt battered by the conflicting and confusing impressions of the war i was watching television with my husband and we saw milosevic , she said he sounded so convincing then after what you see on our news , you get very confused because you hear what a monster this man is her earlier anger with both sides and especially with president clinton , whom she says she distrusts , has given way to resignation that the war will inevitably expand you see people scattered all over the place , losing their families and their homes , mrs theodosakia said and at the same time , this 'ethnic cleansing' has been escalated by the bombing right now i feel there s nothing we can do about it , she added demonstrations did nothing the president has his own way of getting what he wants photos david gammons at this point , there has to be a decision on how to end the whole conflict but the worst thing would be to stop now martha mccauley it s good he s been exposed it took a long time to get him exposed , and now he could n't keep doing it without the whole world knowing it \( photographs by joyce dopkeen the new york times \)

mineola , ny , dec 1 a month after republicans adopted a budget they said would address nassau county s fiscal problems , the budget process today began to look like a freeforall with no solution in sight with the county needing between 60 million and 110 million to balance the budget that goes into effect next month , democratic lawmakers called today for a fiscal summit to find ways to close the gap but county executive thomas s gulotta , a republican who is at odds with his own party , rebuffed the overture he said he would move forward on his own to come up with spending cuts and would consult with the legislature when he had more information this week he warned that closing the gap would require severe cuts and that he was not ruling out the possibility of layoffs unfortunately , the time for summits and studies has long passed mr gulotta said he added that he would meet with union leaders this week , but he did not say what concessions , if any , he would ask of them the county s budget unraveled on the eve of thanksgiving when the republicancontrolled legislature repealed a realestate transfer tax that had been expected to bring in about 60 million to help balance the budget and county officials had already cautioned that the budget could fall 50 million short together , that meant a 110 million gap balancing the budget will not be easy during the heated election season that just ended , the county became something of a contentious triumvirate , with its republican county executive , its republicancontrolled legislature and its democratic minority all vying against one another republican legislators blamed mr gulotta , the county executive , for pushing the tax increases that they believe cost them the election on nov 2 , when voters in the heavily republican county gave control of the legislature to the democrats for the first time \( they take over on jan 1 \) mr gulotta , unhappy that members of his own party campaigned against him , said their fingerpointing had brought about their defeat and the democrats blame both camps for driving the county into a fiscal crisis during a time of economic prosperity so when judith a jacobs , the democratic minority leader of the legislature , called today for a countywide summit in which all the interested parties could try to hash out an escape from the crisis , some of the other groups did not exactly jump at the chance peter j schmitt , a republican who serves as deputy presiding officer of the legislature , said he would be happy to meet with anyone but taking a page from the democrats , who have long complained of being kept out of the loop , he said he had not heard about the summit meeting until reporters asked him about it perhaps it was not surprising that mr gulotta turned down the invitation , given some of the rhetoric at the news conference at which the summit was proposed one democratic legislator , lisanne g altmann , compared him to miss havisham , the jilted bride in dickens s great expectations who sits alone for years in an airless room another democrat , roger corbin , compared him to a drug addict in denial ms jacobs said she was disappointed that mr gulotta was not attending , adding that she had hoped all sides would put aside their differences it s disappointing that the county executive is following up his lack of specifics with a noshow , she said since more than twothirds of the county s 22 billion budget is mandated by contracts or by state laws , county officials said that only a small part of the budget somewhere in the vicinity of 700 million could be cut to hit the 110 million target , they said , they would have to cut roughly one dollar for every seven spent and much of that money now goes to pay the salaries of county employees , they said anthony giustino , the president of the union representing the county s workers , said he was still optimistic that the budget gap could be closed without layoffs if the two factions of the republican side and the democrats stop playing political football with this , this budget can be brought in line in two , two and a half years without a single layoff , mr giustino said but it s become such a political football , especially on the republican side , and it seems that they do n't care who they hurt as long as they hurt each other in 1992 the county laid off 1 , 800 workers and demoted 800 more , mr giustino said , and staffing levels have not rebounded adding to the many complications is the fact that no one actually has a copy of the budget although it was adopted on oct 30 , a hard copy of it has yet to be printed and distributed h carl mccall , the state comptroller , criticized the county for pretending there is a budget when in fact none exists , and added that this emperor has no clothes four weeks after the budget was adopted , the budget is still not available for review and examination , he said in a statement released today even for nassau county , with its long history of irresponsibility , this is outrageous yesterday , none of the sides would offer concrete proposals for cutting the budget off the record , they mentioned the possibility of losing jobs through attrition , making layoffs and cutting the 25 million subsidy that the county currently pays for bus service in the meantime , county workers and residents worried about the loss of jobs and services they have left themselves no choice but to make deep and painful cuts , said matthew t crosson , the president of the long island association , a business and civic group the republican majority consciously left a hole in the budget
skopje , macedonia , april 3 speaking from inside kosovo , a top commander of the rebel army today described what he called massacres of civilians in parts of the province and continuing attacks by yugoslav air force jets , tanks and artillery against villages despite 10 days of nato bombing the commander , a member of the general staff of the kosovo liberation army who goes by the name drini , also asked for the first time for emergency air drops of food from outside countries to ease what he called a terrible situation the commander s account , in a telephone interview , could not be independently confirmed he is a figure well known to foreign journalists and verifiers of the organization for security and cooperation in europe and has proven a reliable source of information in the past since foreign journalists were expelled from kosovo last week , precise information has been difficult to obtain on possible atrocities in the province and the level of resistance being offered by a desperately outgunned rebel army but today commander drini said that he and his men were persevering in their fight against serbian forces and trying to protect civilians , who are fleeing the province by the hundreds of thousands he repeated an impassioned appeal by the guerrillas for supplies of arms we are doing tactical maneuvers to try and save the population from the serb army , he said but where we are using a unit of 50 to 60 men , they are up against a whole division , with tanks , artillery and infantry if the outside world gave military support , he added , we could do much more the yugoslav forces are still bombing villages with mig fighter jets , commander drini said , and using tanks and heavy artillery he said bad weather had prevented nato bombers working with full effectiveness even god turned its back on the albanians , he said for 12 days there have been no clear skies , and we have not had air strikes in his area of central kosovo , though he would not disclose where he was speaking from exactly washington and its nato allies have acknowledged that the weather has seriously hampered attacks by highflying allied jets , although they have given few specifics about their actions over and in kosovo no outside power has said it is ready to arm or supply the rebel army commander drini said that his forces were now fighting on several fronts around kosovo and coming under heavy pressure as ammunition and food were running low supply lines from albania have been cut , the rebel army said earlier in the week the rebels said the food situation was so desperate that they were having to use their own rations to feed the thousands of displaced civilians inside the province the humanitarian situation is terrible , he said people are under the open skies and it is now raining there is a lack of food and we are giving out our reserves commander drini , who said he was wounded this week , related what he said were three separate incidents of mass killings of civilians by serbian forces in the last two days he said 150 people , including women and children , had been found killed in izbica , in northern drenica region , northeast of the kosovo capital , pristina another 70 had been killed in the village of pusto selo , and another 34 people in jovic , he said none of the incidents could be confirmed independently the commander also said that yugoslav mig29 s hit a school yesterday in a heavily contested area of northern kosovo there were 200 people there , he said but fortunately casualties were low only 3 people were killed and 27 wounded refugees crossing the border into albania on saturday said that one target of the serbian mig s two nights ago was the village of negovac , where albanians from a halfdozen smaller hamlets had gathered for safety , according to several overlapping accounts given to foreign journalists and relief workers it was 2 o'clock in the morning , rahman helshawi , 44 , said the crossing in kukes , albania they bombed from airplanes twice and the village was destroyed there are many , many people dead commander drini said that while nato bombing was succeeding in cutting serbian military supply routes and would demoralize the military , ground troops are the only answer now to contain the crisis nato is exhausting the big war machine of the serbs , he said but air power never solves the problem we see nato ground forces as the only way to solve the problem in kosovo , he said nato knows that , and if they can help us with military materiel and supplies , we will be able to make enough trouble for a month until they can come in his call for assistance is not the first from the kosovo liberation army , and the message is now reaching western governments , diplomats and foreign military observers here said commander drini , 38 , who has 20 years of military schooling and experience in the former yugoslav people s army , is emerging as one of the guerrilla army s top military men until recently commander of one of the six zones in kosovo , he was promoted two weeks ago to the general staff of the rebel army , which seeks independence for kosovo he and others with solid military experience have been credited over the last year with transforming the kla from the ragtag peasant force into a wellcoordinated fighting force better trained and equipped than before , the guerrillas have engaged in serious fighting in recent months it fought off the serbian military in a battle in northern kosovo in december and in recent fighting has managed to inflict some damage and casualties on attacking forces yet it remains vastly outgunned nato shot down one mig29 jet thursday , he said , but the serbian air force still had five more jets in operation commander drini also passionately pressed an urgent request issued earlier this week by the chief of staff of the guerrilla army for countries to provide food and medicine kosovo is burning all around us , commander drini said there are convoys of people stuck , trying to flee to albania and macedonia they are fleeing for their lives i cannot describe to you the state they are in they are like zombies nato , european

with kosovo he said he would be returning to the united states to report to secretary of state madeleine k albright on saturday the united states has steered clear of showing support for the rebel army as a military organization , and administration officials pushed the rebels during peace talks in france to transform themselves into a political movement photo the kosovo liberation army needs

there has been a death in the family barry and sheryl schwartz are just getting through it is like a wake , like sitting shiva , the husband said , of the jewish mourning period i thought sunday was bad , the wife said monday was worse it s a grieving process it s going to take time at the moment , their loss is as vivid as a thud and a scream on saturday afternoon at belmont park , sheryl schwartz had just finished giving a kiss to three ring when , for reasons none of them will ever comprehend , the filly reared on her hind legs , fell over backward and fractured her skull she had to be euthanized , while jockeys cried and a track photographer fell to the ground , moaning the schwartzes own 100 horses , and they loved three ring not just because she had made them some money but because she had a way about her you know , my husband is around models a lot , the wife said , and she was just like models she knew she was a star she hammed it up for photographers as the chief executive officer of calvin klein inc , barry schwartz is used to seeing longlegged models prancing up and down the runway she loved to strut her stuff , the husband said she was a prima donna they fell for her in the year they owned her , but they were not all that unusual although racing has its share of abuses , most owners \( most trainers , most grooms , most exercise riders \) love the horses in a personal way that transcends the business decisions horses are not pets like cats and dogs , barry schwartz said they are 1 , 000 pounds of muscle , best left to professionals but she was something special , a chestnut filly with a great big white face i spoke to my trainer about her every day i am not the kind of owner who shows up on saturday and people say , she s running in the seventh schwartz has come a long way from his childhood in the bronx , where he cut high school to attend the track he parlayed his family grocery to make the first 10 , 000 investment in his childhood friend , calvin klein , and he helped build that company into a multibilliondollar enterprise now the schwartzes own stonewall farm , 750 acres in upper westchester , and the wife is a regular at the barns i'm more touchyfeely than my husband , sheryl schwartz said yesterday i hug the horses , but three ring was different you could go up to her and blow a kiss right into her nostrils , and she would stick out her nose so i should do it again they ran her in the kentucky derby , where she finished 19th , dead last , victimized by a slipping saddle after that , she went back to beating the fillies on saturday , she was entered in the mother goose stakes , and they converged in the paddock , along with the trainer , edward plesa eddie said , 'come on , sheryl , do your stuff , ' the wife recalled i gave her the usual kiss , and i turned my back , and i heard something was wrong normally , the delicate beasts come back down on their front legs after rearing up three ring keeled over backward , striking her head , flailing on the ground blood all over , the husband said i told eddie later that she missed him by inches it could have been even worse the husband rushed his wife away from the stall , knowing what would come next the handlers raised an oilskin screen and put the filly out of her pain she ran in the derby , 125 , 000 people , the wife said she never broke a sweat there is no explanation i was just sick to my stomach , to tell you the truth i just wanted to get out of there before the race they bolted the track , went home to westchester , and only later regretted not staying around to console plesa and his wife , and the loyal staff back at the barn we wanted to be alone , and then we wanted to be with people , the wife said they had to call their son , jon , who was at the airport , about to fly to italy on business on sunday , they stayed around the house , with sheryl schwartz cooking for themselves and their daughter , stephanie , and her husband , michael ferdman the phone and the fax were going constantly messages from hundreds of people in the fashion industry and the horse business schwartz does not insure his horses , but money was not an issue nobody tells you how to deal with tragedy , said barry schwartz , age 56 , whose sister died young , whose father was murdered at the family grocery , and who has lost horses before if there was one common thread to all the messages , it was that you never get over it , but after a while it does n't hurt so much , he said barry schwartz had been debating whether to fly to milan for the showing of next spring s line , but now he could not get on the plane on monday , he had to go back to the office , while his wife drove up to stonewall farm

headstone , wondering what to say about a filly who loved to be kissed on the nose i do n't think you love a race horse more just because she is a filly , sheryl schwartz said but it is true , when a filly is outstanding , it is a little more rare the way i see it , it s like your children a boy , a girl , you love them both , but this one was special spoken like a true mother photos barry and

robert frost a life by jay parini illustrated 514 pp new york henry holt company 35 robert frost wrote so well for so long that it s easy to forget he belonged to the generation of american writers who came of age during the 1890 s his contemporaries , born in the shadow of the civil war and doomed to hit the job market during a prolonged , findesi cle depression , were toughguy writers like theodore dreiser , jack london and stephen crane frost got a slow start , but he outlived just about all of them by his 40 s , midway through his life , frost had invented a new profession for the poet in the united states , combining sporadic residence on college campuses with a continual roving around the country , a sort of permanent campaign he was the first voyager , allen ginsberg remarked , a kind of pioneer , the original entrepreneur of poetry in his late 80 s , frost joined the newly elected john f kennedy at his inauguration , reciting his patriotic poem the gift outright in 1962 , frost held a personal summit as though he had been the one elected president with nikita khrushchev to try to iron out some wrinkles \( like berlin \) of the cold war it s hard to imagine a poet traveling farther or higher robert lee frost , that quintessential new england writer , was born in 1874 in san francisco his illmatched parents seem to have stepped from some nasty naturalist novel of the period frost s mother , pretty and ethereal , as jay parini describes her in his sturdy and wellinformed new biography , robert frost a life , was besotted with swedenborg and spiritualism her name , belle moodie , could hardly have been more apt will frost , by contrast , was a harddrinking , pistolpacking newspaperman who kept a jar of pickled bull s testicles on his desk \( meaning , presumably , do n't mess with me \) as an independentminded young man , will had run away from home in massachusetts to join the confederate army \( he got as far as philadelphia before the police remanded him to his furious parents \) later , he ran away to california , where he named his son after his hero , robert e lee when will frost died at 34 , of tuberculosis and drink , belle returned the family to the east and the strained mercy of her husband s parents robert frost was a brilliant student as parini notes , he became a better latinist than those selfproclaimed classicists ezra pound and t s eliot but he found academic rituals stultifying and thought the classroom was about the last place to pick up anything useful we go to college , he wrote , to be given one more chance to learn to read in case we have n't learned in high school he dropped out of both harvard and dartmouth , and married his highschool sweetheart with few career prospects other than a fresh , unconventional talent for teaching children english and latin \( the way to read a poet , he maintained , is to settle down like a revolving dog and make ourselves at home among the poems , completely at our ease as to how they should be taken \) subsistence farming and some teaching on the side became a pattern loosely adhered to for the rest of his life frost believed it was almost an article of faith for him in the intimate connections between forms and farms ten years of raising chickens and children and he had metaphors on which he could draw for a lifetime his first major literary success carried the populistsounding working title farm servants and other people before it was published as north of boston in 1914 , when frost was 40 frost was hardly the only world war iera poet to be deeply distrustful of machinery his anxiety about railroads and telephones \( they plant dead trees for living , and the dead they string together with a living thread \) is almost ruskinian , and no poem of his is more exuberantly harrowing than 'out , outa , ' his account of a power saw accidentally severing a child s hand his ethics and esthetics were artisanal we crave the flaws of human handiwork , he wrote during the 1930 s , frost was predictably attacked for his stubborn pastoralism malcolm cowley , scowling at two tramps in mud time , thought frost should have given one of those tramps a job but some of frost s most impressive lyrics date from that dark decade , including such downbeat masterpieces as desert places and provide , provide , frost s wry commentary , as parini notes , on roosevelt s new deal better to go down dignified with boughten friendship at your side than none at all provide , provide ! in the frost biographical wars \( initiated by lawrance thompson s authorized but rancorous three volumes of 196676 \) , jay parini is staunchly profrost , approving of his subject s many ways of providing for himself frost is the only character in this book his doomed children one a suicide , one committed to an insane asylum , one \( the happy one \) dead in childbirth circle him like distant , errant planets , lurching into view for the next disaster frost s longsuffering wife , elinor , whatever she was like in real life , seems drained of vivacity by her manicdepressive husband in this account , as she moves from pregnancy to pregnancy and illness to illness parini defends frost as husband and father , arguing that his displays of selfishness and insensitivity were within the range of normal behavior and mentioning repeatedly that frost suffered from depression frost s romance \( after elinor s death \) with his friend and secretary , kay morrison , which is the centerpiece , almost the centerfold , of jeffrey meyers s recent biography , is given short shrift here the relationship between frost and kay appears to have slipped into the platonic realm rather quickly if parini rushes through incidents embarrassing to frost , he tends to linger too long on his favorite poems , piling up critics to sandbag his own spillover claims he himself is often a much better critic and writer than the authorities he enlists does it really help our understanding of frost s great late poem directive to have its setting described by a critic parini quotes approvingly as a deconstructed land that evades the pitfalls of both town and farm even as it repudiates the possibility of an uncorrupted wild space \? parini is at his best when making claims for such neglected poems as riders \( the surest thing there is is we are riders , and though none too successful at it , guiders what is this talkedof mystery of birth but being mounted bareback on the earth \? \) , or when defending unfashionable poems like the gift outright against the view that the latter is a jingoist defense of anglosaxon appropriation of north america the deed of gift was many deeds of war parini notes that frost s conquerors seem more like a virus than a nation in 1958 , when frost turned 85 , his publisher gave a party in his honor at the waldorfastoria and invited lionel trilling to be the featured speaker trilling , who preferred cities to rural idylls , shocked everyone by confessing that he had only recently come to admire frost s work , specifically for its overlooked grimness i regard robert frost as a terrifying poet , he announced trilling sent a letter to frost apologizing for the stir his remarks had caused not distressed at all , frost wrote back you made my birthday a surprise party and then , in one of those swooping summations with which he regularly rewards his readers , frost added no sweeter music can come to my ears than the clash of arms over my dead body when i am down jay parini s sympathetic book might have seemed sweet music to frost , but the clash of arms will continue drawing
just hours after the four police officers accused of killing amadou diallo were arraigned on murder charges late last month , a team of lawyers convened before television cameras in lower manhattan and made their case against the officers citing the findings of what they called our pathologist , the lawyers described how and where bullets had punctured mr diallo s body they said mr diallo had been lying on the floor for most of the 41shot barrage in the vestibule of his bronx apartment building on feb 4 and they attacked the blue wall of silence that shields police officers the presentation had all the hallmarks of a closing argument by prosecutors , but it was an opening salvo by a team of private lawyers representing the diallo family in the civil claim they say they will eventually file with that news conference , johnnie l cochran jr , barry scheck and peter j neufeld served notice that they would go far beyond just filing a lawsuit they would be shadowing the criminal prosecution , demanding reforms in the police department and waging a public relations war on friday , when wrangling over pretrial motions in the criminal case begins in bronx supreme court , they will not be in the courtroom , but their presence will be felt nor is the diallo case the lawyers' only front the three men , who were at the epicenter of a national debate over race and the police with the trial of o j simpson , have now attached themselves to a halfdozen headlinegrabbing cases in new york and new jersey , all of which accuse law enforcement officers of excessive force or abuse of authority the people they represent include abner louima , the haitian immigrant who accused brooklyn police officers of sodomizing him last year two new jersey men , one black , one hispanic , who were shot by state troopers on the turnpike last year after what was alleged to be a racebased traffic stop , and the family of thomas pizzuto , the long island man who died in january after , his family says , guards at the nassau county jail beat him and left him to languish while all of these cases could yield sizable awards or settlements , the lawyers say they have taken them on because of the potential they offer for law enforcement reforms the cases clearly have their own momentum for reform , and many changes may come about long before the civil cases conclude but the spotlight that follows mr cochran and his colleagues will help keep attention focused on the issues the cases raise whether the lawyers' involvement is good for the prosecutors , who have the narrower mission of pursuing the criminal case , is less clear the lawyers' expertise and the information they provide in these cases may benefit the prosecutors but their highwattage presence may also pose dangers , like creating the perception that the private lawyers' agenda is driving the public prosecution their visibility certainly has an effect on public opinion , gerald lynch , a former prosecutor who teaches at columbia law school , said and to the extent that public opinion affects prosecutors , judges and juries , then there is some impact to it their successful defense of mr simpson in his criminal case catapulted mr cochran , mr scheck and mr neufeld to fame , giving them reputations as formidable lawyers and highpriced hired guns that renown also provided them entree to many of these cases , where they are working with local lawyers who were retained first and it gives them considerable access to prosecutors and public officials while it is unusual for criminal defense lawyers to suddenly align themselves with prosecutors , there is a continuum of sorts the lawyers turned their defense of mr simpson into an assault on the los angeles police department , just as they are assailing police practices now and it did not start with simpson as an assistant district attorney in los angeles , mr cochran prosecuted police brutality cases , and in private practice in california , he won millions of dollars in judgments against law enforcement agencies in brutality cases mr neufeld and mr scheck began as legal aid lawyers in the bronx , and founded the innocence project , which has used dna testing to free more than 40 inmates wrongfully convicted of crimes it is not uncommon , legal experts say , for people who allege that they were victimized by law enforcement officers to retain a lawyer early in the process to prod prosecutors to pursue a criminal case against the police but the impact on these cases of having lawyers with such unusually high profiles is hard to predict on the one hand , they can be useful to prosecutors mr scheck and mr neufeld wield considerable expertise in forensic evidence , and all three are skilled at trial preparation they have hired their own investigators and say they will pass on to prosecutors what they learn the bad part of the last few years is that everyone knows who you are people throw stones , mr scheck said the good part is that witnesses come forward
los angeles , aug 24 if the producers of the loopy comedy south park were to make a medical drama , it might go something like this an attractive female surgeon , heading to work on her first day at a major hospital , cheerfully asks a woman on the street for directions but is warned oh , i would n't go there they 'll kill you there ! then the hospital s new president jogs into a staff meeting and , in a scene that takes precisely 25 seconds , fires most of the doctors when they go to court to get their jobs back , the judge angrily instructs their lawyer to tell his clients he s a toad , then corrects himself , a big toad oh , and the ninehour operation to remove an inoperable brain tumor from a 9weekold baby is a success this is not south park it is chicago hope , or rather , the new chicago hope that was the plot line of the last episode of the spring , and it was , to put it mildly , a harbinger of changes to come in the direction of a fairly traditional and slowly dying onehour drama that cbs is attempting to resurrect from last year s ratings slump it is a highly unusual gamble , not unlike operating on an inoperable tumor primetime television series are tinkered with all the time this fall , for instance , the british comic eric idle , a monty python alumnus , is joining the cast of suddenly susan , heather locklear is coming to spin city , and two guys , a girl and a pizza place is being renamed two guys and moved out of its pizza parlor but executives at cbs and the 20thcentury fox studio , which produces chicago hope , said that to the best of their recollection no major primetime drama had been reinvented so suddenly chicago hope is , in effect , being hit with a triple heart bypass , electroshock therapy , multiple organ transplants and a fashion makeover , in the form of new producers , a new writing staff , the replacement of nearly half the cast among the incoming actors are barbara hershey , mandy patinkin \( who was on the show in its first couple of seasons \) , carla gugino and lauren holly and a new time slot , not to mention new opening titles and new theme music these are desperate times in network television , with audiences and profits dwindling rapidly the show s radical overhaul reflects the depth of the anxieties rippling through the industry none of the major networks , cbs included , have produced a hit onehour drama recently \( the most emmy nominations for a drama this year were for the sopranos , which is on hbo , a cable channel \) but in cbs s view chicago hope has a few strong points that make the experiment worthwhile the size of the show s audience has tumbled from a peak of an 119 rating and a 20 share in 199596 to a 75 rating and 13 share last season , according to nielsen media research \( each rating point represented 980 , 000 homes last season share is the percentage of homes watching television tuned to that show \) but chicago hope has been on the air since the fall of 1994 , and it is already being rerun on the lifetime channel thus there is high name recognition and at least a modest base of viewer interest to build on , rather than starting from scratch in a glutted market in which new shows have been doing poorly perhaps more important , chicago hope has a star who is assuming a more active role no , not one of the doctors in scrubs , but the show s creator , david e kelley , who is the hottest writer and producer in television after mr kelley started chicago hope in 1994 he moved on , as is common , and created his current successes , ally mcbeal and the practice this fall he has two new shows , an editeddown halfhour version of the onehour ally , and a show about private detectives , snoops seeing signs that chicago hope was headed toward cancellation , mr kelley approached people at cbs early last spring and said he would become a handson producer again if they would give the show another chance the network was initially lukewarm but finally agreed the situation reflected another reality of network television producers can earn much more money creating new shows than sticking with old ones as an executive producer , a veteran can earn 1 million or so a year , but a producer who creates a new show that catches on can earn tens of millions of dollars , not to mention a multimilliondollar deal with a studio to create more shows the two executive producers who had run chicago hope for several seasons , john tinker and bill d'elia , said they had begun to pull back from daytoday involvement in the series last season because they wanted to concentrate on developing new shows they said they were not unhappy about being replaced as executive producers this year , because it allowed them to put all their efforts into the three ideas they were pitching the networks the show needed some major changes , and we realized we were n't the guys to do that again , said mr d'elia we had our development deal , and that was what john and i wanted to focus on

san juan , pr , nov 15 the six defendants , aging cuban exiles in sport coats and suits , sat quietly in a federal courtroom here looking more like a faction from the local rotary club than a counterrevolutionary cabal none of these distinguished cuban gentlemen are any rambos , one of their lawyers assured the jury but as government prosecutors began today to present the first case ever brought in the united states against someone accused of plotting to kill president fidel castro of cuba , they quickly offered a different image of the men s activities pulling away a coverlet beneath the prosecution table , one of the prosecutors displayed a pair of big , semiautomatic sniper rifles , each capable of piercing a bulletproof vest from a mile away do n't take our word for it , the prosecutor , miguel a pereira , said he suggested that the jurors consider instead the assertions of one of the accused , angel alfonso , after mr alfonso , 60 , a textileplant manager , was arrested in 1997 even though he will go to jail , federal agents recounted mr alfonso as saying , once he gets out he will attempt a second mission to assassinate castro because his sole mission in life is to kill castro the longawaited trial thus began with the jurors weighing two seemingly improbable theories the prosecution suggested a plot so bumbling that two of the tiredlooking defendants had turned in a rental car in miami with boxes of 50caliber ammunition in the trunk \( the rental agency quickly called the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms \) lawyers for the defendants may have cast them even more implausibly as stubborn cuban patriots who went to great lengths to sneak onto a venezuelan island where mr castro was to attend a regional summit meeting , not to kill him but to demonstrate peacefully against his presence and to help rescue any members of his entourage who might want to defect traveling aboard a 46foot cabin cruiser , the men brought the rifles , as well as nightvision goggles , a radio scanner , satellitepositioning units and camouflage gear , because they needed protection , one of their lawyers said the six men face charges including conspiracy to murder an internationally protected person , possession of illegal weapons and making false statements to investigators all of them could face life imprisonment if convicted the case against a seventh man , juan b marquez , was postponed because he has cancer he is also facing trial with his son and other defendants in a separate federal drugtrafficking case there was no mention in court today of the relationship that has drawn particular attention to the case the ties of several of the accused men to the cuban american national foundation , one of the most powerful ethnic lobbying groups in the united states the closest that mr pereira , the prosecutor , came to mentioning the foundation was to note that one of the two barrett sniper rifles was bought in 1995 by one francisco hernandez but he did not mention that mr hernandez , who has not been charged in the case , is the organization s president in outlining his case , mr pereira stuck mainly to mr alfonso s admissions and the circumstantial evidence that was discovered after coast guard officers stopped four of the defendants aboard the cabin cruiser esperanza on oct 27 , 1997 after the weapons were discovered and the men were arrested , mr alfonso told federal agents that the rifles were his and that he had brought them on the boat to kill mr castro but the prosecutors , concerned about the legal impediments to using the statements of one defendant against the others , agreed to use all but one of his statements against only him mr alfonso s lawyer asserted that he had simply made up that threat in an angry and frustrated attempt to get attention the commander of the coast guard cutter testified that the men first said they were fishing , but gave the wrong registration numbers for the boat and claimed to have traveled the nearly 900 miles from miami in just a day later they said they were headed to sell the boat in st lucia after the men were persuaded to dock at aguadilla , pr , ostensibly to repair leaks , federal agents discovered the weapons and other equipment in a secret storage area on board in interviews last year , cuban security officials said that at least four of the seven defendants in the case had considerable histories of terrorist plotting against the castro government and that at least two of them had had ties to the cia the officials asserted that many of the incidents in a wave of anticastro attacks between 1992 and 1997 had been carried out by a secret militant cell within the cuban american national foundation while several of the men acknowledged having taken part in anticommunist plots for which they were jailed in cuba , both they and the foundation vehemently deny using violent means against mr castro in recent years and if investigators were able to penetrate the conspiracy that the prosecutors described , there was no sign of it today still , if the prosecutors had hoped to keep politics out of the case , they were quickly disappointed the defense lawyers went on at great length about their clients' patriotism , rarely missing a chance to draw parallels between the struggles of rightwing cuban exiles and those of puerto rican nationalists who are generally found on the other end of the ideological spectrum photo jose antonio llama , second from left , and angel alfonso , right , are among seven men accused of a plot against fidel castro \(

trenton , dec 13 in many poor communities , renttoown furniture outlets often stir the same mixed emotions as utility companies both businesses provide necessities , but their steep prices often breed resentment so it is little wonder that the industry s annual efforts to win favorable legislation from the new jersey legislature often involve the inflammatory issues of race and class this year s battle , over a bill that would exempt renttoown businesses from the state s laws limiting interest rates on lending , has also been fueled by big money and as lawmakers rush to finish their business before the end of the legislative session on jan 10 , it has become one of trenton s most bitterly contested issues renttoown advocates , who say their high prices are necessary because they provide a costly service for a market no other businesses will enter , have given tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions in the last two years and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbying they hired three of trenton s most powerful lobbying firms to sway legislators renttoown dealers also set off a split in the state s national association for the advancement of colored people by hiring its former public affairs director to lobby for the bill after a squabble among civil rights leaders and heated debates between members of the black and latino caucus , opponents of the bill managed today to prevent the measure from coming up for a vote but supporters of the bill say they may mount one last charge to push the measure through both the assembly and the state senate on the day of the final voting session , so the battle may not be over industry officials say the new jersey proposal , which is similar to new york state s law , is actually a consumer protection measure because it would mandate that renttoown dealers disclose the total cost of an item on every price tag the bill would allow customers to use their renttoown records as a credit reference , but would forbid the companies to file negative credit reports against those who failed to pay but consumer advocates oppose the bill because it would shield renttoown dealers from lawsuits by making it legal for them to charge up to 200 percent of the retail price of a piece of furniture before customers would gain ownership in the past three years , the industry has lost or settled several costly classaction suits charging violations of the state s consumer fraud laws , and in one case a passaic county judge criticized the shops for charging unconscionably high rates consumer groups have asked to limit the purchase price on renttoown items to 130 percent advocacy groups say that in poor neighborhoods , where many residents do not have the financial wherewithal to get credit cards , there is little choice but to patronize renttoown shops curtis fisher , executive director of new jersey public interest research group , said his organization s survey found that renttoown businesses charged annual interest rates of 125 percent for a 14cubicfoot refrigerator , and as high as 200 percent the practice of charging too much for a piece of merchandise is n't capitalism , said assemblywoman loretta weinberg , a bergen county democrat it s loan sharking in the past , those arguments helped opponents of renttoown legislation prevail over their betterfinanced , betterorganized foes but during this legislative session , which began in january 1998 , renttoown businesses have given more than 40 , 000 to political candidates from both parties , state records show the industry also spent more than 80 , 000 on lobbying firms in 1997 and 220 , 000 in 1998 , a study by the new jersey public interest research group shows the most controversial move in the industry s campaign was the decision to hire walter fields , the former naacp political action director he helped win the endorsement of the black ministers' council of new jersey and its director , the rev reginald t jackson , new jersey s most prominent civil rights leader late last week , mr fields also used his influence within the state naacp to persuade the group s newly elected director to issue a letter dropping the group s longstanding opposition to the bill but at the group s quarterly meeting last weekend , naacp members overruled their director and voted to renew their opposition to the bill some members also criticized mr fields for working for an industry that is mistrusted in many black neighborhoods it s unfortunate that people have to racialize this , said mr fields , who is black and it s just wrong for people to think that every black person should have a preprogrammed position on this issue by today , the naacp s actions persuaded craig stanley , one of the democratic cosponsors , to withdraw his support for the bill unless certain amendments were added assemblyman joseph charles , director of the black and latino caucus , said that a heated discussion among his members also swayed two democrats who had briefly considered supporting the bill republican sponsors of the bill , who needed three democratic votes , suddenly found they had none , and were forced to withdraw it but dale florio , an industry lobbyist , said the fight had not ended until the session ends , there s always a possibility , he said so if you 're asking if we 've given up , the answer is no
ottawa for just about as long as there has been a border with the united states , some canadians have believed that americans covet their country and the resources it contains a few conspiracy subscribers still believe washington harbors ambitions about northern expansion similar to those that provoked the first armed incursion into what is now canada in the 18th century and a certain type of canadian is sure that freetrade agreements are a plot to make canada a commercial colony of the united states but there is one subject that leaves a broad range of even normally cleareyed and levelheaded canadians looking for american subterfuge fresh water from the thunderous torrent at niagara falls to the perpetually rainy coast of british columbia , canada is awash in more fresh water than almost any other place on earth but although it contains 20 percent of the world s known freshwater resources , canada believes it has little or none to spare americans have often disagreed , and over the years entrepreneurs have come up with grand plans to get their hands on some of canada s water , including recent projects involving huge tankers that would be used to ship fresh water out of canada vocal public opposition pushed the canadian government to impose a temporary ban on the bulk exports of fresh water it is not just a commodity , foreign minister lloyd axworthy said after announcing a temporary nationwide moratorium in february the moratorium will be in place until all 10 provinces , which share jurisdiction over lakes and rivers with the federal government , can come up with a way to ban water exports permanently mr axworthy says he believes that unless something is done , bulk fresh water could become a commercial good covered by the provisions of the north american free trade agreement , and therefore subject to continental exploitation maude barlow , chairwoman of the council of canadians , a national citizens group with 100 , 000 members , agrees she said she fears that privatization and trade agreements are cementing rights so clearly that governments are going to forfeit the right to make decisions on this soon bottled water is already covered under nafta , but some canadians worry that any export permit issued by a single canadian province or american state for bulk water would make it a tradeable good throughout north america similarly , any attempt simply to ban water exports would actually acknowledge that fresh water in lakes and rivers is a commodity and bring it under tradeagreement regulations but while some canadians are horrified by the idea of shipping fresh water , others have been busy figuring out ways to get as much water out as quickly and as inexpensively as possible to california or any other place in the world that wants to buy it one company in newfoundland , mccurdy enterprises , wants to harvest about 13 billion gallons of crystalclear water a year from gisborne lake , an 11squaremile lake in remote newfoundland the water would be carried by pipeline five miles to the coastal town of grand lapierre , where it would be loaded onto scrubbed , singlehull oil tankers that can no longer legally be used to haul oil mccurdy enterprises also plans to open a waterbottling plant in grand lapierre that will employ 150 people local officials support the project , as did the province until federal officials from ottawa leaned on them to adopt the temporary ban on water exports last year , nova group of sault ste marie applied for and was granted a permit from the province of ontario to skim off 158 million gallons of water a year from lake superior and ship it in bulk tankers to asia after word leaked out about the company s permit , a storm of public protest arose and provincial leaders revoked the license in 1991 , british columbia actually gave six canadian companies licenses to export bulk shipments of water but long before any tanker could be loaded , the province reversed itself and imposed a moratorium on bulkwater exports that continues today british columbia eventually compensated the canadian company in the joint venture for the business it lost , but a similar offer for the american partner has never been completed the american company , sun belt international , recently challenged the canadian government under chapter 11 of the north american free trade agreement , arguing its claim had been ignored because it is american we were expecting the same treatment , said jack b lindsey , chairman of sun belt international , and what we got were stalls ms barlow worries that the sun belt claim could somehow be used by united states officials to pry away canada s water but she is more concerned about the one big bulkwaterexport project in north america that is moving forward the global water corporation , a canadian company , has a bulkwater purchase agreement with the small alaskan community of sitka to siphon off five billion gallons of water a year from the glacierfed blue lake and export it to china there , local handlers will put the water into fivegallon jugs for sale to china the head of global , fred paley , is a canadian who founded the local company that received the settlement from british columbia for the nullified export license mr lindsey of sun belt is a shareholder in global as well mr paley said he could not help but compare his experience in british columbia with that in sitka , where the local assembly has welcomed him warmly we 're talking about water from remote areas , flowing into the pacific ocean , mr paley said he says he thinks exporting water would not hurt canada at all and would aid people in other parts of the world he said the position opposing water exports taken by british columbia and ottawa is just plain wrong there s no reason why we canadians should n't be exporting it , he said
washington , jan 23 as vice president , al gore has traveled to california so many times that aides have lost count they think his latest trip this weekend , his second of the year already , is the 52d but they are not eager to bet on it while the exact number does not matter much , what mr gore has done there behind the scenes probably does over the last three years , he has built a prodigious network of constituent groups and contributors to help him win california s 54 electoral votes , the most of any state , and help him become the fifth incumbent vice president to capture the white house by election \( the others were john adams , thomas jefferson , martin van buren and george bush \) california has always been critical in the presidential equation but by moving up its primary to join new york and eight other states on march 7 in 2000 , just weeks after the first two election tests , the iowa caucuses and new hampshire primary , california s primary holds lifethreatening powers over underfinanced campaigns that are still forming while that may suggest an urgent need to organize and tap financial sources , mr gore appears to be the only aspirant from either party who has amassed a powerful array of support at this early juncture of the 2000 campaign and the advantage appears compelling do n't forget , we 're just at the very beginning , said gina glantz , campaign manager for bill bradley , the former new jersey senator who recently entered the presidential race sooner more than later , we 'll have a more formal organization in california but we 're just getting started that is apparently more than any other democrat challenging mr gore has done art torres , chairman of the california democratic party , said any others who might be contemplating a run , like senator john kerry of massachusetts , had not significantly raised their profiles in the state the fact that the primary is so early , they should have started organizing six months ago , mr torres said if they would ask me for advice now , i 'd tell them not to waste their money mr bradley , who lectured at stanford university after his three terms in the senate , is not without considerable ties to california he has campaigned for democrats from swing districts , like representatives ellen o tauscher and gary a condit , and his friendship with michael d eisner , the chairman of the walt disney company , could lead to big contributions but the reality is , gore is leaps and bounds in front , said representative loretta sanchez of orange county , a director of mr gore s political action committee , leadership '98 , and an incoming chairwoman of the democratic national committee , a position that requires neutrality mr gore s strength in california flows directly from the power of incumbency and instant access to air force two , a combination that allows him to deliver federal largess and to campaign for democrats whenever he wants and often on the same trip the mix worked especially well last year on a dozen visits , he announced grants and programs worth more than 550 million , and almost every democrat running for statewide office won in november , including gray davis , the state s first democratic governor in 16 years just as he did in planning for this weekend , mr gore has always made special efforts to court the same groups that twice turned out money and votes for president clinton , including hispanic and black voters and people in the entertainment industry through science and technology issues , long a passion of his , mr gore has tried expanding that base by impressing environmentalists and silicon valley executives with his knowledge of topics like salmon as an indicator species and massive parallel computing in addition , he has taken unusual steps to familiarize himself with hightech issues , meeting periodically with small groups of industry representatives at all levels gore techs , his aides call them to discuss new and future technologies he gave an address on forestry , water issues and clean air about a year ago at lake tahoe , said ruth hunter , a board member of the california league of conservation voters he was more informed than some of the enviros while environmentalists have typically supported democrats , that has not necessarily been the case with people in hightech fields , whose philosophies tend to be more libertarian and progressive than democrat and republican but jerry yang , a cofounder of yahoo , the internet portal , said he and other hightech executives had grown to respect mr gore for interest in issues vital to internet growth , like privacy and electronic commerce in one meeting i was in with him , he talked very eloquently about network economics , how decision making can be distributed in the network world , mr yang said it s good to see that he can think about these things and not reduce himself to sound bites would mr yang put any republicans in the same category as mr gore \? nobody i know as a presidential candidate , he said
mineola , ny , aug 6 nassau county s financial problems get deeper every day but somehow the republicans who run the county government do not seem to be all that troubled they ran up a staggering 300 million deficit on the current budget of 21 billion , then reasoned that a surplus would have been worse because it would have meant that residents had been overtaxed the rich and economically booming county s bond rating sank to near junk level , and they noted that nassau could still borrow plenty of money , albeit at a much stiffer price during the drive to pass a new state budget in albany this week , nassau s republican leaders persuaded the taxcutminded governor and state senate to force a new countywide propertytransfer tax through the state assembly , costing anyone selling property 1 , 000 for every 100 , 000 in the price nassau democrats got none of the fiscal oversight measures they had demanded in return yet anyone expecting republicans here to be on the defensive would be mistaken the county executive , thomas s gulotta , spent an hour this afternoon discussing the county s financial predicament in an interview , but never acknowledged any responsibility for having created it he attributed the deficit to a series of oneshot measures that he had counted on to produce enough revenue to avert propertytax increases but by happenstance , he said , the revenue was late in materializing without exactly saying that his reliance on those revenues had been unwise , he promised to restore structural integrity to the county s finances as soon as he issued his budget for 2000 this fall , and to see that recurring expenditures \( like salaries and supplies \) were paid for with recurring revenues \( like taxes and fees \) a step that bondrating agencies have demanded for years but in the same breath , mr gulotta raised doubt about how much he was promising to fix , and how soon we may be talking about a budget that laps over into a twoyear fiscal plan , he said and then , he added for the most part i ca n't say to you without any exception , because i do n't want to mislead anybody but for the most part , recurring expenditures are going to be offset by recurring revenues mr gulotta need not hurry it became clear this week that , despite signs that nassau democrats were becoming more aggressive under the new county democratic leader , assemblyman thomas p dinapoli , republicans still could easily outmaneuver the nassau democrats , at least in albany , where financial rescues come from mr dinapoli had demanded strict oversight as a price for the new nassau transfer tax he hoped the state would create some entity with the power to force mr gulotta to revise his budget proposals , which have frequently overestimated revenues and underestimated expenses but the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , a democrat , wound up accepting a republican proposal for a threemember panel of state and county officials that could issue unpleasant reports about mr gulotta s budgets , but do little more knowing that the same three state and county officials , independently , had repeatedly issued unpleasant reports that mr gulotta had not heeded , mr dinapoli was unenthusiastic he insisted that the republican advisory panel accepted by mr silver be dropped from the legislation , and then , along with other nassau democrats , voted against the budget package anyway back on long island today , mr dinapoli was left to look on encouragingly at a news conference as the four democrats in the county legislature proposed a strong fiscal oversight board , then called on the legislature s 15 republicans to do the unthinkable and approve it as if gaining republican support were not enough of an obstacle , the democrats pointed out , almost as an afterthought , that this latest oversight proposal would also require a countywide referendum not that republicans were going to let the democrats' futile exercise go unnoticed bruce a blakeman , the presiding officer of the legislature , called the democratic proposals a political coverup for dinapoli s inability to get state legislation which would improve the budgetary process in nassau county was he saying that mr dinapoli s proposals would have been good for the county \? legislation which could have been done on a bipartisan basis , mr blakeman added , making it clear that he simply meant mr dinapoli should have acceded to the weaker republican proposal mr blakeman , too , is proposing changes to improve the county s budgetary process but his ideas only go so far as requiring the county executive s budgets to look three years ahead instead of just one , and creating a blueribbon panel that would be able only to recommend changes in mr gulotta s budgets mr dinapoli said such a panel would be worthless , but he acknowledged that democrats were powerless to achieve anything stronger still , he maintained , without strict oversight , mr gulotta would only make the county s financial problems worse and eventually , mr dinapoli said , that will catch up with the republicans , or at least with mr gulotta if not in november , when all 19 seats in the county legislature are up for election , then perhaps in 2001 that s when the new transfer tax expires , he said and that s when the county executive is up for reelection i do n't think he s even going to be able to get the nomination without a fight this time we 're going to have the highest sales tax in the region and this new transfer tax is going to hit the little guys , who are the backbone of the county and it s going to hit the big guys , the developers and corporations , who are the backbone of the republican party my hope is that people are not going to be asleep anymore , he said , that they 'll recognize that the current system rips off taxpayers photos thomas s gulotta , the nassau county executive and republican leader , vowed to restore structural integrity to the county s finances \( vic delucia the new york times \) thomas p dinapoli said the current system rips off taxpayers \( richard lee for the new york times \)
zurich the chief executive of a leading machinery company says that in five years his company will adopt the euro a city council debates whether its citizens should be allowed to pay taxes in euros local banks open a clearinghouse in frankfurt for transfers and settlements in euros france \? germany \? another country that has adopted europe s new single currency \? no , switzerland , which could not join the 11 nations that have embraced the euro even if it wanted to , because it is not a member of the european union the arrival of the euro is expected to stoke debate about whether the swiss , recently immersed in a pained discussion of their financial role as a neutral nation during the nazi conquest of much of europe , should forfeit their cherished separateness as europe unifies all around them no one expects the country to desert the venerable swiss franc any time soon the people are divided , their political parties even more so , and a land of glacial public debate where issues are subjected again and again to referendums can hardly expect an early or easy decision bankers are less concerned about which currency to choose than about the bubble in world stock markets or the financial crisis in brazil but none of this has kept the swiss , especially companies with extensive outside ties , from approaching the euro with an affection that eclipses that in some of their larger neighbors for us , the euro has become a reality , a new and convenient currency , said fritz fahrni , chief executive of sulzer ag , a 4billionayear industrial group that manufactures everything from weaving machines to medical devices like pacemakers within five years , mr fahrni predicts , the euro could supplant the swiss franc as the currency of use at sulzer , which does more than half its business elsewhere in europe to be sure , the reality of the euro even in the 11 participating nations remains a bookkeeping and securitiestrading phenomenon until 2002 , when euro bills and coins will come into circulation , changing hands across shop counters in this country , acceptance of the euro started for the most part with the banks , which risked losing international business if they were not prepared some of the banks we do business with , especially in france and germany , were not very well prepared , said klaus w wellershoff , chief economist for switzerland at the warburg dillon read unit of the largest swiss bank , ubs ag the swiss franc , the pillar of this small country s financial might , may be too crucial a strut of swiss prosperity to be jettisoned any time soon still , the reasons for the enthusiasm for the euro seem clear switzerland , with just over seven million people , is surrounded by four euro nations germany , france , italy and austria and conducts about 70 percent of its trade with the 15 nations of the european union so it is quickly becoming a twocurrency nation manufacturers are ready to do business in euros , hotels to take payment in euros big retailers like migros ag , a kind of swiss walmart , are programming cash registers for both currencies officially , any significant participation will take longer perhaps much longer rudolf baer , chief executive of bank julius baer , expects that east european countries lined up to join the european union in the next few years will take precedence switzerland , whose voters rejected a move toward european union membership in a referendum in 1992 , does not have a realistic chance of joining the european union , he said , before 2010 one big concern in the meantime is that the swiss franc could grow too strong if , at any point , a weakening euro spurs a flight of investment capital into switzerland , the swiss franc s value would rise , making the country s exports more expensive and undermining growth some large swiss companies base their business on currencies other than the franc abb asea brown boveri , the giant swissswedish industrial group , uses the dollar we are seen as a global company , goran lindahl , abb s president and chief executive , said in an interview if we go to the euro , then we are seen as a european company still , mr lindahl will not rule out , somewhere down the line , having abb quote its shares on european stock markets in euros as well as in swiss francs and swedish kronor , as it does now and abb is fully prepared to bill customers in euros if they wish , and to pay suppliers in euros over time , abb expects to use fewer currencies , lowering transaction costs and perhaps simplifying bookkeeping it thinks this will reduce administrative expenses , though it cannot say by how much the swiss machinery industry the biggest exporter , with 37 billion in outside revenue consists not only of giants like abb but also of midsized manufacturers like sulzer , and they are fast shifting to euros roughly twothirds of total swiss machinery exports go to european union countries two years ago , mr fahrni pushed sulzer s accountants and computer specialists to begin preparations , so that by the beginning of last month , when the 11 countries formally adopted the euro , almost all internal procedures , like billing and receiving euros , were in place in recent negotiations with sulzer s fuel oil suppliers in london , mr fahrni was told that longterm contracts for oil would soon be in euros the euro , he said , will eliminate the costs of hedging against currency fluctuations , shaving 1 to 2 percent off transaction costs for the sale of products like textile looms
washington , may 28 speaker j dennis hastert won the allegiance of his fellow republicans with a pledge to restore order to the fractured house but the republican congress collapsed in disarray this week , abruptly leaving hours early for a holiday recess without being able to act on military legislation and failing to pass several budget bills that mr hastert had counted on finishing by memorial day these setbacks raise serious questions about the ability of republican leaders to govern a house with one of the slimmest majorities this century , when any five defections can throw the majority party off course the last time control of congress was so tight was about 45 years ago , when republicans were again in the majority after that , democrats won control and held on for 40 years every passing day this week brought a new defeat a handful of republicans defied mr hastert to work with democrats on campaignfinance legislation conservatives brought the house to a grinding halt by offering endless amendments to an agriculture bill to express dissatisfaction with the leaders' lack of strategy on spending republican leaders pulled back legislation to pay for congressional offices , for fear the democrats would try to tack on guncontrol proposals and a bill authorizing pentagon programs collapsed because democrats and republican conservatives were prepared to vote to block it from the floor only the week before , senate republicans were driven into retreat by democrats over gun control to some republicans , this made the disorder in the house more ominous we had a better week than the senate did because they screwed up so badly that everybody noticed it , said representative peter t king , a long island republican we did so little that nobody realized we were doing nothing he added , but we ca n't survive many more weeks like this the events showed that the house republicans , despite a facade of unity after their 1998 election losses , have only papered over their differences largely through inactivity the house republican caucus is still composed of distinct factions hardright conservatives , traditional main street conservatives and northeastern moderates at any given moment they pull in different directions even the house leadership is splintered both representative dick armey of texas , the majority leader , and representative tom delay of texas , the majority whip , voted at times with the rebellious conservatives on the agriculture amendments in one party caucus this week , republicans say , representative tom latham of iowa talked of the dissidents who were defying the republican conference by undermining the agriculture bill he pointed to the front of the room and said it was the leaders who were voting against the bills he asked how they could tell others to stand together if they themselves did not have the courage to do so that , republicans say , brought a blamecasting and defensive speech from mr armey , who the next day stopped voting with the dissidents making matters worse for the republicans is the fact that democrats , flush with the possibility of retaking the house in 2000 , are showing a high degree of unity and tactical aggression they are seizing any opportunity to promote their own agenda , including petitions intended to force legislation to the floor on issues like campaign finance and regulation of health maintenance organizations if the republicans continue to do nothing , we are not going to sit back and do nothing , said representative charles b rangel , democrat of manhattan whether it s campaign reform or the patients' bill of rights , we are going to make sure that the issues are joined and they are going to have to decide which side they 're on even if their efforts never make it into law , democrats believe they are showcasing themselves as the advocates of an agenda that will resonate with voters in 2000 from the start this year , house republicans knew they would have trouble governing because of the size of their majority we only have a margin of five votes , said representative christopher shays of connecticut , who broke with his party this week on campaign finance we all know it s making it difficult to run the place their solution was to choose a minimalist agenda and a lowvisibility leader and put a high priority on passing the spending bills in an orderly fashion they would then bank on a presidential candidate to provide an agenda and a face for the party in 2000 to rally voters whether anybody wants to admit to it or not around here , representative joe scarborough , republican of florida , said recently , george w is going to be the republican party leader across the next 18 months or so he referred , of course , to governor bush of texas democrats argue that the republicans are making the same kind of mistake they did in 1998 when instead of putting forward an agenda they relied on the scandals surrounding mr clinton to carry them forward and they say no matter which party wins , a presidential candidate has congressional coattails only in the case of a landslide it s a risky strategy to rely on a landslide in the presidential election to protect them , said representative martin frost of texas , a member of the democratic leadership now even the orderly passage of spending bills seems in jeopardy the republican leaders gave their members a full week s vacation for memorial day because they had expected two or three of the 13 spending bills to be voted on and passed this week none were the conservatives led by representative tom coburn of oklahoma derailed the 608 billion agriculture bill , choosing it to make their stand because it was the first spending bill to come to the house floor the conservatives threatened to slow or even kill the bill with more than 100 amendments as a way to draw attention to their argument that party leaders had no strategy to keep president clinton from winning billions of dollars in new spending on domestic programs such spending would most likely have to come out of the social security surplus , which the republicans have vowed to protect explaining why he was methodically offering amendments , dr coburn wrote to republicans leadership believes it is more important to stick to the calendar , even when that may mean sacrificing good policy \( controlling spending \) and great politics \( saving 100 percent of social security \) an unapologetic dr coburn said he would not back down i'm a hellraiser , he said republican moderates also worry about the spending bills but in contrast to the conservatives , they argue the bills are too lean to pass for now , the democrats are content to sit back and let the republicans flounder over the spending bills how they deal with it is going to be intriguing and very interesting to all of us , said the senate minority leader , tom daschle of south dakota his house counterpart , representative richard a gephardt of missouri , said of the republicans this is their budget and i assume they 're going to implement it photo speaker j dennis hastert may see his party s fragile unity collapse \( associated press \) \( pg a10 \)

boston , april 27 the maine supreme court has denied a constitutional appeal by five families who wanted to use taxpayer money to send their children to a churchaffiliated school in a 5to1 decision , the court upheld the state s policy of restricting publicly financed vouchers to nonreligious schools the decision , the most recent from a flurry of school choice cases across the nation , could bring the issue a step closer to the supreme court the ruling comes almost a year after the wisconsin supreme court came to a different decision on the voucher issue , ruling that a milwaukee program can allow parents to use vouchers to pay tuition at churchaffiliated schools this now creates a split in authority among state supreme courts on the constitutionality of school choice that makes it much more likely that the united states supreme court will take a case and resolve the issue , said clint bolick , litigation director for the institute of justice , a libertarian public policy law firm that represented the maine parents in maine , parents who live in towns without public schools can use publicly financed vouchers to send their children to private schools that are not affiliated with churches five families from rural raymond , me , which has no high school , sued their school district for the right to use vouchers to send their children to a private , allmale catholic school in portland they maintained that the program violated their freedom of religion and other rights an appeals court denied the request , and the state supreme court upheld the decision on friday choice alone , the decision said , cannot overcome the fact that the tuition program would directly pay religious schools for programs that include and advance religion referring to the principle of the separation of church and state , the decision continued , none of the supreme court s decisions to date have ever intimated that such direct subsidies of religious schools could survive an establishment clause challenge both opponents and supporters of vouchers are hoping that this case , or one of the others in litigation in vermont and ohio , will reach the united states supreme court and lead to a national standard this is the case more than any other that makes it crystal clear that vouchers aid religious schools and that violated the constitution , said the rev barry lynn , executive director of americans united for separation of church and state it says it directly and without any fudging or equivocation but mr bolick called the maine court s interpretation of constitutional law an aberration in june , the wisconsin supreme court upheld a program allowing lowincome students to use vouchers at religious schools in november , the united states supreme court declined to review the decision nearly 14 , 000 students in about half of maine s school districts attend public schools outside their own districts or approved private schools under the 70 million tuition program in august , a federal court ruled against a group of families in minot , me , in a similar school voucher case that case is being appealed two other state supreme courts , in ohio and vermont , have heard arguments on school voucher cases about 40 state legislatures have dealt with proposals on vouchers , scholarship programs , tuition tax credits and other aid involving religious schools this year , mr lynn said this is probably the most ever the florida legislature is poised to approve the first statewide school choice program , a program that libertarian groups have vowed to fight the plaintiffs in the maine case have 90 days to decide whether to appeal to the united states supreme court mr bolick said an appeal was likely we are very anxious for the supreme court to remove any lingering doubt about the constitutionality of school choice programs , he said
groovin' high the life of dizzy gillespie by alyn shipton illustrated 422 pp new york oxford university press 30 during his apprenticeship in the big bands of teddy hill and cab calloway in the 1930 s , the trumpeter john birks \( dizzy \) gillespie gained a reputation as the enfant terrible of jazz , a reputation based as much on his quick temper as on his penchant for advanced chord changes and offbeat rhythms by the time of his death from cancer in 1993 , at the age of 75 , gillespie was beloved by musicians and public alike as one of the grand old men of jazz along with a handful of others , including the alto saxophonist charlie parker , the pianist bud powell and the drummer kenny clarke , gillespie spearheaded a musical revolution in the 1940 s in the arts , successful revolutions are those whose leaders find that the rest of the world has caught up with them more quickly than anyone might have guessed bebop the name ultimately given jazz s first selfconsciously avantgarde movement had become the status quo by 1955 , the year of parker s death by 1959 when miles davis and john coltrane popularized modal improvisation with the album kind of blue and ornette coleman shocked new york clubgoers with his aharmonic brand of freeform jazz gillespie was at his peak as an instrumentalist and improviser but nothing he or any of the other surviving pioneers of bebop could play was still surprising groovin' high is the first biography of gillespie to be published since his death and the most thorough summary of his life and music , with the exception of to be or not to bop , gillespie s valuable but poorly organized and often fanciful 1979 autobiography , written with al fraser the english jazz critic alyn shipton plausibly argues that the gradual transformation of gillespie s public image was caused by more than the accelerated pace of jazz evolution and the mellowing effect of middle age shipton draws attention to an irony implicit in gillespie s persona from the very beginning of his career though bebop broke with tradition in being black music primarily designed for listening rather than dancing , gillespie s scat singing and flamboyant clowning in front of his big band of the late 1940 s , the most visionary outfit of its day , retained much of the elements of black show business that gillespie had encountered as a sideman with cab calloway and others a decade earlier furthermore , since bebop in its purest form lasted only a few years and gillespie , for the remainder of his career , was often featured in allstar groups of mixed stylistic allegiance , he devised a manner of constructing boppish solos that fitted easily into the swing meter , yet communicated much of the excitement and dash that his playing had contained in a more fully bebop context gillespie was between bands and at loose ends for much of the 1950 s , but in shipton s perceptive analysis of the way in which gillespie eventually became virtually synonymous with jazz , his trumpet battles with stars of the swing era like roy eldridge and charlie shavers as part of the jazz at the philharmonic tours did much to accelerate his popularity by removing most of the rhythmic and harmonic aspects of bebop that were hardest for uninitiated listeners to understand or appreciate this is keen criticism , and shipton is also persuasive in examining gillespie s sizable role in bringing elements of latin music to jazz through his work with the cuban percussionist chano pozo in the late 1940 s and the argentine pianist lalo schifrin in the early 1960 s shipton s strong suit is his obvious affection for gillespie , whose playing he credits with conveying more of the sheer joy and excitement of jazz than that of any other musician the only character flaws shipton detects in his subject are the youthful temper gillespie eventually outgrew , a taste for philandering not ended by his 52year marriage to gussie lorraine willis \( shipton presents conclusive evidence , in the form of a signed paternity agreement , to validate the singer jeanie bryson s claim that she is gillespie s outofwedlock daughter \) and what shipton calls a tendency to economize with the truth when it was less than favorable to him shipton makes exemplary use of secondary sources , including gillespie s own previously published reminiscences , to draw vivid pictures of gillespie s hardscrabble childhood in cheraw , sc , his school days at the laurinburg institute in north carolina and his brash efforts to crack the inner circles of musicians in philadelphia and new york in the mid1930 s shipton also delights in debunking conventional wisdom , even that handed down by gillespie himself , who steadfastly claimed over the years that his approach to trumpet was an extension of that of roy eldridge , his predecessor in teddy hill s band and supposedly his single role model shipton s educated guess is that gillespie s unacknowledged influences included charlie shavers , henry \( red \) allen and louis armstrong the last a figure the young gillespie may have been reluctant to cite as an influence because of armstrong s stated antipathy toward bebop
tampa , fla , march 21 a kentucky derby dream did not exactly shatter here today on a neat little track about a thousand miles from churchill downs but the dream , the design and the investment being made by two old friends took a bit of a pounding when their undefeated 3yearold colt , menifee , ran second to pineaff by the length of a horse in the tampa bay derby it gives you humility , lamented jimmy stone , an oil and gas executive from new orleans who owns menifee with arthur hancock of paris , ky hancock , who has won the kentucky derby with gato del sol and sunday silence , spoke bravely about the learning experience that carried menifee for the first time around two turns , but he also mourned the detour in their louisville dream menifee was not supposed to lose this race he arrived in tampa with three victories at three tracks and with high hopes of maturing into that elusive prodigy known as a derby horse he was the solid favorite when he went to the post in sunshine today against five other colts for a purse of 150 , 000 and triple crown expectations but menifee broke awkwardly from the gate and swung too wide on the first of those two pesky turns he ran fifth in the middle stages of the race even though still parked wide , rallied nobly in the home stretch , but then failed to run down pineaff in third place came doneraile court , four lengths farther back was the distance , a mile and onesixteenth , too far for menifee , or the two turns too troublesome , or the track too deep \? none of the above , said his trainer , elliott walden , who also trains victory gallop , a hero of last year s triple crown series and the winner of the belmont stakes actually , i'm pleased with his race , walden said , not sounding too pleased but also not sounding too critical of his veteran jockey , pat day pineaff is a solid horse we got carried extremely wide on the first turn , and another horse kept him out there to dry so does menifee still pursue the dreams of hancock , stone and walden along the tortuous road to may 1 in kentucky \? the next race will tell us what we 've got , walden said we will play it by ear , and probably go on as planned to the blue grass stakes in three weeks and the derby three weeks after that stone , who owns 16 horses trained by walden and who has won the ascot gold cup twice , remembered that he once lost the arc de triomphe by a nose that taught him humility , too , he said i never tell elliott how to train a horse , he said i have a deal with him if he never tells me where to drill for oil , i wo n't tell him where or when to run a horse the team surrounding menifee flew into tampa from different directions stone from new orleans , hancock with his wife and six children from palm beach , fla , and walden from north of miami , where he has been sheltering and training menifee in payson park s countrylike setting right after the race , they all flew back out , with walden following the longest itinerary to dubai in the middle east , where he will run victory gallop in the 5 million world cup this week menifee headed back home to kentucky pineaff , a son of pinebluff trained by ken mcpeak and ridden by jose santos , ran the mile and onesixteenth in 1 451 5 and paid 14 for a 2 bet to win he had lost three straight since winning in november , and santos paid full credit to his colt for upsetting menifee , one of the stronger contenders in the country if you look in the newspapers , santos said , you ca n't beat that horse but we did nick zito knows about dreams won and lost he has won the kentucky derby twice in this decade with strike the gold and go for gin his speedy colt doneraile court ran 10th in the fountain of youth stakes last month and third today he did n't run too bad , zito said but there s no kentucky derby in his picture anymore
san francisco , sept 19 call it an endofthecentury business case study pangea systems inc is a small but leading company in bioinformatics , a hot new field that combines the two keystone technologies of the 1990 s computing and biotechnology but its products are expensive and difficult for mortals to use , which limits pangea s potential market and reduces the prospects for a public stock offering what to do \? this being 1999 , the answer if you are pangea is to dotcom yourself this week pangea , which is based in oakland , calif , intends to begin a shakedown test of doubletwistcom , a new web site intended to make online genetic and biological research fast , easy and available to any amateur or professional biologist while the test phase is available only to faculty and students at stanford university , the site is scheduled to go live for general use in december the doubletwist site , whose name is a play on the doublehelix structure of dna , holds the nearterm promise of lifting pangea above the pack of competitors chasing the business opportunities in bioinformatics but other companies may not be far behind and the implications go beyond the interests of professional biologists and biotechnology executives as more of the arcane secrets of genetics and molecular biology become available to the modemed masses , some industry executives foresee the day when an educated consumer might take a cdrom containing a laboratory s rendering of his or her genetic profile , and combine it with a web surf through gene libraries to determine the person s predisposition toward adverse drug reactions , for example , or for alzheimer s disease , colon cancer or other afflictions that might eventually be treatable through gene therapy to promote its name and capabilities , pangea plans to let individuals who make only casual use of the site have access to its software and data base at no charge heavy users and corporations may obtain licenses to pay for access on a sliding fee scale which could run to tens of thousands of dollars a year , but would still be significantly less than the 500 , 000 or more that pangea now charges big pharmaceutical companies to buy its software outright the power of bioinformatics has been somewhat limited to those who could afford it , said john couch , pangea s president and chief executive , who was an executive at apple computer in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s i 've been trying to figure out how to empower the scientist the way we did computer users at apple in the early days , mr couch said we saw the opportunity to be the first web portal that enabled scientists to do molecular research celera genomics group is another company that has said it will offer its bioinformatics tools from its web site , although it has not specified a launch date this is an internet company , said craig venter , president and chief executive of celera , a unit of the pe corporation , which is based in rockville , md scientists and nonscientists alike , he said , will be able to use celera s tools to gain insights into their genetic makeup and as catalogues of common mutations correlated with disease become broadly available , he said , individuals will be able to make appropriate life style changes or health care decisions you 'll be able to log on to our data base and get information about yourself , mr venter said our ultimate customer on the internet is individuals bioinformatics is a field that emerged from the human genome project , the international quest which began in 1988 and is expected to be concluded in the next two years to spell out the precise sequence of the three billion letters in the human genetic code the first industry spawned by the genome project was genomics companies , which sell data bases of individual genes whose sequences have already been identified or are developing drugs aimed at gene targets as these efforts began to produce vast amounts of biological information , they needed powerful software to keep track and make sense of it all and so , in the early 1990 s , bioinformatics was born as a tool of genomics while the software created by the governmentfunded labs like the whitehead institute at the massachusetts institute of technology is in the public domain , with intriguing names like blast and fasta , the genomics companies , like human genome sciences inc and incyte pharmaceuticals inc , have kept their tools for use by themselves or their licensed partners that is celera s primary business as well , despite mr venter s intent to offer bioinformatics services on the web it was not long before a few entrepreneurs and venture capitalists saw an opportunity in a pureplay bioinformatics company , which would sell not genes or data , but software as private companies , none of the bioinformatics players publish revenue figures , but most say they are between 5 million and 10 million in annual sales and growing indeed , some analysts predict a multibilliondollar bioinformatics market within the next 10 years
there s no law against lying about your hair color , and jacques dessange inc has always been willing to oblige brunettes wanting to be blond , or vice versa , at its chic hair salons but there is a law against lying on visa applications , and federal prosecutors said yesterday that the french beauty care company did just that so that dozens of its paristrained stylists and colorists could work illegally in new york and elsewhere , as part of the company s plan to rapidly expand in the united states a federal indictment filed in manhattan charged the company and two of its new yorkbased lawyers with conspiracy to commit immigration fraud the company and the lawyers were also charged with 30 counts of fraud each the company s president , bernard sagon , said in a statement that the charges were a gross and unfair overreaction by united states authorities to classify the incidents described in the indictment as criminal , he said , was a terrible distortion of the facts speaking by phone from paris last night , mr sagon said , we react with confusion , frustration and concern he said talks with the government had broken down it was impossible to negotiate , he said , because we are completely innocent the indictment said that in 1994 , the company , which then had just one salon in the united states , at 505 park avenue , decided to carry out its expansion plans and create a chain of highend french salons , with a goal of opening 100 across the united states the company s officials in new york believed that it was critical to bring a large number of experienced french hairstylists and colorists to the united states to attract customers and create a quality image , the indictment said the company promised the owners of its franchises a steady supply of french stylists and colorists , the indictment said but to quickly send a large number of the french workers to the united states , the indictment charged , a company vice president in new york , who was not named , and the two lawyers applied for a special visa that the immigration and naturalization service reserves only for highlevel managers who are being transferred by their company to the united states ultimately , about 50 stylists and colorists who were otherwise ineligible for the special visas were admitted into the united states to work in salons , the indictment said in many cases , it said , their visa applications falsely stated that they were to be paid salaries of 1 , 000 a week in reality , the indictment charged , most of the workers were guaranteed only a substantially lower salary the company and the two lawyers charged in the case , howard deutsch and libby salberg , will be arraigned on dec 2 in federal district court in manhattan , prosecutors said none of the french workers were charged mr deutsch s lawyer , gerald l shargel , said howard has done nothing to violate the law the evidence in this case is going to show that he had no motive to commit any crime , nor did he commit any crime he and ms salberg s lawyer , catherine l redlich , said their clients would plead not guilty ms redlich declined to comment further if convicted , jacques dessange inc could face a fine of 500 , 000 on each count , said the office of mary jo white , the united states attorney in manhattan mr sagon said the company had relied on its new york lawyers and was the victim of receiving bad legal advice he said the company filed a legal malpractice suit against the firm of deutsch salberg last month in state supreme court in manhattan mr sagon said the company , which operates 600 salons around the world , still had only 5 in the united states , and he disputed the contention that the company had sought a rapid expansion but he said the company did want to bring in its specially trained stylists , saying they offered something unique jacques dessange is a french company with a french style , mr sagon said reactions to the charges were mixed yesterday in the world of new york hair salons the stylist garren , of garren new york at henri bendel , said he was not aware of the allegations , but speaking generally , added that jacques dessange appeared to have wanted to create what they created in paris and bring it to america that s basically what they were trying to do , he said , the whole package , that women feel that they have stepped into the door of a paris salon , and experience what they would have experienced in europe but grace figueroa , assistant to the president of jean louis david , a french hair salon chain with 10 stores in new york , sniffed at the idea that the french had unique hair techniques that could not be emulated by their american counterparts i highly doubt that the french have developed something special to them , she added photo the jacques dessange hair salon on park avenue is one of five in the united states federal prosecutors accuse the company of lying on visa applications to bring parisbased stylists and colorists to america \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)

selected nonfictions by jorge luis borges edited by eliot weinberger translated by esther allen , suzanne jill levine and eliot weinberger 559 pages viking 40 jorge luis borges was the master of the short , erudite mysterious story he loved paradox , the search for meaning in things , the labyrinth as a symbol of human perplexity he probed the diabolical he invented perfect murders he was , in short , strange in his determined quest for arcane knowledge and his use of that knowledge in the creation of a literary universe he is most widely read for his fiction , but this intelligently selected and magically translated collection of borges s nonfiction demonstrates , among other things , the closeness of his two worlds , reality and invention reading this latest in what is now viking s threevolume set of this great argentine s works is to see how borges s fiction represented a mere short step from his essays a similar sensibility pervades both \( i am leaving the poetry volume out of consideration here \) , a sensibility in which an avidity for knowledge , a cabalistic thirst and a poetic taste for images propel the mind into every enigma created by the human experience take , for example , a brief , light fragment of movie criticism written in 1945 , on dubbing , meaning what borges calls the perverse artifice that hollywood uses to render foreignlanguage films accessible the first line , the art of combination is not infinite in its possibilities , though those possibilities are apt to be frightening , already suggests something far more than a predictable highbrow complaint about the mass culture borges , who died in 1986 , rapidly lists a few of the monstrous creations begotten by mythology over the centuries , especially those creations that combined parts of things that normally do not go together there is , for example , the chinese red supernatural bird equipped with six feet and six wings but with neither face nor eyes the point is that for borges , dubbing in movies is not simply vulgar and inauthentic his learning leads him to find something archetypally grotesque about it , a new monstrous combination the famous face of greta garbo with the voice of aldonza lorenzo one reads these many essays , none of them more than a few pages long , with amazement at their author s impetuous curiosity and penetrating intelligence one also experiences them as difficult pleasures they are elusive they are so learned that the learning sometimes inundates meaning many of the pieces a prologue to mystical works by emmanuel swedenborg , a comment on the novel vathek by william beckford , a 1931 review of a german movie called the murderer dmitri karamazov are obscure or seem dated and then there are comments and essays whose points are perhaps suggestive but so cryptically put as to elude comprehension perhaps universal history is the history of the various intonations of a few metaphors , borges writes at the end of a brief essay called pascal s sphere striving to decipher that sentence , and the essay of which it is a part , is like groping for something solid among vapors of light and yet one has to allow , with a genius like borges , for the likelihood that these episodes of noncomprehension reflect more on the reader than on the writer in any case , there are sublime and accessible essays here , arrestingly compact turns of phrase among the most startling comments are those written in the late 1930 s and early 40 s that bitterly and eloquently denounced nazi germany and nazism s sympathizers among the argentine middle class but most of what borges wrote about was literary and philosophical this volume includes witty brief biographies of writers like isaac babel , t s eliot , virginia woolf and others borges discourses brilliantly about dante and about ellery queen as well , and in one trenchant piece he creates a code for the writing of detective novels in the last item in the code , a solution that is both necessary and marvelous , borges bans resorting to the supernatural , whose use in this genre of fiction is slothful and felonious slothful and felonious the language here is intentionally deformed by its very intensity , and that gives these essays an almost lurid quality , like something overly magnified by a microscope although short , the essays are prodigiously detailed a good example is the one titled the translators of 'the thousand and one nights , ' which is essentially an illustration of one of borges s constant early themes , the way language invents reality the essay is a review of the several european efforts over the decades to put this famous arabic classic , whose original version aimed at the lowbrow or ribald tastes of the cairo middle classes , into a highart form suitable for educated europeans borges provides sketches of the translators , the most famous of whom was the arabist and explorer richard burton , which make for a typically learned collective study of european orientalism and the whole is written with that imaged , magnesium prose one associates with borges of the writer s solitary trade he made something valiant and plural , borges writes of the extraordinary burton he plunged into his work at dawn , in a vast chamber multiplied by 11 tables , with the materials for a book on each one and , on a few , a bright spray of jasmine in a vase of water it is not surprising that the writers whom borges most admired , like poe , cervantes , kafka and coleridge , combined poetically or grotesquely magnified visions with the creations of profligate stylistic domains even at his most erudite and elusive , there is always something lusciously selfmocking in borges s language his uniqueness in 20thcentury letters is rooted in another almost monstrous combination encyclopedic knowledge , razorlike critical judgment and a ravishing appreciation for the magical and pagan dimension in every situation who else but borges could have written a defense of the kabbalah by depicting the cabalists' belief in a divine astral intelligence that manifested itself in a book , genesis , where the collaboration of chance is calculated at zero \? and then there is this luxuriant description of the cabalistic vision of that book a book impervious to contingencies , a mechanism of infinite

belgrade , serbia , may 20 a body lay curled up under the broken masonry of what had been the neurology clinic under the monochromatic gray dust that covers everything after an explosion , amid the broken tiles , filthy blankets and scattered bed rails , one could slowly make out the curve of the buttocks and thighs less than two hours after the russian special envoy left belgrade after peace talks with president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia , nato bombed a hospital this morning four people were killed and dozens wounded , including medical staff and two women struck by broken glass while giving birth at least 70 other pregnant women were moved to another hospital dr dejan sumrak , the chief of the neurology department of the dragisa misovic hospital , could barely control his disgust three of his patients had died and five more were wounded when a missile aimed at a nearby and empty military barracks in this wealthy belgrade district of dedinje landed on this hospital instead i do n't care what they were aiming at , dr sumrak said this is a hospital this is an utterly cynical act by nato his associate , dr branislava mrsulja , said we thought we were safer here than at home and why are these patients guilty of anything \? one of the dead , branka boskovic , had celebrated her 75th birthday in the ward the day before , said dr mrsulja , who asked that the names of the other two dead patients , radoslav novakovic , 47 , and zora brkic , 72 , be taken down in brussels , the nato spokesman , jamie p shea , said that one of seven laserguided missiles failed to guide correctly and fell 500 yards from the barracks , striking a building mr shea , apparently unaware or skeptical of western news agency reports that nato had hit a hospital , said he had no details of the kind of building that was hit as he has after other nato accidents , mr shea said , we will continue our practice of striking those military targets with great accuracy and precision and we will continue to take every conceivable measure to avoid damage to civilian property and harm to civilians aiming at targets 500 yards from a hospital , said dr sumrak , was not taking every conceivable measure to avoid damage , at least in my opinion the fourth to die here this morning was a security guard , whose name was not immediately available because of the need to notify his family he became an interesting aspect of this story because reporters brought to the scene by the yugoslav army press center discovered some 50 rounds of ak47 ammunition scattered along an oily , muddy road not 20 yards from the missile crater , which was full of sewage , ground water and wood bits , some of them green and there was one small piece of camouflage cloth visible some of the rounds , once cleaned of mud and oil , were perfect some were exploded , but the bullets showed no rifling , indicating that they had not been fired shown the rounds , soldiers at the scene had no comment asked later at a press conference if there had been any storage of ammunition on the hospital grounds , or in trucks parked along the road , leposava milicevic , the serbia health minister , said there had been none no medical facility is used by the army or the police , she said it is strictly forbidden , and i checked this myself as for the ammunition , she said , i suggest this was the remains of the security guard who was killed in her view , she said , nato targeted the hospital , having also dropped a cluster bomb on the grounds of a hospital two weeks ago in nis goran matic , a minister without portfolio who often speaks for the government , said that the guard might have had a clip of cartridges in his kalashnikov assault rifle and another three clips on his person , totaling some 120 rounds the oil on the road , he said , came from a firetruck kept near the barracks , which the government knew were a potential target , and which he said had been empty for two months he denied , also in strong terms , that any military equipment or ammunition was stored on the grounds of any yugoslav hospital five military buildings appeared damaged badly , with one of them , originally four stories , collapsed to one the nearby residences of the spanish and norwegian ambassadors were also damaged , as was that of the swedish ambassador the swedish foreign minister said in stockholm that it is unacceptable that right in the center of a large city , these kinds of large explosives are used , causing this kind of damages and injuries the foreign minister , anna lindh , said , the strike on the hospital underscores the need for a political solution one serb who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that nothing nato did would any longer surprise her this is of course a military target if you just take the longer view , she said bitterly in 20 years or so , these babies will be soldiers as in any sudden storm of violence , there were bizarre moments of heroism and chance dr miodrag lazic , the director of the hospital , described how two nurses on the second floor had been caught in the explosion , and how the staff rigged a pipe to get them down a nurse described to serbian radio how she was in the maternity ward with a woman in labor she began smashing things around her and crossing herself , the nurse said we could barely manage to move her downstairs to the basement , where she finally gave birth we are full of dust it was terrible dr lazic described another baby born by caesarean section minutes before the explosion , and how both mother and child were covered with dirt and dust , and how offended he had been as a doctor one journalist broke in to demand was it a boy or a girl \? dr lazic stopped short , then said i do n't know i'm a urologist photo a belgrade hospital was badly damaged when a missile that nato says lost direction struck yesterday morning three women patients and a security guard were killed and dozens of others were injured \( associated press \) map showing the location of the dragisa misovic hospital dragisa misovic hospital is in belgrade s wealthy district of dedinje
when austin powers , international man of mystery became a surprise hit back in may 1997 , the executives at time warner did more than just congratulate the folks at their subsidiary , new line cinema they got to work for them , the spoof , starring mike myers as a foppish secret agent cryogenically frozen in the 1960 s and thawed out in the present , had more than just laughs and an obvious sequel going for it \( austin powers ii the spy who shagged me opens on june 11 \) with its goofy characters , accessible irony and catch phrases like shagadelic , baby , it provided an opportunity to demonstrate the raison d'etre of the modern entertainment conglomerate synergy that concept , which has powered a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the last decade , is based on the theory that socalled vertically integrated companies can spend the least money to make the biggest profit if all the divisions work together on every opportunity to market and merchandise every facet of a concept or character and there is indeed a great deal of money to be made not just by time warner but by a slew of integrated behemoths like disney , polygram , sony and viacom in the past , such addons as soundtrack albums , novelties , novelizations and foreign and television rights were mere bagatelles dwarfed by the domestic grosses of films themselves today , however , the equation has changed and with advertising and promotion costs for movies soaring , the companies can make the most of the money they spend by selling everything from keychains to theme park rides at once licensing and the other revenue streams can now mean the difference between a 90 million base hit and a 150 million home run , said ira mayer , who owns licensing letter , an industry newsletter last year , nearly 16 billion of movierelated merchandise was sold for new line , synergy at such a heady level is relatively new for more than 30 years , the company was a scrappy independent studio then , in 1994 , it was bought by ted turner and , two years later , absorbed by time warner as part of a merger at the time , critics fretted that new line s quirkiness would be quashed by the corporate dictates of the parent company , that in the quest for synergy it would be turned into a mainstream studio like warner brothers instead , by most accounts , new line has retained its offbeat character in addition to developing austin powers , it has released boogie nights and american history x while growing downright comfortable with the resources of its parent company the opportunities presented by a movie like 'austin powers , ' said michael lynne , the president of new line , actually make you glad you 're part of a big corporation instead of giving up potential profits on toys and television rights , for instance , new line can now keep the money all in the time warner family better still , the corporate hoopla means that a relatively modest movie the spy who shagged me cost 30 million has been transformed into an event film there was a moment , recalled mr lynne , when we all realized that 'austin powers' was our 'pink panther , ' that the first movie was just the beginning of the franchise bob friedman , who oversees marketing and licensing for the company , puts it more bluntly to us , this 'austin powers' is n't a movie it s a cable network and a board game and a stuffed toy and an animated series and a potential hit for madonna in fact , within weeks , warner brothers retail stores and spenser gifts stores across the country will roll out a plethora of merchandise from snazzy nightshirts to the austin powers swedish penis enlarger \( the perfect gift for dad on father s day ! \) tbs and tnt , two cable networks owned by time warner , will feature walltowall promotion of the movie entertainment weekly , the glossy magazine owned by time warner , is set to have an austin powers cover warner records will release the soundtrack album , which includes a single , beautiful stranger , by madonna , whose label , maverick records , is also a warner subsidiary and by now , warner books has probably delivered to stores the first of its no doubt multiple printings of the austin powers encyclopedia there s more the home video , due out in the fall , will be sold by time warner s sales force early next year there will be an animated series by hbo , a time warner subsidiary we are working on a relationship with the wb , said mr friedman , referring to the youthskewed broadcast network also owned by time warner they 're perfect for us there may also be a theme park tiein with six flags great adventure , which was sold recently by time warner but retains a licensing agreement with the company there s really no telling how far this thing can go and for how long , mr lynne said but despite plucky new line s smooth path to corporate nirvana , synergy is hardly an answer to all the industry s woes after all , to make synergy work , studios need more than just a concept that has good merchandising potential

the question i'm most asked is whether or not being in the films has changed their lives , so in 42 up i let them answer it some say they enjoy it others hate it and take part only under sufferance , persuaded by me that the films are unique and that we should finish what we started they argue that at 7 , they had no say in the decision to take part and anyway , when is it ever going to end \? some see it as a treasured record of their lives , while others regard it as a major invasion of privacy and would n't wish it on anybody most shrug off its psychological impact , but it s hard to believe that putting yourself up for public examination every seven years does n't take some toll
belgrade , serbia , april 30 when nato bombed residential areas of belgrade for the first time early this morning , two errant missiles , meant for military office buildings , hit houses instead dejan filipovic , 26 , was in his upstairs bedroom on miruliceva street when a missile nearly blew him out of the window he scrambled out the rest of the way , over the wreckage of the zlatni ovan restaurant , the golden goat , breaking only his leg , his sister , aleksandra , said we were in the living room and dejan was upstairs , aleksandra said , pulling at the sleeves of her sweatshirt as she shifted through the rubble my mother went through the window and i followed her , but my father stayed because my brother was upstairs when he realized dejan was alive , he climbed out , too and then it all collapsed , and we all thought we were very lucky to be alive branko filipovic , her uncle , said these are crazy people to do this monsters there s no military building here aleksandra , an economics student , laughed harshly this is one of the 'mistakes' of nato , she said with all the venom she could muster it s just another of those 'mistakes' on thursday in washington , gen henry h shelton , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , told reporters that the air war against yugoslavia had entered the domination phase general shelton described improving weather and said nato had planned 670 air sorties through the day and night so today s a big one , he said it certainly seemed that way in belgrade , which had its worst night of bombing , coupled with a presumably unrelated earthquake about 5 30 am people joked that if nato does n't get you , an earthquake will after the earthquake , one shaken person interviewed on studio b radio said nothing can surprise us now only armageddon , maybe but the deep percussion of high explosives lasted for hours , as nato chose targets in the heart of belgrade the massive paired 1970 sera buildings of the defense ministry and army general staff headquarters , just across the street from the elegant foreign ministry , and the federal interior ministry , which had seemed to be pretty effectively destroyed earlier in the war four people died , none of them in the houses that were destroyed in the vracar district , near the kalenic market , one of the city s largest at least one police officer died he had been doing guard duty by the interior ministry , officials said at least 37 people were hurt 13 of them seriously but officials insisted that the defense and army buildings had been emptied of workers weeks ago in the morning , the scene around the buildings was somber and eerie , as shocked belgraders picked their way over a carpet of broken glass and shattered masonry , as if fifth avenue had been hit by missiles and every window for a halfmile had shattered some gathered on the corners to stare , speaking in hushed voices others walked along fixedly some stopped to pick up a bit of shrapnel and put it in their pockets some diplomats , who had come to work to find their windows blown in all over their offices , milled around outside , staring at the shrapnel pockmarks gouged out of the sculpted stones of the facade workmen with long straw brooms swept the sidewalks and streets , making little heaps of glistening , broken trash before shoveling them into trucks to cart away the oddest sight was of other city workers carefully pulling the weeds from the dirt around trees some of which had bent or broken in the blast as if a longordered city beautification project was being carried out on schedule amid the ruins what really makes me angry is the foreign ministry , said a passerby named ilija it s one of the most beautiful buildings in the city , and it s like the old civic belgrade is being destroyed the foreign ministry , begun in 1903 and finished in 1936 , has lovely arches and windows , with a marble reception area now left open to the elements pretty iron bollards on the sidewalks had been broken off and elegant street lights bent or severed diplomats had made nervous jokes in recent weeks about being across the street from such likely targets the huge defense buildings , faced with pink stone , were known as sutjeska , after a bosnian mountain where tito fought a grand battle in 1943 and was wounded but there was something shocking about the home of yugoslav diplomacy being shattered in this remotecontrol war , an irony immediately seized upon by the ministry spokesman , nebojsa vujovic , who noted that the bombing occurred only hours before the arrival of the russian special envoy for the balkans , viktor s chernomyrdin nato wants to bury under concrete and steel , under the debris , not only the civilian victims but the idea of a diplomatic settlement itself , mr vujovic said this is an attack on diplomacy as a method to solve the crisis in kosovo in the vracar district , an end to the war seemed quite far away the history of bombing cities in this century is a mixed one , but tends to reinforce patriotism and anger , not diminish it branko filipovic had nothing but imprecations for nato this will go on until they have the mercy to stop it , he said if the international community does nothing , we wo n't exist but we wo n't give up kosovo aleksandra said i think they cannot know our people and our life here we 're a small country but educated and proud we 're proud to live in this city and we 're proud to be serbs and we will stay proud then she laughed , describing how her uncle often slept in their house , because he lives so close to the defense ministry he slept here for 10 days , thinking it was safer , she said and now they 're both destroyed only five minutes before our street was hit , he called us and said everything is smoke and dust photo onlookers gathered friday across the street from a home and a restaurant in belgrade that were mistakenly bombed on thursday night \( amy toensing for the new york

the conflict between serbs and albanians , currently embodied by the sight of albanian families desperately fleeing serbian pursuers in kosovo , has a very long history that is deeply felt , if selectively recalled , by those condemned to live it at the same time it has never been much understood or appreciated beyond the southern balkans in 1780 while edward gibbon , the british historian , was sailing down the adriatic and regarding the high peaks of the southeastern shore , he wrote that here was an area lying within sight of italy , which is less known than the interior of america and yet , as the contemporary british historian norman davis has observed , no lands have suffered more from the whims of international politics in this century alone , the serbs and albanians have had to contend with turkish , nazi and italian forces of occupation , while also contending with and confronting each other since 1987 , when slobodan milosevic , now the yugoslav president , first began exploiting and inflaming the historical rivalries of albanians and serbs , many observers predicted that kosovo could well become the site of the deadliest violence seen in europe since world war ii now , as nato s bombs fall and long lines of refugees straggle over mountain passes , the issues pitting serbs against albanians , which preoccupied and bedeviled the european powers for the latter part of the 19th century , have once again grown beyond the crenelated landscape of mountains and valleys stimulated by mr milosevic s policies , serbs and albanians have retreated to their own distinct politics , sharpening the differences in their already diverging historical accounts of kosovo and the region until the recently provoked flight of albanian families , there were 18 million albanians in kosovo , the province of serbia where ethnic albanians accounted for 90 percent of the population opposing accounts of local history in general , the serbian view of kosovo could be summarized as follows it is the nation s holy land , first settled by their ancestors in the seventh century medieval serbian kings were crowned there important shrines of the serbian orthodox church still dot the landscape and most important , it was the site of the battle of kosovo polje , where in 1389 the turks defeated the serbs and set the nation on its course of 500 years of resistance to ottoman rule this event is at the heart of the serbian national myth , and as the writer noel malcolm observed in his recent book , kosovo , a short history , serbian writers have often compared the loss at kosovo to the crucifixion of christ , and its reconquest in 1912 to resurrection to the extent that a serbian view takes account of albanians at all , the albanians are portrayed as having sided with or served the ottoman turks , and they are said to have taken over properties left behind when serbs fled northward , particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries the serbs claim that in the years of ottoman rule , the turks favored the albanians , most of whom are fellow muslims , installing them as landlords and allowing them to exploit and humiliate serbs albanians see things differently for one thing they claim that their ancestors , the ancient illyrian tribes , who provided fighting legions for the greek and roman empires , were already in kosovo for centuries when the serbs first arrived from what is now southern poland moreover , they claim that albanians had a long record of fighting the turks , and that in fact albanians had fought as allies of the serbs at kosovo polje they point out that their national hero , scanderbeg , spent 20 years in the 15th century warring against the ottoman sultan the albanians , who did not have their own state until 1913 , stress that they are an overwhelming majority in the area and that they have attained such numerical supremacy despite longstanding efforts of governments in belgrade to displace them , among these an attempt in 1926 to sponsor serbian settlements the albanians recall how in the period between the two world wars mosques were seized , land was confiscated , old deeds invalidated and some albanians were forcibly put on trains and deported to turkey at the moment , by their conduct in the skies over serbia , it seems clear that the great western powers have found the albanians' case persuasive but in kosovo itself it is the serbian view of history that is gaining ground despite living in close proximity over the ages , albanians and serbs are quite different from each other in the case of the recent fighting in bosnia , eastern orthodox serbs , bosnian muslims and catholic croats had different religions but spoke the same language the serbs and albanians are linguistically distinct albanian is not a slavic tongue nor does it have recognizable links to any other european language seventyfive percent of albanians are muslim , with the remainder divided between orthodox and catholic 2 large groups in the balkans though the young albanians of pristina , the kosovo capital , would be indistinguishable in dress from their serbian counterparts in belgrade , their elders often still maintain distinctive garb , with men prizing flowing mustaches or wearing white felt conical caps in albania , particularly in the north , clans remain extremely important in determining who can and cannot be married and blood feuds are still carried out under an ancient code called the law of lek currently , there are eight million to nine million serbs , most living in yugoslavia s two republics , serbia and montenegro there are also a few serbs in croatia and macedonia there are virtually none in albania
moscow , april 12 russian parliamentary leaders voted today to delay indefinitely a planned vote on the impeachment of president boris n yeltsin , stepping back from another showdown between the kremlin and the parliament but the postponement was only half a victory for mr yeltsin , who recently said that he would prefer to have the issue removed from the political agenda once and for all , preferably by its defeat in the oppositiondominated lower house of parliament the vote , which had been set for thursday , had added suspense to a debate that in the last month has been electrified by the war in the balkans , a series of ugly sexandcorruption scandals and the kremlin s own behindthescenes maneuvering in an unusual television address last saturday , prime minister yevgeni m primakov urged the parliament not to take up the impeachment issue which he said was groundless and counterproductive such political games are irresponsible and dangerous , he said they may not only rock society but provoke a grave political crisis mr primakov and his government became targets in the crossfire between mr yeltsin and his parliamentary opposition as the kremlin fanned speculation that the president might fire his prime minister , and then go on to disband the parliament none of this has happened but at a public meeting last friday , mr yeltsin hinted broadly that mr primakov s hold on his job was not guaranteed at this stage , primakov is useful , mr yeltsin said sourly later , we shall see the oppositiondominated lower house voted last year to investigate five articles of impeachment against mr yeltsin , ranging from the illegal dissolution of the soviet union to the genocide of the russian people to the waging of an illegal war in the breakaway region of chechnya of the five charges , the one about the war in chechnya was considered the most likely to succeed since it would attract votes not only from mr yeltin s hardcore leftwing opposition , but also from liberal members of parliament but even so , lastminute headcounts were putting the total a few votes shy of 300 , the margin required in the 450seat chamber to send the impeachment proceedings on their tortuous route under the russian constitution , an impeachment vote must be upheld first by the russian supreme court , then by the constitutional court , and finally confirmed by the parliament s upper house , the federation council the chances of clearing those hurdles before mr yeltsin s term ends in the summer of 2000 are exceedingly small but a vote to impeach would damage the president s already weakened political position more importantly , it would prevent him from disbanding the parliament , which the constitution forbids him from doing once a vote to impeach has been taken
there was chaos to allan houston s left a ball was loose in the corner , like a dollar bill swirling in the wind , while the shot clock was melting down on the knicks at the last instant , the burly kurt thomas hit the floor , grabbed the ball and flung it into a sea of tranquillity , right into houston s hands in one smooth motion , houston set himself and released a 3pointer that splashed into the net at the shotclock buzzer to break a tie in the third quarter and this was the way houston made every ominous situation that presented itself last night into another leg of his inspirational journey it was houston who preserved faith in the knicks before an awestruck crowd at madison square garden and it was houston who matched his playoff career high of 34 points including a 3pointer in transition to stomp on the spurs' threat in the final minutes to pull the knicks out of certain doom against the san antonio spurs in an 8981 game 3 victory instead of finding themselves on the verge of being swept in the national basketball association finals , the knicks crawled right back in it , down two games to one in the fourofsevengame series our true character was tested because this is the first time in the playoffs , one , that we 've been down in a series , coach jeff van gundy said and two , it s first time we 'd lost two in a row i think you saw the true character of the knicks we hung in there , and were very resilient for the first time in the finals , the knicks stood up to the looming presence of the spurs' david robinson and tim duncan they combined for 45 points and 22 rebounds , but they did not dominate the game it was houston s turn and yet , he was not alone latrell sprewell recovered from a dreadful third quarter and finished with 24 points , while larry johnson provided the knicks with the third scorer they have been searching for by adding 16 points johnson , feeling much freer on his sprained knee , was also a part of a defensive effort that held duncan to 20 points but none in the fourth quarter in a role reversal , it was the spurs' turn to stand in praise of the knicks , especially houston after the spurs closed to 8177 with 3 minutes 13 seconds left , houston hit a jumper in transition that provided the relief and separation the knicks needed to pull off a pivotal victory allan houston was incredible , duncan said we thought we played hard through that possession in the third quarter , and then allan comes up big he made shots when they needed them houston had his legs all night in games 1 and 2 , houston seemed to wear down from the constant pounding he was taking driving to the basket and guarding mario elie while the knicks remained aggressive last night , they did not dare give robinson and duncan the same predictable chances at blocking their shots the knicks altered their thinking , relying less on oneonone play and more on ball movement dumping unselfishness saved their season two months ago it kept them alive last night as well sprewell shot just 9 for 22 but had five assists as much as houston was shooting he was 10 for 24 he added four assists and seemed to be everywhere on the court spurs coach gregg popovich called him unstoppable i hope to be all the time , houston said i hope to be a pain in the neck and unstoppable if i'm not , that s how i think sometimes you 'll have a good night but i do n't want to have a 30point night and then have 10 i want to be consistent he was the common thread through the knicks' victory houston started them off on the right aggressive track by getting to the freethrow line , and he was a perfect 12 for 12 on the night after houston scored 18 points in the first half , he kept cooking and scored over elie on three straight possessions , including a 3pointer in transition to put the knicks up , 5647 , with 9 16 left in the third quarter at that point , houston had 25 points , almost half his team s total instead of getting flustered , popovich called two quick timeouts to get his team on its defensive game it worked after a turnover by charlie ward and two missed shots by sprewell , the spurs were within 4 , 5854 , with five minutes left the crowd was crying for houston to get the ball , but the spurs were doubleteaming him every time he touched the ball and as the shot clock kept ticking down , the knicks were forcing up bad shots that were being rebounded by the spurs , who were within 5856 with 4 01 left in the third quarter they tied it on a duncan bank shot 30 seconds later that s when the loose ball went flying in the corner , thomas saved it and delivered it to houston that s just one of those times when his touch was amazing , thomas said i got it to him and he just stroked it , like he did all night long he does n't get flustered by any situation no matter how ominous it must seem i thought allan had it rolling real well tonight , van gundy said allan has show an ability to make critical shots before this time , he made the big shots down the stretch of the game that made the difference the spurs were not at all happy with the officiating , especially when a 3pointer by sean elliott was waved off because of a foul by thomas before the shot popovich lost his temper in the face of referee ronnie nunn , who slapped him with a technical foul houston s free throw on the technical gave the knicks an 11point lead that gave way to a minirun by the spurs , who pulled within 5 points a hot houston helped give the knicks an 11point lead after the first quarter it was a lead built on teamwork and unpredictability once houston sat down , the knicks went to johnson in the post , and he delivered some fancy post moves around duncan they were rolling as they took a 4033 lead with six minutes left in the second quarter but the spurs' defense started applying more pressure , and the knicks turned the ball over on three consecutive possessions , allowing the spurs to crawl back into the game one play in particular signified the knicks' selfdestruction in the second quarter after stripping duncan of the ball and knocking him down , ward then threw the ball away on the break with duncan remaining at the other end on the play , the spurs' center was in position for an open dunk wide open but for some reason , chris childs decided to foul him from behind and create a 3point play that pulled the spurs to within 4 , 4238 , with 5 11 in the half the spurs were doing what the knicks had done to little avail in the first two games they were hanging around rebounds chris childs sprained his left knee after battling for a loose ball with tim duncan near the fourminute mark of the second quarter coach jeff van gundy received a telegram from a fan after game 2 of the eastern conference finals against the indiana pacers , suggesting the knicks should dress patrick ewing in a uniform for motivational purposes he did n't do it then , and he wo n't do it now van gundy was also amused by the suggestion that ewing could return to play in the finals with a partly torn achilles' tendon yeah , van gundy said we 're saving that for game 7 photos knicks' larry johnson , who scored 16 points last night , driving between malik rose , left , and mario elie \( barton silverman the new york times \) tim duncan , who scored 20 points but none in the fourth , looking for an opening between

everglades national park , fla somewhere among the endless mangrove forests and sawgrass prairies of north america s last tropical wilderness lies a brackishwater creek filled with baby tarpon fish in the 5 to30pound range that have perhaps never seen a fly i found this out last year from a fishing guide i met in the florida keys who had returned from a sort of busman s holiday he described the creek as rarely fished and just loaded with tarpon , two attributes that quickly placed it high on the mustfish list when he explained how it could be reached by canoe , it grabbed top billing and finally forced my recent trip to south florida perhaps it was van campen heilner s classic story the river of thrills , about fishing in the jungles of cuba , that had me convinced that the proper way to catch a tarpon was not from a bridge or even poling along a flat , but from a tiny boat in a lonely , mangrovelined creek it sounded as pure as fishing for striped bass in a pounding november surf or casting a tiny dry fly to rising trout on a pennsylvania spring creek before i headed into the everglades , i had spent a few nights priming myself by wrestling with monstersize tarpon on heavy spinning tackle from a roaring cut in marathon key to the south some of those fish were true brutes of up to 100 pounds , but they seemed almost phantomlike , jumping in the shadows cast by the nearby overseas highway before easily breaking me off now , with nothing but an eightweight flyrod and a box of tarpon streamers , i silently paddled a canoe through a long canal lined by an impenetrable wall of foliage draped with spanish moss from what the guide told me a year earlier , my destination lay about four miles ahead calls of pig frogs and the squawk of an occasional heron had replaced the din of highway traffic heilner would have been proud , i thought even in the canal a few tarpon rolled on the surface i stopped and briefly cast for them but remained distracted by the lure of the creek after all , this was where real fishing guides went on their days off i left the fish behind and continued on the canal emptied into a fairsized bay about a mile wide rafts of wintering coots splashed and chattered noisily on the surface of the brownish water i turned left as the guide had said and headed along the shoreline a few hundred yards ahead , a white stake marked the mouth of the creek , which turned out to be part of the network of canoe trails that crisscross much of the everglades as i paddled closer , the entrance seemed impossibly small , just a tunnel in the mangroves not even 10 feet wide but i glided in anyway , feeling as though the everglades had just swallowed me without a trace , canoe and all it was otherworldly in there dark , humid , close huge orb weaver spiders hung from webs strung across the aerial roots of mangroves inches from my head a lone louisiana heron seemed to stare down at me from its perch in disbelief the creek itself actually appeared to be getting smaller it twisted along at impossible angles , sending the canoe bumping from one bank to the other flycasting in such a place remained impossible then , the first mosquito arrived , followed by another , then a few hundred more and although i'm sure that heilner , a pioneering angler who had fished throughout much of the tropics , would have continued on , i had quickly seen enough i managed to turn the canoe around , and somewhat frantically , bushwhacked my way back into the bay did i take a wrong turn , or had i become the victim of a guide s joke , played on a nonpaying customer trying to glean a couple of free tips \? if it was a hoax , maybe i could pass it on to another fisherman , a sort of evergladesstyle snipe hunt by now i had already made my way back to the mouth of the canal another tarpon rolled in front of me , one of just a handful i had spotted during the day exasperated , i halfheartedly stripped out a few yards of line , shooting a bright green streamer beneath an overhanging branch i stripped twice , felt a hard take and watched dumbfounded as a tarpon of about 20 pounds threw itself from the surface , rattling its gills and crashing back into the dark water the fish jumped again and again , shining silver and purple against the dark green of the mangroves each time it leapt , i lowered the rod , giving it slack so it could n't break the line even though this was the first goodsize tarpon i had ever hooked on a flyrod , i had run the moment through my head so many times that it all felt well rehearsed eventually the tarpon tired it rolled on its side next to the boat staring at me with its huge eye i reached down to remove the hook , but the fish would have none of it it unleashed with a final crazed leap , throwing the fly back into the canoe and although none of this happened on the creek that i had dreamed about for the past year , for the moment just knowing that such a place might exist in the vastness of the everglades seemed as satisfying as if i had already been there photo in the everglades , a fisherman explores a creek lined with mangroves both the mosquitoes and the tarpon are waiting for him \( richard franklin \)
whatever happened to rumpus rooms \? there were millions of them a generation or so ago , and now not a trace can be found of that seemingly unique american institution oh , we have family rooms and dens and libraries and home theaters and the eversopromising great room , but the rumpus room has gone the way of the dodo does that mean that we as a country or as individuals have calmed down , tamed by our architecture into more sedate lives \? i have a theory that some of the mortal remains of the rumpus room have metamorphosed into wine cellars it is a comfort to think that a corner of the basement is still capable of providing a bit of excitement , although i would like to believe that none of us are causing a ruckus or raising a rumpus when we open a bottle of wine leslie ensor , editor of custom home magazine , reports on the growing popularity of wine cellars we 've noted the increase of this category since the wine cellar is a status symbol , the hot tub of the late 90 s ms ensor described a wine cellar she had seen in a house being considered for the magazine the wine cellar had been set into an arched niche in the basement and fitted with elaborate wroughtiron gates and an impressive lock unfortunately , the gap between the iron bars was large enough to allow one to reach through and extract a bottle she concluded consider whether the cellar is to be decorative or functional a wine cellar need not be in the cellar suitable storage can be found in all but the smallest of spaces , and even then , if one reassesses what is important to quality of life , a dozen bottles or so can be squeezed in somewhere kitchen and home stores and catalogues have simple racks in wood , plastic and metal some metal racks are positively sculptural and can be recycled into other rooms as the collection grows and storage matures some suggestions roll up fluffy hand towels and slot them into the remains of your first wine rack or sort some magazines into the compartments or display a salami collection or antique rolling pins when you are ready to move into more serious wine storage , consider the three enemies of wine heat , vibration and light those living near an elevated train line or over the tracks might not want to lay down chateau petrus , but vibration is usually not a serious consideration in wine storage avoiding excessive light frees up the kitchen windows for potted plants but heat is the real devil a steady temperature of 55 to 60 degrees fahrenheit is ideal for longterm storage those who have a spacious cellar at that temperature range must then decide on which types of racks are needed companies like the wine enthusiast in hawthorne , ny \( 9143459463 \) can help homeowners design the perfect cellar computergenerated images can give an idea of what the cellar will be like in any size space among the decisions are whether to use metal or wood racks if the answer is wood , then it is necessary to winnow down the choices to the one just right for one s esthetic and financial requirements installation can be doityourself or you can pay someone to do the job assembling all those bits and pieces can be a very timeconsuming , patienceeroding experience there are a lot of things in life one need do only once eating rattlesnake is one of those singular experiences , and assembling wine storage is another in the case of the rattlesnake , there is just so little return for your effort even a plump rattlesnake does n't have a lot of meat on its elegant bones less costly wine storage in terms of money and space is a freestanding unit that combines temperature and humidity control in cabinets ranging from under the counter to fullfledged , doubledoored behemoths holding 500 bottles such cabinets can be zoned to hold red , white and sparkling wines at the proper temperatures the doors can match the kitchen or the family room , but my preference is for glass doors the sight of several cases of good wine is a comfort even on days or nights when one is not serving wine another relic of the american past is also an ideal candidate for wine storage the fallout shelter in the backyard now is the time to replace the bottled water and emergency rations john thompson of ardmore , pa , told me about the real estate agent s problem when his parents' home went on the market in the early 60 s the senior thompsons built a fallout shelter with all the bells and whistles his father , a chemical engineer from princeton s class of 1927 , incorporated air filtration , secret passageways and hidden doors the shelter cost more than the original 1940 s house from behind the pingpong table in the rumpus room , the tunnel led to what my father envisioned as their last stop on earth the shelter was stocked with liquor , wine and navy rations , along with orange and black candlesticks and his princeton memorabilia , mr thompson said as appealing as it must have been to his parents , everyone had to agree with the real estate agent that it posed a problem in marketing out with the yearbooks and oldfashioned glasses in with the concept of a really secure wine cellar wine storage problems are not insurmountable a little ingenuity will provide a caring environment for 1 case or 100 and most people are better off without that rumpus room
william alfred , the author of hogan s goat and other plays and a longtime professor at harvard university , died on thursday at his home in cambridge , mass he was 76 although mr alfred had a distinguished career as an educator , it was as a playwright that he achieved his greatest recognition hogan s goat , a play in blank verse about the bitter political maneuvering among irishamericans in brooklyn in the late 19th century , was a surprise success off broadway in 1965 opening at the american place theater , it was acclaimed by the critics and ran for 607 performances it established mr alfred s theatrical reputation and also introduced faye dunaway , who was featured in the cast as the wife of matthew stanton \( ralph waite \) , the central character hogan s goat propelled ms dunaway s movie career she and mr alfred became close friends and in 1982 , as a reigning hollywood star , she returned to the theater in the curse of an aching heart , a play about irishamericans in the era after hogan s goat mr alfred began writing hogan s goat in 1956 because of the demands of his teaching career it was nine years before he finished the play robert lowell , a friend , recommended it to wynn handman , the artistic director of the american place theater , which had produced mr lowell s old glory within a year hogan s goat opened in 1971 a television version starring ms dunaway , was presented on channel 13 the author wrote several other plays , and collaborated with albert marre on cry for us all , a musical version of hogan s goat \( with a score by mitch leigh and lyrics by mr alfred and phyllis robinson \) , but none of them came close to equaling his phenomenal initial success though theaterstruck , he continued teaching at harvard , where he was one of the most popular professors the nice thing about a professor in the theater , mr alfred once said , is that you can always disappear he was born in brooklyn in 1922 after serving in the army during world war ii , he graduated from brooklyn college and then studied at harvard , where he received a master s degree and a phd while at harvard he took a course in creative writing with archibald macleish and began writing verse plays , starting with agamemnon , which was published in 1954 as a faculty member he was a medievalist , specializing in early english literature his most celebrated course was a seminar on beowulf he also taught drama , playwriting and poetry at harvard among the students he trained were tommy lee jones , stockard channing and john lithgow his quiet academic life was suddenly interrupted by hogan s goat in the play , he looked back on irish immigrants and their early domination of new york politics a highly poetic though realistic drama , it was filled with back room and barroom atmosphere , focusing on matthew stanton , who wants to unseat the corrupt mayor of brooklyn remembering his difficult voyage to america , stanton says , i crossed in middecember seven weeks of driving rain that kept the hatches battened in a hold so low of beam a man my height could never lift his head and i could n't wash i 'd have died with shame , had i sailed here to die get power ! he cries without it , there can be no decency , no virtue and no grace i have kept my vow the mayor s chair is mine but for the running his wife is less enthusiastic about his political campaign , and he is eventually brought down by the sins of his own past hogan s goat was followed by cry for us all on broadway in 1970 agamemnon , which had its premiere in 1972 at the mccarter theater in princeton , nj , and the curse of an aching heart on broadway mr alfred s roots remained in academia , where he continued to teach and write poetry and scholarly essays he retired in 1991 , but was still a familiar figure in cambridge and in the audience for productions of plays at the american repertory theater at harvard he is survived by a halfbrother , vincent allfrey as a child , he spent a great deal of time with his greatgrandmother anna maria egan who immigrated to the united states from county mayo in ireland she told him colorful stories about people she knew in brooklyn before the turn of the century they seemed to me to be more alive , even though they were dead , than the people around me , because she was such a wonderful storyteller , mr alfred said and she just intrigued me with one particular story , which was the seed of 'hogan s goat' photo william alfred at the american place theater s set for hogan s goat \( 1965 \)
kokomo , ind , june 16 a year and a half ago , doris rude , a taxi driver who is partly disabled by a herniated disc , was living at the edge of her income of 300 a week and had just 5 in the bank then she received a 1 , 900 hospital bill with poor credit and no money , she turned in desperation to a new , fastgrowing american institution the payday loan company for a fee of 30 , the company agreed to advance her a twoweek loan of 100 to obtain the loan , she wrote the company a check for 130 that the lender agreed to hold until her next payday with the 30 fee , the lender was charging her an annual interest rate that consumer advocates say is 780 percent but two weeks later , with no change in her living expenses , her check was sure to bounce so the lender let ms rude renew the loan for another two weeks , for another 30 fee soon she was bounding from one payday lender to another , six in all , borrowing from the next to pay the accumulating fees of the others ms rude had fallen into a trap that regulators worry is an increasingly common one , not just for lowerpaid workers like ms rude but for highersalaried ones as well payday lending companies are sprouting up all over the country , having increased to nearly 8 , 000 today from 300 seven years ago although this is most prosperous peacetime decade of the century , many workers have become trapped by debts run up in free spending or have been driven deeper into debt by misfortune but these workers have the two basic things needed to obtain a payday loan paychecks and checking accounts although plentiful in big cities like new york and los angeles , the payday lenders have become most visible in places like kokomo springfield , ohio , and cleveland , tenn ten have opened in kokomo , a city of 45 , 000 people bearing names like check into cash , check 'n go and fast cash , payday lenders grant loans to workers against their next paychecks in return , the companies charge a fee , typically 15 to 35 at annual rates , the fees normally exceed 300 percent and 400 percent and in some cases they reach four digits at least a dozen national chains have sprung up the biggest , ace cash express in irving , tex , has around 900 stores and revenue last year what it collected in loan fees of 100 million , twice that of 1996 check into cash , in cleveland , tenn , reported that its revenue had jumped to 21 million in the first six months of 1998 from 10 million three years ago and 1 million five years ago in much of the country , these companies escape the routine scrutiny and regulation faced by banks , finance companies and pawn shops , because in some states they are too new to have stirred much controversy and in others they have used political clout to stave off legislation as of late last year , the consumer federation of america reported that 19 states , including all of those in new england , as well as pennsylvania , texas and virginia , prohibited payday lending , most by limiting annual , smallloan interest to less than 40 percent but the federation said the 31 other states , including new york and new jersey , condoned it by law or by the absence of law a spokesman for the new york state banking department , rick hansen , disputed this assertion , saying the state s usury law forbids charging more than 25 percent annual interest on any loan the payday lenders say they are providing a vital service as commercial banks have shunned the poorest borrowers , in part by raising the minimum amounts they will lend , people who need small sums to get over a hump , like paying for a medical prescription or buying tires for a car , have few choices these include people who are unable to get credit cards or who have charged or exceeded their cards' credit limits industry leaders say comparing payday lenders' fees with annual interest rates is unfair because most of the loans are paid off within a month consumer advocates consider the interest rates exorbitant i know of loan sharks in new york who would n't charge this kind of interest , said gary l calhoun , a lawyer here who provides legal services for members of the united automobile workers state representative richard w bodiker of indiana , a democrat whose bill this year to regulate the lenders fell to intense industry lobbying , calls the fees in excess of what usury laws consider loansharking robert c rochford , deputy counsel of the national check cashers association , an industry trade group , called such accusations spurious loansharking involves coercive tactics to collect the debt , mr rochford said no major direct deposit provider has been convicted of that one reason for the lenders' growth is people s comfort with debt the nation s savings rate , the percentage of people s disposable income that is saved , dropped to 05 percent last year and to nothing at all by earlier this year from 6 percent a decade ago rather than save , people are spending more than ever and borrowing more than ever we know there s a pretty sizable group of folks whose credit cards are maxed out , said mark b tarpey , a supervisor in the consumer finance division of the indiana department of financial institutions with payday lenders around , mr tarpey said they do n't have to tell the boss they need a cash advance they do n't have to give up their tv s and furniture they do n't have to run a credit check

west nyack , ny when the palisades center mall opened here in march 1998 , the developers might have thought that their long battle with neighbors was finally over they would have been wrong an average of 300 , 000 shoppers pass through the glistening mall doors each week , surpassing the developer s expectations they pick up lumber at home depot and pressed linen suits at ann taylor , kitchen equipment at williamssonoma and bargains at target but a small group of rockland county residents who opposed this mallcumcity about 20 miles northwest of manhattan since it was first proposed in 1985 are not to be found among the crowds they say they are still shocked that the mall , all four stories and three million square feet of it , was not only built but has also apparently triumphed there are people who have devoted a quarter of their lives to fighting this mall , said linda rauer , a former shopkeeper and an environmentalist who became involved in opposing palisades center in the early 1990 s when she found out that it was being built on top of two landfills they are not going to just give up , walk away the opponents , some of whom still hope to close the mall , are now focused on assuring that a proposed expansion of palisades center is voted on in a public referendum , as promised approval of the expansion , which would permit the center to lease out about one million square feet of unoccupied space , would make it the secondlargest mall in the united states , after mall of america in bloomington , minn so when rosie o 'donnell , who lives in nyack , went on her morning television talk program in january and joked about rumors that the mall in her town was sinking and would soon close , the mall s opponents were infuriated ms rauer and the members of the rockland county civic association , a grassroots organization that was formed to stop the mall , complain that their last hope for closing the mall the possibility that cracks in the concrete floor and a distinct shimmy in the structure meant it was unsafe was reduced to a joke by ms o 'donnell we think this is a public safety issue , ms rauer said we want a structural engineer to come in and measure whether the mall is settling we want a seismic engineer to find out why that building shakes the mall is built on two former , unregulated landfills , she said , adding that even though the mall s developers built a system to contain contaminants from the landfills , poisons could percolate through the soil and end up in the drinking supply thomas j valenti , a partner in pyramid companies , the developer of the palisades center , concedes that the underground parking lot at the mall has settled , that cracks run helterskelter across the bare concrete floors and that the building s shaking is disconcerting none of it , however , means that the mall is dangerous , mr valenti said he noted that the mall has been inspected by engineers furthermore , he said , pyramid , the nation s largest mall developer , has a 390 million investment in the project , plenty of incentive to make sure that it is structurally sound these people are never satisfied with anything you do , mr valenti said you clean up landfills and that s not good enough you solve the traffic problems , stop the roads from flooding and that s not good enough no matter what solution you provide , it s never going to be good enough for them he dismissed ms rauer s fear that poisons from the landfills could harm the water supply when the pyramid companies of syracuse came to rockland to build the palisades center , its reputation for aggressiveness preceded it the company was investigated by the new york commission on government integrity for spending 776 , 967 to influence the 1985 election of the poughkeepsie town council to elect members who favored construction of the poughkeepsie galleria the commission called the contributions legal but unethical , and said they showed why campaign finance laws should be tightened karl s coplan , codirector of the pace environmental law clinic in white plains , brought five suits against pyramid in an effort to stop the palisades center mall , which to opponents seemed to be expanding nonstop when pyramid first came to town in 1985 , it proposed an 875 , 000squarefoot project , but later announced three expansions mr coplan , who lives in west nyack and in good weather kayaks across the hudson river and then bicycles to work , became involved in 1996 , when pyramid announced its plan to expand from 185 million square feet to more than 3 million square feet the developer prevailed in all five of mr coplan s suits a major blow to the opponents came when pyramid , without approval from the planning board or town board of clarkstown , which includes west nyack , went ahead with plans to build the extra space that so alarmed mr coplan the only approval that pyramid obtained was from the town s building inspector , adolph milich because of the lack of board approval , a state supreme court justice ruled after the building was already under construction that the additional space could be completed but not occupied in the wake of the judge s ruling , pyramid sought the town board s approval to profit from the expansion the town responded that residents would have to approve it in a referendum , and now , the additional square footage , on floors above lord taylor and filene s , remains vacant but opponents who hope to block the expansion fear that pyramid will seek a way to use the space without going to a public vote when you see how they operate , you can understand why no one in town believes a word they say , mr coplan said shirley lasker , the founder of the rockland county civic association , decided that the best way to fight the expansion of the mall , and what she sees as the overdevelopment of rockland county , was to run for the clarkstown town board she ran in 1997 and lost in a close election she is now gearing up for another race this november what i loved , what i came here for , the parkland , the open space , is nearly gone to overdevelopment , said ms lasker , who teaches disabled children and has lived in west nyack for 17 years ms lasker , like ms rauer and other members of the rockland civic association , does not patronize the mall but mr coplan has had to compromise when your son is invited to a skating party at the ice rink , you ca n't very well tell him that it s the death star and you just ca n't go , mr coplan said i went , but i did n't enjoy it

what , alice must once have asked the mad hatter , is the difference between an annotated book prepared by an editor and an edited book peppered with notes \? all the difference in the world , the hatter would have replied one plays the notes for the sake of the text , and the other plays the text for the sake of the notes martin gardner s annotated alice \( norton , 2995 \) is now back , in a new , definitive form , to remind us that this is so , and why a conventional edited edition is there to elucidate its text gardner , on the other hand , plays the text goes right round the floor with it , bringing in physics , psychoanalysis , literary history , math and logic for the sake of notes that are compressed little essays on all the subjects the text inspires when gardner s annotated alice first appeared , back in 1960 , this approach made it a genuinely new thing a scholarly book for nonscholars , with all the annotations placed in broad margins right alongside the text , creating , if not a context , then a kind of counterpoint between text and editor since then , many a classic has undergone annotation in the gardner mode gardner himself has had a fine time with carroll s hunting of the snark and coleridge s rime of the ancient mariner , and there have been annotated volumes ranging from a complete sherlock holmes to a partial gilbert and sullivan but none of them seem , to this digressionloving reader at least , as pleasing as the first gardner s annotated alice , which includes both alice s adventures in wonderland and through the looking glass , is all an annotated book should be a classic text illuminated , a monument with windows in it even though , 40 years on , it also has some of the elements of a period piece it memorializes the meeting of two remarkable eccentric minds at a particular moment in intellectual history the new edition has , in its organization , some odd , alicelike aspects it is what humpty dumpty would have called a portmanteau book , two volumes stuffed together in one cover in 1990 , gardner issued a second , easily missed revision of the original annotated alice , called more annotated alice , which , for variation s sake , reproduced the turnofthecentury illustrations by the american peter newell in place of the original tenniels in this presumably final edition , he has placed the old annotated alice and the new one on top of each other , to slightly strange effect the text at times mentions newell drawings that are no longer reprinted \( not in itself a bad thing the urge of artists to improve on the unimprovable tenniel is hard to understand , but they keep trying \) , and adjacent notes occasionally cancel each other out a new note in the white knight chapter of through the looking glass , for instance , seems to offer conclusive proof that carroll identified himself with the white knight , while an older note on the next page still presents this as merely an enticing hypothesis even odder , the two introductions , old and new , are laid out one after the other \( there is also a short prefatory note \) , so that problems mentioned in one are blandly solved in the next in the original introduction , for instance , gardner mentioned a cryptic reference in carroll s diary to the fact that mrs liddell , the original alice s mother , had been mad at him ever since lord newry s business what business lord newry has in carroll s diary , gardner commented , remains to this day a tantalizing mystery but three pages later , the tantalizing mystery is solved , rather banally , as the second introduction explains that we now know that lord newry , a student , wanted to have a ball at christ church college , and that mrs liddell was for and dodgson against this plan a very looking glass procedure , in its way yet even if there are odd contradictions and overlaps like this , they feel not so much confusing as cozy the reader has a sense of a project that has grown naturally and organically over time besides adding many new notes , gardner has reprinted the lost wasp in a wig chapter actually intended as an insert within the white knight chapter of through the looking glass carroll cut it from the original edition at an exasperated tenniel s request , and it then appeared , amazingly , in a printer s proof at a literary auction in 1974 since 1960 , those of us who love alice have had a double stroke of luck a whole missing chapter ! the illicit nude photographs carroll took of his child friends ! truth be told , though , the nudes are less intense than the familiar littlegirl portraits , and the wasp in his wig is an invention well lost doubtless if we ever dug up the library of alexandria , half the scrolls would be a bore and the other half out on loan we return , therefore , to the original puzzle why does this book work so well , better , even , than the other books gardner has annotated \? perhaps it is because alice is what literary theorists call or if they do n't yet , they ought to a hub book for modern thought , in the same way that memphis is the hub airport for modern packages everything flies into it , and mostly everything flies out of it carroll deliberately packed it with everything he thought about , and everything in it has the life of an idea victorian piety in parody form , mathematical and logical speculation , bits of philosophy even the sentiments are intellectualized , made strange ideas fly out , because ideas flew in \( very few books perhaps only gulliver s travels in the 18th century and ulysses and finnegans wake in the 20th are hub books of quite this kind , and in joyce one can still feel that the flights out have all been canceled because of fog \)
philadelphia , may 21 while the hometown fans were jubilant with anticipation of being host to a home playoff game , it was no secret that a 76ers defeat tonight would put the team in a terrible bind it would sink the 76ers to three games to none against the indiana pacers and put them one step from elimination , with game 4 on sunday and philadelphia s worst fears were realized despite the frenetic waving of white handkerchiefs from the sellout crowd of 20 , 930 and allen iverson s 21 points in the first half , the pacers led from the outset and defeated the 76ers , 9786 iverson finished with 32 points , and reggie miller led the pacers with 29 but while miller was not as acrobatic as iverson , he was a more effective scoring machine iverson took 33 shots and made 13 , including 2 for 10 from 3point range miller hit 9 of 14 shots and was 4 for 6 on 3pointers we knew we were coming into a hostile environment , miller said after the game , but we wanted to make a statement with our defense , and of course our focal point was stopping iverson it did not work too well in the first half , because iverson lighted up the first union center , hitting 8 of 20 shots for 21 points but he obviously tired in the second half , and the hounding of iverson by miller and mark jackson took its toll on the 76ers' young star the pacers , meanwhile , have made a strong impression on iverson these guys took the chicago bulls to seven games last season , iverson said they have a great defense , and they play with a lot of confidence , even in our building as for his performance , particularly late in the game , when he missed several shots in a row after the 76ers narrowed the pacers' lead to 7773 with 9 minutes 38 seconds to go , iverson said i kind of got caught up in the game and i tried to do too much and they just kept coming at us and it seemed that in a flash the pacers had taken a 10point , a 12point , a 14point lead the 76er offense revolves around iverson , who led the national basketball association in scoring , the shortest player , at 6 feet tall , ever to do so but it is striking when one player takes more than half the shots and winds up scoring more points than the rest of his teammates combined , as iverson did in the first half it appears that the pacers , like all the other teams , cannot contain iverson s swift moves so the trick is to give him the outside shot rather than allow him to drive to the hoop and the pacers , meanwhile , seek a balanced attack while miller had a large number of points in the first half 17 there was no sense that he was dominating the offense , in contrast to iverson and philadelphia and with this strategy , the pacers went up by as many as 13 points , 3825 the shooting percentages were key indiana s 476 to philadelphia s 349 to start the third period , the 76ers went on an 80 run and tied the score at 4949 but the pacers held on , with chris mullin scoring 10 points , including two 3pointers , in the period at the end of the third quarter , the pacers led , 7566 what was unusual for the veteran pacers was that they made 20 turnovers , nearly twice as many as the 76ers , with 11 but they made up for it by shooting 50 percent to philadelphia s 375 percent they also outrebounded philadelphia , 4742 dale davis was a particular stalwart on the boards , leading the pacers with 11 tyrone hill , a substitute forward for philadelphia , wound up with 12 rebounds jackson had a doubledouble , with 11 points and 10 assists eric snow , the philadelphia point guard , had a comparable game , scoring 16 points and dishing out 9 assists as for sunday , miller understands that philadelphia will show up , and then some allen is capable of scoring 50 points , he said this series is still far from over he did admit however , that we probably have more weapons than they do photo antonio davis \( 33 \) of the pacers and matt geiger of the 76ers going up for a rebound last night \( jamie squire allsport \)
if there is one thing the atlanta braves do n't want to hear as they head into the playoffs once more , it is that they have to win the world series to validate their status as the team of the 90 s the braves clearly have been the best team in this decade , winning eight consecutive division championships and compiling a record of 859 victories and 531 losses beginning in 1991 and running through friday night no other team in any decade or parts of two decades has made eight postseason appearances in a row \( none has made more than five straight \) , and the yankees are a distant second in wonlost record , 75 1 2 games behind at 783606 but the braves have won only one world series in the 90 s the yankees have won two , the toronto blue jays two , each in only two tries one is not enough , the braves' critics say , for a team that has finished first in seven previous seasons it is not even enough , they argue , that the braves have played in only four world series i think we 'd all love to win another one simply because that s why you play , said tom glavine , a member of every one of the team s division champions and a 20game winner for four of them if you went around and asked everybody , yeah , we 're disappointed we 've only won one beyond that , i do n't think we think a whole lot about it i do n't think we worry about whether we 're the team of the 90 s or having to win this year to validate anything we have or have n't done i think we 're extremely proud of what we 've done glavine s partner in pitching victories and cy young awards , greg maddux , said he did not care if the braves were viewed as the team of the 90 s what i care about is the accomplishments that this team has had and will have , he said we 've had another great year this year , and we 're going to try to add a little more to it not having won more world series does not detract from what the braves have done , added maddux , who has played for six of the winners who 'd have thought it \? he said i thought i 'd be dealing blackjack in las vegas obviously , you can take a resident out of las vegas , but you ca n't take las vegas out of the resident this is the fifth title team for chipper jones , the braves' strong candidate for the most valuable player award , an honor the braves have n't had since terry pendleton , also a third baseman , gained it in 1991 , the year the championship run began no matter what happens at the end of the 90 s , jones said , we 're still going to hold our heads high and know for 10 years we played better baseball than anyone else we won more games than anyone else it just happened that a couple teams beat us around october time to deny us these championships we 're not going to slit our wrists because people say we have only one everybody knows at the very least that if you want to be the national league representative in the world series , eventually you 're going to have to come through us john smoltz acknowledged that he once let the negative view of the braves' success creep into his thinking no more my take has totally changed , the pitcher said we have been sucked in to thinking that for the longest time that i finally refuse to think that way i really do n't care what happens i do n't care what people think all i know is i 've had a blast the last eight years people would trade anything to be in my position take a poll see how many guys would want what i 've had the braves , smoltz said , want to win the world series this year because they want to win every year that , after all , is the ultimate goal it would be absolutely easy to be the florida marlins , to win one year and not show up again , he added look at peoples' perception do n't disappoint me if you 're going to go , win if you win , it s tremendous and if you never show up again , we had our one year but if you go nine straight years and win only one , there s something wrong there you see how warped that view is \? any team that has been in the playoffs in recent years talks about how difficult a task it faces in even getting through the first two series to the world series , let alone winning the world series the threeoffivegame division series especially poses problems it s very easy to sit back and secondguess and criticize when you 've never been in that situation , smoltz said when we 're done and it s over , i guarantee you every view will change smoltz , who like glavine has played for every one of the winning 90 s teams , said he even preferred his experience to that of some players who had enjoyed more frequent world series success i would n't want to be the guy who jumps around from team to team late , gets into the playoffs and gets lucky enough to win three or four rings , he said the braves this season have added another distinction to their record they have become only the fourth team in history to win 100 games or more three successive seasons it does n't matter , smoltz said people are n't going to hang a star over us because we 've done it all it is is another accomplishment that people do n't care about unless you ultimately finish it off a martinez double
washington , may 14 a federal appeals panel today threw out air quality standards that have been a cornerstone of the clinton administration s antipollution strategy in a 2to1 decision , a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that the environmental protection agency had arbitrarily set standards for permissible levels of fine soot the court also said that in setting smog standards , the epa had exceeded its powers it said it would have been unconstitutional for congress to have granted it such broad authority under the clean air act the judges said that the agency had failed to adequately explain how it set its standards the standards put hundreds of communities out of compliance with the clean air act the epa had directed states to take steps to reduce levels of these pollutants the agency s standards would limit the allowable levels in the air of extremely fine soot , particles measuring as little as 25 microns across , a tiny fraction of the width of a human hair the agency would also require that ozone , an essential part of smog , not exceed a concentration of eighthundredths of a part per million in the air previous standards , which remain in force , allow ozone concentrations to reach twelvehundredths of a part per million , and do not regulate soot less than 10 microns across the new standards measure ozone over eight hours , while the previous rule measured it over one hour none of the standards actually require specific industries to reduce their pollution instead , the federal government tries to set national pollution rules , such as for automobile emissions , that will allow most cities to comply with the air quality standards , and then demands that cities and states with particularly dirty air take further steps a lawyer at the united states chamber of commerce , robin s conrad , said we see this as a big win the epa s got to justify its numbers it ca n't pull them out of thin air but supporters of the epa standards , which were announced in june 1997 and were to take effect over the next few years , said they saw hope in the dissent of one the judges , david s tatel , a clinton appointee , who wrote that the decision by his colleagues , stephen f williams and douglas h ginsburg , both reagan appointees , ignored the fact that over the past halfcentury , the supreme court had permitted far wider delegations of powers to federal agencies , the kind at issue in this case the case involved challenges by ohio , michigan and west virginia along with those by a trucking group and a variety of other industries briefs in support of the standards were filed by massachusetts , new jersey , connecticut , vermont , new york and new hampshire , and others a broad regional plan by the epa clamps down on emissions by power plants in the middle west that create pollution that drifts into the northeast , putting cities out of compliance the majority ruled that the soot standard was unsupported by the evidence in the record and was arbitrary and capricious what epa lacks , the ruling said , is any determinate criterion for drawing lines , adding , it has failed to state intelligibly how much is too much the way the epa read the clean air act , the judges said , left it free to pick any point between zero and a hair below the concentrations yielding london s killer fog judge tatel said , though , that in setting the standards , the agency had used the latest scientific knowlege , as the law required in calling into question the epa s criteria , the judges were at odds with a longheld legal doctrine that administrative agencies have broad discretion in making complex scientific decisions the decision points out what people on both sides of the case say is a growing contradiction in air pollution policy congress told the epa to set standards that protect the public s health with an adequate margin of safety , on the theory that there is a threshold below which any pollutant is safe but some scientific studies now say that for contaminants like groundlevel ozone , known as smog , any exposure may be harmful at the white house , joe lockhart , the president s press secretary , said , we are deeply disappointed by the court of appeals' ruling today on clean air standards , particularly given the court s explicit recognition that there is a strong scientific and public health rationale for tougher air quality protections the epa said in a statement that the standards it had put in place will protect the health of 125 million americans , including 35 million children the ruling , the statement asserted , does not question the science and process conducted by epa justifying the setting of new , more protective standards however , the agency said , the panel called into question the constitutionality of the primary public health provision of the clean air act that on numerous occasions have been ratified by congress and , until now , the courts proposed tighter rules on automotive emissions , including new standards for sport utility vehicles , would be among the first affected and possibly derailed by the new interpretation , some experts said one epa official said he thought the regulations for vehicles could still proceed the agency plans an appeal if that is not successful , the agency said in a statement , congress must insure that these protections are preserved for the american people but some advocates of tighter standards were wary of congress john m stanton , a lawyer for the national environmental trust , said of the ruling today , they 're saying , you can always give this back to the legislative branch , you can always give this back to the republicans , who we know are going to overturn these

plush , new living space vince carter s vertical leap and latrell sprewell s scoring savvy were on display all evening vibrant , young players sprinting toward the next millennium yet with 213 seconds left in a tie game and the knicks discombobulated on offense , the ball was dumped inside to ewing with the shot clock about to expire , he turned around on antonio davis and released a soft fallaway jump shot a few inches right of the freethrow line it rattled in in the last knick game of the century at madison square garden , ewing pushed aside the future for a moment to deliver nostalgia and a stirring 9190 victory over the toronto raptors despite some shaky freethrowing shooting in the final seconds from sprewell , the knicks managed to survive and record their seventh victory in the last eight games the ball found its way into my hand and i just made the play , ewing said it feels good my shot is back ewing had a modest 8point , 8rebound night , but he brought the knicks home after a wild toronto comeback from 15 points down in the final 8 minutes 34 seconds the knicks survived some anxious moments even after the basket when sprewell went to the freethrow line with 29 seconds left and new york leading by 1 point he missed the first shot his second miss in the final 41 seconds and , on instruction from coach jeff van gundy , purposely missed the second so the raptors could not set up a designed out of bounds play under the basket , down by only 2 points doug christie grabbed the rebound , and his halfcourt running prayer barely grazed the rim to end the madness while ewing s shot was the clutch one , most of the night belonged to carter and sprewell between the toronto forward s dunks and long jumpers and sprewell s dribbledrive jumpers catching all net , the two forwards waged a shootout sprewell was awesome for 10 minutes of the second half , ending with 25 points to lead new york and allan houston was his reliable self from the perimeter for most of the night , chipping in 18 points carter was remarkable , scoring 36 points on five dunks and a plethora of jump shots he scored on one dunk in the first quarter in which he seemed to pluck a seemingly errant alleyoop pass from the garden rafters before throwing it down he made 13 of 25 shots , none bigger than a rainbow jumper with 407 seconds left coming off a screen from davis , his right foot slightly elevated like michael jordan s , carter tied the game at 8686 sprewell kept pace in a burst somewhat reminiscent of his game 5 explosion in the playoff finals last june , he scored 12 straight points at the end of the third quarter and the outset of the fourth to help the knicks pull away losing his man by dribbling hard and driving to either side , he would stop and pull up for mediumrange jump shots that fell softly through the net , his right arm held high , following each shot through the rim he was feeling it , and there was nothing the raptors could do to simmer him down for the second straight game , van gundy elected to go with a bigger lineup featuring houston and sprewell in the backcourt , marcus camby alongside larry johnson and patrick ewing on the frontline , and charlie ward on the bench to start the game the move paid dividends in overtime against the charlotte hornets on monday night , and the knicks parlayed that performance into an even more convincing effort for most of last night but the knicks came down on offense on the final play with no cohesion johnson had the ball at the top of the key and kept motioning for sprewell to get free so he could receive the pass on the wing and dump it in to houston but sprewell stood there on the perimeter , unsure of where to go and covered tightly sensing disaster , johnson tried to dribble out of trouble before finding ewing , who essentially brought an end to a regularseason keepsake the play was designed to go to allan in the post , van gundy said somehow it was passed to patrick and he nailed the shot he hit a lot of big shots in his career and this was another rebounds the knicks appear on their way to having a representative role in the allstar game for the first time since 1996 after the first round of balloting for the 2000 game in oakland , calif , was released yesterday , allan houston and latrell sprewell were third among eastern conference guards and forwards , respectively houston \( 92 , 715 votes \) trailed allen iverson \( 293 , 892 \) and eddie jones \( 114 , 257 \) while sprewell \( 122 , 362 \) trailed vince carter \( 297 , 870 \) and grant hill \( 214 , 910 \) the top five votegetters are selected as starters , with the final seven roster spots decided by coaches if houston ca n't catch jones in the balloting , there is a good chance he will be selected by the coaches allan deserves it , i do know that , sprewell said asked if he felt the coaches would vote him on the team , sprewell added , i have no idea patrick ewing was the last

hempstead , ny , dec 16 tom tupa s leg has healed , and the jets' punter has such supreme confidence in both his leg and his teammates that he said he would not kick the ball away from deion sanders on sunday tupa and the rest of the jets will have to stop sanders , the cowboys' versatile cornerback , receiver and perhaps the mostfamed punt returner in recent national football league history but except for what tupa described today as some wrinkles we 'll throw in , he plans simply to punt the ball as high and as far as he can if he does what he has done so well for most of this season , the jets' defenders should have enough time to corral sanders if i get a quality punt , then the guys will be there , tupa said confidently tupa had been bothered for the last three games with a hamstring pull in his right leg the injury lowered both his net average and overall average still , his average of 452 yards a punt is onetenth of a yard away from the finest season in jets history that came in 1965 , when curley johnson was the punter the jets' kicking game has become critical this season as ray lucas has learned about quarterbacking on the job until the last two weeks , when lucas threw for a total of six touchdowns , the jets had not been scoring a lot in fact , the team still has not scored 30 points in a game this year so tupa s booming punts he ranks third in the american football conference have kept the opposition pinned back when i came into the league with new england , tupa said , bill parcells told me 'i do n't care what you punt i just want the average higher than the other teams' punters' now , sanders represents an unusual opponent his average punt return , 12 yards , puts him third in the national football conference he has scored a touchdown on a return and also produced a 76yard return against the giants he s the fastest guy i 've ever seen , said his former teammate , omar stoutmire a defensive back who had been a cowboys starter and is now the jets' free safety stoutmire will actually be playing against sanders occasionally on sunday sanders lined up as a wide receiver last week , and his coach , chan gailey , said he would do it again the first jet chasing the returner is chris hayes , the club s top special teams tackler hayes has downed three punts inside the 5yard line , playing what is known as the gunner role his first move once he catches the ball is very dangerous , hayes said about sanders i see none quicker in the league so what will hayes do \? wait for sanders to make the first move \? no , i 'll slow him down with my best shot , hayes said you ca n't wait to react i do n't think we 'll punt away from him we 'll take the challenge hayes wants to make sure he does not give sanders room to return a kick along the sidelines so when he is bearing down on sanders , he will try not to leave a lane along the outside it is a difficult juggling act even parcells dismissed the possibility of punting away from sanders some do , the coach said but when you start directional punting , you might be sacrificing yards bernie parmalee , a shifty runner himself , is one of the faster jets who chase the punt returner he knows about one of sanders s tricks he takes the ball and holds it out there , not tucked away , parmalee said if you see a guy with the ball out like that , you go for the ball rather than the tackle that gives him a chance to put on his moves dwayne gordon , a linebacker and another important special teams player , describes sanders as aware of the field , using his dangerous first move to get clear of a swarm of tacklers tupa was not volunteering information , of course , but he did admit that the jets would do something to limit his big plays extra points vinny testaverde continued his daily rehabilitation program thursday following his achilles' tendon surgery but his days have grown longer because his mother , josie , is in intensive care following surgery over the weekend for a serious infection the quarterback s father died last winter jason ferguson , the nose tackle who was suspended for four games for using a banned substance , will return to the club next tuesday jumbo elliott will be arraigned next week on a misdemeanor charge stemming from a bar fight over the summer
moscow , may 14 after a day of angry and vivid speeches that accused president boris n yeltsin of crimes like treason and genocide , the speaker of parliament predicted tonight that the lower house would vote on saturday to impeach him on at least one of the charges against him as the crisis moved toward its next stage , the speaker , gennadi seleznyov , a communist who leads the 450seat lower house , said the opposition to mr yeltsin , strengthened by his decision this week to dismiss prime minister yevgeny m primakov , would collect more than the 300 votes required to impeach the debate today was bitter , heated and at times incoherent , as deputies took turns blaming mr yeltsin for all the ills that have befallen russia in the last seven years , from the collapse of its military to the poverty and decline of its population do n't you hear all of russia wailing \? sergei govorukhin , a nationalist and a filmmaker , asked they wail and hold out their hands , begging to free us from him , to save our children all russia except the population of the criminal megalopolises and some 150 deputies who are always ready to sell themselves all of russia demands impeachment in a rebuttal , mr yeltsin s parliamentary representative , aleksandr kotenkov , accused the president s accusers of staging a political and not a legal process , heavy on personal judgment and weak on legally tenable facts the other impeachment charges , to be voted on saturday by paper ballots that will be made public , accuse mr yeltsin of orchestrating the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , of storming the parliament in 1993 and of waging an illegal war in chechnya from 1994 to 1996 the chechnya section , which will be supported by a leading liberal party as well as by the communists and their leftwing allies , is expected to pass by as many as 312 votes , mr seleznyov said today although other deputies echoed his prediction , none said they expected the charge to be upheld through the impeachment process according to the russian constitution , an impeachment has to be reviewed by the supreme court , where this accusation is widely expected to be squelched still , in view of the nervous political condition , a vote to impeach could carry major political consequences , a kremlin aide warned the president s decisions may be most unexpected , the itartass news agency quoted unnamed official in one popular construction , the lower house might choose next week to sidestep another showdown by voting to approve mr yeltsin s prime ministerdesignate , sergei v stepashin , a kremlin loyalist who heads the main police force thrust into a tenuous role , mr stepashin consulted today with parliamentary leaders and potential cabinet members in an attempt to restore the shaky consensus that mr primakov s ouster shattered if the parliament approves mr stepashin , mr yeltsin will have no evident constitutional means to dismiss it and call early elections under the constitution , the president has to disband parliament if it votes three times to reject his nominee for prime minister another clause forbids him to dismiss parliament while an impeachment proceeding is under way in view of the constitution s loose language and mr yeltsin s wellknown penchant for surprises , some experts said a vengeful kremlin could freely interpret those legalisms yet there was growing hope for a solution that might at least keep the political arrangements in place until parliamentary elections in december the communists will be happy if an impeachment passes , because it means they will have been able to punish him , said a deputy from moscow , vladimir lysenko in exchange , they could vote for stepashin , which would give them the chance to live calmly until december mr lysenko , 43 , once a loyal supporter of mr yeltsin and a fellow democrat , a label broadly used to describe anticommunists , took the podium today to urge the 68yearold president to resign and spare the country the agony of an openended crisis that he created you have completely disassociated yourself from the democratic movement that brought you to power , said mr lysenko , now a member of the moderate regional bloc you have hidden yourself behind the kremlin walls , and high fences we who sincerely believed in democratic reforms and began them with you , are now doomed to hear the curses of our compatriots in an interview , mr lysenko said he had planned to vote against impeachment until wednesday , when mr primakov was discharged now , mr lysenko said , he is seriously considering joining his old communist foes in what he said has turned into a vote of noconfidence in a presidency that has gone badly wrong from a human point of view , he said , i am sorry from a political point of view , i am fed up mr lysenko said a straw poll of his district , a liberal stronghold in northern moscow , showed his electorate to be almost evenly divided on impeachment , whereas colleagues from distant regions were reporting an overwhelming majority against mr yeltsin many deputies are required to vote for impeachment or else they will be out of job in december , mr lysenko said
avignon , france within the medieval walls of avignon , the rue republique cuts through the tangle of streets to the central place de l'horloge and the broad white square in front of the papal palace now , street and squares are a solid mass of people among the throngs are actors with outlandishly painted faces , jugglers , men twisting balloons into animal shapes , mimes standing motionless on soapboxes a group of african drummers weaves through , passing out fliers and singing as a backdrop , every available surface is plastered with posters advertising theater events , from marguerite duras plays to circuses the bright logos and graphics blend into a colorful wallpaper or , hanging from lampposts in sheaths of plastic , flap like the flags of unknown countries in the wailing gusts of the mistral for three weeks , says alain leonard , the director of the festival off , avignon s answer to the edinburgh fringe , the whole city of avignon becomes one big theater the avignon festival itself is the largest theater festival in france in its 53d season this year , from july 9 to 31 , it presented more than 50 works of theater and dance in 23 spaces in and around the city , from an old quarry eight miles out of town to the traditional openair stage of the cour d'honneur in the papal palace while frenchlanguage theater still accounts for more than half of the program , this year s festival included a special focus on south america , as well as works from bulgaria , italy and germany companies not invited to the main festival come at their own expense to the festival off , and this year 550 did ever since it began in 1947 with shakespeare s richard ii , paul claudel s l'histoire de tobie et sara and a brandnew work by a young author named maurice clavel , the avignon festival has walked a fine line between old and new , provocative and popular and , more recently , between focusing on france and moving into the international arena avignon was the host of robert wilson and philip glass s world premiere of einstein on the beach in 1976 and peter brook s mahabharata in 1985 yet its programs have also relied heavily on more conventional productions of french classics and shakespeare this year s season opener was henry v , which had never been performed in france perhaps because it shows the english triumphing over the french the critics were reserved the public enthusiastic at the other end of the spectrum was voyage au bout de la nuit \( voyage to the end of night \) , an adaptation of celine s novel by an italian company , societas raffaello sanzio the production focused on , among other things , the cadaver of a horse , prompting both catcalls and bravos on its opening night avignon has had its scandal , le monde and other papers reported with satisfaction there are two audiences , said bernard faivre d'arcier , who has directed the festival since 1992 and led it from 1980 to 1984 as well there is a more popular audience , which is n't much of a connoisseur , which likes theater but is a little scared of the critics and the parisians then there is an audience composed of real connoisseurs so one has to bring these two together , combine them at the start of the festival , he continued , the audience is more regional , so you have a production like 'henry v' after july 14 , bastille day , when everyone goes on vacation heads south , that is , from paris to avignon we do more divisive , more provocative things angelin preljocaj the contemporary ballet choreographer or raffaello sanzio with celine and at the end of the festival , we do a piece that brings everyone together the season s final work was tango , vals y tango by an argentinian choreographer , ana maria stekelman in the beginning , theater at the avignon festival was secondary the main event in 1947 was an exhibit of contemporary art in the papal palace , and there was heated debate about placing work by the likes of bonnard and picasso within those venerable walls as an added attraction , the popular actor and director jean vilar was invited to stage one of his signature pieces , murder in the cathedral he proposed shakespeare , claudel and clavel instead a welcome move toward decentralization transporting culture to areas outside paris the event was a success thanks to jean vilar , avignon may be able to give us a festival of theater the way we have festivals of film , said the newspaper le figaro in more than two decades as the festival s founder and director , vilar sought to bring new life to french theater and at the same time create a dialogue with the distinctive architecture of the medieval city today , however , festivals are less local than international , and avignon is no exception the increasing number of companies from abroad reflects a general trend , but it is also an invitation for additional foreign spectators while foreigners accounted for only about 10 percent of the 115 , 000 tickets sold this year , the exoticism of special programs devoted to asia \( last year \) or south america could attract wider audiences

the financier kirk kerkorian , who is best known for his ownership of the mgm grand hotel and his mid1990 s battle to take over chrysler , has expressed a desire to purchase the jets , according to two national football league owners one of the owners called the 82yearold kerkorian s chance of getting the jets good if he really wants them kerkorian was the 75thrichest man in the world in 1998 , according to forbes magazine s annual ranking , with an estimated net worth of 38 billion in may , soon after the death of the jets' owner , leon hess , hess s estate announced the hiring of the investment firm goldman , sachs company to handle the sale process according to financial experts , the jets could go for 500 million goldman , sachs is prepared to send out prospectuses to potential bidders as early as this week potential buyers can then make a bid , according to owners , and those bids will be presented to the hess estate , which will accept the highest or most agreeable offer one of the goldman , sachs prospectus books is expected to go to kerkorian , who has contacted the firm , according to the two owners other potential bidders include the new york real estate developer samuel j lefrak , the mets coowner nelson doubleday , the devils owner john mcmullen and charles dolan , cablevision s chairman a majority of the nfl s owners would have to approve the team s new ownership when asked what qualities he would like in the new jets owner , commissioner paul tagliabue said the nfl in new york has had mighty few owners in 80 years of nfl football but they have all been strong league people and have known the importance of doing well in every city , doing well in buffalo , green bay and kansas city , as well as in new york , chicago and some of the big markets so , someone that has the same values and longterm vision is what you 'd like to see tagliabue added that the league is working closely with hess s son , john , who is representing the family , and the jets team president steve gutman , who is representing the team the sale of the jets could go quickly , since the hess estate will most likely not bid for the team the only thing that could slow the process , owners maintain , is the desire of coach bill parcells to hold off the sale because of the potential distraction it could provide for the team the jets lost in the american football conference championship game last season yet parcells may not have a choice because if a blockbuster bid is made soon , the estate will be foolish to ask the potential buyer to wait if kerkorian does enter the bidding process , he will be a formidable candidate he would be one of the league s wealthiest owners , and would probably have little trouble financing the purchase of the team kerkorian also donates significant amounts of time and money to charitable causes in january , kerkorian gave 15 million to the american red cross for earthquake reconstruction and relief efforts in armenia , which was devastated by a 1988 earthquake kerkorian , who shuns publicity , was born the son of an armenian immigrant fruit farmer he earned a reputation for scrappiness early in life even being sent to reform school as a teenager and earned the nickname rifle right kerkorian as a lightweight amateur boxer he never got a high school diploma but after being introduced to flying by a friend , became so skilled at it that he was hired to train pilots during world war ii following the war , he built the trans international airline charter service and sold it in 1968 for 104 million he then purchased a 40 percent stake in the mgm movie studio and has since been a major stockholder in the studio as well as in chrysler , in which he tried to purchase a controlling interest in 1995 since kerkorian spends most of his time in the west , mainly in las vegas , nev , his potential entry into the jets' bidding process is the first signal that the team s suitors will not be limited to the new york area the jets are the third nfl franchise in the last several years to be put up for sale , joining the washington redskins and the cleveland browns throwing it all away if the group of rookie quarterbacks struggling through hours in the classroom and taking a beating on the field can learn from anything , it is the experiences of ryan leaf , the second player chosen in last year s draft it was impossible for the san diego chargers to know that leaf would turn out to be so immature as a rookie least season , he finished with one of the worst quarterback ratings in the league , he was caught on videotape cursing at a reporter and he alienated most of his teammates last week , leaf told usa today he would most likely not be back once his contract reaches the voidable portions after the 2000 season then , just a day later , he got into a confrontation with a heckling fan , again caught on video , leading to teammates again blasting him for his immaturity so far , none of

there is little chance he can catch up with his teammates patriots hire former agent the patriots remain busy trying to patch all of their injured players , but the team is also engrossed in completing plans for its new stadium because andy wasynczuk , the vice president for business operations , has been so involved in stadium issues , several weeks ago the patriots started looking for someone to help him deal with the job he usually does , which is signing players they hired the former player agent jack mula the move continues a trend by teams that are now hiring the enemy agents and teams are usually at opposite ends of the spectrum because the agent wants as much money as possible for the player and the team wants to keep salaries as low as possible but teams , recognizing the value that agents can play if they cross the line , are hiring them to help with negotiations agents can tell teams the tricks they use in negotiations green bay hired the former agent andrew brandt as director for player finance and the oakland raiders brought in the former agent bruce allen to negotiate contracts photo kirk kerkorian , 82 , has a net worth of about 38 billion , forbes

rome , nov 2 the debate over the conduct of pope pius xii during world war ii has lasted far longer than either the war or his 19year papacy accused by critics of remaining shamefully silent during the holocaust , pius xii is revered by many roman catholics as quite literally a saint his cause for beatification , the penultimate step before sainthood , is still on course but a new and scalding biography , hitler s pope the secret history of pius xii \( viking press \) , by the british journalist john cornwell , has revived public scrutiny of the wartime leader of the catholic church the intensity of the dispute , moreover , has led many leaders of jewish groups and even some catholic scholars to question the vatican s decision to make him a candidate for sainthood at a vaticansponsored interfaith meeting last month , jewish representatives said they had been privately informed by vatican officials that pope john xxiii , whose second vatican council in the early 1960 s rid church doctrine of the idea that jews were collectively responsible for the death of jesus , was to be beatified next year the leaders said they had been told that the cause of pius xii , however , would not be ready in 2000 some jewish organizations viewed the disclosure as a sign that their lobbying had paid off but the implication that the holy see is delaying the beatification of pius xii to appease jewish concerns is resented by many vatican officials the beatification of pius xii will not take place in the year 2000 because we have not completed the preparatory work , but that does not mean it has been slowed or stopped , said the rev peter gumpel , a jesuit who has been researching the cause of pius xii for the last 30 years for years , jewish and catholic leaders alike have warned that the beatification of pius xii could harm reconciliation efforts begun during vatican ii and cemented by the current pope , john paul ii now , some religious leaders say they fear that a perception that the beatification was halted for political reasons could also impede reconciliation the constant condemnation of pius xii is causing a catholic backlash that can impede catholicjewish relations , said rabbi jack bemporad , the director of the new jerseybased center for interfaith understanding , who attended the vatican interfaith assembly it is obscuring the substance of what has been achieved vatican officials have confirmed that john xxiii , but not pius xii , will be beatified next year but insist that neither jewish criticism nor mr cornwell s unflattering biography affected the schedule they explain that while both processes were begun in 1965 , john xxiii s papacy lasted less than five years , and involves less paperwork john paul ii is not one to bend to outside pressure , said the rev pierre blet , a jesuit who helped compile an 11volume collection of vatican documents from world war ii and wrote his own , less incendiary biography of pius xii mr cornwell s book was written for a mass audience , and its more sensational arguments pius xii , who was pope from 1939 until his death in 1958 , is painted as a lifelong antisemite have helped make it a best seller but the book has infuriated vatican officials , who say it is an unjust portrait some reviewers have argued that mr cornwell squeezed the facts to fit his thesis that pius xii could and should have spoken out against hitler america , a catholic national weekly magazine edited by jesuits , concluded that mr cornwell s book fails as a work of historical scholarship but its editors also stated that because of the lingering questions , beatification of pius xii at this time would be inopportune in rome , however , the challenge to mr cornwell s scholarship is being led by father gumpel , a respected church historian who also happens to be in charge of pius xii s beatification process father gumpel is the relator of the beatification cause , which the vatican defines as an investigating judge the vatican revised its rules on canonization in 1983 , eliminating the role of the promoter of the faith , commonly known as the devil s advocate father gumpel explained that it was his duty to present even damning information but so far , he insists , he has found none meanwhile , mr cornwell has thrown himself into the process , saying in an interview , i suppose i am the devil s advocate mr cornwell makes much of a letter sent to the vatican by pius xii in 1919 , when he was bishop eugenio pacelli and papal nuncio in munich , that reports on his deputy s unpleasant encounter with bolshevik revolutionaries who were then terrorizing catholic priests and the german bourgeoisie the letter describes the leader , max lieven , as a young man , of about 30 or 35 , also russian and a jew pale , dirty , with drugged eyes , hoarse voice , repulsive , with a face that is both intelligent and sly the letter also describes mr lieven s companions , a gang of young women , of dubious appearance , jews like the rest of them
imrali , turkey , may 31 on the first day of his trial on treason charges , the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan apologized for his past and said he would call for an end to guerrilla violence if the turkish authorities would give him the chance to turn his army into a civilian political party speaking with rising emotion , mr ocalan admitted that he and his fighters were responsible for all the killings and other acts attributed to them by prosecutors , and added , i could list many more you have n't mentioned but he said he had come to believe that his approach to solving the country s ethnic problems was a deadend street now is the time to end this conflict , or else it will get much worse , he said i want to dedicate my life to bringing turks and kurds together there have long been complaints from kurds , a distinct ethnic group in turkey and neighboring countries , about official suppression of their language and culture the kurdish guerrillas have been at war with the turkish government for 15 years , a struggle that according to various estimates has taken more than 30 , 000 lives and cost ankara 100 billion mr ocalan s statement was sure to astonish many turks , kurdish or not , and many may find it hard to take seriously for more than a decade he has been portrayed here as a bloodthirsty killer fanatically dedicated to dividing and destroying the turkish republic you could see this as a great chance for the state , but it s hard to imagine them taking it , said a european diplomat who was at the court session today compromising with an enemy you 've been fighting and denouncing so fiercely for so long runs against something that s very deeply ingrained in this part of the world the trial is being held under tight security at the remote prison island of imrali , where mr ocalan \( pronounced ohjalan \) has been the only inmate since his capture in kenya in october he entered the courtroom unannounced through a side door and took the sole seat inside a glass booth reserved for him the outburst of anger that some had expected from parents of fallen soldiers who were in the courtroom did not materialize but three were led out later , after they began shouting epithets and waving pictures of their dead sons at mr ocalan as is the custom in turkish security courts , the three judges , including one military officer , shared the raised dais with prosecutors defense lawyers sat below two of them left early , evidently upset that they had not been able to agree with their client on a strategy after the presiding judge rejected a motion that the trial be postponed , prosecutors began reading their indictment , which was a detailed account of mr ocalan s personal and political history it described his founding of the kurdistan workers party , or pkk , in 1978 , his decision to begin an armed campaign in 1984 and his use of training bases in syria , lebanon and elsewhere the indictment included reports of specific engagements in which mr ocalan s fighters were said to have killed soldiers , police officers and civilians it is universally assumed here that the trial will end with a guilty verdict , most likely a death sentence mr ocalan has not entered a plea whether the sentence will be carried out is uncertain there have been no executions in turkey since 1984 the leadership council that has taken over direction of mr ocalan s group since his capture issued a statement before the trial began today threatening retaliation if he is executed policies of extermination and vengeance , especially aimed against the person of our president , will not go unanswered , the statement said in another reminder of the reality of war in southeastern turkey , the military announced that soldiers had killed 10 rebels and lost one of their own in clashes over the weekend mr ocalan , 50 , was held incommunicado for 10 days after his capture he has been allowed only limited meetings with his lawyers , who seemed confused and illprepared today some human rights advocates have said he is being treated unfairly , but prime minister bulent ecevit today rejected such charges the rights of the defendant and his lawyers are being guarded , mr ecevit said it is now up to the independent turkish judiciary to have its say although the government and mass media seemed likely to report mr ocalan s professed conversion to democracy with skepticism , the dozen foreign diplomats who were in the courtroom , among them representatives of the united nations and the european parliament , described themselves as amazed none had expected to see the longtime marxist firebrand so contrite and at the same time so overwrought he went on for minutes on end with just sentence fragments , and it was impossible to figure out what he was saying , said one diplomat you got the feeling the situation was overwhelming him but the message came through anyway , loud and clear mr ocalan s rambling statement lasted nearly 40 minutes he said he was worried that he would not have another chance to speak , but the presiding judge assured him that he would have ample opportunity later in the trial , which is expected to take weeks in his remarks , mr ocalan poured scorn on greece , which he said had supported his group for years but failed to protect him when he sought asylum but the core of his statement was his call for an end to violence he said that he had forged his ideology during the 1970 s , when turkey was being torn by political violence , but that since 1990 i have wanted to change in accordance with the new situation in the world we want to give up the armed struggle and have full democracy , so the pkk can enter the political system , he said from this moment on , i do n't want one single soldier or pkk militant to die barriers against the expression of kurdish language and culture should be removed , he said today the best policy would be to give the kurds linguistic and cultural freedom kurds should not hesitate to use this democratic chance in the best way possible i call on the state not to block the way i will work with the republic of turkey toward the goal of peace and brotherhood in the past i was the one to blame , the one responsible but that is not the case today i call on both sides to stop the bloodshed of armed conflict call it a ceasefire or whatever you want turkey s future is at stake mr ocalan offered to broker a peace , if the court lets him i will serve the state , because i now see that it is necessary , he said these are my most important words my service is important if it extinguishes the fire if i am given new means , i can bring the fighters down from the mountains in three months but the state cannot do it let us join together to end this danger the pkk should see that the only solution is living together in a single country , together and without weapons i realize i am saying this too late , but what can i do now \? maybe i can help the best shelter for kurds would be a democratic republic photo abdullah ocalan , who has led the kurdistan workers party in its guerrilla war against the turkish government , went on trial yesterday on the island of imrali he apologized and offered to pursue peace \( associated press \)

ellicott city , md , dec 16 alternating between deep concern and lightheartedness , monica s lewinsky testified in a maryland court for more than an hour today in an effort to help state prosecutors put linda r tripp in jail for secretly taperecording their conversations ms lewinsky , a poised and practiced witness by now , told the prosecutors that she had not given mrs tripp permission to record their telephone conversations when she discussed her relationship with president clinton i had not consented , she told a deputy state attorney general , carmen shepard , in howard county circuit court near mrs tripp s home ms lewinsky also testified that she did not rely on anything she learned from the independent counsel s investigation of her relationship with mr clinton when she identified a particular conversation as having taken place on dec 22 , 1997 the state charges filed against mrs tripp last july involve the tape that she made of that conversation determining the date of the conversation is crucial for prosecutors , who have charged mrs tripp with two felony counts for knowingly violating maryland s wiretap laws , which prohibit taping a conversation without the consent of the other person although mrs tripp secretly taped more than 20 hours of her conversations with ms lewinsky , the dec 22 conversation is the only one that took place after prosecutors believe mrs tripp was definitively informed by her lawyer that it was illegal to do so in maryland when ms shepard asked what ms lewinsky felt when she first saw herself on the cover of newsweek magazine on feb 2 , 1998 , and inside the magazine read a transcript of the dec 22 conversation with mrs tripp , ms lewinsky replied , it terrified me because i was concerned about the privacy of my relationship being revealed under questioning from ms shepard , ms lewinsky said there were many references in the transcript that made her certain the conversation had taken place on dec 22 it was clear to me that this was from a conversation i had with linda tripp on dec 22 , she said it was etched in my mind because it was a pretty frightening time for me a few days before the conversation , both mrs tripp and ms lewinsky had received subpoenas in the sexual misconduct lawsuit filed against the president by paula corbin jones accusations that mr clinton tried to get ms lewinsky to lie about their relationship to lawyers for mrs jones led to his impeachment last december the opportunity for a glareoff between ms lewinsky and the woman she once told a grand jury she hated did not occur because mrs tripp chose not to appear in court there was , however , a moment of personal drama when mrs tripp s son , ryan , walked into the spectator s section and smiled at ms lewinsky , who suddenly became flustered ms lewinsky abruptly turned to judge diane o leasure and asked if she could have a break you want a recess \? the judge asked yeah , please , ms lewinsky replied ms lewinsky s lawyer , plato cacheris , said his client was not enthusiastic about appearing in court against her former confidante turned nemesis , mrs tripp she did her bit in the impeachment trial and she 'll do what she has to do in this case , mr cacheris said as far as we 're concerned , that should be the end of it today s appearance was ms lewinsky s first public testimony before then , ms lewinsky had testified only before the closed grand jury of the independent counsel , kenneth w starr and in a videotape presented at mr clinton s trial in the senate , where he was acquitted on feb 12 but ms lewinsky s appearance was drained of real suspense because the issue before the court is a narrow one judge leasure is deciding whether the state s case against mrs tripp is built on information gathered independently of mr starr s investigation of the lewinskyclinton relationship under judge leasure s ruling , the prosecution must show that none of its witnesses told the grand jury information they only learned from their association with the starr investigation federal prosecutors gave mrs tripp use immunity , which means that nothing she told them could be used to prosecute her ms lewinsky was questioned closely by mrs tripp s lawyer , joseph murtha , who tried to show that some of the information she gave to the state authorities she had received from federal prosecutors after she began cooperating with them but ms lewinsky insisted that her knowledge of the dec 22 telephone conversation did not depend on her many debriefing sessions with the prosecutors during her crossexamination by mr murtha , ms lewinsky displayed a sophistication about grand jury and lawenforcement matters at one point , when mr murtha handed her a document , she looked at it and asked , is this a 302 \? a 302 is lawenforcement jargon for the written forms used by agents of the federal bureau of investigation to record witness interviews yes , it s a 302 , replied a somewhat surprised mr murtha in her testimony , ms lewinsky cited several factors that made her certain of the date of the conversation with mrs tripp that was published in newsweek besides the fact that she and mrs tripp had just been subpoenaed in the jones case , ms lewinsky said she had also talked to mrs tripp about her appointment that day with vernon e jordan , a washington lawyer and clinton confidant after she was excused from the witness stand , ms lewinsky hoisted one of her signature tote bags onto the shoulder of a long black coat she wore over black pants judge leasure is expected to rule next week on whether the state s case is untainted by the federal investigation if she rules against the state , mrs tripp will probably go free if the judge rules otherwise , the trial is scheduled to begin on jan 18 ms lewinsky could then be called again to testify photo monica s lewinsky left howard county circuit court in ellicott city , md , yesterday after testifying against her former friend , linda r tripp \( associated press \)
taking lives by michael pye 295 pages alfred a knopf 23 in the 1975 antonioni film the passenger , a disaffected journalist exchanges identities with a man he finds dead in a hotel room , and soon finds himself pursued by the man s wife , friends and enemies a similar premise underlies michael pye s engaging new novel , taking lives , a philosophical thriller about a serial killer who takes on his victims' identities as in mr pye s accomplished 1996 novel , the drowning room , we are introduced to a curiously amoral and opportunistic protagonist whose identity is constructed around a secret and as in that earlier novel , we are plunged into a sinister world whose glittering surface , detailed by mr pye in spare but painterly detail , belies its shadowy mechanics the killing spree at the heart of this novel starts randomly enough young martin arkenhout , a dutch foreign exchange student , is bumming around florida with an american teenager named seth goodman when their rented car breaks down seth tries to flag down help , but he is struck by a passing car and left in a bloody pulp by the side of the road martin checks to see if seth is still breathing and then unaccountably takes a rock and strikes him in the head to finish him off he switches watches with seth , appropriates his credit cards and papers and takes off the police will mistakenly identify the dead body as that of martin arkenhout martin , meanwhile , has settled down to college life as seth goodman in new york city , where he becomes an habitue of the downtown art scene there he meets an awkward rich man named john gaul who tells him that he has just inherited a big , pink house in the bahamas seth \( that is , martin \) files this information away , and when seth s parents insist on seeing him , he decides it s time to move on he will dispose of john gaul and appropriate his life gaul , he figures , is a misfit , an outsider , a man without roots or family or friends he will not be missed arkenhout thinks he can kill , probably , mr pye writes the boundaries weakened when he took a rock to seth goodman s head besides , it will be seth goodman s crime , and he will not be seth goodman anymore seth martin coolly murders gaul , moves into his house in the bahamas and lives off his copious credit in time , as he grows restless , eager to reinvent himself , he will murder others always men he can reasonably impersonate , always men with a lack of mooring to the ordinary , crushing rhythms of practical life martin had always been the winner , mr pye writes , the man who knew how to reinvent himself perpetually , faust with no need for some cramping contract with any passing devil he did what other men just dream of doing , which is to change all the incidentals and take with him , life after life , only what s essential and then he makes a mistake on the run from the police \( who are curious about an expired visa \) , martin is forced to pick a new mark quickly he selects a professor named christopher hart , an art historian who is about to head off to portugal on sabbatical this hart , however , has his own secret past he has stolen 15 illuminated plates from a rare 17thcentury book belonging to a london museum , and the museum has appointed one of its curators , john michael snell costa , to track them down the two men are soon engaged in a dangerous game of cat and mouse , a game in which none of the usual rules of fair play apply it is costa who narrates the remainder of taking lives , piecing together the story of martin arkenhout from his own encounters with the man , from police reports and from the testimony of others who have crossed his path costa , it quickly becomes clear , has his own identity problems and his own reasons for wanting to run away from his life developments that not only help mr pye advance his story line , but also help him to underscore the dialectic in this novel between roots and rootlessness , home and abroad , stasis and flux we learn that costa s father , a portuguese national who raised his family in england , has abruptly returned home to portugal and that the stories he has told his family about his past may not be true we also learn that costa has been feeling estranged from his wife , anna , and their tidy little life in london , and that he wants to visit his father in portugal and reaffirm his portuguese roots certainly there are far too many coincidences between costa s story and arkenhout s story for the reader to continue to suspend disbelief not only do both men end up within miles of each other in the portuguese countryside , but both also turn out to be involved with the same woman both men also spark the interest of a local police captain who seems to have had a mysterious relationship with costa s father and who has reason to suspect that there is something fishy about the socalled christopher hart what enables the reader to overlook these jerryrigged developments and even the novel s contrived ending is mr pye s ability to combine psychological insight with hitchcockian suspense and vivid novelistic descriptions mr pye conjures up nassau for the reader as a collection of houses in the colors of coconut ice and sherbets , and a seedy vietnamese restaurant in soho as an edward hopper cafe except for the paper lanterns , and the green lights in the fish tanks in the window the sky glimpsed from an airplane strikes costa as a baroque , sentimental sky that ought to have fat , pink cherubs lollipopping about , while tourists in a portuguese village

los angeles , nov 26 last may , the nets offered phil jackson a multiyear contract worth more than 7 million a season , but for 1 million less he got shaquille o'neal , kobe bryant , glen rice and a legitimate chance to win a seventh national basketball association championship not that the nets are an adequate litmus test , but the lakers looked like contenders in flicking away the nets by 10380 tonight at the staples center with o'neal having his way against each of the three centers the nets ran at him , los angeles improved to 104 the nets , who end this fourgame western conference road trip saturday at phoenix , dropped to 211 o'neal led everyone with 30 points , 16 rebounds , 7 assists and 4 blocked shots considering what he had done recently , that line was tame he had entered averaging 376 points and 16 rebounds over his last five contests the 35yearold ron harper , pulling out a handful of fancy finger rolls from his past , followed with 17 points , while rick fox and derek fisher each scored 12 johnny newman , scoring at least 20 for the second straight game , led the nets with 24 points he was the lone bright spot , though , as the nets stars stephon marbury and keith van horn struggled mightily van horn scored 20 , but missed 9 of 14 fieldgoal attempts marbury played perhaps his worst game this season , recording 10 points and 5 assists on 3of16 shooting from the field after building a 9point halftime lead , the lakers , playing without bryant \( broken right hand \) , broke the game open in the third period behind 10 points by harper and 8 by o'neal they combined for 8 points as the lakers opened the half with a 102 run to increase their lead to 17 points though the nets once pulled within 9 , the result was never again in question before the game , jackson spoke candidly about why he turned down the nets' generous offer , saying basically that they were far too thin around the basket one of the reasons that i did n't take the job was because i thought there were some holes in their team that were going to be very difficult to make up , jackson said i think that it s a team that s lacking the power players that are so important in this game this team does n't have big bodies michael cage is playing for them , and they just solicited him , did n't they \? they just got a 37yearold guy in this game , you 've got to have your power players that clog that lane up and do n't let people penetrate with impunity you 've got to make them pay with the 6foot9inch cage starting at center against the 71 , 300plus pound o'neal , the nets were not in position to bully anyone the 68 jamie feick and the 71 jim mcilvaine , who played with a scratched cornea in his severely swollen right eye , spelled cage , but none of them had the power to slow down o'neal early on , it looked as if o'neal might rip the nets for 50 points again the last time he scored that many was on april 2 , 1998 , at the meadowlands when he scored 6 of the lakers' first 8 points his third basket came on a ferocious alleyoop slam over cage the basket tied the game at 88 and began a 142 run that put los angeles in control with three minutes left in the quarter rice and harper closed the spurt with consecutive 3pointers , giving the lakers a 2010 lead but just when los angeles seemed poised to pull away , the nets rallied behind newman after cutting the deficit to 2720 heading into the second quarter , the nets scored 9 of the next 13 points to move within 2 points newman led the charge with a layup , two free throws and a 3pointer that made it 3129 with just under eight minutes left in the half from there , the lakers slowly began rebuilding the lead o'neal , who had been relatively quiet after scoring 11 firstperiod points , made the lakers' final two baskets one on a turnaround jumper from 10 feet , the other on a nifty spin move and reverse layup to make it 4738 at intermission rebounds already the owner of the national basketball association record for consecutive games played , laker forward a c green broke ron boone s record for consecutive professional basketball games played by competing in his 1 , 042nd straight game friday night nets point guard sherman douglas sat out for the second straight game with a sprained right ankle nets guard lucious harris , a sevenyear veteran and native of los angeles , started an nba game in front of his family for the first time friday night he reserved tickets for 30 friends and relatives they do n't even know i'm starting , said harris , who made his fourth start of the season if we were 100 , i 'd have called them and told them i was starting , but since we 're 210 , i just told them we need some wins the nets shot 28 of 81 from the field , for 346 percent photo phil jackson has watched his lakers get off to a 104 start \( steve w grayson allsport \)
carlsbad , calif as soon as his birdie putt plopped into the cup on the 15th hole , jeff maggert was suddenly 2 up without a glance at tiger woods , the 35yearold touring pro with only one victory in his nine years on the pga tour turned and strode toward the 16th tee c'mon , tiger , a voice in the gallery yelled , do n't make us watch basketball on sunday but when woods soon lost , 2 and 1 , on the 17th green , the andersen consulting match play championship was assured of diminished ratings for tomorrow s 36hole final on the abc network , as well as diminished credibility for the first of three world golf championship tournaments this year theatrically , the dream final would have had woods , who is no 1 in the world ranking , against david duval , who is no 2 or least woods or duval against any of the other marquee names mark o'meara , davis love 3d or ernie els but with woods and all of the world s other top 10 players already home for the weekend , this tournament has dissolved into just another pga tour stop that is almost instantly forgettable the andersen consulting promoters had hoped this match play event would at least approach major status but it wo n't now not even with 1 million to the winner out of the 5 million bonanza mere money is never enough to , and you 'll pardon the expression , match the history of the four major tournaments the masters , the united states open , the british open and the professional golfers' association championship but if woods or duval or o'meara or love or els had won here , this event would have earned a measure of respect as an important tournament because a top golfer won it instead , the world golf championship promoters have only themselves , alias the vagaries of match play , to blame for the upsets that have created a 36hole yawn between the survivors of today s semifinals involving four longtime but dulltime american touring pros jeff maggert versus steve pate and andrew magee versus john huston considering their respective world ranking , the semifinals involve no 24 \( maggert \) versus no 61 \( pate \) and no 50 \( magee \) versus no 27 \( huston \) none of the four has ever won a major that s not what the world golf championship had in mind when it created this match play event and when maggert went 1 up on woods with a birdie on the 541yard 12th hole , that s not what the displayer of a huge homemade banner on a nearby house had in mind tiger s championship , the blueandwhite banner read blue indeed for tiger woods bluer than the sky on this soft , sunny southern california afternoon woods , the 23yearold native of nearby cypress , calif , could not do what he was famous for doing in match play as the threetime united states amateur champion coming from behind to win in his three 36hole united states amateur finals , with trip kuehne , buddy mariucci and steve scott , woods trailed , once by as much as six down to kuehne , but he rallied each time but this was not a 36hole united states amateur final this was an 18hole match against maggert , a hardened pro with a 43 record in ryder cup matches when you get the top 64 players in the world and you give them just one round of golf , anything can happen , woods said i think if you would make 36hole matches , then i think you 're going to see the better player come out on top then again , playing 36hole matches would wear you out a little bit because of his awesome length off the tee , woods usually has an advantage on the par5 holes , but on the four par5 holes at the la costa resort and spa in their quarterfinal , maggert was 1 up and after going 2 up on the third hole , woods did not win another hole he had no bogeys but only three birdies i did n't think jeff would give me an opening unless i applied enough pressure , woods said if i was to make two or three birdies in a row and really put a lot of heat on him , then i could see him possibly hitting one errant shot but i was n't able to do that i did n't hit enough good shots close to the hole and no matter who the winner is now , this andersen consulting match play championship will not hit enough good shots close to the stature of a major photo tiger woods \( associated press \)
the number of homicides reported in new york city has risen slightly this year compared with the same period last year , the police said yesterday , adding that there was no way to know whether the increase represented a temporary jump or a leveling off in the city s historic drop in crime of the last six years there were 115 homicides reported in the city this year through march 7 , an increase of 55 percent over the same period last year , when 109 homicides were reported , according to preliminary police department statistics reported crime continued to drop in all other major categories , though , and overall reported crime was down 14 percent , the police said police commissioner howard safir said at a news conference that it was too early to say what the figures presage homicides , like all crimes , have peaks and valleys , he said he noted that even if the city ended the year with 700 homicides there were 629 reported last year it would still represent the secondlowest total since 1967 a preliminary analysis of the year s homicides indicated that the biggest jump was in those stemming from domestic violence or family disputes , commissioner safir said marilyn mode , a police spokeswoman , said that of the slayings with known motives , 21 stemmed from domestic violence or family disputes , up from 11 last year domestic violence slayings are among the most difficult to curb with policing tactics though the police have found that increasing patrols in highcrime areas and starting antidrug initiatives can bring down the number of killings related to robberies and drug deals , they have a much harder time keeping a husband from killing his wife at home but commissioner safir said he hoped to address the problem by expanding a program aimed at reducing domestic violence in two bronx neighborhoods in the 41st precinct in hunts point and the 43d precinct in soundview , eight police officers are investigating and trying to prevent domestic violence they work with social service agencies and make repeated visits to households known for violence mr safir said that the number of incidents of domestic violence had dropped in both precincts , and that he would like to see the program expanded not all areas of the city saw the number of homicides go up the largest increases were in southern queens , which had 8 reported killings compared with 4 last year , and northern manhattan , which jumped to 16 from 9 but there were fewer reported killings this year in the bronx , which had 26 , and northern brooklyn , which had 19 northern queens remained steady with 11 , as did staten island , which had none there were 8 killings reported in manhattan south of 59th street , and 27 in southern brooklyn the increase was most striking in the last four weeks , when 52 killings were reported , compared with 45 over the same period last year in the past , mr safir has credited aggressive police tactics with driving down crime he noted yesterday that some people had suggested that after the feb 4 shooting of amadou diallo and the increased scrutiny it has brought on the police department , some officers might fear taking aggressive action although it is unclear whether the police are holding back , in the four weeks after the diallo shooting , officers made 186 arrests for firearms possession , down 17 percent from the same period last year people have expressed concerns with me about police officers not wanting to take chances because of the possibility they will be viewed in the wrong light , or as overly aggressive , mr safir said all of that is just speculation
a judge who once represented a police officer in a lawsuit over a controversial onduty shooting was picked yesterday to preside over the trial of the four officers accused of murdering amadou diallo last february before his election to the bench in 1993 , justice joseph c teresi of state supreme court in albany was also a longtime public defender , something court officials eagerly highlighted , apparently to assuage any concerns that albany judges are generally propolice in his six years on the bench in albany county , justice teresi , a registered democrat , has gained a reputation for a tough courtroom demeanor his work will be cut out for him on the diallo case the decision by an appellate court to move the trial from the bronx to albany has ignited criticism that the courts in the overwhelmingly white county , which includes the city of albany and many of its suburbs , will be overly sympathetic to the four white officers justice teresi was picked by chief administrative judge jonathan lippman the selection was a surprise only in that justice teresi , as a supreme court justice , primarily presides over civil cases , although he also handles some criminal cases assigned by the county court david bookstaver , a spokesman for the office of court administration , said the selection was based on availability it was important that the case not cause backlogs in the criminal caseload as well as scholarship , expertise and demeanor mr bookstaver said that justice teresi would not comment about his appointment to hear the diallo case the judge has never shied from making decisions that are unpopular with the political powersthatbe in 1995 , for example , he accused the pataki administration of trying to reward the chemical industry by repealing a restriction on the use of deet , the main ingredient of many insect repellents , which some scientists consider a health risk and in 1998 , in a sharply worded ruling , he struck down a third effort by the governor and the state legislature to preserve a special public school district for the hasidic enclave of kiryas joel , calling it an act of legislative favoritism that endorsed a single religious group his decision was upheld on appeal those lawyers who would speak on the record described justice teresi as tough and serious of all the judges in this district , he is the most nononsense judge , said kevin luibrand , a lawyer in albany who primarily represents plaintiffs in civil cases he suffers no fools he despises unpreparedness by lawyers he will issue fines on the spot if they 're late to court mr luibrand summed up he is very well liked by lawyers who are prepared the unprepared live in fear of him but several other lawyers who spoke only on the condition of anonymity described incidents that they said illustrated justice teresi s tendency to be impatient and intolerant of perceived threats to his authority several lawyers , for example , told of a lawyer who recently failed to have a witness ready at 4 30 pm or 4 45 pm on a friday afternoon , thinking that court would adjourn at 5 pm and his remaining witnesses would appear on monday instead , an angry justice teresi declared the testimony over , lawyers familiar with the incident said still , most lawyers described justice teresi as bright and knowledgeable on criminal as well as civil law i think he s very sharp on the law and evidence he does n't give a lot of leeway , said brendan baynes , a civil lawyer in albany , said and one lawyer who has known him for years said , what s good about justice teresi is that he s the same to everybody he s certainly not going to favor one side over another but other lawyers said that justice teresi s selection could only help the four officers , and they referred to rulings that they said tended to reflect a proprosecution bias last year , justice teresi sided with the state when he ruled that to ease overcrowding , it was legal for prison officials to put two inmates in a cell designed for one he also rejected a claim by the union representing state prison guards that doublecelling would increase the risk of spreading disease or make inmates more likely to become violent and mark mishler , a civilrights attorney in albany , said the judge was fairly typical in another respect in general we do not have judges in albany county who are known for their sensitivity to or understanding of concerns relating to race within the criminal justice system , mr mishler said this is because albany county is a tightly controlled , somewhat monolithic political system in which for decades judges have been selected based primarily on their proven loyalty to the established political structure , he added justice teresi , who is 53 , was born in albany he attended boston college , then returned home to attend albany law school for 20 years , he was an associate with and then partner at an albany firm , ainsworth , sullivan , tracy , knauf , warner ruslander , that does extensive work for insurance companies his practice emphasized defending productliability , malpractice and civil rights claims and defendants in industrial accidents he was also involved in one of the city s most highprofile cases in 1984 , jessie davis , a 35yearold black man with a history of mental illness , was killed by several albany police officers who said he lunged at them in an incident that still resonates in the city , particularly its minority neighborhoods none of the officers faced criminal charges justice teresi represented charles peters , one of the officers who was at the scene , in a civil suit filed by mr davis s sister mr peters did not shoot mr davis on the eve of the trial , in 1994 , the city settled the case for 500 , 000 , which is believed to be the largest amount in a police case in albany history , and an apology by that time , justice teresi was already on the bench , and it is not clear when he stopped representing the officer but justice teresi also worked for two decades as a public defender in albany county , public defenders are also able to maintain their private practice work partly because of his work as a public defender , mr luibrand said , justice teresi has a connectedness with poor people in the broad sense not singling out minority but poor justice teresi starts court sessions at 8 am , and goes until 5 pm one lawyer said that downstaters would be struck by how quickly albany s justice system and particularly justice teresi s courtroom moves whatever you think , the lawyer said , referring to the length of the trial , it s going to be shorter photo justice joseph c teresi of state supreme court
mayor rudolph w giuliani has decided that he and the city s other top officials deserve a raise earlier this month , a panel of three private citizens recommended raises ranging from about 10 percent to 28 percent for the mayor , the public advocate , the comptroller , the five borough presidents , the five district attorneys and all 51 members of the city council mr giuliani endorsed the panel s recommendations last week in a letter to the city council speaker , peter f vallone , that was made public yesterday in the letter , the mayor called the raises fair and reasonable the panel recommended increasing the mayor s annual salary by just more than 18 percent , to 195 , 000 from 165 , 000 the largest percentage raise would go to the council members , whose jobs are considered part time their base pay would climb nearly 28 percent , to 90 , 000 from 70 , 500 the panel recommended the following raises for the other officials about 20 percent for the comptroller , to 160 , 000 from 133 , 000 20 percent for the public advocate , to 150 , 000 from 125 , 000 more than 18 percent for the borough presidents , to 135 , 000 from 114 , 000 , and just under 10 percent for the district attorneys , to 150 , 000 from 136 , 700 the city council is widely expected to approve the recommendations of the panel , which is called the quadrennial advisory commission for the review of compensation levels of elected officials the last time the officials got raises was in 1995 , although mark green , the public advocate , refused his , saying he could not accept it at a time when services for the poor were being cut at a hearing yesterday before the council s committee on governmental operations , the panel chairman , richard l gelb , acknowledged that raises for elected officials often did not go over well with voters , but he said the politicians running new york city were underpaid the magnitude of the duties , responsibilities and accountability associated with positions responsible for governing the largest city in the united states must be recognized , he said mr gelb , a chairman emeritus of the bristolmyers squibb company , said the city s elected officials were underpaid when compared to the compensation paid by other cities , or the compensation paid by some agencies , authorities and labor unions within new york city and new york state mr gelb testified that the pay increases were of particular importance for the city council to attract qualified legislators he noted that nearly threequarters of the council members will not be allowed to run for reelection in 2001 because of term limits along with mr gelb , the members of the commission are stanley brezenoff , the president of maimonides medical center in brooklyn , and robert kaufman , a partner in the manhattan law firm of proskauer , rose the recommended raises do not take into account or have any effect on the annual stipends that council members receive for heading various committees or serving in leadership positions the stipends range from 3 , 000 for the minority whip to 39 , 500 for mr vallone mr vallone , through a spokesman , also said he approved of the increases it seems to be fair and reasonable adjustments given the fact that none have happened for four years , said the spokesman , michael clendenin
this is a tale of two earnings reports from micron technology inc , one of the world s largest makers of semiconductor chips micron also happens to be a very hot stock the reports detail the results for the company s first quarter , which ended dec 3 one is a news release issued dec 23 the other is the quarterly report , or 10q , filed with the securities and exchange commission on jan 5 the two reports differ in intriguing ways the most glaring discrepancy is in micron s sales of semiconductor memory products the news release says these totaled 4281 million in the quarter the 10q says they totaled 4095 million which number is correct \? a micron spokeswoman , julie nash , said there was a 19 million reclassification of numbers that went from semiconductor memory products sales into 'other' these were sales that were relative to providing semiconductor revenues , but they were actually service fees she said micron , of boise , idaho , found the error and fixed it in the 10q but it did not publish a corrected news release it was not material , she said so it s immaterial that 43 percent of the company s semiconductor sales were n't semiconductor sales at all none of this would matter if investors relied on 10q s rather than news releases for investment information but that is not the case dan niles , an analyst at bancboston robertson stephens , has a strong buy rating on the stock the revenue number he has used in recommending the stock is the 4281 million from the news release mr niles did not know the number was incorrect until a reporter told him on friday he said the new , lower number would not change his positive view of the company there is another interesting difference in micron s two reports the 10q states that net sales of semiconductor memory products increased 10 percent over the previous quarter , a result of an 18 percent increase in the chips' average selling price being partly offset by a 10 percent decline in megabits shipped the news release , however , is mum about the decline in shipments it is a big deal to show a decline in megabits shipped with chip makers constantly improving the memory capacity of their products also known as the yield a drop in megabits shipped is not good news why did the news release not mention this \? ms nash again the press release is a summary document used to discuss what we believe is of interest to shareholders and reflect company trends whether this passes the smell test is something arthur levitt , chairman of the sec , may want to ponder mr levitt is justifiably concerned that companies make accurate disclosures to investors who uncovered the micron discrepancies \? sleuths on the internet specifically , three people who post comments on the ask michael burke and micron only threads on silicon investor and larry woods , editor of the tech review newsletter in stoney creek , ontario two footnotes since micron s news release came out , its shares have risen 49 percent not bad for a company that lost 462 million in the quarter and on wednesday , the company filed a registration of 275 million shares to be sold to the public graph shows the daily close for micron technology , since dec 1998

it is possible that many investors have ignored this warning because her market forecasts have always been understated while she has been correct about the market and has not buckled during sharp downturns during 1997 and 1998 her forecasts for the gains in the s p 500 and the dow have been short of actual performance ms cohen says she does that on purpose i am trying to come up with a forecast that is not on the extreme end of the bell curve , she said i want a forecast that we are comfortable with achieving because of the understated nature of her forecasts , the themes she lays out each year assume added importance and , until now , they have remained pretty constant she often reminds investors , for example , that market advances follow a staircase pattern spurts followed by trading ranges that theme should be even more relevant in a market with slower growth her supertanker america theme , which argues that global crises will not derail the united states economy , still holds true the same goes for the silly putty theme , which has claimed for years that the profit and economic expansion will stretch much longer than anyone expects the need for nimble stockpicking , another theme , is even more important in a market where 67 percent of the stocks on the new york stock exchange are 20 percent or more below their 52week highs now comes the first change in one of her major themes since she became a bull in early 1991 ms cohen argued for years that the stock market could live with higher pricetoearnings ratios when inflation was low lower inflation , she has said , increases investor confidence in the growth of profits and makes them willing to pay more for a given level of earnings but now , she noted , inflation is beginning to rise modestly that means inflation is no longer going down and it is no longer something that gives us a significant margin for improvement in valuations , she said that , she explained , is a reason for believing that the market will stay fairly valued none of this means that ms cohen is pessimistic the market , she says , will hit new highs in 2000 , with operating earnings for the s p 500 rising 8 percent and the earnings will be more solid than the percentage increase implies because the second half of 2000 will have to be compared with a very strong second half of 1999 as for ms cohen s market forecast , which she says provides direction , not precision , she puts the s p 500 at 1 , 525 and the dow at 12 , 300 at the end of next year those are jumps of 46 percent and 78 percent , respectively , from the levels on thursday ms cohen is favoring financial stocks , including banks and insurance companies , in part because they fell so sharply this year that she thinks they are good values you are buying a financial services growth stock at a 40 percent discount to the market , she said and technology stocks are still on her list , although she thinks the valuations are not as appealing as they were the biggest threat ms cohen sees is the politics of a presidential election year , a factor that many strategists have not even mentioned in their musings about 2000 directional changes could be problematic , she wrote in her outlook analysis for example , federal budget policy has been moving toward restraint since 1992 proposals for excessive tax cuts or spending programs could be worrisome she dismisses the risk of a surge in inflation and says year 2000 computer problems will be few she does not think that economic recovery and stockmarket rallies abroad will siphon off investors from the united states market indeed , ms cohen said global growth would help the profits of american multinationals and she says the stock market will weather the rate increases that she and most other analysts expect the federal reserve to make early next year if the economic growth refuses to slow from the torrid 5 percent annual pace of the last six months this is something that will not come as a surprise , she said it is already a builtin presumption so the shock for investors , if ms cohen is right about market valuations , is that normal returns next year will look puny compared with the last five , robust years photo abby joseph cohen , the goldman sachs market strategist who has long been one of wall street s leading bulls , is looking toward more modest market gains next year \( andrea mohin the new york times \) chart leading the band abby joseph cohen , chief market strategist at goldman sachs , tends to be conservative when forecasting earnings growth for the companies in the standard poor s 500stock index s p 500 operating earnings growth 1997 forecast 10 actual 99 1998 forecast 8 actual 21 1999 forecast 5 to 7 actual 115 2000 forecast 8 actual na based on first three quarters and goldman sachs estimate for the fourth quarter \( source goldman sachs company \)
for years , collectors and dealers of highquality art photographs have been surprised by a proliferation of firstrate prints by lewis w hine , the important documentary photographer best known for his early to midcentury images of labor , poverty , immigration and the construction of the empire state building but the surprise has turned to concern with the recent discovery that hundreds of the photographs , while made with genuine hine negatives , are apparently unauthorized posthumous prints that often bear signatures purporting to be hine s with stakes that could run into the millions of dollars , the principal hine dealers across the country have opened an investigation into the genesis of the prints and they have alerted clients to the possibility that some of the work will be called back many of the doubted photographs were sold by walter rosenblum , 81 , himself a highly respected photographer who in his youth was hine s friend and colleague and is the leading authority on his work with his wife , naomi rosenblum , an esteemed historian of photography who is also a hine authority , mr rosenblum was honored last year with a lifetime achievement award by the international center of photography in new york reached at home in queens , mr rosenblum would not comment , referring questions to his lawyer , mark sugarman we 're aware that various people have raised questions as to the vintage and authenticity of some hine photographs out in the market , mr sugarman said we are investigating these allegations and will continue to do so over the years , mr sugarman said , mr rosenblum amassed a large collection of hine s works they were obtained , the lawyer said , directly from hine , from the photographer s son , corydon hine , or from art market sources he added mr rosenblum consigned various prints to various galleries over a period of time if there is a problem with some of the prints , he had no knowledge of it at the time he sold them it is possible that the prints not regarded as authentic came from him , but they could also have come from a number of other sources if there is a problem with the ones he sold , we will try to remedy it as best we can the group of approximately half a dozen dealers who are looking into the matter is led by the new york gallery owners robert mann , edwynn houk and howard greenberg peter r stern of the law firm of berger stern webb , speaking for the group , said we are obviously extremely concerned with the authenticity of these prints we are in the process of factual investigation in a dialogue with the rosenblums , and are hopeful that this matter can be explained and resolved no legal action has been taken none of the dealers involved would be interviewed on the record nor would they disclose the names of clients who had bought hine works the questioned photographs may place a heavy financial burden on the dealers , since , by trade practice , galleries guarantee the authenticity of works they sell and are obliged to make restitution to clients in cases of faulty authentication , no matter how long ago the works were sold museum curators and dealers say that for about 15 years they have been aware of wellfinished , showquality hine enlargements oddly , it was the high level of the printwork that first drew attention hine , a socially committed artist who lived from 1874 to 1940 , was concerned more with the substance of his images than with their finish and was not particularly known for his skills as a printer still , persuasive evidence that the prints could not have been made by hine emerged only recently through the efforts of a collector , michael mattis , a physicist in los alamos , nm mr mattis , who would not comment for this article , worked with paul messier of boston , a paper conservator who for some time has been doing materials analysis of 20thcentury photographic prints mr messier would not comment on his work , saying it was a matter of confidentiality between him and his client but dealers and collectors said he found that the paper used for the prints was made after 1950 , when photographic manufacturers changed their formulas word of the findings quickly traveled through the circle of dealers and collectors involved with hine s work , arousing concern in the market as a whole an article by anne horton mentioning the matter appears in the current art auction magazine certainly with hine photographs we will be particularly vigilant , said denise bethel , director of the photograph department at sotheby s , which has sold many hine prints in the past at a sotheby s sale last april , one was sold with a letter of authentication from mr rosenblum , requested by the consignor along with the age of the print paper , the signatures on many of the works have been questioned although hine , working at a time when his photographs had no collectors' market , signed few prints and most of those in block letters on the front nearly all of the prints in question are signed prices for hine prints vary , from a few hundred dollars for his earliest works , 4by5inch contacts made for the national child labor committee in the early 1900 s , to 60 , 000 or more for later works , many of these 8by10inch or 11by14inch enlargements of images only the enlargements are suspect , according to dealers who declined to be named the number of existing prints is only one of many factors that may affect the price of vintage photographs the record price for a hine photograph was set at christie s in april 1994 , when a photograph titled mechanic and steam pump from the 1920 s was sold for 90 , 500 in october 1998 , a single enlargement from his 193031 series of the empire state building under construction went for 74 , 000 at christie s a believer in photography as a tool for social reform , hine covered immigrants on ellis island , new york sweatshops and childlabor abuses after world war i , he turned to documenting the positive side of labor , in a series called men at work that culminated in the extraordinary empire state building photographs in his last years hine , then living on welfare , was befriended by mr rosenblum , who also saw photography as an aid to social reform after hine s death , his son gave his prints and negatives to the photo league , an organization of socially committed photographers in 1955 , mr rosenblum , the group s last president , turned over 3 , 800 hine negatives and 6 , 000 prints to the george eastman house in rochester dealers joining in the investigation stress that they are looking for a peaceful rather than a litigious solution the important thing is that if there are fakes , let s get them off the market , one dealer said photo lewis w hine prints have sold for tens of thousands of dollars \( sol libsohn \)
the driver heading across the union street bridge over the gowanus canal in brooklyn slowed down yesterday when he saw the crowd peering over the railing into the green water what is it , a body \? he called out sort of in fact , it was dozens of bodies , but none of them belonged to a discarded mobster pink jellyfish bobbed lazily downstream , tentacles gently flexing to take in food schools of fish not tiny killifish but fish the size of a decent cigar flitted close to the bank a largish flatfish that looked suspiciously like a flounder sat on the bottom , where flounders sit and everywhere in the canal , where the water is now clear enough to see two or three feet down , blue crabs went about their business , scuttling over hubcaps , sidestroking through the water and clinging to pilings two months after the city turned on a propeller to push relatively clean harbor water through one of the nation s most famously putrescent waterways , the gowanus canal is alive again while health officials strongly cautioned against eating the marine life , the canal s sudden rebound has surprised environmentalists john c muir , the executive director of the brooklyn center for the urban environment , came down to the canal yesterday after getting a tip about the crabs he walked away shaking his head i do n't indulge in hyperbole a hell of a lot , mr muir said , but this is astounding a complete and complex ecosystem has established itself when two months ago there was none while the canal may be filled with new life , there is something definitely missing these days the overwhelming stench on hot days in summers past , inhaling within a few blocks of the canal was like sticking your head into a rubber boot filled with used motor oil and rotten eggs bernard harrigan , a printer , tropical fish fanatic and member of a merchant s group on nearby court street that has been pushing to clean up the canal , could not believe his nose a year ago , you could n't stand here in this heat , the smell was so bad , mr harrigan said as he gazed down at the urban version of a jacques cousteau special now it smells like the beach , like it should the canal is not exactly pristine yet yesterday , the view of the wildlife was often obscured by the usual flotilla of potato chip bags , plastic coffee cups and traveling oil slicks nor has the smell vanished completely a faint odor of petroleum hung over the water yesterday but the canal runs through a heavily industrial neighborhood the bayside fuel oil company sits beside the bridge and industrial neighborhoods smell that way the canal s recovery shifted into high gear in early may , when the city replaced a broken propeller that once drove harbor water from the buttermilk channel off red hook through a tunnel that led to the gowanus suddenly a body of water that was virtually barren of life since the 1960 s had oxygen levels as high as four parts per million , almost as high as new york harbor itself , said joel a miele sr , the city s commissioner of environmental protection more oxygen in the water means more plankton , one of the main building blocks in the aquatic food chain with amenities like that and a prime location at the mouth of gowanus bay , the crabs and jellyfish , like the real estate speculators who have been prowling the neighborhood in recent months , were bound to start poking around previously , mr muir said , the animals in the bay which lies at the south end of the twomile canal encountered a wall of deoxygenated water at the mouth of the canal and would pass right by it now they are patrolling their margins and finding this is a good area to probe the crabs , which mr miele said abandoned the canal 40 years ago , started showing up last week , said leonard thomas , a city department of transportation employee who raises the union street bridge over the canal so barges can pass susan hinz , a biologist with the brooklyn center for the urban environment who took samples yesterday , found that even the black , syrupy sediment at the bottom of the canal was teeming the sediment smells like oil , but it s filled with life , she said there were diatoms in there , and two species of microscopic worms , and a dinoflagellate , which is halfway between a plant and an animal it s really wonderful the canal s recovery may also be partly attributable to the continuing lack of rain , mr muir said heavy rainstorms send diluted sewage streaming into the canal through overflow pipes , and , he noted , the canal has not received a fresh layer of sewage in months but mark phillips , a web site designer and canal buff who runs the site www gowanuscanal com , was too busy yesterday envisioning bringing his baby daughter down to the canal to question the reasons behind its rebirth i want to be able to teach her to fish down here , mr phillips said maybe by the time she s 4 or 5 we 'll be able to come down and catch stripers mr thomas , the bridgekeeper , who is also a master chicken chef and author of the cookbook cooking with the chicken man \( warner books , 1998 \) , was having food fantasies someday i'm going to make some crab and chicken gumbo , he said gowanus gumbo , suggested nicholas evanscato , an artist who had set up his easel by the bridge that s a good one , gowanus gumbo , mr thomas said i 'll use that in my next book but a cleaner canal brings a new set of worries abu moulta ali , an environmental scientist who runs boat tours up the canal , said he was concerned that homeless people who camp near the third street bridge might be tempted to eat the crabs that would be a bad idea , he said , because the crabs could carry sewageborne hepatitis and intestinal parasites , in addition to the numerous inorganic toxins that still lurk in the canal once the water becomes clean enough , marine borers , the tiny insects that are eating their way through much of the city s waterfront , might start gnawing through the pilings and bulkheads along the waterfront , too mr phillips said that seemed like a small price to pay dealing with a worm that s eating wood is not a big problem to me if we have a waterway that we can use he said as for the nowendangered gowanus stink , mr thomas said he was slowly adjusting to its absence it s like the people who live where the el was , he said the first few days when there s no train going by , you ca n't sleep but you get used to it photos susan hinz , a brooklyn biologist , taking water samples yesterday even the sediment at the bottom of the

asuncion , paraguay when martin almada asked a judge for records of his arrest under the dictatorship of gen alfredo stroessner , he hoped merely to learn more about his own private tragedy nearly four years of captivity , during which the police telephoned his wife so she would hear his screams under torture instead , the onetime schoolteacher unearthed a mountain of records detailing repression among united statesbacked military regimes throughout south america during the cold war from floor to ceiling , five tons of reports and photos detailed the arrest , interrogation and disappearance of thousands of political prisoners during general stroessner s 35year dictatorship the documents trace the creation and work of operation condor , a secret plan among security forces in six countries to crush leftwing political dissent paraguayans quickly named the files the archives of terror though discovered six years ago , the files have gained new prominence throughout latin america with the arrest of chile s former dictator , gen augusto pinochet , in london last october to this day , they remain the only extensive collection of public records of a project by the region s military rulers that succeeded in exterminating thousands of political opponents the files have given a kind of vindication to survivors , their families and the families of those dead and missing by delivering concrete proof of a darkly secretive era the archives have also provided fodder for the developing case against general pinochet , the only one of the region s dictators to face the prospect of trial general stroessner remains a fugitive from justice living in brazil baltasar garzon , the spanish magistrate seeking the extradition of general pinochet from england , has collected more than 1 , 500 pages of evidence from the archives last december , he requested records on hugo banzer , the current president of brazil , who ran the military regime there from 1971 to 1978 , and on general stroessner this documentation might exist in other countries as well , but it s hidden , while in paraguay they did n't manage to hide it all , juan garces , the lawyer who brought suit against general pinochet , said in a telephone interview from madrid it proves that there was an organization with a structure and discipline that did n't only exchange information but committed criminal acts , he said intelligence sharing between washington s allies in south america did not begin with operation condor , but the plan formalized and deepened cooperation among police and military forces that had taken power in six countries brazil , argentina , chile , paraguay , uruguay and bolivia after gen manuel contreras of chile invited security chiefs to create the basis of an excellent coordination and improved action at a meeting in november 1975 , police forces from member countries began to operate in each others' jurisdictions their new ties allowed security officials to take part in joint interrogations , to pursue people across borders and to order surveillance on citizens who sought asylum in other nations trained during the cold war at the school of the americas in panama , the officials viewed their enemy as communism , backed by moscow in a subversive war without frontiers to prevail , governments too would have to work across borders , they said the security threats were not entirely imagined rebels like the montoneros in argentina did aim to destabilize some governments but in other countries there were no rebel movements , and military regimes used the club of anticommunism to snuff out any calls for democracy or labor rights in chile , general pinochet had overthrown the democratically elected president , salvador allende gossens , a socialist , and hunted down his cabinet officials and supporters among them was orlando letelier , who died when his car exploded on a street in washington , also killing his american aide , ronni moffitt according to a 1979 senate foreign relations report , which remains classified , the killings of gen carlos prats of chile and gen juan jose torres of bolivia in argentina were also reportedly the work of operation condor , as was the attempted assassination of a chilean senator , bernardo leighton , in italy in paraguay , the targets of general stroessner included members of a rival faction in the governing colorado party , doctors who refused to cover up torture and mr almada , who criticized the educational system in his dissertation they said i was an intellectual terrorist , mr almada said he blames the paraguayan police for the death of his 33yearold wife , who suffered a heart attack and died after hearing his screams over the telephone two of the thousands of cases contained in the archives are those of gladys sannemann and agustin goiburu , physicians in asuncion who refused to falsify an autopsy to show that a man beaten to death under police custody in 1958 had died of natural causes instead , dr sannemann took the cadaver to her medical school in asuncion and performed a proper autopsy before her students practically from that moment it began , said dr sannemann , an immunologist who is now 69 and practicing here in asuncion the challenge marked her out for the stroessner regime
langdon , nd beneath the flat , broad plains of north dakota , where the push of a button could have ignited a nuclear attack , the earth is exploding it is the sound of peace in a thunderous exclamation point to the end of the cold war , some 150 steel and concrete silos , once the launching tunnels of the nuclear minuteman iii missiles , are being blown to bits by dynamite the silos were part of our everyday landscape , social and physical , said carol goodman , who farms near one of the missile sites with her husband , bernie in so many ways , it set the rhythm of life in north dakota now they 'll be gone to fulfill the strategic arms limitation treaty , the grand forks air force base is overseeing the destruction in north dakota of roughly one silo a week for the next three years the first two silos were demolished just weeks ago the nuclear missiles themselves were removed from 1995 to 1998 in all , 150 silos in north dakota will be destroyed , with the next dynamiting scheduled for wednesday veit company , a demolition contractor , is destroying the silos , which reach more than 60 feet into the earth workers lace each silo with more than 800 pounds of dynamite , ammonia nitrate and fuel oil the first explosion , triggered at a site outside this little farm town of 2 , 335 people in northeastern north dakota , about five miles from the canadian border , sent chunks of concrete soaring 100 feet into the air it s the end of an era , said dick parrish , a spokesman for veit it makes you stop when you think what could have been like other americans , people in north dakota say they are grateful that the end of cold war hostilities has made the nuclear sites unnecessary but there has been no small measure of nostalgia for the arsenal that put prairie towns like langdon in the center of world affairs in a place accustomed to a familiar , ordered world anchored by straight , square sections of cropland , the missile program brought thousands of newcomers from all over the country business in north dakota , which had been hemorrhaging population since the 1930 s , suddenly boomed rents soared , schools burgeoned and churches sprang up some of the older people saw it as an invasion , said dawn roppel , president of the langdon school board , who was a high school student here when the missile silos were being built but it was great for business to many north dakotans , it was a time of social stimulation over a cup of coffee and a piece of rhubarb pie , longtime residents here would talk with their visitors and learn more about life in distant regions to some people , the concentration of nuclear firepower made north dakota a likely target in an enemy attack but more north dakotans saw the missile bases as a shield to me , it looked like protection , not a threat , said bill verwey , a grain elevator manager and former mayor of nearby nekoma , population 102 if there was trouble , we were in the best place whatever the case , north dakotans were apt to go along with whatever the united states military deemed necessary people here are pretty trusting , mrs roppel said if the government tells you it s going to be all right , you believe them i do n't know if that s trusting or naive but the ominous potential of the missiles was impossible to deny in a public meeting in september 1962 , before the missile silos were built , a farmer asked an air force representative what effect the launching of missiles would have on his milk cows none , the air force spokesman said if these missiles are launched , we will be at war the milk cows would be the least of your problems when the missile unit at grand forks was disbanded last year , the air force cut more than 1 , 700 jobs it was a bruising blow in a farm state already hard hit by rockbottom prices for spring wheat , oats , barley and other crops you ca n't raise 5 wheat and get 3 back , mrs goodman said at least , you ca n't do it for very long young north dakotans , whose scores in college admissions tests routinely rank among the highest in the nation , have done the math they continue to leave the state in large numbers sure , my boys would like to stay and farm , said mrs goodman , whose oldest sons went to college to study economics , preparing for life behind a desk it s just not possible the county s population stood at about 6 , 200 in the 1990 census , but most officials acknowledge a decline of 800 or 900 people since then looking for an economic savior , most people here hold out hopes that a new missile system will be based in north dakota the soviet union no longer exists , the north dakotans say , but other troubles lurk in the most likely scenario , the land used for missile sites will be sold for farmland , said staff sgt rob mims in grand forks , just as it was used before the cold war for years , farmers would tend crops right up to the fences that marked the missile sites , riding tractors and combines as they might anywhere else the one difference , though , was that a uniformed airman stood watch nearby you 'd be plowing , and look over to see the airman with a gun , watching you , watching you all the time , mrs roppel said that could give you the heebiejeebies photo in many ways , missile sites set a rhythm of life in north dakota , said carol goodman , a farmer the first silo was imploded

even casual fans could recognize payne stewart on the golf course , with the trademark knickers , or plus fours , that he wore during competition but beyond his colorful apparel , stewart was recognized and appreciated for his talent and his competitive spirit demonstrative and outgoing , stewart was one of the world s best golfers , a twotime winner of the united states open and he was enjoying the finest year of his career when he was killed yesterday at the age of 42 in a plane crash in south dakota a winner of 18 tournaments worldwide during his 19year career , stewart won three major championships this year s open , the 1989 professional golfers' association championship and the 1991 united states open he was third on this year s tour money list with more than 207 million

s most popular and accomplished players after staging a riveting duel down the stretch with phil mickelson at pinehurst , nc , stewart sank a 15foot par putt on the final hole to win by one stroke it was one of the great pressure putts in golf history , the longest putt ever to decide the open on the final hole in its 99year history it was also a memorable climax to what would be stewart s final victory on the pga tour it is difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over the death of payne stewart , tim finchem , the pga tour commissioner , said stewart lived in orlando , fla , near many of his peers , including tiger woods , one of stewart s teammates at this year s ryder cup stewart was one of the most enthusiastic members of the team , which staged an incredible rally on the final day to win the cup back from the europeans last month it is shocking , woods was quoted as saying by the associated press it s a tragedy i ca n't even comprehend the scope of it none of us can right now there is an enormous void and emptiness i feel right now with a beautiful swing and a superb short game , stewart solidified his place as one of the game s top players this year , accomplishing his two biggest goals winning the united states open again and making the team for the ryder cup , the international competition that is held every two years meanwhile , stewart talked openly about his newfound peace and maturity because of a renewed faith in god after winning the open in june , stewart took an extended vacation , determined to savor his victory when i won the open the first time , i did n't take enough time to enjoy it , stewart said this time i'm going to enjoy it stewart had tears in his eyes after his victory at pinehurst , proving to himself and to others that he was still one of the game s best players in a classic backnine duel on that sunday with mickelson , stewart made pressure putts on the final three holes , but it was the last putt that will live in history when the putt at no 18 dropped into the hole to clinch his victory , stewart raised his fist and let out a scream as the gallery roared with him the victory was even more impressive because the 1998 united states open had been bitterly disappointing for stewart he took a fourstroke lead into the final round , but he lost to lee janzen by one stroke before this year , stewart had not won on tour since 1995 , and there were those who wondered whether stewart would ever win another major , or perhaps even another pga tournament but that loss motivated stewart to new heights he started this year strongly , winning the att pebble beach national proam in march , then winning the open three months later those two victories helped earn stewart a spot on this year s united states ryder cup team , and stewart made no secret that he believed his presence would help the united states win back the cup though stewart was not at his best during the ryder cup , winning only a halfpoint , his enthusiasm helped unify the team one of his teammates , mark o'meara , joked about stewart s habit of playing bruce springsteen s song born in the usa on the stereo in the team s lounge if we hear bruce springsteen , we know payne s around , o'meara said at the time that s the way payne is he wears his emotions on his sleeve he s great what you see is what you get ben crenshaw , the united states ryder cup captain , said he would remember stewart as the life of the party , and cited something stewart brought to this year s cup team pingpong he insisted that the team have access to a table to help wind down from the cup matches stewart began wearing the colorful plus fours because he wanted to stand out from the crowd early in my career , i went to the driving range and i looked down the way , and there was a guy dressed exactly the same as me , stewart said i decided right then that i would do something different stewart was born in springfield , mo , on jan 30 , 1957 , and attended southern methodist university he turned professional in 1979 after graduation his first victory came in the 1982 quad cities open , and it was a special one because it was the only tournament his father , william , saw him win william stewart , who introduced his son to the game of golf , died in 1985 , and when stewart won the bay hill invitational two years later , he donated the winner s check to a hospital in his father s memory stewart s first major championship came in the pga championship at kemper lakes outside chicago in 1989 , when he beat mike reid by one stroke two years later , stewart won his first united states open at hazeltine national golf club in chaska , minn , defeating scott simpson in an 18hole playoff then came tougher times , when stewart won only once on tour between 1991 and 1998 he had sometimes exhibited a gruffness , and he was severely criticized in the summer of 1990 for his seeming insensitivity to the issue of racial exclusion raised at that year s pga stewart said players were not concerned about the issue , which he said was a news media creation the players have probably made more jokes about it than anything else , he said yet as he recovered his golf game through the 90 s , he also refurbished his image , transforming himself from someone who might brush past reporters or fans when he was upset to one of the most approachable players on the tour i'm a lot more mature and happier , he said earlier this year i 've learned what s really important he also cited a newfound faith that he said he was drawn to by the involvement of his children , 13yearold chelsea and 10yearold aaron he is also survived by his wife , tracey , and his mother , bee stewart s place in this week s tour championship , an elite event

chicago , june 22 nigeria is playing in its third women s world cup , so the team is no longer green , unless you count the hair of its top scorer , mercy akide for her , mercy is a name , not a virtue attack is the only style for a team that plays with joyous assertion and individual brilliance , one that needs a pit crew more than a coaching staff thursday s match against the united states is set for soldier field here , but it might be better suited for the brickyard in indianapolis the nigerians have only one gear , overdrive patience is the name of one of the starting forwards , but none is ever expected on the soccer field football is a game of taking risks , said ismaila mabo , the nigerian coach we will rattle the americans we will not be intimidated this may sound flamboyantly selfassured for a team that had never won a world cup match until it left skid marks on north korea , 21 , on sunday but nigeria s super falcons are flying high after a recent exhibition victory over china , their confidence fuelinjected by nationwide expectation and fervent christian conviction they expect to win thursday they expect to win the whole tournament before sunday s opener , the super falcons received a call of encouragement from nigeria s first lady , stella obasanjo , wife of the newly inaugurated president , olusegun obasanjo for two previous days , the entire team had fasted and prayed for victory we asked god to give us the trophy and to surprise the world , said akide , who scored a goal and delivered an assist in the victory it is a remarkable emergence for a team that did not officially exist before 1991 and that has overcome the cultural stereotype that soccer is a man s game and that women who played would be unable to bear children two weekly , halfhour television programs are now devoted to women s soccer in africa s most populous country , and at least five newspapers and magazines give the super falcons significant coverage they are household names , said pepsie adiukwu , who is the host of a weekly program called female soccer with pepsie two businesswomen , princess bola jegede and gina yeseibo , are generally credited with kickstarting women s soccer in nigeria in the late 1980 s princess jegede sponsored the first national club championship and operates a team called the jegede babes in lagos , providing her players free education yeseibo , who is in the construction business , donated 100 trophies in the name of traditional leaders around nigeria , respectfully and cleverly gaining their acceptance for the women s game when we started , people said women should not be showing their legs , or that they would not be able to have babies , but football is football , male or female , yeseibo said now , there are a total of 34 teams in the top two divisions of the nigerian women s league , which is sponsored by pepsicola one of its senior executives , a scotsman named iain nelson , heads a development project for female players , and the company also sponsors soccer academies for boys and girls players earn 50 to 100 a month in league play and endorsements , officials said , not an insignificant amount of money in a country stunted by years of corrupt military dictatorship akide owns a small transport business ann chiejine , the goalkeeper , operates a hair salon her sense of style is as ostentatious as her goalkeeping she has dyed her hair white , and wears a brightly decorated head scarf during games for the world cup , she has dyed akide s hair green and white , the colors of the nigerian flag , and for the captain , florence omagbemi , chiejine has applied a shade of flamethrower orange a fan of mexico s jorge campos and paraguay s jose luis chilavert , chiejine is as much a diva as a goalkeeper she shakes her head and waves at players who deliver weak shots , and makes acrobatic , diving saves even when only routine stops are called for i always hold the belief that whenever my husband comes to watch me play , he wants to know how well i justify my involvement in the game that takes me out of the house oftentimes , chiejine once told a women s soccer magazine in nigeria there is another reason she plays to be noticed , chiejine said in an interview she would love to play soccer in the united states if this world cup generates a women s league here my daughter said , 'play well , so i can go to school in the united states , ' said chiejine , who is 25 as the only wife and mother on the nigerian team she has two daughters , ages 5 and 3 chiejine serves as a powerful rebuttal to those who believe that sports sabotage motherhood , her teammates said some feel that when you get married , that is the end of your career , and that if you play football , you wo n't be able to have children , chiejine said i am showing that you can still play and it will not disturb you akide , 23 , was a tabletennis star at the state level in nigeria , when her sister told her in 1991 that a world cup was being played for women i will be there next time , akide told her sister the super falcons did not score a goal in their three matches at the 1991 women s world cup and managed only a tie with canada four years later in 1995 but akide , known as marvelous mercy , scored 10 goals during qualifying for the 1999 tournament , as the super falcons won the african championship by scoring 28 goals and giving up none a world cup victory finally came against north korea , and there is pressure for more a failure to advance to the quarterfinals , which would qualify nigeria for the 2000 summer olympics in sydney , australia , could undermine corporate and private support of its women s league at home , officials said this is our third time , said lizzy onyenwenwa , the head of the women s division of the nigerian soccer federation the sponsors have put a lot of money into this it is important to deliver photo nigeria s florence omagbemi , left , had

it was a beautiful , butterscotch day , yankee stadium was bathed in sunlight and derek jeter , who seems to move in perpetual sunshine , was at bat jeter cocked his bat in his customary stance , the bat held in such a high , unorthodox manner that it appears he is sprouting an antenna from his helmet it was the third inning , runners on first and third , none out and the yankees were behind , 20 , to seattle pitcher paul abbott abbott , a righthander , threw , and jeter , a righthanded hitter , whipped the bat around with the speed of a mongoose attacking a lizard , and lined a single to right field , the 762d base hit of his major league career the myriad statistics that baseball elicits can give one a headache , but a particular number that jeter is fashioning is remarkable it places him in a category with the greatest hitters in baseball history with his two singles yesterday in the yankees' 115 victory over the mariners , he has more hits in the first four full years of his career , 751 \( he had 12 in 1995 \) , than hitters like ted williams \( 749 in his first four seasons \) , cal ripken \( 745 \) , lou gehrig \( 736 \) ty cobb \( 729 \) , pete rose \( 723 \) and henry aaron \( 718 \) had if derek sanderson jeter continues at his present , leagueleading pace of hits \( 175 \) he is batting 348 , third in the american league to nomar garciaparra s 350 and bernie williams s 349 jeter projects to 220 hits this season and 796 hits for his first four full years he will have passed stan musial \( 792 \) and joe dimaggio \( 791 \) if , said jeter , seated at his locker before yesterday s game , man , if s a big word baseball s a game of failure obviously you fail more than you succeed his track record as well as his persona portray anything but the concept of failure at age 25 , he appears the most levelheaded of athletes he is approachable and , as yankee management has learned , coachable he s not one of these young guys who thinks he s got it all figured out , the yankee coach jose cardenal said in the other clubhouse , jamie moyer , a seattle pitcher , said jeter had made huge adjustments at the plate when he first came up , said moyer , it was obvious he had talent , but he also had some glaring holes for one thing , you could pitch him up and in , get him out on his front foot that is , get him to shift onto his front foot before he swung you did that with change of speed , and it took a lot of sting out of his bat but , added moyer , jeter adapted that hole no longer exists it does n't exist because jeter spends good chunks of his time at his craft while his reputation of dating stars like mariah carey may be earned , it has not proved a debilitating distraction to his occupational chores over last winter , he regularly appeared on the yankees' tampa springtraining grounds to work on driving inside pitches to left field , instead of fighting them off and slicing them to right he did n't find this kind of diligence extraordinary i live in tampa , he said , with a shrug i work on my game all the time don zimmer , the yankees' dugout coach , who has been in professional baseball for 51 years , said that unlike some superb hitters , like rose and wade boggs , jeter hits with power , and to all fields how do you think he hits balls over the rightfield fence tapping them \? zimmer said he s got a big swing , and for him to have so many hits is phenomenal jeter is also a goodsize shortstop , at 6 feet 3 inches , 195 pounds , bigger and with greater range and richer than johnny pesky , whom zimmer remembers as having a terrific major league start pesky was a red sox shortstop in the 1940 s , and had 779 hits in his first four seasons pesky got 208 hits in his second season with boston , in 1946 , and batted 335 he dropped slightly in 1947 , getting 207 hits with a 324 batting average but they made him take a cut in pay after that season , zimmer said he was a coach for me when i managed the red sox , and johnny told me he s never forgotten that he went from something like 7 , 000 a year to 6 , 000 jeter , to underscore a difference in eras , went from 750 , 000 in his third year to 5 million this year , after arbitration but he says there are no hard feelings about that between him and george steinbrenner , the team s principal owner but he gets upset when michigan beats ohio state in football , said jeter , who is from michigan while steinbrenner is from ohio , and i do get on him about that jeter , who grew up a yankee fan in kalamazoo , said that his favorite player was dave winfield , who was not one of steinbrenner s favorites i thought winfield was the greatest allround athlete there was , jeter said and as far as winfield s being mr may , as steinbrenner had disparaged him , jeter said , he must have got a lot of hits in may then , to get 3 , 000 for his career as for his career numbers , jeter said i just want to be consistent and play as long as i'm having fun i hope to have a lot of great years left after all , i'm still the youngest guy on this team looking around the clubhouse of the defending world series champion yankees , it turned out he was right only 25 just a babe which gives rise to yet another agreeable , if plump , historical baseball image photo coach jose cardenal , right , says derek jeter does n't think he s got it all figured out \( mary dibiase blaich for the new york times \)

paris for decades , curators , collectors and dealers from throughout the world came here to an antiquarian bookshop on the left bank , the librairie p jammes , where they climbed the circular staircase to meet the owners , andre jammes and his wife , marietherese they came to share the couple s expertise on photography , a private passion that they pursued for more than 40 years , forming one of the finest collections anywhere now , after a series of gifts and sales of their treasures to the bibliotheque nationale and the musee d'orsay in paris as well as to the j paul getty museum in los angeles , and the metropolitan museum of art in new york , the jammeses have sent to auction much of what is left of their magnificent obsession , said philippe garner , the director of the photography department at sotheby s in london thirty of the most important photographs and albums are on exhibit through tuesday at sotheby s in new york the sale of the collection , 2 , 000 images in 280 lots , will take place on oct 27 in london sotheby s expects that the sale will total as much as 48 million , a record at auction for photography but when mr and mrs jammes began acquiring photographs , neither they nor anyone else realized how prescient they were in 1955 , after a beautiful lecture on nadar , we discovered that there were no collectors and very few serious books on the history of photography , said mr jammes , 72 that was shocking for us so they decided to acquire early french photographs as a study collection then the jammeses documented the photographs as thoroughly as they did the early printed books stocked in their shop they concentrated on 19thcentury french photographers nadar \( born gaspardfelix tournachon \) , edouard baldus , hippolyte bayard , gustave le gray and henri le secq but they soon broadened their focus to include other masters from the first century of photography the britons william henry fox talbott and julia margaret cameron and the americans edward steichen and alfred stieglitz , along with foreignborn artists who worked in paris andre kertesz , a hungarian , and man ray , an american mr jammes became the collector , acquiring vast quantities of photographs from booksellers as well as from photographers , their estates and their families mrs jammes was the archivist , recording the history , provenance and printing techniques used on each photograph they began to exhibit their collection in 1965 , lending man rays to an exhibition at the musee des arts decoratifs in paris \( among them was an album of 12 rayograms that had once belonged to the dada poet tristan tzara \) in 1969 , they sent many 19thcentury works to a show at the philadelphia museum of art , and in 1977 , the art institute of chicago did a major exhibition of their collection , the first century of photography in 1983 , the jammeses sent 19thcentury calotypes , images from paper negatives , to princeton university for an exhibition that coincided with the publication by princeton university press of the art of french calotype , a book by mr jammes and the art historian eugenia parry janis in 1984 , daniel wolf , a new york photography dealer , persuaded the jammeses , along with eight other collectors , to sell part of their collection to an unnamed client that the jammeses guessed was the getty museum we bought several thousand photographs from the jammes collection , said weston naef , the getty s curator of photographs we got a little bit of everything french , british , american photographs all , except their 20thcentury pieces , that most people did not know about then the couple also sold their collection of photographs by nadar , the preeminent french portrait photographer in the 19th century , to the musee d'orsay and in 1990 , the getty returned and bought 200 images by eugene atget while sotheby s auction offers none of atget s poignant photographs of simple landscapes , formal palaces and gardens and eerie reflections in shop windows , the works of most other photographers in the jammes collection are represented in the sale the finest of the 16 images by nadar are two portraits from 1855 one depicts the illustrator gustave dore as a dashing fellow in a checkered scarf the other shows the mime paul legrand as an astonished clown each is expected to bring up to 28 , 800 two albumen prints by le gray from 1855 are nature studies in beech tree , fontainebleau , a huge , gnarled tree seems to swallow the landscape , and in seascape in sete the sun expands both the sky and sea each is expected to sell for as much as 96 , 000 the power in bayard s selfportrait from 185055 is in the tightly controlled setting showing him at work with his camera the earliest photograph in the sale , the bluish pantheon , paris by vincent chevalier , is a wholeplate daguerreotype that daguerre s longtime lensmaker took on oct 2 , 1839 it was just six weeks after daguerre s photography process was announced to a crowd in front of the french academy of sciences in paris sotheby s expects that the photograph will bring as much as 32 , 000 this sale has the wonderful feel of an insider s collection , mr naef said it turns back the clock to the late 70 s and 80 s , when so many early photographs were being exported from france and that makes it seem very refreshing and exciting photos among the photographs belonging to andre and marietherese jammes that will be auctioned by sotheby s are , from far left , an 1855 portrait of the illustrator gustave dore by nadar , a selfportrait by hippolyte bayard from 185055 and a rayogram by man ray \( sotheby s \)
washington , jan 17 president clinton s lawyers are preparing a defense to the senate on tuesday that broadly attacks the prosecution case presented by the house managers on the facts , on the law , on the constitution and even on history according to several white house advisers , the heart of the president s defense will remain that the charges against him fall far short of the high constitutional standard for impeachment this impeachment is a direct affront to that constitutional standard , george j mitchell , the former senate majority leader , said today on the nbc news program meet the press mr clinton s lawyers are likely to use aspects of the house prosecution case to defend him and to show that his accusers have misread both the facts and the law we will point out the significant holes in the presentation of the house managers , said jim kennedy , a white house spokesman , as well as their misleading and overreaching characterizations of the evidence and testimony in the record in presenting their case , the house managers also employed this tactic , by anticipating , incorporating and debunking mr clinton s defense before it had been heard by the senate the evidentiary case presented by the house managers outlined an unlawful scheme orchestrated by the president to get monica s lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the sexual misconduct lawsuit brought by paula corbin jones , and to conceal their relationship from the jones lawyers by hiding gifts the president had given to ms lewinsky the house prosecutors claimed that mr clinton helped find a job for ms lewinsky in order to silence her , and tried to influence the testimony of other witnesses then , they charged , the president went before a federal grand jury and lied about these activities , including the nature and details of his relationship with ms lewinsky mr clinton s legal team is well aware that it faces new and significant hurdles as the impeachment trial turns to the defense senators have already sat through three days of uninterrupted evidence and argument imploring them to go the ultimate step in the impeachment process and remove the president from office and even some democratic senators conceded that the house managers had presented their case clearly and effectively any fairminded person would have to say they made a powerful presentation , senator kent conrad , democrat of north dakota , said on saturday , following the house s final arguments senior democrats in congress and white house advisers remain confident that the house managers still face extremely stiff odds in persuading the required twothirds of the senate to convict the president but the prosecution s coherent presentation of the evidence and law on perjury and obstruction of justice , the central charges contained in the two articles of impeachment passed by the house , made it far more likely that a simple majority of senators would favor hearing from witnesses , an issue to be decided after the white house makes its case next week , senators will hear more about events with which they have become all too familiar the president s deposition in the jones trial , his testimony before the grand jury and his interaction with white house aides and friends , including his secretary , betty currie , and the washington lawyer vernon e jordan jr this time , however , they will hear about these subjects from a different vantage point where the house managers placed mr clinton at the heart of a conspiracy to lie and obstruct justice , the president s lawyers will , if their trial brief is an accurate road map , show him in a very different light after trying to conceal an embarrassing and illicit affair , they will say , the president admitted to the grand jury that he had had an inappropriate , intimate relationship with ms lewinsky and did nothing unlawful in his earlier efforts to hide it the white house legal team , relying heavily on the president s grand jury testimony as well as the testimony of ms lewinsky and ms currie , will most likely challenge every assumption and many of the facts in the house case in several instances , the lawyers will argue that the house s recitation of evidence was purposely misleading for example , instead of encouraging ms lewinsky to lie in the jones case , the president said in his grand jury testimony that he believed ms lewinsky could execute a truthful affidavit , since they had never had sexual intercourse ms currie testified that it was ms lewinsky who initiated a retrieval of gifts the president had given her , while the house managers claimed that mr clinton had instructed ms currie to get the gifts back from ms lewinsky finally , the president s lawyers will stress that he helped ms lewinsky in her job search before she became embroiled in the jones case , undercutting the house managers' accusations that the job help was a quid pro quo for her silence in the jones case mr clinton s defenders were particularly rankled by the presentation of two republican managers , representatives f james sensenbrenner jr of wisconsin and bill mccollum of florida mr sensenbrenner mischaracterized earlier testimony from the white house counsel , charles f c ruff , and misstated facts from the jones case , claiming that ms jones was denied merit pay raises
mayor rudolph w giuliani s chief of staff has been questioned by investigators from the brooklyn district attorney s office who are looking into whether hasidic builders in brooklyn benefited from their political connections to city hall the chief of staff , anthony v carbonetti , was interviewed for more than an hour on tuesday , said officials familiar with the investigation investigators were trying to determine whether mr carbonetti or his former boss , bruce teitelbaum , had forced the removal of a buildings commissioner in brooklyn who was involved in several disputes with hasidic contractors there the inquiry , which began as an investigation into a fatal accident at a williamsburg construction site last month , has expanded to look at whether mr teitelbaum tried to assist developers who were having trouble meeting city building requirements , in part by pushing for the ouster of joseph trivisonno , the senior official at the buildings department in brooklyn kevin davitt , a spokesman for mr hynes , declined to comment on the most recent developments in the probe administration officials have said privately that they believe the investigation is politically motivated the brooklyn district attorney , charles j hynes , is a democrat mr giuliani , a republican , is likely to run for senate next year investigators cautioned that the inquiry was at an early stage and that it was not clear if there had been any wrongdoing they said that mr carbonetti readily agreed to answer their questions and that no subpoenas had been issued mr carbonetti confirmed , in a telephone interview , that he had met with the investigators on tuesday but he would not comment further mr teitelbaum , who left the administration in january to head mr giuliani s senate campaign committee , declined to comment investigators working for in january to head mr giuliani s senate campaign committee , declined to comment investigators working for mr hynes , also plan to interview mr teitelbaum , possibly as early as tomorrow , officials familiar with the inquiry said mr giuliani has long enjoyed broad political support among hasidic leaders , and mr teitelbaum , his former chief of staff , has for years served as the mayor s liaison to the city s hasidic neighborhoods , often organizing fundraising events for mr giuliani s campaigns in the interview on tuesday , according to the officials who were present , mr carbonetti told prosecutors that problems had arisen between mr trivisonno and a number of builders in brooklyn in 1998 mr carbonetti said , according to the officials , that he and mr teitelbaum had pushed gaston silva , then the city s commissioner of buildings , to remove mr trivisonno , but that they had done so strictly out of concern that he was unable to do an effective job mr hynes opened his investigation after a residential complex under construction at 50 middleton street collapsed on nov 23 , plunging a dozen immigrant workers down four stories in a cascade of wet concrete , killing one and badly injuring others the accident raised concerns about the quality and safety of a rash of new construction meant to ease overcrowding among the hasidim in williamsburg , and about whether the city had been rigorous enough in overseeing the work over the last two weeks , the district attorney s office has interviewed a number of hasidic builders in brooklyn and has pored over the building records for a handful of projects in williamsburg investigators have also interviewed former commissioner silva , several officials close to the investigation said prosecutors , they said , are also investigating a tip that builders who were at odds with mr trivisonno were involved in an aborted effort to hold a fundraiser in jamaica estates for the mayor last august since the district attorney opened his investigation , senior city hall officials have said that mr trivisonno was removed from the brooklyn job and an earlier one in staten island for what one called performancerelated issues , not politics mr trivisonno , however , has said in interviews and in meetings with prosecutors , that hasidic builders frequently threatened to go to city hall to try to overturn his decisions about flaws in their designs and buildings mr trivisonno has also said that he had had several disputes over potential safety problems with chaim ostreicher , the contractor whose building collapsed last month but mr trivisonno has said that he suspected that his ouster was due to pressure from people involved in a separate project , a condominium project at 26 heyward street , in a section of williamsburg undergoing rapid redevelopment mr silva has suggested the same thing , officials close to the investigation said mr trivisonno said he temporarily stopped work on the condominium project after work at the site began to undermine an adjacent structure he said that he also found that the building extended five feet farther back on the lot than was legally allowed , and that he had told the developers that they would have to either buy more property or seek a variance if they wanted to avoid having to tear down the completed part of the building according to several officials , mr silva was interviewed last friday and gave investigators an account of the matter beginning with february 1998 , when , he said , he got the first sign of city hall s concern about mr trivisonno s work in brooklyn he said randy mastro , then a deputy mayor , identified mr trivisonno as one of five buildings officials who should be replaced mr silva said he balked at this , telling mr mastro that one representative of the heyward street builders , jacob fekete , had bragged to others involved in construction in brooklyn that he knew mr teitelbaum and was going to get mr trivisonno fired by mr silva s account , mr mastro told him that he knew nothing about mr fekete and his claims of influence , and suggested he talk to mr teitelbaum , who was then the mayor s chief of staff mr silva then met with mr teitelbaum and mr carbonetti , who was then mr teitelbaum s deputy they both told him that they had received many complaints from builders who called mr trivisonno prickly and overbearing neither mr teitelbaum nor mr carbonetti mentioned the 26 heyward street project or identified any of the builders who had made complaints still , mr silva said , mr teitelbaum made it clear that he wanted mr trivisonno out of the job in his account , mr silva said he then stalled for time , and even called in mr fekete to inform him that he had personally approved mr trivisonno s crackdown on the problems with the heyward project mr silva also told investigators that mr fekete denied that he and others involved in the project , including joseph goldberger , a brooklyn businessman and prominent supporter of gov george e pataki , had sought mr trivisonno s ouster mr fekete and mr goldberger did not respond to messages seeking comment for this article but after mr silva let mr trivisonno take a leave of absence for several months , he told investigators , he was ordered to fire him , and told that if he did not comply , he would find that none of the promotions or hires that he wanted to make would be approved by city hall mr silva told the investigators that he believed the order came from mr carbonetti , speaking on behalf of mr teitelbaum ultimately , mr trivisonno retired in october 1998 , and he contends that if he had remained on the job , the accident at mr ostreicher s property might not have happened
huntington station , ny , july 2 the sun was barely up when the immigrant day workers began to gather here along new york avenue , waiting curbside to be hired by the landscapers , carpenters and other contractors who would drive up in vans and pickups the daily ritual , which starts in may and continues through september , has gained a number of participants over the last several years , upsetting local residents and merchants who say the laborers create traffic hazards and scare away shoppers the vans and trucks began arriving this morning around 6 30 and were quickly surrounded by as many as 30 men , who jostled for position to bargain for the promise of an average of 60 in exchange for a long day s hard work all we want is a job , said one of the workers , who came here a year ago from el salvador we just hope we get our money at the end of the day he identified himself only as eduardo , 20 , saying he was an illegal immigrant who feared deportation by 7 30 am , nearly 125 workers had converged on this busy commercial strip , some of them arriving by train at the long island rail road station a few blocks away at times the traffic came to a screeching halt as the workers darted back and forth across the avenue , chasing down any vehicle that might be driven by a contractor or a local resident looking for a couple of men to help with yard work the first signs of hostility and resentment began to surface around 8 am as the local store and business owners arrived to open shop they chased the workers , three to four deep , from the sidewalk in front of their stores , picked up the discarded coffee cups and breakfast leftovers and waited for the customers who no longer come , the shop owners said , because of the crowds of day workers if you get someone driving up in a station wagon , they get mobbed , even if there are kids in the back seat , said the owner of a small shop in the middle of the block the workers think it might be a job offer but the drivers get frightened i'm afraid someday someone s going to get run over he would speak only on condition of anonymity , he said , because i do n't want a brick through my window it s not that i begrudge any of them a job , he added my own parents were immigrants i know what these men are feeling but all this is ruining my business , and no one seems to want to help solve the problem the town of huntington , which includes this small middle and lowincome suburban community stretched along route 110 , tried three years ago to set up a hiring station on a parking lot at a nearby public park that has public rest rooms but residents living near the park resisted the move , and town officials backed down town supervisor frank p petrone tried again last year to convert a parking lot into a hiring station , but that effort , too , was defeated he has said he has another site in mind , but several calls to his office seeking details were not returned the curbside hiring problem has repeated itself in scores of communities across long island with growing immigrant populations , officials said most of the day laborers are hispanic , and the officials say the number of hispanic residents may have doubled since the 1990 census , which showed 200 , 000 spanish speakers in a total population of 28 million the suffolk county legislature tried recently to resolve the issue with a proposal that would have made it illegal for contractors to solicit the workers on public roads between 5 am and 11 am under penalty of up to 1 , 500 in fines and three months in jail the proposal was defeated at a meeting of the legislature in riverhead on tuesday attended by nearly 100 latino protesters among those who voted against the bill were maxine postal , the democratic majority leader , and paul tonna , a republican whose district includes huntington station ron cohen , a legislative aide to mr tonna , said that all the towns in suffolk were keeping an eye on huntington if they can work out a solution , perhaps it can be applied elsewhere , he said ms postal was among the lawmakers who questioned the bill s constitutionality no one wants to put these men out of work , she said the best way to solve this is for the workers , the employers and leaders of the local communities to come together and set up a hiring hall she noted that such a location had been set aside by the city of glen cove in nassau county a few years ago near the glen street station of the long island rail road a similar solution has been in place in inwood for more than three years , according to nadia marinmolina , a lawyer and the executive director of the workplace project , a support group for hispanic workers she said that she had offered to help officials in other towns , but that none had got in touch with the group it s a problem that affects all those involved , including the workers they , like everyone else , would like to work out a solution , she said it s a matter of working together and overcoming distrust and fears photo a van arriving at huntington station , ny , is rushed by men who gather and wait on the street every morning in the hope of being asked to do a day s

paris , may 30 a pair of dispa rate underdogs one an obscure austrian with a penchant for literature and power tennis , the other the most charismatic showman to enliven the men s game divested the french open today of venus williams , a favorite to claim the women s title , and carlos moya of spain , the defending champion the fifthseeded williams , who had predicted that paris would play host to her firstever grand slam championship , instead discovered herself a round of 16 casualty after 125thranked barbara schwartz , a qualifier , ambushed her , 26 , 76 \( 97 \) , 63 andre agassi , at age 29 on the rebound at the only grand slam event he has never won , dethroned the fourthseeded moya , 46 , 75 , 75 , 61 i had never seen her before , williams said of schwartz , admitting that she had n't done any scouting on her opponent williams assumed that it was schwartz who needed to worry about her game but the reverse proved true usually when i lose a match , i really beat myself , but this time i really think she came out and played , williams said after being repeatedly punished , and caught out of position , by schwartz s highly disguised onehanded backhand slice the 20yearold schwartz , who was busy graduating from school at this time last year , now faces topseeded martina hingis , a 63 , 76 \( 75 \) winner against ruxandra dragomir hingis said she would n't underestimate schwartz the way williams did you have to take everybody serious from now on , she said hingis , who did n't hide her delight that both williams sisters had been extricated from her side of the draw before she had to worry about meeting them , added , i think you 're only stupid yourself if you do n't take the player serious venus williams joined her 10thseeded sister , serena , on the sideline after falling victim to the most significant upset on the women s side since 94thranked anna smashnova ousted fifthseeded jana novotna in 1994 moya was bewildered by his loss to agassi when agassi plays well , you get crazy , said moya , who did n't take it well when the center court crowd began to chant agassi s name like a mantra after he lost the first set , then performed the wave on his behalf after he held serve for a 65 lead in the second set spurred on by the gallery s gyrations , agassi sprinted off toward his changeover chair like a hound on a scent , and once play resumed , he promptly broke moya to even the match at a set apiece agassi had been absorbing a 64 , 41 beating from moya , who appeared to be operating his forehand topspin drives and drop shots by remote control , when he bestirred himself he was hurting me , just giving me a beating , said agassi a runnerup here in 1990 , when he lost to andres gomez , and again in 1991 , when jim courier outgunned him at 64 , 41 , i decided that if i'm going to lose this , i needed to lose it executing to the level that i can hit my shots , just start playing bigger , and once i got the offense , i actually believed i could win agassi had been apprehensive about facing moya , whom he had never played before and who had briefly held the no 1 ranking earlier this year today was a huge obstacle in my way i felt good not just about winning , but about how i won , said agassi , who bedeviled moya s game , especially his suspect backhand wing , in the process of beefing up his own artillery agassi , who reduced the forlorn moya to rubble with a backhand lob at match point , added i felt like a quality first serve and a quality first shot was putting him in a world of trouble i was quite confident that the match had turned my way moya could n't quite run agassi s lob down and had to fire off his reply with his back to the net and his racquet between his legs , a trick shot agassi had converted with aplomb in his thirdround match against chris woodruff but moya , who entertained visions of agassi s straightset demise once he had gone up , 64 , 41 , dribbled his shot into the net in the quarterfinals , agassi faces another , albeit older , claycourt war horse in 31yearold marcelo filippini , the ailing \( he has a stomach strain and a virus \) uruguayan qualifier filippini upended the ailing \( he has a sore toe \) greg rusedski , the no 12seeded player from britain , 76 \( 108 \) , 63 , 64 agassi has n't reached a grand slam quarterfinal since the 1996 united states open filippini has never reached one he s a guy that i never played , agassi said i'm kind of dealing with the same situation that i had today , as well as venus had but i 've been watching him , and brad will give me two earfuls about it he was referring to his voluble coach , brad gilbert williams , who had n't lost this early in a grand slam event since making a firstround exit from wimbledon in 1997 , held and surrendered 3 match points when schwartz served at 56 of the second set williams could n't protect a 54 lead in the tie breaker , and dragged herself through the final set as if her sneakers had sprouted roots in the clay i really did n't know who exactly i was playing , williams said i just have to do my best in the next grand slam this one is not mine nor will it belong to jennifer capriati

asbury park summer and winter are different here only because of the weather the ocean breeze blows across an empty boardwalk and right through the spectral hulk that was supposed to become a condominium building the streets off ocean avenue are lined with parking meters that rarely see a car , in january or in august and in winter as in summer , asbury park residents line up at city council meetings to plead for attention to the oceanfront blocks that many compare with beirut they have been devastated for 15 years , ever since the city made a deal with a developer who bought up acres , bought out businesses and then went bankrupt a failure that had a shriveling effect on the rest of the city , too at the last meeting , thomas hayes , president of the chamber of commerce , given two minutes to speak like everybody else , told the five council members just this past week i talked to several businesses who said , 'we ca n't hang in anymore' we need an answer from the council people the question , asked over and over in asbury park , is why did the council turn down an offer from the state to set up a redevelopment authority that would extricate the city from its tortured dealings with the developer , pay his 7 million in back taxes and get started again \? the council s 3to2 vote last fall against opening discussions with the state was especially frustrating to the residents who have staked their futures on the handsome old houses and small businesses here they had been looking to an infusion of capital it will take hundreds of millions of dollars just to rebuild the redevelopment zone in the city that was once a magic kingdom resort with manicured lakes , elegant hotels and a milelong carnival of a boardwalk there were 200 hotels in 1938 , and now there is one , the berkeley carteret , whose grand front entrance is nevertheless locked night and day except for a roller rink with a few video games , the amusements have vanished the stone pony nightclub closed in september and while real estate prices keep climbing along the jersey shore , the tax base the total value of taxable property in asbury has shrunk each year since 1993 innumerable hopes for revival have come to grief in local politics scarred by racial resentments , disruptions in city government and feuds that are too intricate to chronicle residents of all political stripes refer to sinister absentee landlords and developers' back pockets , though for all the criminal indictments of public officials over the last decade , none has shown corruption linked to the redevelopment mess it is hardly clear what anyone has to gain from years of delay in development eugene m lavergne , a lawyer who moved his office to asbury several years ago because i think it has a future , said everything s always been for sale in the city what s enraging and ironic is that they 're buying the town to keep it down the city government s resistance to state help is even more puzzling to outsiders i 've kind of walked away , said state senator john o bennett of little silver , who was asbury park s city attorney for eight months in 1997 and 1998 i do n't know what else you can do for a city this is the absolute best chance for the city i ca n't understand why it does n't happen is what they have now better \? if not the state , why not \? william e best , the executive director of the new jersey redevelopment authority , acknowledged a degree of dismay at the council s vote , taken a few weeks after he addressed a standingroomonly meeting where dozens of speakers cheered on the state s proposal we 've said time and time again that it was our intent to work with the city as the plan was being modified , mr best said we want not only to work with the city but with community support but the council members who opposed the plan reply that they are hamstrung by litigation with the original developer , joseph carabetta , and are close to a settlement that would transfer control of the redevelopment zone to the city or another developer finally , they say , they cannot accept the state s proposed local redevelopment authority , which would have a majority of members appointed by the state they want a majority on the board , said mayor kenneth saunders , one of the three council members who opposes the plan no this is our town , and we should have a majority in the meantime , mr saunders said , i 've got some other things going , and i hope to be able to make a big announcement over the next few weeks we 've had 17 years of going back and forth , and we 're closer than we 've ever been those other things are settlement talks with mr carabetta as well as other prospective developers mr carabetta , whose offices are in meriden , conn , declined to answer any questions for this article , and city officials say they cannot estimate his total investment in the project but one group of investors interested in taking over the project reached an agreement with mr carabetta last summer to pay more than 16 million of the developer s debts this group was rejected by the city council because it could not guarantee financing for the construction
atlanta , oct 13 kenny rogers could only wait , pounding the ball mindlessly into his glove , as the pitching coach dave wallace and mike piazza converged on the mound the agony of that moment was achingly familiar for rogers , whose long , ugly postseason history had just taken on a miserable new addition the pitcher who was vilified as a yankee for three horrible postseason starts in 1996 , who had lost to the arizona diamondbacks in the division series last week in his only other playoff start , turned away as the second home run he had yielded to the braves in the space of five sixthinning pitches sailed over the wall rogers stared at the backstop and into the deep , 02 hole into which the mets' league championship fortunes would sink with a 43 loss the fourofsevengame series moves to shea stadium for three games , starting friday night , but bobby valentine s reaction to eddie perez s home run which gave the braves a 42 lead told the story of how this series , how this season , has gone when the mets come up against the braves he ripped off his cap in disgust and threw it to the ground the mets have now lost 11 of 14 games to the braves this season seven out of eight in the last three weeks their continuing futility at the plate \( john olerud , mike piazza and robin ventura are 1 for 21 in this series and 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position \) is swallowing their hopes of making it to the world series as surely as the two home runs rogers gave up an hour later , valentine admitted he regretted leaving his starter in the game , though rogers lasted longer than he ever had in the postseason and was pitching a shutout until the sixth i had no reason to keep him in , valentine said i left him in and it was absolutely the wrong move rogers had gone 51 with a 400 earned run average since coming from oakland in a pretrade deadline deal but his postseason struggles are the stuff of legend , or perhaps a horror movie with the yankees in 1996 , he went 00 with a 1414 era in three postseason starts one of them in atlanta in the world series his longest outing then was just three innings last week , rogers managed to make it into the fifth against arizona , but he took the mets' only loss of the division series it s history , rogers said every game is over i do n't look back on years' past postseasons i do n't think that s a good barometer these two starts could have been better , but i do n't think i pitched badly it will come sooner or later but today , there was only more disappointment despite the 20 lead the mets had given him with a roger cedeno single that scored robin ventura in the second , and a melvin mora solo home run in the fifth , rogers had not pitched terribly well two pickoffs and two double plays erased four of the eight base runners he allowed in the first five innings but in the sixth inning , with one out , rogers began to unravel he walked chipper jones on a full count then , on a 10 pitch , he threw a changeup outside to brian jordan jordan had killed the mets during the regular season , batting 359 with 3 home runs , 3 triples and 13 runs batted in , and he had been even hotter against houston last week , driving in eight runs in four games rogers was shocked when jordan sent the pitch , which he thought was a good one , to the opposite field , where it ticked off the foul screen for a tworun home run that tied the score i did n't think he had taken an oppositefield swing , rogers said hitters are a lot better than in the past they 're stronger you ca n't make a mistake because they can take any pitch out of the park the next batter was andruw jones , who had already singled twice off rogers but against turk wendell , who would have been the reliever , he was 0 for 9 with three strikeouts in his career surely , valentine would bring in wendell but he did not , and it is that decision that cost the mets the game i'm sure he wishes he had pulled me , rogers said me , too rogers threw the only mistake he thought he made , a twoseam fastball that jones slapped for a single to left again , rogers remained in the game , to face perez , the catcher who had smacked a home run in game 1 rogers decided his first pitch would be a sinker i did n't have great movement on the pitch , rogers said it just was n't as good as i wanted i 'd throw it again valentine probably wishes he would n't perez smashed the pitch to left field and the home run gave the braves a 42 lead finally , valentine took rogers out and wendell got out of the inning but the braves starter kevin millwood , who took the victory , had grown stronger with each inning he retired the mets in order in the seventh before the mets had their final gasp in the eighth with one out , mora , who had come into the game to replace a fluridden rickey henderson , reached first on a fielding error by chipper jones edgardo alfonzo , who was 2 for 4 today , doubled to center to score mora but then atlanta manager bobby cox called on the closer john rocker , who saved game 1 and the three games of atlanta s lateseason sweep over the mets at turner field rocker exploited the mets' failures at the plate he struck out olerud , the bat flying out of his hands on the final swing after intentionally walking piazza , rocker struck out ventura , who is hampered by a mildly strained right shoulder the mets did n't even get an opportunity in the ninth cox replaced rocker with john smoltz , who is scheduled to start game 4 and who had never made a major league relief appearance before the mets went from facing a fireballer in rocker to a sidearmer in smoltz good luck pinchhitter shawon dunston popped up , and cedeno grounded out up came bobby bonilla , batting for rey ordonez bonilla had just five pinch hits all season and none in the postseason he took three strikes , looking appalled at each one , without ever moving his bat bonilla complained later about the calls , but it hardly mattered the mets are back to where they were two weeks ago , reeling and searching for a way to save themselves once again , there is little room for error we 've had our backs against the wall , ventura said we 've been there for two weeks it feels normal to us you learn until you 're dead , you 're still alive nothing is over yet , but you better start winning some , because we 're running out of games

todd martin was the quiet kid in allwhites flailing away on the remote courts of the national tennis center as a junior player when andre agassi was bleaching his long locks and foiling tradition with his audacious denim shorts in 1988 eleven years later , the tagalong american who has always stood in line for recognition behind the likes of pete sampras and jim courier , michael chang and agassi , has been nudged from the background with the help of karma , desire and an intravenous drip now martin , the destined one , will test his staraligned tour against agassi , the chosen one , as the sole survivors of a united states open men s draw that was diluted after injuries to sampras and patrick rafter in the end , the two 29yearolds one balding and the other graying outlasted the stylish games of their opponents yesterday on their way to the first allamerican final since sampras and chang met in 1996 the conditions were just right for it under a blue sky yesterday , the secondseeded agassi , labeled a sure thing to land in the finals , fulfilled the fixes of the andre junkies that were stirring in arthur ashe stadium by dusting off his serve and measuring the wind in time to pry the men s no 1 ranking away from the listless thirdseeded yevgeny kafelnikov , 16 , 63 , 63 , 63 i mean , this time of my life , it s the best i 've ever played , said agassi , who has lost just four matches three to sampras since his french open title in june over the last dozen days , martin did more than was asked as he showed it s never too late to reveal your identity to an american public eager to embrace miracle workers fitting this description , martin extended himself through sickness and in health this week to secure his place in the final with a meticulous dismantling of the frenchman cedric pioline , 64 , 61 , 62 for the first time in a week , martin looked as crisp as a drycleaned shirt compared to the greenish hue he had had during his last two matches , performances that were fortified by a buffet of intravenous fluids and the chanting crowds finally , he looked healthy , as if the cool , breezy air agreed with him in the face of the stylish but perpetually angstridden pioline i woke up this morning and felt fresh , martin said i was a little nervous that i might not be able to play as well on a full tank as i did on a half he was even better on this day , his usual grit overcame grace as martin snapped back returns and pulled winners out of a holster with the kind of consistency that left pioline crestfallen at one point , as his backhand floated long on martin s set point to close the second , pioline flipped his racquet into the air , missed the catch and knocked himself in the head this was not going to be his day to make his third grand slam final , it was martin s moment to gain his second since his appearance in the 1994 australian open final , martin has faded in and out as a threat on the men s tour because of nagging injuries that seemed to sabotage his every rise in the ranking in 1996 , he finished the year ranked 12th a year later , after an elbow injury that delayed his tennis for six months , his ranking had plummeted to 81 there were a few moments that i wondered if i 'd play again , martin said those thoughts stuck with me for another six months to a year instead of sharpening his bingo skills , martin decided it was not time to retire , but the moment to seize a chance that was obvious during his fourthround match here with greg rusedski , when martin was nearly undone by a stomach virus down two sets to none , he was watching his adversary serve for the match somehow , martin survived in a fiveset match that left him so physically drained that he was splayed in the training room for two hours afterward receiving fluids through a tube no matter , he survived the quarterfinals and made quicker work of pioline in the semis i 've never seen him play like this , said pioline , who watched 14 aces by martin pass in a blur i think he has a good chance does he \? agassi is before him , standing as the big favorite with sampras out of his way when pete pulled out , i wanted to play the best player on the other side of the draw , and it s todd martin , agassi said he s done some incredible things to get here it s been great watching it it s easier going to bed thinking about todd martin than pete you still have a job to do and the job can be brutally difficult if you do n't take care of the things that you need to execute it would seem that agassi could take care of martin once agassi found his serve after dropping his first set against kafelnikov , his game fell into place while his opponent s fell apart amid errors that sapped the drama from the match for the top ranking in the world given agassi s dominance , it would seem as if martin will only be background scenery for agassi s fifth grand slam title for years , this has been martin s position among the americans , in the background , far removed from the hype my peers are mostly guys who could have or did turn pro before they left , before they were finished high school , said martin , who turned pro before his junior year at northwestern gee , you know , in comparison to those guys , i had absolutely no fathomable chance of being at a level anywhere near high enough to do this these guys competed for grand slam titles 10 years ago yeah , i'm a late bloomer but as you see , all those guys are still playing on a very high level now they age just as quickly as i do it just does n't show photos todd martin played in the 1994 australian final he lost to pete sampras today , he hopes to beat andre agassi in the us open final in a surprise , andre agassi won the us open in 1994 this afternoon , he 'll be the overwhelming favorite \( photographs by chang w lee the new york times \)
budelsdorf , germany it is not hard to understand why gerhard schmid has gotten under the skin of deutsche telekom it was bad enough that mr schmid lured away nearly 10 percent of the german telephone giant s longdistance business in just the first year of open competition it was even more grating that he did it on a shoestring budget , mostly with phone lines he leased from telekom itself but what really drove telekom crazy was his advertising cheek when mr schmid ran ads that looked exactly as if they had come from telekom , the company once a stateowned monopoly fired back with fullpage ads of its own announcing a trap ! and when mr schmid mailed fliers promising to put your phone bill on a diet , telekom lawyers obtained court orders to block him , arguing that not all his prices were lower than telekom s yet none of that has stopped mr schmid , 46 , from becoming an overnight billionaire as founder of mobilcom , based in this remote hamlet in the far northern state of schleswigholstein , mr schmid has roared out of nowhere , turning his company into the secondlargest longdistance carrier in europe s biggest and most bruising telephone market longdistance prices have plunged by as much as 70 percent , and new price wars are breaking out in internetaccess service deutsche telekom , analysts estimate , has already lost about 30 percent of its longdistance market and may lose more this year goldman , sachs , which managed part of deutsche telekom s initial public stock offering two years ago , summed up the turmoil in a recent report what is going on in germany \? and what s happening in germany is also happening , to a lesser degree , elsewhere in europe fourteen months after the european union ordered all 15 member countries to open their telephone markets , competition is flaring up from austria to spain some of the new competitors are huge consortiums , often led by power companies and railroads some of them are upstarts like mobilcom that lease lines at volume discounts and resell service to customers at cutrate prices in italy , olivetti added a new twist this week by starting a hostile takeover attempt of the national telephone company , telecom italia olivetti owns italy s secondbiggest cellular service as well as infostrada , the leading competitor in fixedline phone service market place , page c6 but the sudden shock has been greatest in germany no other country has seen a market share loss like the one we 've seen in germany , said chris hohre , analyst at hsbc securities in london to be fair , the government has not made life easy for telekom but the bigger problem is its own cost basis its costs are still very high the tide may be shifting alarmed by deutsche telekom s decline last year , german regulators softened their relentlessly hard stance and set new rules this month that will make it more expensive for rivals to enter the local telephone market just as important , deutsche telekom has shot back at its rivals with drastic price cuts at the start of the year , it slashed most of its longdistance rates by more than 50 percent the price of a daytime call on weekdays , for example , dropped from 56 pfennigs , or about 31 cents , to 24 pfennigs a minute earlier this month , telekom announced plans to cut rates again in march or april indeed , deutsche telekom s stock has soared by about 50 percent since the new year , partly on expectations that the worst may be over shares of other former monopolies , among them france telecom and telecom italia , have climbed sharply as well but that s nothing compared with what happened to mobilcom , whose stock market value climbed tenfold from early 1998 to early 1999 , peaking at more than 4 billion before retreating somewhat recently that move reflects a quadrupling of its sales last year to 14 billion marks , or 820 million , and a ninefold increase in profits to 147 million mr schmid owns 60 percent of the stock across the rest of europe , the impact of new competition varies considerably some countries , like britain and finland , have had open telecom markets for several years in others , like spain and italy , government regulators have made life tougher for newcomers and slowed the change in the netherlands , austria and germany , competition has been brutal some of the old monopolies prepared for competition much better than others france telecom , for example , has lost only about 4 percent of its longdistance market , while its sales and profits have both climbed sharply the main difference is that france telecom bit the bullet early , said victoria granger , a telecommunications analyst at merrill lynch they imposed some really heavy tariff cuts and they spent a huge amount of money building a brand name before liberalization deutsche telekom also cut its prices ahead of competition , but its prices at the beginning of 1998 were still twice as high as those in neighboring countries according to data compiled by phillips tarifica ltd , a londonbased publisher of industry newsletters , a threeminute longdistance call during business hours then cost 87 cents in germany , 47 cents in france and only 29 cents in finland

on the seesaw that is political life in new york , the rev al sharpton was up last march , and mayor rudolph w giuliani was down mr sharpton was leading demonstrations and a civil disobedience campaign to protest the police shooting of amadou diallo mr giuliani was on the defensive but last week , the appellate division of state supreme court ruled that the trial of the four officers charged with seconddegree murder in mr diallo s death should be moved from the bronx to albany , specifically citing the demonstrations and more than 1 , 000 arrests that accompanied them in embracing the decision , mr giuliani did not mention mr sharpton by name , but there was no question where his finger was pointing what happened is , there was a concerted effort on the part of numerous people to make it impossible to have a fair trial in new york , the mayor said yesterday when you start marching , demanding that people be indicted you get out in front of courthouses and demand that people be indicted , that s like the old west i mean the reality is that the judge , the judges , five judges unanimously decided that , rendered a very , very wise decision mr sharpton , of course , rejected the implication that his strategy had backfired none of the orchestrated arrests had taken place in the bronx , he said , and the demonstrations had stopped after the indictments but the court s decision , by five appointees of gov george e pataki , did more than just move the trial it validated mr giuliani s worldview , whether of the protesters or what he considered biased news media coverage it also moved a potentially troublesome trial from new york city to a conservative county where further protests are only likely to burnish mr giuliani s reputation as a tough sheriff david meyer , an associate professor of sociology at the university of california at irvine , who observed the diallo protests while teaching at city college , said there s a political angle protecting giuliani if demonstrators are in the street every day talking about police brutality during a trial in the bronx , he said , it s something he has to respond to every day in an election year so inevitably , perhaps , some saw a decision intended to remove the case from politics as being steeped in it norman siegel , the executive director of the new york civil liberties union , pointed out that in the abner louima case , in which thousands marched over the brooklyn bridge in protest , the judge , eugene m nickerson , said he would keep looking for jurors until he found an impartial jury in the diallo case , the appellate division said any attempt to impanel a jury would be fruitless the difference , mr siegel asserted , is the judiciary federal judges like judge nickerson are appointed for life , and thus are independent of any political influence in the state court system , judges are appointed by politically elected officials and must be reappointed the judges are very ambitious , he said in the middle level of the court system any good judge who s not near retirement is thinking in the back of their mind , would n't it be nice to be on the new york court of appeals \? deliberately or not , mr siegel said , the decision also meant that five white male judges were removing the case from the jurisdiction of a black woman , justice patricia anne williams of state supreme court , who was scheduled to preside over the case in the bronx i am hearing in the last 48 hours that at least the result , if not the intention , was to take her out , mr siegel said you do n't want to have that as the backdrop to a potentially polarizing and racially charged trial this gives material to people who do n't believe in the legal system or want to undermine the legal system g michael bellinger , a former prosecutor now in private law practice , agreed mr bellinger , who is black , spent yesterday researching similar decisions , he said last night , and concluded that no black criminal defendant had had his or her trial moved before a judge had even tried to impanel an impartial jury cops in the bronx usually opt for a bench trial , he said we know the judge in this case is black , and it just so happens that the appellate court rushes in and saves them would the man accused of attacking nicole barrett with a brick be granted a change of venue at a similar stage in his legal proceedings , he asked , noting the torrent of news coverage that case had received \? steven zeidman , the executive director for the fund for the modern courts , agreed that with africanamerican defendants , those motions are made and denied in a heartbeat but , he said , that did not mean it was wrong to move the diallo case rather , it meant that too few previous cases had been granted a change of venue it makes sense under the law , he said of the decision , but i think people rightly look at it and say why this case as opposed to all the others but while he defended the decision if not the choice of albany he said he was worried that it could have a chilling effect on community activity will this case be used as a bellwether from now on in a criminal case if there is a hue and cry in public is that going to prevent people protesting \? but fred siegel , a history professor at cooper union , defended the court s response to the protests , although he , too , wondered , why albany \? in trying to use protest to influence judicial proceedings , professor siegel contended , mr sharpton had brought southern politics north if you are looking at the south of 40 years ago , he said , this is the kind of thing that liberals are supposed to be opposed to that mobs could sway the courts
mount vernon , va he is the other president with a problem i know that he was one of the first presidents , lon beard , 10 , said of george washington during a visit to his 18thcentury estate here lon s sister , coral krebs , 28 , added , he s on the dollar bill posterity is a rough game after more than 200 years in the public eye , george washington has been boiled down to a fact and change for a five but the first president has his firstever media and marketing team and 1999 is a campaign year the year washington goes for the hearts of his countrymen troubled by stagnating attendance and a rocky recognition factor , especially among schoolchildren , the directors of mount vernon , the capital of george washington s legacy , have inaugurated a 3 million public relations campaign to reposition him as a national figure with what the spinmasters might call heat think leonardo dicaprio , diana and elvis presley we were looking for something with a lot of sizzle , said michael quinn , one of washington s campaign people , the deputy director for programs at mount vernon he had great name recognition , but not a real high quotient of excitement dull , boring he was the first president of course so what \? their strategy is only in 1999 , the name for a yearlong campaign of celebration in connection with the bicentennial of washington s death on dec 14 , 1799 mount vernon s advance guard has sent 2 , 000 acidgreen press kits and contacted 50 , 000 communities to encourage festivities from planting trees to tolling bells two new web sites and three new books , including his diaries , will also help to establish washington as first guy architect , environmentalist , entrepreneur , fashion plate , both flawed and fascinating robert redford wants to make the movie washington is already on the road with a blockbuster show , treasures from mount vernon , parked at the newyork historical society until feb 22 his ivory teeth , if not his smile , have been a great photo op on feb 15 , presidents' day , the day he must share with lincoln , he will be reintroduced at his home by the potomac river mount vernon has added a museum and refurnished the mansion with 100 objects owned by washington a new death and funeral procession tour will provide black armbands for visitors the master bedroom will be set up as the death scene , complete with bloodletting equipment used by physicians who tried to save him from his sudden cold nearly a third of his blood was drained , said sally mcdonough , manager of media relations at mount vernon that took us two days to figure out there was discussion of piping in bad smells , but consideration of the idea was put on hold because staff historians could not agree on what would be authentic to the period the celebration will be capped by a televised 18thcentury state funeral on dec 18 we 're going to try to make it feel like the diana funeral , said melissa groppel , manager of special events , who is handling the handcrafted coffin and costumed cortege washington s makeover comes not a sound bite too soon annual attendance at mount vernon is far below its peak of 13 million visitors , which was reached more than three decades ago in a 1991 gallup poll , the last one that asked people whom they considered the three greatest presidents , washington s name came up in only 21 percent of the responses , far behind abraham lincoln , john f kennedy and franklin d roosevelt clearly every indication is that he s on a downward slide , said james rees , the resident director of mount vernon even washington s appearance on the dollar bill , mr rees said , is a mixed blessing it s the wrong image , he said the family never liked that gilbert stuart portrait it shows him as a grubby old man three years ago , the mount vernon ladies' association , which for 141 years has owned and operated mount vernon as a nonprofit historic site , decided that it had to dust off the president we know we 've got a great product , said claire edwards , an association member from connecticut this is somebody more than the guy who sells cars on presidents' day the image campaign , including a nose job to the famous jean antoine houdon bust , refining its profile , is a war george washington cannot afford to lose mount vernon needs to increase its attendance by 10 percent to cover its bicentennial costs behind its security gates , the neoclassical mansion , in stark fields that overlook the river , is like a white house in exile in late january , a squadron of geese threaded the sky above it wild turkeys crossed the driveway of the brick colonialstyle administrative buildings it was a brilliant blue day to meet the president s generals upstairs , in what used to be the ladies' association s dormered bedrooms , is the war office for washington s campaign team in a nearby 1 million , 23 , 000squarefoot center , 375 volunteers will be manning tollfree telephone lines to answer requests for bicentennial materials in his office , mr rees recalls the results of focus groups commissioned by mount vernon in 1992 they often floated back to jefferson , as being so creative , interesting , he said referring to the 1995 movie jefferson in paris and a 1997 television biography produced by ken burns , mr rees said , i think he s got better pr
taverny , france nicolas dombroski , an 18yearold mathematics student , was not happy at having to spend his whole saturday at the french air force base here learning about what soldiers do it s a waste of time , he said of the movies and lectures that filled the morning and the afternoon i did n't even listen one reason that mr dombroski did not have to pay attention was the fortunate timing of his birth as europe strives to build nimbler , lighter armies , france is among the nations that have dropped conscription mr dombroski and the 40 other young men at the air force base had only to be informed about the army before departing again , with hair still long , and , in some cases , body jewelry still attached french men born after jan 1 , 1980 , no longer face an obligatory 10 months in the army like britain and the united states before it , france plans to have an allvolunteer armed force by 2002 spurred first by postcoldwar cuts in defense spending and more recently by superior american technological and logistical performance in the nato air war over kosovo last spring , europe wants more agile , better equipped armed forces conscriptionbased armies , heavy with tanks and artillery designed to defend against invasion , are becoming a thing of the past , with spain and perhaps italy set to follow the french example soon , among the big western european countries in nato , only germany will continue the draft mindful of the german militarism that caused two world wars this century , germany still views conscription as an instrument of democratic civilian control over the military as the americans and , for two centuries , the french did before it but now many european military planners and commanders see the draft as an obstacle to the slimmeddown , technologically advanced , rapidly deployable forces that the allies are trying to build to deal with trouble spots far from home the main mission that nato is planning for in the 21st century the 20th century mission was territorial defense but the last threat of outside invasion vanished with the soviet union , and that has changed everything for allied armies marianne , the french version of uncle sam , still wants you all right , but only for a day and military recruiters hope you remember the day fondly enough to come back as a volunteer if i did n't have a diploma , i 'd think of volunteering , said louis gautron , a 19yearold economics student who got his baccalaureat last year , entitling him to go to a university i had no idea how many job skills you could learn in the army he spoke midway through the call for defense preparation day that was held here and at 247 other sites around the country on oct 9 there have been 58 of these days since the first one a year ago not all are on weekends , and none are held in the vacation months of july and august starting next april , young french women will also be required to come spend a day learning at least a little about the military in the first year , 514 , 664 young men heard what the army had to say in these sessions , which also involve a test of reading comprehension roughly a third of them , according to french military surveys , would be interested in coming back at least once to learn more military recruiters hope these sessions will make it easier to fill their volunteer quotas the slimmeddown french armed forces of 2002 will still need 357 , 183 people in uniform 259 , 299 if the members of the gendarmerie , a national police force under the ministry of defense , are not counted there were 500 , 000 people in the french military in early 1996 , when president jacques chirac announced the new plan we 've been reducing by roughly 30 , 000 draftees a year , defense minister alain richard , a member of the socialist government that inherited the plan in 1997 from mr chirac s gaullists , told local elected officials at taverny the air base , at the edge of a suburb northwest of paris , has no airplanes but a large underground command center in a bunker the local mayor had a question for mr richard familiar to any american secretary of defense is the base at taverny going to be kept open after the transition \? mr richard smiled i do n't know what my successor 20 years from now will do , he answered , but for the foreseeable future , i want to keep all large installations near big cities open , because we 'd need them if we had to build our forces up again some day britain and the united states believe that their allvolunteer forces contain units that are more easily mobilized and sent on expeditions like the natoled peacekeeping missions in bosnia and kosovo the reliance on conscripts meant that some continental european countries took far too long to get their forces on the move for kosovo , french military officials believe the british and the french are the only countries in europe that have readily deployable forces , mr richard said with changes in the structure of its armed forces , germany , too , might have them in 10 years , he said but some countries took two months to send troops to kosovo , he added , referring to some smaller nato allies european defense ministries were shocked by their own slow and cumbersome reaction and by technological gaps with the united states that the war over kosovo revealed
they have been declared a team for the ages by many of the coaches whose teams were destroyed by them in the regular season , and they have put up the kind of numbers that inspire the untouchable status they take into the national collegiate athletic association tournament that begins today with 16 games the duke blue devils are 321 , average 93 points a game , the most in the country , and have beaten opponents by an average of more than 25 points another national best but that does not guarantee them a championship , as their coach , mike krzyzewski , acknowledges especially in the oneandyourdone format that is high on emotion and low on historic precedent of the last 16 teams to come into the tournament with one loss or less , only three reached the final four unlv in 1987 and '91 , and massachusetts in '96 none of them reached the title game we can be beaten by anybody , krzyzewski said i truly believe that , because if i'm the other guy coaching the other team , i believe i'm going to beat duke one team has beaten the blue devils this year , while another has come tantalizingly close the cincinnati bearcats defeated duke , 7775 , in the finals of the great alaska shootout last november , and their coach , bob huggins , said that any team hoping to beat the blue devils will have to play the game of its life st john s mike jarvis , whose team lost to duke , 9288 , in overtime at madison square garden in january , said a team that hopes to beat duke must also believe it can win both of those games revealed pieces of the blueprint for beating duke , and the tournament brackets are embedded with teams that can follow it they do n't have any weaknesses , huggins said the guy sitting on their bench knows what he s doing they have nine mcdonald s allamericans i guess mike did n't want a 10th they play extraordinary defense that does n't give you anything maybe they do n't have a 611 shot blocker , but they got a couple of 68 guys who do n't let you close to the basket everything you do has to be right in their victory in alaska , the first and foremost thing the bearcats did right was shoot the ball well guard melvin levett scored 25 points , and as a team cincinnati shot 55 percent the red storm struggled in its shooting against the blue devils , making only 38 percent of its shots , but bootsy thornton s 40 points including seven 3pointers compensated for the low percentage what kept st john s in the game was the way it battled duke s pressure defense with its own , which is what any upsetminded tournament team will have to do the blue devils force an average of 192 turnovers a game but the red storm pressured duke into 23 turnovers seven of them by the blue devils' point guard william avery , four each by trajan langdon , chris carrawell and shane battier in the meantime , st john s took care of the ball , coughing it up only 15 times there is no consensus on how to play duke s 6foot8inch allamerican elton brand , whose intricate footwork and soft touch down low give him polish to complement his determination to score cincinnati leaned on him with the 69 , 255pound ryan fletcher and let its shot blocker , kenyon martin , roam behind him st john s blanketed the entire floor and forced brand s teammates to make mistakes in both games , brand showed that he could be frustrated against cincinnati , he got only nine shot attempts he had 16 points , 12 rebounds and 7 blocked shots against st john s , but fouled out at the end of regulation perhaps the most important factor for an upsetminded team is the belief that it can win there are several squads in the tournament that are not only deep and defensiveminded , but fit that psychological profile the most prominent is cincinnati , which , as the no 3 seed in the east , could meet the blue devils in the regional finals next weekend at the meadowlands the guys started smiling a little bit around the room when we saw that potential matchup , said levett , who slammed home the gamewinner in alaska of course , you want to go out and prove to everybody that the first time was for real if the day ever comes , we 'll be ready the miami hurricanes also have proved that they are hardnosed and poised enough to outlast very good teams they swept st john s in the regular season , beat uconn on the road and likely will play cincinnati in the east regional semifinals in the midwest region , two teams that could test the blue devils are kentucky and arizona both sets of wildcats are championship seasoned kentucky s wayne turner leads

washington , jan 20 following are excerpts from the presentation today by gregory b craig , white house special counsel , on accusations of perjury in article i in the senate impeachment trial of president clinton \( today s excerpts were recorded by the federal news service , a private transcription agency \) i plan to divide my presentation into three parts first , to tell you how really bad this article is , legally , structurally , and constitutionally , and to argue that it falls well below the most basic minimal standards and should not be used to impeach and remove this president or any president from office second , to address the various allegations directly and third , to give you a few larger thoughts in response to some of the arguments from last week at the conclusion , you will have had much more than 100 percent of your minimum daily requirements for lawyering , for which i apologize article i accuses the president of having given perjurious , false and misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of four different subject areas first , when he testified about the nature and details of his relationship with ms lewinsky second , when he testified about his testimony in the jones deposition third , when he testified about what happened during the jones deposition when the president s lawyer , robert bennett , made certain representations about monica lewinsky s affidavit and fourth , when he testified about alleged efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and impede the discovery of evidence it is noteworthy that the second and third subject areas are attempts to revisit the president s deposition testimony in the jones case there was an article that was proposed alleging that the president also committed perjury in the jones case , in the jones deposition that article was rejected by the house of representatives , and there were very many good reasons for the house to take that action those allegations have been dismissed , and you must not allow the managers to revive them last week they tried to do that the managers mixed up and merged two sets of issues allegations of perjury in the grand jury and allegations of perjury in the jones case these are very different matters , and i think the result was confusing and also unfair to the president you will notice that the third and the fourth subject areas correspond to , coincide and overlap with many of the allegations of obstruction of justice in article ii this represents a kind of double charging that you might be familiar with if you 've either been a prosecutor or a defense lawyer one , the defendant is charged for the core offense secondly , the defendant is charged for denying the core offense under oath this gives the managers two bites at the apple , and it s a dubious prosecutorial practice that is frowned upon by most courts the upshot though , is this with respect to subparts three and four of this first article , if you conclude , as i trust you will , that the evidence that the president engaged in obstruction of justice is insufficient to support that charge , it would follow logically that the president s denial that he engaged in any such activity would be respected , and he would be acquitted on the perjury charge simply put , if the president did n't obstruct justice , he did n't commit perjury when he denied it an article s omissions but the most striking thing about article i is what it does not say it alleges perjury generally , but it does not allege a single perjurious statement specifically the majority drafted the article this way despite pleas from other members of the committee and from counsel for the president that the article take care to be precise when it makes its allegations such specificity , as many of you know , is the standard practice of federal prosecutors all across america and that is the practice recommended by the department of justice in the manual distributed to united states attorneys , who enforce the criminal code in federal courts throughout the nation take a look at the standard form it s exhibit 5 in the collection that we have handed you this is given to federal prosecutors this is the model that they are told to use to allege perjury in a criminal indictment in federal court now , there is a very simple reason why prosecutors identify the specific quotation that is alleged to be perjury and why it is included in a perjury indictment if they do n't quote the specific statement that s alleged to be perjurious , courts will dismiss the indictment , concluding that the charge of perjury is too vague and the defendant is not able to determine what precisely he is being charged with the requirement that a defendant be given adequate notice of what he is charged with carries constitutional dimensions , and the failure to provide that notice violates due process of law this is something that applies to all criminal offenses when they are charged , and you can understand why that kind of notice is required imagine a robbery indictment that failed to indicate who or what was robbed and what property was stolen how could you possibly defend against the charge that you just stole something , but you do n't know what it is , and it s nothing specific \? imagine a murder indictment without identifying a victim \?
paris in the end , it was all about leaving paris with no regrets when the red dust settled at a tumultuous french open that breathed new life into several stunted careers and served as a turning point for several others , a pair of 29yearold champions dusted off their reputations , removed the former from their resumes and reasserted themselves as forces to be reckoned with at this and every grand slam event andre agassi , after riffing through his career like a jazz musician , all improvisation and unpredictability , made history as he exorcised the roland garros demons that have haunted him since he faltered in the 1990 and 1991 finals with his galvanizing 16 , 26 , 64 , 63 , 64 comeback in the final against andrei medvedev on sunday , agassi became the fifth man to have won all four grand slam titles in a career he joined rod laver , don budge , fred perry and roy emerson the men who completed a true grand slam , all four titles in one calendar year , were budge in 1938 and laver in 1962 and 1969 after a decade of mercurial results , suddenly the las vegan was defining tradition , not defying it he put a lot of ghosts to rest this really cements something , brad gilbert , agassi s coach of five years , said a lot of people say andre ca n't win from twosetstonone down , ca n't win a fiveset match , can never win on clay but andre s got the most godgiven talent i 've ever seen sometimes you expect the most from him and he gives you the least sometimes he can reach back and grab some magic like nobody what agassi grabbed on sunday was his fourth career grand slam title the 1992 wimbledon , the 1994 united states open while unseeded and the 1995 australian open are the others plus confirmation that his current fitness and focus campaign has been worth his while it s been a big obstacle for me psychologically and emotionally , agassi said this being the last of the slams , me being ranked 140 a couple years ago , believing that if i just try hard enough some good things are waiting for me the french open s new women s champion , steffi graf , returned to the grand slam winner s circle for the first time since the 1996 united states open in a wildly unconventional final against topranked martina hingis on saturday , graf ignored her aching back and her opponents' astonishingly unsportsmanlike tantrums and secured her sixth french open championship with a 46 , 75 , 62 comeback graf became the first women to defeat the topthree seeded players at the same event as she won her 22d grand slam title , two short of margaret court s record \( 24 \) graf , apparently flirting with the notion of retirement after this season , announced that she would not return to roland garros next year to defend her title , dropping a bombshell that left even her longtime coach , heinz gunthardt , in the dark i told her a week before the tournament began that she had nothing to prove to anyone , did n't need to listen to anyone telling her where or what she should play , said gunthardt , who called his player s paris revival fairy tale stuff but the german star , who turns 30 next week , made it clear she would tackle wimbledon , her favorite tourney and the one that has earned her seven titles , with all the conviction she lacked at the start of her french open it came out of nowhere , this one , graf said but it s made me believe in me , and sometimes i 've had problems doing that over the last few years one player who does not lack for selfesteem is the 18yearold hingis , who was so certain she was going to defeat graf that she had already selected a party dress to wear when she posed with her trophy but hingis , who was foiled at the end of the second set as she served for her first french open title , became unhinged midway through the match when she questioned a line call and never regained her equilibrium her decision to stalk over to graf s side of the court to inspect a mark at 64 , 20 of the second set not only cost her a point penalty and then the enmity of 16 , 000 booing and hissing roland garros fans , it later cost her a 1 , 500 fine hingis , who dissolved in angry tears after the defeat , her seventh in nine matches with graf , left the french open with ample regrets graf and agassi left with none , and revalidated themselves to boot it was almost like it was destiny , this tournament for her and in some cases for me , too , agassi said when i won my first grand slam , she was the winner , too but she s won 22 slams , and she s never lost intensity over the years me , i 've taken leaves of absence for years at a time i feel like a spring chicken
blue ash , ohio , sept 3 it began with good friday seven years ago a group of jewish parents here in the sycamore community school district asked why the schools were closed for good friday and not for the jewish high holy days when the school board eventually voted to cancel classes for the high holy days , a group of muslim and hindu parents asked why the schools did not also close for the most holy of their holidays but they got no satisfaction now , in escalation of a fight that portends further growing pains as the nation becomes more religiously diverse , the american civil liberties union is suing the sycamore schools on the ground that they are favoring one religion over others the aclu says the district is giving preference to jewish families , and so violating the first amendment for its part , the district says it closes on the high holy days only to avoid the disruption of high absenteeism the conflict poses a challenge to the standard religious pecking order that has evolved in many american cities and suburbs , where christians are the dominant majority , jews a vocal minority , and those of other faiths so few or unorganized as to be virtually invisible here , parents of various minority religions have asserted their presence by uniting and demanding treatment equal to that of jews holidays for all , or for none if you 're going to give a holiday to the jews , you ought to give holidays to the muslims , to the hindus , to the buddhists , to the sikhs and that is impractical , said zeinab schwen , a muslim parent with three children in sycamore schools if we 're all minorities , we 're all minorities together we should n't have degrees of minority the jewish high holy days bracket a 10day period of introspection and repentance that begins with rosh hashanah , which this year starts this friday at sundown , and ends with yom kippur officials of the sycamore schools , a wellheeled suburban district 15 miles northeast of cincinnati , say they decided to close for those two days only because so many students had been absent on them bruce armstrong , the superintendent , said about 15 percent of the district s students , who number more than 6 , 200 , did not go to school on rosh hashanah or yom kippur before the policy of shutting down then began on major muslim and hindu holidays , he said , only about 6 percent of students are absent , including a 35 percent routine rate of absenteeism across the country , other school districts , including new york city s and some in new jersey and connecticut , also close for the jewish holidays if the reason for the closing is that a high proportion of teachers or students will be absent and cause disruption , then that is fine , said marc d stern , a lawyer with the american jewish congress you do n't have to be a majority , mr stern said you just have to be enough of a minority for your absence to disturb education but he added , i have argued in districts that used to have large numbers of jews and do n't anymore that it makes no sense , nor is it morally right , to close down and leave the other kids with no school , their parents working , and nowhere to go word of the lawsuit has alarmed school superintendents elsewhere , concerned that their districts could also be sued because they too close for the high holy days , aclu officials said i have been explaining to superintendents all over the east side of cleveland that this case is highly factspecific , and it does not mean anyone else is going to be sued , said raymond vasvari , legal director of the aclu of ohio the civil liberties union says the particular history of how the schools came to be closed in the sycamore district is evidence that the reasons were not purely educational or secular after jewish parents first petitioned seven years ago for a high holy days closing , the board appointed a calendar committee to examine the issue but the committee , whose members included rabbis , a protestant minister and parents of various religions , recommended that the schools stay open , because an effort to select some religious days as holidays while ignoring others does not equate to equal treatment or religious sensitivity the schools did stay closed on good friday , because a day off on that holiday had been written into the staff s union contract years earlier the high holy days issue remained a cause among some jewish parents , however so in 1995 the board decided that if absenteeism on a holiday reached a threshold 18 percentage points above the average student absentee rate of about 35 percent , the schools would be closed on that holiday as of the following year in a concession to jewish parents , the board recommended that on the high holy days , teachers not give tests or introduce new material but it did n't work , said mr armstrong , the superintendent the students who did attend were not provided a quality school day , he said , and some parents agree they say their children spent the day in class reading or reviewing even some nonjewish parents started keeping their children home

most golfers are happy to break 100 decent golfers sometimes break 90 good golfers often break 80 touring pros expect to break 70 but only a chosen few break 60 david duval is now among the chosen few in firing a 13underpar 59 to win the bob hope chrysler classic on sunday , duval has created a feature threesome with al geiberger and chip beck , the only others to shoot 59 in a pga tour event geiberger did it in the 1977 memphis classic , beck in 1991 during the las vegas invitational , both on par72 courses as the first to do it , geiberger , a lean californian who ate peanutbutterandjelly sandwiches during a round , was rebaptized mr 59 his business card opened to a miniature replica of his 59 scorecard beck was lucky enough to shoot his 59 when the hilton hotel chain was offering a 1 million bonus to anybody breaking 60 in a pga tour event he also was kind enough to donate 500 , 000 of that bonus to charity but now david duval is not only the new mr 59 , he does n't need a business card his name has replaced tiger woods and mark o'meara on golf s moveable marquee in his last 28 tournaments , duval has won nine , virtually one out of every three in two tournaments this year , he has won both , including the mercedesbenz tournament of champions in hawaii he leads the pga tour money list with more than 1 million , and it s still january in the world ranking , based on a twoyear weighted system , duval is still no 3 , behind woods and o'meara , but he is the world s hottest golfer with four victories last year , he led the pga tour s money list with more than 2 million , but he knows why o'meara was player of the year historically , agreed duval , mark had a better year in golf , history counts more , meaning major titles the masters , the united states open , the british open and the professional golfers association championship duval knows he was leading the masters last year until o'meara birdied the last two holes to win o'meara also won the british open but now duval has shot a 59 to do it , he needed a sixfoot eagle putt on the 18th green and made it to win the tournament the clinching argument that of the three 59 s , his deserves to be ranked as the most impressive to appreciate duval s score , consider that jack nicklaus , arnold palmer , tom watson and greg norman never shot lower than 62 in a tournament not that duval produced the one most impressive round in golf history golf coexists with a theory of relativity that einstein never considered the difficultly of the course , the rough , the bunkers , the speed of the greens , the weather , the wind , and the stature of the tournament as well as the round first , second , third , final considering the burden of trying to win a major in the final round on a brutally difficult course , three scores are etched in history johnny miller s 63 to win the 1973 united states open at oakmont , arnold palmer s 65 to win the 1960 united states open at cherry hills , and ben hogan s 67 to win the 1951 united states open at oakland hills none of the 59 s involved a major geiberger s 59 occurred in the second round on the 7 , 249yard colonial country club course because of soggy conditions , the pros were allowed to lift , clean and place their ball he acknowledged moving the ball nine times he holed a 30foot wedge shot as well as putts of 40 , 20 and 18 feet he held on to win with a final two rounds of 7270 beck s 59 occurred in the third round on the wideopen 6 , 979yard sunset country club course that was virtually treeless and roughless then only 11 months old , it was used only that one year in the las vegas tournament he had 13 birdies , sinking putts of eight and four feet on the last two holes he finished third , two strokes behind duval shot his 59 on the 6 , 950yard arnold palmer private course at pga west in la quinta , calif , coming from six strokes behind he did it with laser approach shots in his backnine 28 , he holed birdie putts of 4 , 4 , 2 , 10 and 6 feet , and 18 inches about all david duval can do now to top that is shoot 58 , but to have a historically better year , he would rather win a major photo david duval \( jon ferrey allsport \)
various portraits at the entrance and at the end of to the rescue eight artists in an archive at the international center of photography midtown do not make a distinct impression that is the nature of most photographs of anonymous people these come from the archives of the american jewish joint distribution committee , a relief organization , and they show faces , like any others , that you may glance at unconsciously , the way you glance at the faces in a passing crowd on the street photography mirrors our general experience of the world in this respect that most of what we see does not register it appears to us inarticulate and inert we often need additional information about a photograph or we may fail to see it the image eludes us no doubt this was one hurdle that faced the organizers of to the rescue their goal to use pictures that record significant historical events but are not necessarily very articulate images the results , unfortunately , are not good , but the exhibition is an interesting failure because it raises some general questions about art and social responsibility and about the tricky distinction between exploitation and information the show was put together by marvin heiferman and carole kismaric to advertise the committee s efforts since 1914 it has helped starving jews in palestine , tried to rescue victims of the holocaust , cared for survivors , helped rebuild western europe and sent packages to refuseniks in the soviet union today it works in ethiopia , bosnia and albania over the years it has accumulated 50 , 000 documentary photographs mr heiferman and ms kismaric were asked to comb this archive and put together an exhibition they went through all the pictures , one by one a photographic archive of a relief organization is , of course , not the photography department of an art museum the curators decided to include eight artists in the project did they fear that history on its own was too boring \? the artists were invited to present works that either incorporated pictures from the archives or that somehow related to the photographs , a request vague enough to allow the artists to do almost anything and some did leon golub , for example , was interested in jewish resistance during world war ii , and borrowed photographs from the united states holocaust memorial museum because the committee s archive evidently did n't have the photographs he wanted his installation consists of several blownup transparencies , a kind of walkthrough version of one of his paintings magdalena abakanowicz and terry winters simply chose to show their usual work ms abakanowicz presents more of her headless , burlap figures , which have a vague , morbid gravity here one wonders what they are meant to imply , because they could imply many things , including that jews are a faceless horde mr winters presents several heavily worked , handsome abstractions of multilayered , irregular grids and other patterns , like diagrams in an accompanying statement he describes not wanting to use the very realworld subject matter of the archives to add moral or social weight to my images the works are extensions of what he had already been doing , he says , now opened up to a particular interpretive slant i 'd been touched , he continues , by seeing so much forced emigration , people displaced by circumstances this seemed to be an overriding condition described in the archives we are therefore invited to construe these abstractions in terms of maps and movement a question begins to arise what real function do the archive and the committee play in these works \? fred wilson , another artist , has gone so far as to cover up the photographs he borrows from the archives , leaving visible only small , frustratingly incomprehensible portions of them to make a general point that photographs without explanatory texts accompanying them can be deceptive an image of concentration camp survivors , for instance , is obscured by mr wilson , except for a fragment of the stripes on one survivor s uniform i 've obscured the content of most of each photograph except for the one point that interests me , he explains we 're always bombarded with images of some kind we choose them arbitrarily and we assign meanings to them and live through them , and then eventually we decide that they are reality wendy ewald has taken a different tack she has selected from the archives several photographs of children , survivors of world war ii , and distributed the pictures to elementary school students in durham , nc by themselves , she says , these photographic portraits do n't reveal much they depend on a history unfamiliar to the students , so her goal , in part , was to teach about the war the students were asked to write what they imagined it might be like to be a displaced child , to witness the holocaust and finally what they might feel as children of nazi sympathizers they then memorized and performed parts of what they had written on a split screen we see an archive portrait and a videotape of a student pretending to be the child in the picture i wanted to create a tension between the imagined and historical reality , ms ewald explains one wonders if this is a proper way to remember these people is mr wilson s manipulation of the concentration camp photograph , to prove a point about art , how the survivors in it might want their images to be used \? what , in general , is the responsibility of an artist to the material he or she uses \? maybe none there was certainly no obligation on the part of the artists in this exhibition to make art that serves the archives or the people in the photographs , merely to make art but neither , then , are we obliged to accept the art on the artist s terms we are perfectly free to conclude that the work comes between us and the more compelling subject that was its source dealing with archival material of this sort is a tricky business one of the installations at the holocaust museum in washington is an arrangement of 1 , 000 photographs of unidentified people from a shtetl who were killed by the nazis the photographs are hung in a twostory atrium shaped like a smokestack it s an artful design , along the lines of the works in to the rescue that installation can be interpreted in contradictory ways on the one hand , it presents pictures of the people of this town as they lived , so it may be seen as a tribute to their lives but because they are an anonymous mass , the people also appear to us , in a sense , as they were to their oppressors how would it feel if it were one s own father or daughter or grandmother whose picture was a decorative effect hung 20 feet above the heads of people passing through the installation \? art is an unstable container for history its virtue is that it refuses to conform or surrender to anything or anyone else after seeing to the rescue , it s possible that you will recall few of the photographs from the archive , which should not be surprising to use art as a package in which to wrap a message is to invite bad art or bad propaganda and sometimes to end up with both to the rescue eight artists in an archive remains at the international center of photography midtown , 1133 avenue of the americas , at 43d street , through may 16 it will go to the miami art museum \( sept 15 to nov 28 \) and the contemporary arts museum in houston \( oct 7 , 2000 to dec 3 , 2000 \) photos partisans , leon golub s walkthrough environment in to the rescue eight artists in an archive at the international center of photography midtown \( international center of photography \) \( pg e37 \) in h rr r and h pe \( 199899 \) , fred wilson presents two photographs twice , once with all but a small area of detail masked \( adam eidelberg international center of photography \) \( pg e44 \)
in the second consolidation shock to hit the aluminum industry in two days , alcoa inc , the largest producer , said yesterday that it wanted to buy the reynolds metals company , a troubled competitor that is nonetheless the thirdlargest player the announcement came a day after three huge alcoa rivals alcan aluminium of canada , pechiney of france and the alusuisse lonza group of switzerland announced they intended to merge , creating a 216 billion behemoth called alcan that would displace alcoa , which had 155 billion in sales last year all three foreign companies had been rumored to be talking to reynolds themselves reynolds said its board would discuss the offer on sunday but if alcoa s proposal is accepted , the merged company s combined 1998 sales of 213 billion would put it back within breathing distance of the top spot in fact , since the new alcan would derive 174 billion of its sales from aluminum , alcoa would remain the biggest company in the business while this merger flurry is big news on wall street , where both reynolds and alcoa shares rose yesterday , it is unlikely to have much impact on the consumers who buy reynolds wrap and other aluminum foils , or the automotive companies designing evermore aluminum into their cars even if the mergers result in fewer aluminum producers , aluminum itself is a basic commodity that is in in ample supply throughout the world neither of these mergers , assuming they go through , will have any impact on aluminum prices , or even on aluminum supply , said leanne baker , the metals analyst at salomon smith barney even the heaviest users of aluminum seem unworried aluminum is a marketdriven commodity , so you 've got to presume that the market will drive the price to wherever it is going to go , said ronald h iori , a spokesman for the ford motor company the deal may yet run into antitrust opposition in december 1997 the justice department sued to prevent alcoa from purchasing some of reynolds' assets in alabama , saying the purchase would result in higher prices a day later , the companies abandoned the deal since we looked at the previous proposal , it is likely we 'll be looking at this one as well , said gina talamona , a spokeswoman for the justice department still , analysts expect this proposal will survive regulatory scrutiny in fact , some analysts suggested that the advent of two such big deals may help each one go through they reason is that the justice department is likely to look more favorably on a strengthened alcoa , now that it has the prospect of a far bigger alcan operating across the border in montreal , while the european union will want a bigger presence in the aluminum industry to fight the specter of a joined alcoa and reynolds moreover , alcoa and reynolds are not mirror images reynolds , for example , is big in aluminum packaging , which alcoa has shunned alcoa is a huge supplier of aluminum sheeting for cans reynolds divested that business a few years ago while aluminum producers cannot affect prices or supply by joining forces , they can reduce costs and thus increase the profit from every pound of aluminum they sell that is something many need to do aluminum prices have been badly depressed for a decade first , the collapse of the soviet economy led to heavy selling of aluminum by russia , a huge aluminum producer , in a panicky quest for hard currency at the same time , auto makers , aerospace companies and other huge consumers of aluminum were merging into global giants with more influence over what they would pay for aluminum , keeping prices low the general motors corporation , for example , announced a multibilliondollar 10year contract with alcan in november that provides a steady supply of the metal at a relatively stable price the result is that aluminum , which routinely sold for more than 1 a pound in the 1980 s and often spiked far higher , costs 70 cents a pound or less now prices have been on such a steady downtrend that many companies were not even earning their cost of capital , said warren spitz , a portfolio manager at prudential investments , whose funds are heavily invested in both alcoa and reynolds shares this consolidation is hitting an industry that has had substandard profitability for at least a decade the news has not been all bad in the industry , of course as economies in asia and latin america continue to recover , aluminum demand and prices are expected to increase , although even getting to 75 cents would be worth a hallelujah , said james n kelleher , an analyst with argus research aluminum producers have also succeeded in increasing industrial use of the metal in place of steel auto makers now use aluminum in transmissions , wheels , doors and roof racks the popularity of fourwheel drives has been a boon for the aluminum makers , since the vehicles require two transmissions instead of one gm will use 17 billion pounds of aluminum in its cars and trucks this year five years ago , that volume was 11 billion pounds last year gm cars and trucks contained an average of 275 pounds of aluminum this year they contain 290 pounds the use of aluminum has increased much faster than anyone had expected , said daniel j bealko , gm s global commodity manager for lightweight metals still , the persistently low prices , combined with the huge number of plants producing aluminum have kept prices and profits low manufacturers have coped partly by shuttering older plants
washington , sept 7 henry g cisneros , president clinton s former housing secretary , pleaded guilty today to a misdemeanor count of lying to the fbi about payments to a former mistress under a plea agreement that brings to an abrupt end the fouryear , 10 million investigation that led to his resignation , he avoids both a trial on 18 felony charges and jail time mr cisneros would have faced up to five years in jail on each count in what probably would have been the last criminal trial conducted under the independent counsel law the plea agreement also means that the last four cases brought by independent counsels ended in setbacks to three prosecutors the agreement with the independent counsel david m barrett calls for mr cisneros to pay a fine of 10 , 000 he will not be placed on probation i accept responsibility for the conduct as outlined , mr cisneros said in federal court today mr cisneros , a former mayor of san antonio , added that future aspirants to public office should learn that truth and candor are important he left the courthouse without talking to reporters but later issued a statement through his lawyer saying that he was not candid in statements he made to federal bureau of investigation agents doing a background check on his suitability to serve in the clinton cabinet but mr cisneros said he hoped he would be best remembered for his actions as secretary of housing and urban development for three years at the beginning of the clinton administration mr cisneros told the fbi agents doing the background check that he paid the former lover , linda jones , about 60 , 000 over the years ms jones , once known by her married name , linda medlar , secretly taperecorded 88 telephone conversations with mr cisneros , who is heard acknowledging that the actual figure was closer to 250 , 000 and that he had not been honest with investigators about the payments jury selection was set to begin today in a trial that was expected to last more than a month instead , mr barrett told reporters outside the courthouse , we are just glad to have this over and done with in a statement released by his office , mr barrett defended the investigation and suggested that his decision to end the case was based on compassion and sympathy for mr cisneros , who had a long career of public service and was once viewed as a rising star in the democratic party as a popular mayor and hispanic politician , mr cisneros had occasionally been considered as a possible vicepresidential candidate he was a skilled operator in the domesticpolicy bureaucracy who inherited a housing department demoralized by rampant scandal in republican administrations over charges that contracts were awarded to politically connected lobbyists and lawyers mr cisneros is now the president of univision , the spanishlanguage cable television network based in los angeles this disposition should in no way be viewed as minimizing the serious ethical breach by mr cisneros , mr barrett said in his statement however , a just disposition of any prosecution must include an evaluation of the defendant s overall conduct in this case , the conduct , while egregious , was committed by a person whose life has been otherwise dedicated to public service , and this fact must season the final decision but many lawyers viewed the case against mr cisneros as deeply flawed , a judgment seemingly confirmed by the prosecution s decision today to end the matter the main problem for mr barrett was that his chief witness against mr cisneros was ms jones , who has been portrayed as a liar not only by mr cisneros s defense lawyers but also by mr barrett s office ms jones is serving a 42month sentence in federal prison on charges brought in a bank fraud case by mr barrett s office and related to the money she received from mr cisneros prosecutors exposed as a lie her assertion that the audiotapes of her conversations with mr cisneros were untouched originals the prosecution showed that they were copies , many of which had been altered by ms jones to conceal some of her statements mr cisneros s lawyers had tried to have the tapes ruled inadmissible at his trial but judge stanley sporkin , who was to preside , ruled that the jury would be told the tapes had been doctored and that jurors could decide what to make of them judge sporkin said that the plea agreement was appropriate and that it upheld the principle that we cannot allow an individual to lie his way into office but lawrence g barcella , a former federal prosecutor , characterized the result as basically a wipeout , a prosecutorial implosion mr barcella , who is an experienced whitecollar defense lawyer in washington , said the result showed that the independent counsel law had sometimes led to prosecutions that were gigantic wastes of time and money congress allowed the independent counsel law to expire in june lawmakers were troubled by the continuing debate over the law and especially wearied after the impeachment of president clinton , which resulted from the investigation by kenneth w starr , the whitewater independent counsel today s plea agreement also means that none of the several independent counsels deployed in the clinton administration have achieved a major conviction of their principal targets mike espy , mr clinton s former agriculture secretary , was acquitted on charges he accepted favors and bribes the independent counsel investigating bruce babbitt , the interior secretary , is on the verge of ending an investigation into whether he improperly intervened in the matter of a gambling license for an indian tribe an independent counsel investigating commerce secretary ronald h brown ended his inquiry when mr brown was killed in a plane crash in croatia and mr starr has decided not to seek indictments of president clinton or his wife , hillary rodham clinton , law enforcement officials said the last two cases brought by mr starr , against susan h mcdougal in arkansas and julie hiatt steele , ended in mistrials and dismissals the only remaining open investigation by an independent counsel is that of labor secretary alexis m herman on charges of influence peddling in obtaining federal contracts before she assumed the post in accepting the cisneros plea agreement today , judge sporkin said he anticipated that it would lead to much secondguessing he said his first impression upon hearing the proposed agreement was that the penalty was far too light for the time and money expended but he said he has concluded that the ultimate resolution was wholly appropriate and that mr barrett did not have much choice in the matter mr barrett and his associates had an obligation to maintain the integrity of their oath of office , and in pursuing this matter they did , the judge said but judge sporkin said he believed that matters should have been concluded more quickly

washington occasionally an exhibition makes you reach for your abacus photographs from the collection at the national gallery of art is such a show the 63 blackandwhite works in this show , drawn mostly from recent acquisitions , span nearly the whole history of photography and are arranged in roughly chronological order but for some reason history flows strangely here it is too still why \? maybe a look at the photographers would help a quick tally reveals that alfred stieglitz and robert frank are the high scorers in the exhibition , with six photographs each right behind are andre kertesz and paul strand , with five each next comes charles sheeler , with four , then a string of photographers with three william henry fox talbot , eugene atget , ilse bing and roy decarava carleton watkins , julia margaret cameron and harry callahan each have a pair the photographers with one each include gustave le gray , nadar , brassai , bill brandt , laszlo moholynagy , berenice abbott , august sander , frederick sommer and edward weston among the noshows are daguerre , walker evans , ansel adams , man ray , alexander rodchenko , diane arbus and cindy sherman the party list does n't actually help much , though why \? because the show does n't revolve around photographers and their innovations the national gallery s curator of photographs , sarah greenough , said the museum was just showing off the handsome pictures it has gotten recently nonetheless , the exhibition does seem to coalesce around four distinct , extended moments 1856 to 1867 , when photography , after a period of experimentation , finally achieved some clarity 1917 and 1918 , a time of formal , almost religious intensity 1929 to 1938 , playtime with perspective , and 1952 and 1953 , when photographers turned inward this is not the usual history of photography for one thing , the big shots do not play their usual roles for another , there is no contemporary period history deadends in the 1950 s then there are the chronological quirks some photographs appear in their proper places in the chronology , others pop up in odd places , displaced from their usual time slots the first coalescent moment in the show is the dawn of clarity after a period of experimentation \( represented here with a few touching , muzzy , saltedpaper prints of talbot from 1843 \) suddenly the images are sharp in le gray s albumen print of a beech tree , with its white bark , its dappled leaves and the dark mysterious gap where the roots are exposed , you can actually see the grass the year is 1856 dr hugh welch diamond s woman holding a dead bird , surrey county asylum , an albumen print of a happily deranged woman , is so detailed that diamond thought it could be used to make a psychological diagnosis the moment of photographic clarity reaches its extreme , though , with carleton watkins s albumen print of the high , soft cliffs of the columbia river gorge , so huge and clear that you could survey the rock layers just on the photograph s evidence the next big moment in the show appears to be 19171918 , a period of intensive study and formal rigor this was the time when alfred stieglitz began his multipicture portrait of georgia o'keeffe it was also the period when charles sheeler began his equally obsessive portrait of his farmhouse in doylestown , pa lovely and fascinating as both of these projects are , there is something unnerving about their presentation first the sheeler given that this show includes only 63 photographs , it is bizarre that three are devoted to the interior of sheeler s doylestown house the pictures are gorgeous , spare , modern , with flat elegant shadows but three \? why \? just the opposite goes for stieglitz s o'keeffe portrait just three pictures \? why \? part of the series s appeal is its progressive seductiveness , his artful undressing of his subject but here things are different we find o'keeffe bare right off the bat two of the 1918 nudes of o'keeffe with a kimono are together next to these is a third nude that looks like o'keeffe , but is n't it is a portrait from 1856 , taken by franc chauvassaignes long before o'keeffe was born maybe it is here to show that stieglitz was n't doing anything that had n't been done before or maybe because it looks good here it s hard to tell meanwhile another piece of the stieglitz portrait is in another room , mingling with other women s portraits a bleachedout photo of eleanor callahan by her husband , harry , and a monumental , pearleyed platinum print of rebecca strand by her husband , paul the next important moment in the show is 1929 to 1938 , when photographers were playing around with perspective , exploring the many strange opportunities presented by bridges , towers and skyscrapers the moment begins with a 1929 kertesz shadow of the eiffel tower , taken from the tower it ends in 1938 with his photograph of indecipherable , upside down skywriting in manhattan , taken from the ground somewhere in between is ilse bing s 1931 photograph pont des arts , taken at a 45degree slant the passion for skewing extended , apparently , to psychological matters , too in this show there are three portraits of couples from the 1930 s , and none of them , as the wall text points out , is what it pretends to be one of kertesz and elizabeth , his first wife , appears to be a study in a husband s solicitude , but it was taken around the time he picked up a second wife and even though bill brandt s dark and scary photograph called street scene appears to show a man in a fedora about to attack a woman , with the shadow of his fedora right behind him , it is actually a picture of brandt s brother and sisterinlaw horsing around in dramatic lighting the last distinctive moment in this odd survey is 195253 , a time of inwardness and melancholy roy decarava s hallway , a very dark print of a narrow passageway with a single bulb s light bouncing off the walls , is emblematic of this moment so are robert frank s bittersweet portraits of flower sellers in paris one of a sadfaced girl calling out to a crowd with an armful of flowers and another of a poor man desperate to unload a single bud on any passerby although there are a few more contemporary photos , the show peters out chronologically after the 1950 s the last photographs in the exhibition all appear to exist in a timeless moment or rather they are all over the time line , and it s hard to tell just from looking what period they come from there is stieglitz s moon , a 1926 picture that predates and resembles ansel adams s far more famous moonrise shot forest scene taken in the 1930 s by the portraitist august sander strand s 1927 shot of the maine woods a dark mountain road in colorado taken by robert adams in 1980 why does this show end in the pretty , primeval forest , where time and change do n't exist \? maybe because this was the point that the show was striving for all along history does n't always matter photographs from the collection is at the national gallery of art , fourth street at constitution ave nw , washington , \( 202 \) 8426353 , through july 5 photo eugene atget s view of corot s pond in villed'avray , france , in photographs from the collection \( national gallery of art , washington \)
the queen s chamber band opens ocean grove s classical series with a concert of rb in the world of early music , that means rameau and bach works by these giants of the baroque period one french , one german are offered for comparison in thursday s program , from versailles to the brandenburg gates the ninemember chamber band is officially named for king george iii s wife , queen charlotte sophia , who retained a little woodwindandstring salon ensemble but the de facto queen of today s band is its founder , elaine comparone , a harpsichordist whose program biography lists impresaria as one of her credits another is founder of harpsichord unlimited , a nonprofit organization that promotes interest in harpsichord music one of its activities is commissioning and performing brand new works for an instrument more often associated with music predating the classical era when vincent persichetti , the composer and juilliard professor , became enchanted with the harpsichord in 1982 , he invited ms comparone to perform sonatas he composed she sometimes receives unsolicited manuscripts in the mail from composers experimenting with harpsichord music in addition to bach and italian baroque , her recordings , with the band and her other groups , include ragtime and contemporary music \( by christmas , recordings of rameau and scarlatti are due out on the lyrichord label \) last month , in manhattan , the band introduced seven of its new commissions none are on the ocean grove program , which is closer to an allrameau one called music at versailles rameau followed musical forms , but his pieces are intended to evoke images , which appear instead of tempo names like allegro as movement titles some of the movements to be performed on thursday are named for rameau s patrons , like la popliniere , for a man in whose mansion rameau stayed , or for areas of the countryside , like le vezinet rameau was born in 1683 , two years before bach , and outlived his german contemporary by 14 years in addition to music , he wrote treatises on theory , taking the sensible view that the primary esthetic purpose of music was to express , to please the ear and to move the passions , as the new grove dictionary of music and musicians phrased it one of rameau s bird pieces was recently played on public radio , followed by one by amy beach , an american who lived 200 years after him it was clear from listening to the two in succession that birds have n't changed much over time rameau is up there with bach , ms comparone said , speaking in the manhattan apartment she shares with four cats , a dog and two harpsichords he should be known more his keyboard music is immensely difficult , like little orchestra pieces i started working on them 20 years ago , and now i can finally play them twenty years ago was about the time of a bach freeforall in her upper west side neighborhood , when she suddenly found herself in the role of harpsichordist on call for 12 hours , with no idea of what piece might be sprung on her next , she sightread the accompanying continuo part in orchestral works and accompanied singers and players she even played a sober , healthy solo both her instruments were built to her specifications by two leading harpsichord makers the newarkborn william dowd , who has workshops in cambridge , mass , and paris , has made her a replica of a french one from 1721 , and her francoflemish copy is by mr dowd s onetime partner , frank hubbard , who died in 1976 the dowd , which she played at ocean grove last summer , has an uncommonly big bass , which audiences like , and a penetrating , nasal upper register the hubbard , which she plans to use on thursday , has a lighter , more beautiful sound both instruments can be placed on her ornate riser with blue wheels also constructed to her specifications ms comparone feels freer when she plays standing up , which she says is her own innovation i want to stand like the rest of the group , she said it projects better , and people see i can move more and have better access to the keyboard i'm from the rockandroll generation keyboard players stand why should n't i be seen \? freedom of movement is not an issue that depends on whether the music is new or old the challenges of contemporary music are surprisingly like those of old pieces , and as persichetti once pointed out , they lie in the nature of the instrument for instance , since harpsichords have no damper pedals to sustain the notes , it is best if pieces keep moving atonal music does n't work on the instrument , ms comparone says , because of sound distractions of the mechanics of playing as for timbre , she tends to use the dowd instrument for new music besides composers , ms comparone attracts the attention of artists outside her profession a verse from gerald stern s poem elaine comparone reads if i could do exactly what i wanted i would move a harpsichord into my backyard and ask elaine comparone to play for me all morning the queen s chamber band great auditorium , pilgrim and ocean pathways , ocean grove elaine comparone , harpsichordist thursday at 8 pm \( 732 \) 9880645 or \( 800 \) 7730097 photo elaine comparone in her preferred position for playing the harpsichord
four generations of new englanders have suspected that the boston red sox exist merely to lure and then torture them in these final days of the 20th century it seems wholly appropriate that the red sox would meet their hated rivals , the yankees , for the american league championship there are only two possible outcomes , courtesy of the baseball gods the red sox clear underdogs in this fourofsevengame series , their pitching staff tattered from a playoff series with cleveland will prevail and overcome the curse of the bambino or the yankees will win , again , and the hearts of red sox fans will be ripped out , again orlando hernandez will face kent mercker , a journeyman lefthander chosen only because boston s other starters are unavailable , tonight at yankee stadium in game 1 of a playoff series that promises to stir memories and emotions it s intense , david cone said it s kind of eerie when you think about it it s 1999 , and the yankees and red sox are meeting for the first time in the postseason it s an opportunity red sox fans have been waiting for since babe ruth the bambino , as ruth was known , was property of the red sox until 1920 , when he was sold to the yankees , and in the interim , the yankees have won 24 championships , the red sox none , despite many near misses that are landmarks in time envy and arrogance have fueled the rivalry over the years , and although don zimmer formerly the red sox manager and currently the bench coach for the yankees believes the teams do n't despise each other as they did in the past , most spoke excitedly about the possibility of performing in the eye of such a charged atmosphere it could be two weeks of sheer nut house around here , scott brosius said zimmer said , the whole thing is going to be wild paul o'neill worked out yesterday and expected to be in the lineup tonight , even though he was sometimes breathless because of his broken rib even so , the yankees were expected to add another outfielder , shane spencer , to their roster joe torre juggled the pitching rotation he used in the sweep of texas last week cone , who did not pitch against the rangers , will start in game 2 \( and game 6 , if necessary \) , and roger clemens will pitch game 3 \( and game 7 \) , with andy pettitte slated for game 4 jimy williams , the boston manager , was not prepared to schedule his rotation for the final three games of the series he struggled to identify a starter for game 1 the red sox eliminated cleveland , 128 , on monday night and , with his hair slick with champagne , williams told reporters later not to bother asking how he might align his pitchers against the yankees he did n't know like the movie character indiana jones , williams has improvised his way through one crisis after another this is his immediate problem he used starters bret saberhagen and pedro martinez in the final game of the cleveland series , and ramon martinez , coming back from shoulder surgery , needs more rest so williams will improvise mercker , a lefthander who started game 4 against the indians , will open game 1 for the red sox but mercker may simply be the first pawn if the yankees attack mercker with their usual lineup against lefthanders , then chili davis will serve as the designated hitter and either chad curtis or spencer will play the outfield williams might then replace mercker quickly perhaps as soon as the first or second inning , when the righthanded hitters at the bottom of the yankees' lineup are due to bat with a righthanded reliever , such as derek lowe if williams tries this strategy and the game is close , torre would then face a problem should he counter by inserting the lefthanded hitters ricky ledee and darryl strawberry and possibly leave himself open to unfavorable matchups late in the game \? but the yankees might hammer mercker , beat up on the relievers who follow and williams s relief corps could be taxed for game 2 is gambling legal in this state \? williams asked we just kind of make it simple , play one game , see what we can do here the red sox have played that way all season , gamely hanging on with a lineup of littleknown players , in spite of injuries brian daubach , the no 3 hitter for the red sox , was a longtime minor leaguer with just 15 atbats in the majors before this season john valentin , who has been with boston longer than any player , is hobbling on a bad leg troy o'leary , their no 5 hitter , was a castoff of the milwaukee brewers pedro martinez , certain to be the american league cy young award winner , has stiffness in his back tom gordon , once a dominant reliever , may need reconstructive surgery on his elbow nomar garciaparra , boston s best player , is still bothered by a sore wrist that forced him to miss game 3 of the division series they traveled from boston to cleveland early monday morning and checked in at their hotel at 4 am , beat the indians monday night and then arrived here early this morning we are not tired , williams said he paused he declared again , we are not tired , seemingly a statement of will torre said you do n't get tired when you are in postseason play maybe they ca n't line up their pitchers the way they would normally like to , but they are on such a high right now they have ridden this thing they will be tired when it is over for them , whether it is this week , next week , the week after but right now , they will do it on fumes if they have to unlike the indians and the texas rangers , the defunct playoff qualifiers , it is apparent that the red sox do not fear the yankees boston won 8 of 12 games between the teams during the regular season , including a threegame sweep at yankee stadium sept 1012 there is no question the boston red sox have given us all we can handle this year , torre said they are an aggressivetype lineup brosius , mike stanton , zimmer and the others chatted about the history of the rivalry between the yankees and red sox ted williams against joe dimaggio , the boston collapse of 1949 , bucky dent winning the playoff game of 1978 for the yankees with a home run into the screen above the green monster it used to be war , zimmer said , mentioning how carlton fisk hated thurman munson , how the yankees detested bill lee it s not quite the same for the players , zimmer said but for fans of the yankees and red sox , this is most serious business , as zimmer understands he told a story about his 13yearold granddaughter , whitney mollica , who lives in windham , nh she finished a soccer game sunday , and teammates knowing of her ancestral roots surrounded her and screamed , now bring on the yankees ! photos boston s martinez brothers , ramon \( wearing cap \) and pedro , will play an important role against the yankees , but they will not be pitching tonight in game 1 \( jeffery a salter the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) paul o'neill has a broken rib , but he expects to be in the yankees' lineup tonight \( jeffery a salter the new york times \) \( pg d7 \)
i robbed people on the street in the bronx , said reynard smith , his big , round face briefly sad i'm not proud of it , but i did my mom brought me to staten island for a better life the big face brightened i found a family here , he said i was overpowered with love they even gave me a nickname , pooh bear because i'm so big and gentle not on the field , of course today , pooh bear and the family he found , the curtis high school football team , will defend their public schools athletic league championship against wagner high , another staten island powerhouse , at the midwood high field in brooklyn it is no surprise that two staten island teams will meet for the title in the past three years , five of the six finalists have come from a borough of new york city that periodically threatens to secede and is as often urged to do so on the island , there are plenty of explanations for football dominance there s a suburban mentality here , said paul barchitta , a psal coordinator who played for new dorp high when it won the city s first title game in 1959 he later coached that staten island powerhouse of the 1960 s and 70 s staten island has a daily paper , the advance , so the kids are promoted , see their names there are parents' groups that raise money for equipment and coaches and the coaches think they 're running division iii college programs barchitta , a big man in cowboy boots and hat , watched curtis practice on its astroturf field last week and nodded as jim meraglia , the curtis athletic director , offered up his theory meraglia , who played baseball at new dorp , is one of curtis s six deans of discipline he said there is relatively little trouble at the 2 , 500student school , and claims that one reason is that 440 of the students play varsity sports you got tradition here , he said , pointing up at the sign for the abel r kiviat memorial track , in honor of the curtis alumnus who competed in the olympics the school is 95 years old , a beige stone monument to preverrazanonarrowsbridge staten island and kiviat was n't even the school s most famous athlete , meraglia said i 'll never forget my dad telling me how after bobby thomson hit the shot heard 'round the world , he took the ferry back home to staten island and do n't forget our coach he won his hundredth game last week coach fred olivieri , a squarecut earth science teacher , waved that aside do n't forget it took me 18 seasons , he said olivieri was sitting after practice in the coaches' locker room , a small room condensed further by his four assistants , george brown , peter gambardella , andrew schron and peter mcnamara , all of whom have played for him it s these guys , they know the program it means we speak as one voice it means we can all take off on him , said mcnamara , a special education teacher at a nearby middle school we can all mimic his great philosophies , like , 'when i say change your underwear every day , boys , that does n't mean change them with a friend' what does that mean \? olivieri smiled he is famous for stopping the team bus so he can examine an outcropping of rock he said why are these games so important \? to prove manhood , to win for the school , or so that we learn that whatever we face in later life we have confidence in our ability to stand up and be counted \? in the breathless room , the question seemed rhetorical enough not to be answered olivieri , as had his father before him and his daughter after him , graduated from curtis , where he was a football player but earth science was his passion he studied at indiana state , then returned to teach at curtis for 10 years before also taking on a losing football program it took him 10 years to build a consistent winner from 1992 through 1995 , curtis made the first or quarterfinal round of the city playoffs every season , twice knocked off by wagner in 1996 , curtis lost in the semis to john f kennedy of the bronx in 1997 , curtis lost the title game to tottenville , another staten island team last year , it beat lehman of the bronx for the title this season , after losing an exhibition game to a new jersey team , roxbury , curtis won 11 in a row , including drubbings of tottenville and wagner why so good , finally \? i got good kids , olivieri said like mike goodman , a running back whose career statistics include 50 touchdowns and more than 3 , 000 yards gained , and george hassell , who has started every game at quarterback during his four years at curtis the reason staten island football is so good is competition , hassell said mike and i 've been playing peewee since we were 8 years old there are two pop warner leagues here you know everybody on the island and you grow up with kids who go to other high schools the rest of my family went to wagner we ca n't lose what i 'd have to listen to in the neighborhood good kids like reynard smith , the former mugger who , as pooh bear , became a 6foot5inch , 350pound offensive tackle recruited by hofstra and pittsburgh my mom was n't doing so good in the bronx either , and she came out here and looked around for a good school where i could play football , smith said she s a registered nurse i was 15 then i would have been arrested soon it s real quiet out here sometimes i miss the streets that s part of the reason we 're so good there is n't much else to do and like wesley sanchez , a 63 , 285pound tackle on both offense and defense , who also talks about coming to staten island for a better life i was in the eighth grade and things were going downhill for me , sanchez said it got too easy to cut school , to start hanging with the wrong people here , neighbors see you do wrong , they talk to your parents back in brooklyn , they just talked about you a senior captain like pooh bear , goodman and hassell , sanchez admitted feeling nostalgic on the eve of his third and last city title game we 're all a bunch of knuckleheads tonight , just happy to be practicing together , he said life might never get better than this none of us want this to ever end photos players at curtis high , which has six deans of discipline , preparing for today s psal championship game against wagner reynard smith , left , a highly recruited tackle at curtis , is coached by fred olivieri , above , an earth science teacher who turned the football program around \( photographs by frank c dougherty for the new york times \)
every new year s eve , we would like to think , one small story closes and another opens but this year the story arrives in a deluxe edition the ball dropping in times square at midnight will punctuate not just a chapter or a volume , but a boxed set titled 20th century and it will be the first mark of an ellipsis into the future epochal transitions are part of every culture , and they are by no means always occasions for cheer thresholds are worrisome places you know a good deal about what you 're leaving behind but not much about what s ahead and vulnerability makes emotions run high no wonder the prospect of ending one life and starting another the millennial concept in a nutshell invites responsive extremes of hope and despair all over the world art is called on for guidance and assurance in such matters certain kinds of objects play an instrumental , constructive role , forecasting the future and ensuring stability in the here and now others have a speculative purpose , advancing visions of what could or should be still others offer retrospective glances , cautionary or nostalgic in every case art is a psychic tuning fork sensitive to every tremor of elation or fear , cosmic and personal one can feel those vibrations on visits to theme shows like millennial dreams vision and prophecy in american folk art , at the museum of american folk art , or from this world to the next jewish approaches to illness , death and the afterlife , at the jewish theological seminary but they are just as evident on a tour of the permanent collections of almost any museum in new york , as the old stories of ends and beginnings converge on us this new year the morgan library for a highpressure blast of millennial urgency , shifting between storms and calms , one can do no better than to visit the morgan library , where two examples of work by william blake \( 17571827 \) are on view in a small show titled collecting for the centuries blake was an outstanding polymath in western art he wrote and illustrated a series of fantastic epic poems , handprinting them in a selfinvented etching process that rendered each page as fresh and unique as a painting he was also a radical political thinker who conceived a vision of history in mythological and religious terms and conceived the world as a revolutionary site the morgan is displaying two plates from america , a prophecy \( 1793 \) , an illustrated poem that distills blake s spirit of utopian agitation for him the american and french revolutions were linchpin upheavals of the kind promised by judeochristian apocalyptic tradition in them liberty and tyranny met in pitched battle , after which , he trusted , universal harmony would reign in the first plate , the poem s title page , flames shoot from a trumpet like water from a riot hose , driving a terrified family from its home but even as fire and smoke fill the sky , a figure with broken chains soars free the conflict is resolved in the second plate , a pastoral scene of sleeping children , birds of paradise and a clear sky washed in rainbow hues it is unclear , though , whether the scene depicts dawn or sunset for blake , america did not live up to its promise the declaration of independence was signed , but slavery continued blake s belief in the human capacity for goodness held firm , nonetheless , and his view of earthly experience grew increasingly cosmic to him reality and imagination were one and the same , and bliss was always just around the corner newyork historical society meanwhile the united states had acquired a visionary artist of its own in the selftaught britishborn painter thomas cole \( 18011848 \) a highly strung romantic appalled by the ecological and cultural effects of the industrial revolution , in the new world he sought , and initially found , an eden of natural beauty and republican virtue as with blake , cole s idealistic view did not last during the jacksonian era of the 1830 s the country was increasingly in turmoil the wilderness was disappearing fast north and south were at odds urban disorder was on the rise a profithungry elite was gaining power temperamentally inclined to operate in crisis mode , cole poured his fears for the future into art , and the apocalyptic series of five paintings titled the course of empire \( 183336 \) was the result the paintings , on permanent view at the newyork historical society , form an allegorical fever chart of civilization and the evolutionary motto that cole attached to them tells the tale taken from byron , it reads first freedom and then glory when that fails , wealth , vice , corruption the scenes depicted correspond to times of day in the first , savage state , an untamed forest emerges from a murky predawn in the second , a dewy arcadian tranquillity prevails the centerpiece , consummation of the empire , shows a colossal city , resplendent with trumpstyle gilding and marble , glinting under a hazy , hot noon sky as darkness approaches , destruction arrives the city is torn apart by war in the grim coda , desolation , urban ruins molder in a brackish , moonlit swamp
for more than two years , the educational testing service , the author of the nation s most widely used college entrance examination , has been working to devise a formula to help admissions officers identify disadvantaged students who score better than might have been predicted by racial , economic and other factors though their scores would stay the same , the students would be labeled as strivers , perhaps increasing their chances of admission but none are likely to be flagged any time soon , if ever , because recent reports describing the research touched off criticism from many universities and from the college board , the association of colleges that contracts with the testing service to write the tests and score the results gaston caperton , who was named president and chief executive of the college board on july 1 , said in an interview this week that he would work to block the testing service from ever offering such a formula to colleges as a tool to diversify their incoming classes there is a real art and a real skill to blending these factors together , for an institution to decide what it s student body should look like , mr caperton said to think that you could do that with some scientific formula just would n't work according to descriptions of the research provided by the testing service , a student would be identified as a striver with a score of at least 1 , 000 on the test , out of a possible 1 , 600 , and a performance at least 200 points better than expected the expected score would be calculated by assigning values to dozens of factors in the student s life and background , including how many books and appliances are in the home , how many years of school the student s parents attended and the total of advanced placement tests taken in the student s school the formula would permit universities , which would be responsible for analyzing the scores , to factor the student s race or disregard it though the their scores would not change , the students would , in effect , be credited with doing better than they actually had the research was prompted by recent attacks on affirmative action and the fact that test scores are increasingly seen as the way to get into colleges among the criticisms of the striver research , most of them raised since the wall street journal first reported on the project late last month , has been that it represents an affirmative action effort in disguise critics fear that the formula might hurt more affluent students by setting the bar of expectation higher than that for strivers i think it s too simplistic and , in a way , demeaning , said karl furstenberg , the dean of admissions and financial aid at dartmouth college i worry about a program like this stigmatizing people , and in effect saying , 'just because you come from background xyz , you are not expected to do well , and if you do well , you get this gold star of being a striver' in the wake of the journal article , which suggested that admissions officers would be able to start using the formula this fall , the testing service has taken great pains to say that its research is continuing and that it has yet to decide whether to disseminate the formula to colleges there is no product or program or service that is even under concept , said tom ewing , a spokesman for the testing service nonetheless , by even undertaking such research , the testing service is acknowledging a flaw in the test that critics have bemoaned for years the college board test does not necessarily provide a fair gauge of ability this makes ever more clear that the socalled common yardstick of the sat is in fact a flexible , rubber ruler , said monty neill , the executive director of the national center for fair and open testing , a nonprofit group that wants college board exams to be voluntary the test really does mean different things for different testtakers in pursuing a formula , the testing service is searching for some way to put the imprint of science on something that many highly selective universities do anyway , though informally through interviews and essays taking into account all the influences on a student s life and academic record when considering an application for admission though many admissions directors said they feared that an individual s strengths could get lost if compared to generic formulaic expectations for racial or economic groups , michael t nettles , a university of michigan professor of education , said he believed the testing service was on an important quest and encouraged it to continue its research it s a first step , said professor nettles , an expert on educational assessment one of the benefits of the work is that it enlivens the debate on the issue
jeff van gundy remembers sitting next to pat riley and watching a promising knicks postseason perish terribly at the hands of the great michael jordan it was 1993 , and the knicks , seemingly en route to their first appearance in the national basketball association finals in 20 years , led their series with the twotime defending champion chicago bulls by two games to none but as quickly as jordan could blow by defenders with his first step , the advantage disappeared , and the bulls rose up to win the next four games and add another chapter to their prodigious history of flooring the knicks though the experience seemed futile at the time , van gundy , then a knicks assistant , is now using it to foster fear and the threat of danger as his team prepares for game 3 of its eastern conference semifinal series with the atlanta hawks today at madison square garden in trying to create desperation in the minds of the knicks , van gundy is ignoring two things that atlanta s main weapon , steve smith , lacks the ammunition of jordan , and that the staggering hawks are not championship material instead , he is advertising the opponent as an excellent road team that won a regularseason game at the garden and could easily duplicate the bulls' feat of six years ago he will find out today whether his players are buying it are you going to go in urgent and desperate , or are you going to sit back and subconsciously exhale and collapse \? van gundy said after yesterday s practice at sunypurchase that s what we have to try to avoid to me , game 3 is very urgent and desperate because the games are going to happen bangbang if we 're not ready tomorrow , i do n't think that bodes well for us hopefully , we 'll be at a fever pitch intensitywise a quirk in scheduling gave the clubs two days off after thursday s game 2 but no days off between game 3 at 3 pm today and game 4 , which is tomorrow night at the garden so the gamut of possibilities for the knicks ranges from sweeping the hawks and playing in the conference finals for the first time since 1994 , or heading back to atlanta with the series knotted at two games apiece with the knicks in command and the indiana pacers holding a threegamestonone lead over the philadelphia 76ers , many fans and analysts are already preparing for a suspenseful rematch of last year s secondround series , won by the pacers in five games that indiana bounced the knicks from the semifinals in seven games four years ago and is favored to win the conference s first postjordan crown makes the matchup that much more enticing aware of this , van gundy is doing whatever is necessary to challenge his team and keep it from relaxing he praised indiana for displaying a sense of urgency in trying to sweep philadelphia , called the notion that the raucous garden crowd will give the knicks a great advantage ludicrous , and trumped up atlanta s victory at the garden on march 22 , even though the hawks won a close game by 8071 i tell them about my basic experience here for 10 years , van gundy said things can change quickly in the nba bad to good , as it has for us this year , and good to bad if you 're not right on it mentally and you subconsciously exhale and play it like you have a cushion , then you 'll find yourself at 22 in 48 hours that s what will happen anyone who has paid attention to the knicks this season knows that they are annoyingly inconsistent , apt to be brilliant one game and inept the next they followed that pattern precisely in their firstround victory over the miami heat , playing well in games 1 , 3 and 5 and horribly in the others and after scoring 100 points in game 1 of this series in atlanta , they scored just 77 in game 2 while shooting 38 percent from the field the knicks' starters shot just 32 percent and were outrebounded , 4624 , by atlanta s starting five were it not for the spectacular bench play of latrell sprewell \( 31 points \) and marcus camby \( 11 points , 13 rebounds \) , combined with the horrid shooting of the hawks \( 29 percent \) , this series might be tied justifiably questioning his team s mental toughness , van gundy wonders if the knicks have the resolve to put away the hawks in new york clearly , they have the ability with advantages in power and depth , with the lightning quick sprewell all but unguardable , and with camby flying by air and by ground one thing i 've found with our guys is that it s more of a mental challenge than it is a physical challenge , van gundy said we ca n't get tired of winning subconsciously some teams get tired of winning they 're not willing to play that role every night , to think defense before offense , think rebound before run , think pass before shoot it s hard to keep winning it really is , so to me that s why it s so much more of a mental challenge than it is a physical challenge it may remain that way the rest of the season , so if the knicks stumble in one of the next two games , van gundy may use the infamous 1997 semifinal loss to miami for motivation in that one , of course , the knicks wasted a threegamestoone lead when patrick ewing , allan houston , larry johnson , john starks and charlie ward were suspended for one or both of games 6 and 7 for their part in ward s scuffle with the heat s p j brown ward , however , said that bringing that up was not necessary , that the knicks get the picture we do n't want to bring back those types of memories , ward said , laughing those teams were different and like coach says , 'every game brings its own personality' coach is hoping that his players bring the right personality to the garden today and tomorrow photo marcus camby and latrell sprewell , celebrating the knicks' success in game 2 , were two big reasons for it \( reuters \)
hollywood , dec 9 holiday movies , by the book the holiday rush of movies , now well upon us , always includes a fair sampling of book adaptations , both recent best sellers and timeworn classics each comes with its own builtin audience and predetermined respectability , guaranteed oscar bait and this year s crop is , if anything , a bit bigger than usual before month s end , theaters will be showing adaptations as diverse as angela s ashes , based on frank mccourt s pulitzer prizewinning memoir of growing up poor in limerick , ireland \( with alan parker directing robert carlyle and emily watson , as mr mccourt s parents \) the green mile , based on stephen king s serialized prison drama \( with frank darabont directing tom hanks , as a death row guard forced to confront well , you have to see it \) snow falling on cedars , based on david guterson s atmospheric drama about cultural conflict in the pacific northwest \( with scott hicks directing ethan hawke \) girl , interrupted , based on susanna kaysen s memoir of her year in a mental hospital in the 1960 s \( with james mangold directing winona ryder and angelina jolie \) stuart little , based on e b white s children s story \( with rob minkoff directing geena davis and a computergenerated mouse \) the talented mr ripley , based on patricia highsmith s coldblooded thriller \( with anthony minghella directing matt damon and gwyneth paltrow \) , and the cider house rules based on john irving s best seller \( with lasse halstrom directing tobey maguire and michael caine \) and that does n't even include a couple of adaptations of plays \( julie taymor s assertively idiosyncratic take on shakespeare s titus andronicus , shortened to titus , and matthew warchus s adaptation of sam shepard s simpatico \) or martha fiennes directing her brother ralph in onegin , an adaptation of pushkin s narrative poem but perhaps none of them faced a challenge quite like neil jordan s he was charged with finding a way to adapt the end of the affair , graham greene s autobiographical story of wartime love and spiritual anguish the film opened last week in new york and los angeles to generally positive reviews greene s drama is about a writer , not unlike himself , who is deeply embittered when a torrid affair with a friend s wife ends inexplicably during the london blitz but it s about more than that , also exploring issues of religious faith and conscience not usually dealt with in mainstream films , and it tries to explain , at least partly , why greene himself became a catholic the way i decided to structure the story , there are a series of pivotal events that are at the center of the story , mr jordan said he was not so concerned with the specific religious elements of the story as he was with the way greene built the plot , in which the central character \( played by mr fiennes \) completely misunderstands what is in the mind of his lover \( julianne moore \) mr jordan \( above \) said he shot some of his pivotal scenes more than once one encounter in a restaurant , for instance , is shot once from the point of view of mr fiennes and then , later , after we learn his lover s secret , from hers , and then yet again from the perspective of a private detective peering at them through the window the scenes play at different times in the movie , and each time the audience understands a little more about what is really happening the point is to show how easy it is to misinterpret what is on someone else s mind , even someone with whom you are on the most intimate terms that s one of the main reasons i wanted to make the movie , mr jordan said you read the book , and you get the sense of the novelist s state of mind , but greene had a wonderful story in there with a wonderfully ironic sequence of events , if seen from different points of view first we experience what happens with ralph , then again with julianne by adding these two perspectives together , yet another perspective emerges , something much more mysterious he also found it necessary to excise one of greene s supporting characters , a rationalist preacher who undergoes a miraculous cure that he cannot explain in my opinion , the preacher was the least successful character in the book , mr jordan said yet the character plays a role in the story s spiritual denouement , so mr jordan inserted a new character , the detective s child , to handle that chore to me , having a child in that situation just made it all much more mysterious and believable , he said accenting their words holiday prestige pictures also mean actors' tackling foreign accents , and this year has a bumper crop julianne moore is not the only american actress using a british accent jodie foster gives it a go in andrew tennant s anna and the king michael caine goes american in the cider house rules tom hanks tries a southern drawl in the green mile by comparison , the swedishborn max von sydow \( below \) has it easy in snow falling on cedars , playing a lawyer who happens to be a scandinavian immigrant to the pacific northwest
mike piazza kicked first base as his eighthinning fly ball was caught , a sudden and lonely gesture of frustration interrupting an evening of creeping , vexing futility the mets went down terribly quietly to the braves last night at shea stadium , 10 , and , for all the thrilling comebacks , heartstopping hits and headlinegrabbing bombast of the last three weeks , their season is now a whisper away from being finished down by 03 in the fourofseven national league championship series , the mets will try tonight to stave off what now seems nearly inevitable the elimination that seemed almost as inevitable two weeks ago , when the mets came within a stunning turnaround of missing the playoffs altogether this time , however , the mets cannot hope to salvage their season against a lowrent team like the pittsburgh pirates they must try to conjure another miracle actually four miracles in a row against the atlanta braves , who have beaten them 12 of the 15 times the teams have played this season , including eight times in the last three weeks they will send rick reed against john smoltz tonight in an effort to turn things around but no team in postseason baseball has ever come back from a 30 deficit if in the final week of the season the mets were trying to stop a plummet off a cliff , they are now attempting to climb out of a dark , deep abyss one made the more ominous because , after faltering in the first inning , al leiter outpitched the braves starter tom glavine but the mets , despite a lineup change , could not get one timely hit to erase a painful unearned run i never thought that run would cost us the game , said manager bobby valentine , who previously has reacted to losses with a mixture of anger and tense laughter last night he was stunned into near silence , shaking his head at the wonder of a team with a lineup bloated with 300 hitters unable to make up a firstinning run i thought we 'd score i felt it in my bones when was the last time you won a game without scoring \? leiter had struggled for much of the season , but had performed well in some of the mets' biggest games of late in his previous three starts , the mets beat atlanta to end a sevengame losing streak , beat cincinnati to clinch the wild card , and beat arizona to win the division series in that span , leiter had an earned run average of 190 the common denominator of all three starts leiter had not allowed a firstinning run , overcoming a secondhalf tendency to actually begin the game feeling too relaxed and unable to focus because he was so concerned about getting comfortable on the mound and figuring out the umpire s strike zone before last night s game , leiter noted how important it was for him to start well , because glavine was sure to be tough on the mets but the first inning was an exercise in clumsiness , and the fatal run developed in the most unlikely of circumstances , the first time all season that the mets committed two errors in one inning mike piazza and leiter , the battery , had together committed just 15 errors in the regular season leiter began the game with a fullcount walk to gerald williams on a 12 count , bret boone hit what appeared to be a routine comebacker to the mound leiter fielded the ball cleanly , then whipped to face second base for a moment then he turned his face toward first and fired , but the throw pulled john olerud way off the bag and leiter clutched his head as boone was safe i was thinking more about how i should be throwing to second while i was actually throwing to first , leiter said with runners at first and second with none out , leiter sent two pitches well inside to chipper jones , who popped up for the first out brian jordan was next , and as he took the first pitch , williams and boone took off for a double steal boone appeared to break late and piazza stepped up to throw to second base as he did , valentine said , he stepped on home plate and slipped just a bit the throw flew into center field and williams easily scored it s amazing , valentine said i guess without that we 'd still be playing but we still did n't score any runs the mets had reason for hope that they would not be buried by a lone run because a spectacular defensive play immediately minimized the damage jordan flied out to center field , but boone tagged up at third and headed for home melvin mora , in just his third start of the season as part of valentine s lineup shakeup , threw a perfect strike to piazza , validating valentine s belief that mora is the best defensive outfielder he has piazza braced for the hit and it came hard boone slammed into piazza s jaw , sending the catcher onto his back , where he lay , clutching the ball boone was out , and piazza nearly was , too he suffered a slight concussion but continued to play , and he actually got his first two hits of the series while wobbly not that it mattered leiter held off the braves for seven innings , allowing just three hits and striking out five he was aided by several defensive gems , most notably rickey henderson s twice throwing runners out while trying to stretch singles into doubles but the mets were stymied by glavine he threw seven innings , too , but allowed seven hits none of them were welltimed twice the mets stranded runners on third base they were the only two runners to get past first all night and only once , in the second inning , did the mets string two hits together valentine juggled the lineup to put space between the lefthanded hitters olerud and robin ventura , so that no braves reliever would be very likely to face both of them in the same inning the move meant that edgardo alfonzo , who was 4 for 8 entering the game , batted third but , as in the sevengame losing streak , nothing worked alfonzo was 0 for 4 with three strikeouts shawon dunston , pinchhitting for leiter in the seventh , reached first on a passed ball but then was thrown out trying to steal to end the inning ventura was 0 for 3 and looked so uncomfortable at the plate that he told valentine it was fine with him if valentine pinchhit for him something valentine had not done all season when the mets faced the braves reliever john rocker in the ninth even that move did n't work benny agbayani , who was also 0 for 4 , reached first on a fielding error by shortstop walt weiss to lead off the ninth but todd pratt , the hero of the division series when his home run in the 10th inning clinched a trip to the league championship series , struck out and mora , who had two singles earlier , flied out before rey ordonez grounded out to end the game the mets are batting 182 \( 18 for 99 \) in the series today we hit it , but not at the right time , alfonzo said we had pretty good chances we have to be doing things together all they may be doing together soon is packing up for a long winter inside pitch mike piazza had xrays on his left hand , which was hit by gerald williams s bat on a backswing in the eighth he has a bruised knuckle below his pinky , but no broken bones photos mets catcher mike piazza holding on to the ball for the out after a collision with the braves' bret boone , who

sex is n't sexy anymore this has become a glum and widely accepted fact of cultural life in these united states , where people tend to gag and reach for the remote when another graphic description of presidential activity emerges from the television even the new york theater , hardly known in recent years for keeping its fingers on the national pulse , is reflecting this sensibility check out , if you can find a ticket , the blue room , david hare s comic drama of copulation and its discontents , on broadway at the cort theater do you think that the 10 erotically entwined characters played by nicole kidman and iain glen are having any fun \? for that matter , is the audience \? or take a look at the broadway dance show fosse , a celebration of the great sensualist choreographer bob fosse , in which the saucy fosse style is delivered with emptyeyed , robotic athleticism the thrill is gone and do n't even ask about footloose , the sanitized gym class of a musical about teenagers in love if you want to have a good time at a play about sex , you might do better in the experimental hinterlands of off broadway specifically , you might take a look at richard foreman s paradise hotel , an abstruse but very lively study of carnal appetites by the ontologicalhysteric theater at st mark s church of course , you should know that its essential premise is that sex really is n't sexy , something the performance fully confirms but at least the show is up front about its intentions , and it manages to generate considerable wit and energy in carrying them out mr foreman has been the reigning philosopher vaudevillian of the new york avantgarde for three decades now , creating fractured dreamscapes in which life is the banana cream pie that keeps hitting you in the face his starting point is that the world is unknowable , self is a question mark , and existence is one long chain of frustrations his plays are always , on one level , the same yet mr foreman slyly varies them in ways that reflect the shifting society outside , unknowable though it may be the execution of his shows , from their phantasmagorical sets to their displacing use of sound , remains as polished and precise as a disney production , and somehow he continues to invest existential anxiety with the adolescent vigor of alanis morissette in her prespiritual days sex has always been a component of mr foreman s work , one of the many guy wires that trip up his hapless , questing characters the subject took center stage last year with his benita canova , which presented a balthusian girls' school of cunning , sadistic little vixens paradise hotel , however , is his baldest consideration of the erotic impulse in it , sex is something that everybody talks about and nobody does anything about think of a speededup , plotless eric rohmer movie directed by mack sennett , and you start to approach the mindset of paradise hotel as it turns out , the hotel of the title has another name that is a common fourletter anglosaxon word for sexual congress , a word that is repeated over and over and in assorted contexts by the evening s five principal characters whether used as a verb , a noun or an epithet , the word would seem to have a talismanic power for its speakers , a promise of transporting erotic activity not a chance like chekhov s mopey provincial sisters pining for moscow , mr foreman s sex seekers think that life would be dandy if they could only arrive at that hotel , a palace of carnal delights but they never get there , or if they do , they do n't know it anyway , it seems that the paradise hotel is always threatening to turn into the hotel of beautiful roses , a place in which raw sex becomes merely sentimental that s the plot , and it s actually a lot of plot by mr foreman s standards it all transpires in a cluttered room in which clocks , golden baby dolls , skulls and all manner of overhead lighting fixtures can be discerned , as well as a sinister floating gorilla , whose presence is never referred to the overall effect is as if paintings by fragonard and magritte had caught fire and melted into one another a chorus of hardbitten , blackclad flapper types dance to the repeated phrase i'm happy , you 're happy a mysterious , exquisite naked woman , her head wrapped in cloth , briefly materializes , though none of the fellows dare touch her also making fleeting appearances are a small effigy of the hotel itself , which is most frustrating since nobody could possibly go inside it , and a large , carnivorous bag of dirty shoes people fall down a lot , commit suicide , come back to life and employ measuring tapes in vain hopes of quantifying the chaos around them are you following this \?

new delhi when i was young in india , for four years i reported a story i wrote of as the great adventure and believed was one of the most important of our century during the decade after india became independent a halfcentury ago , i relished that story almost alone among countries newly freed from colonialism , india had chosen and kept democracy as its governance the others mostly went quickly under hardboot government communism , fascism , militarism , juntaism , whatever it chose to be called each time i return , i know india s decision remains central and hopeful for itself and the world but america and its allies think about india with a mixture of condescension and irritability at its desire to be seen and heard when they think of it at all every indian government has resented india who \? but somehow managed to carry on for precisely a year , for instance , india has been writing some pages in its history that may shape the adventure as none since nehru died in 1964 and his congress party ousted itself from power by arrogance and corruption the current ruling coalition , 14 parties headed by the hinducentered bharatiya janata party , will stay in power or lose it depending on three things one is the ability of prime minister atal behari vajpayee to wean his party from the wildly bigoted hindufirst hardliners and toward a moderation they detest another is his stillforming economic strategy how far and fast will he move india from its mixture of private enterprise and strangulation by regulation toward economic openness inviting to investment \? but to move at all he will have to end the outbreak of persecution of the small christian minority churches have been burned , worshipers beaten and murdered the police dawdle a government investigation commission has publicly protested its lack of resources and power this in a country where a man once considered an untouchable is president , where people of almost every minority muslims , christians , sikhs , jews , buddhists have reached high office , where mother teresa received a state funeral it is a country where civil peace depends on the constitutional guarantees of equality among india s religions almost as many as the world s christians are only 2 percent of india s billion people but what one minority suffers , all others fear the persecution is the work of hindu nationalists supporting mr vajpayee he will have to choose between issuing one more denunciation of the persecution and taking action that will cost him extremist backing that helped bring him to office all these years , india s political and religious leaders and its wealthy have failed the indian people for hundreds of millions , the poverty is an insult to their very humanity india still has enough streetsleepers to populate a sizable nation scores of thousands in its capital live in hovels built on stilts so that perhaps during monsoons open sewers will not flood inside with excrement but through it all indians consistently insisted on their own fundamentalism the right to vote politicians into office , or out the west sometimes remembers india , as when india wins its attention by carrying out nuclear tests but kosovo , bosnia , somalia , bananas those are the big foreign concerns for americans also can we succeed in appeasing china , which is a perpetual threat to india \? can we make china stronger with trade that costs us military secrets and a yearly commercial imbalance of 50 billion \? europeans at least are consistent , historically regarding asia as a mango to be sliced up or squeezed into juice strange thing not a western word is said about where the world would be if indians had chosen the mao or stalin way , or saddam s we certainly would not be one bit condescending or irritable about india we would be too busy worrying about how to deal with a totalitarian axis running through asia , the pacific , the mideast and eastern europe , headquartered in beijing , moscow and new delhi if we were allowed to deal at all indians chose the freedom of democracy for their sakes , not ours still , it is nice to remember that choose it they did , and still are
reader , you are to know that i am one who naturally like stories and love the tactile , sensual feel of a freshly minted book as well as anyone i am a person whose appetite for a book is often particularly tempted by the lush coloring and crisp lettering of its cover further , that i am of a temper that is , if not outright technophobic , certainly not that of one who is a technophile yet notwithstanding any of this and recently settled comfortably in a chair with a resolve to read , i reached for a book well , it was n't really a book , or at least one consisting of printed pages bound together , but rather an electronic thing , paperless suddenly i was a power reader , and there was a new theatricality to the act of reading a medieval baron probably felt the same way the first time he held a gutenberg book for me , to my amazement , i must say , there was this wondrous feeling of fantasy , that i was perhaps a squire who had drawn my sword from its scabbard for the first time now , i have never experienced even an audio book , nor would i ever read a condensed edition of a printed book but someone had lent me this electronic book , an ebook as it is called this one was the rocket ebook , manufactured by nuvo media inc , a neat charcoal gray contrivance that in its classy stylishness reminds one of , say , a fine automobile , although it measures only 5 by 7 1 2 by 1 1 2 inches and weighs 22 ounces the device , whose reading screen is 4 1 2 by 3 inches \) costs 499 in the levenger catalogue with backlighting it can run for 17 hours on batteries without being recharged without backlight , for 33 hours there are at least two other ebooks out there , the softbook \( r \) , by softbook press inc and the millennium reader by librius inc the rocket ebook can store an average of 10 books , each 300 to 400 pages , which are available through barnesandnoblecom on the internet for about the price of a regular paperback book they can be downloaded a scary twilight word that i 've never used and a concept i'm not sure i 'll ever master onto one s computer and then onto an ebook my ebook contained jon krakauer s into thin air \( villard \) american sphinx the character of thomas jefferson by joseph j ellis \( alfred a knopf \) , and the modern library edition of emily bronte s wuthering heights enough reading for more than one transcontinental flight or , if fully loaded , several weeks at the beach i'm not a gadget wonk , but the gizmo can do everything mark your place , allow you to write notes in the margin , highlight juicy paragraphs , call up a dictionary if needed , change type sizes , add backlighting for reading in dark rooms , and more a lot , although i am sure true techies will have many demands for improvement , particularly when it comes to the ease of loading it up with literature what is it like to read on such a device \? it must be stated that the screen draws one s eyeballs like a magnet , sort of bewitching them into staring , and therefore reading , as if one s pupils were independent of the mind two wellplaced buttons on the book s spine scroll pages forward or backward , and a font with comfortablesize type will produce a page displaying about 100 words that is less than a third the number on a printed book s page , but this can easily be adjusted to bigger and smaller type and thus fewer or more words it could be the novelty , the feeling that at last even i have at least tiptoed into the the computer world , but i must admit , hesitantly , that i liked the little machine but it does have drawbacks , or , more precisely , annoynances one is not surprised or distracted by starting at the top of a book book in midsentence in a book made from trees , there s a flow from the bottom of the previous page or the eye can quickly return there in the ebook a page can start this way and shock at one point during my research i asked three other people to recount an incident all four of us had witnessed high on the mountain , and none of us could agree \( from into thin air \) now , can anyone reading their ebook remember what came before and shock without stopping to hit the rewind button \? no what came before and shock , for those of you who want to know , was badly distorted by exhaustion , oxygen depletion which is the way one can feel , i assure you reader , with too much ebooking besides , i could never tell how far along i was somehow heathcliff and wuthering height s wickedness are more tolerable on the printed page , i found , than on the small screen , but nonetheless i have to ask whether i really want to lug a bound volume of wuthering heights , no matter how enticing , in my carryon bag when i can put that book and about nine others in my coat pocket and barely notice them \? and then there is the comfort factor like all readers , i can sit for hours with a book if its story purrs along , happily turning the pages , sometimes deep into the night with the ebook , after about an hour , the very eyeballs that were seemingly hypnotized and seduced by the gadget begin to complain even increasing the font size does n't help much , and , anyhow , the screen , though small , looks funny with too few words on it still , the ebook is not a passing thing , but here to stay as it becomes cheaper and improved nonetheless , it is really no more than a screen upon which to read , and it is clear that when enough people start reading them , electronic books will do for the ophthalmologists what taffy and caramels did for dentists photo a rocket ebook , one of several electronic books on the market \( igor vishnyakov for the new york times \)
because he was convinced that terrorists could have been behind the 1996 explosion of twa flight 800 off long island , a senior fbi official tried to suppress an early federal report that found the cause to be mechanical failure , not sabotage , according to investigators for a senate subcommittee they said that in january 1997 , six months after the plane crashed into the atlantic , killing all 230 people aboard , james k kallstrom , who was in charge of the fbi s new york office , urged the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms not to forward its report to the national transportation safety board , which by then was leaning toward a conclusion of mechanical failure when atf officials objected , saying that aviation safety was potentially at stake , mr kallstrom went over their heads to raymond j kelly , then the undersecretary of the treasury for law enforcement , who ordered that the report be withheld , the subcommittee investigators said in later internal memorandums , mr kallstrom whose agency had taken an early lead among various federal agencies investigating the crash disparaged the atf findings as speculative theory , and unprofessional and reprehensible the report said there was no evidence of a bomb or missile neither mr kallstrom , who is retired , nor mr kelly , who is now the united states customs commissioner and was in ireland yesterday , could be reached for comment debbie weierman , a spokeswoman for the fbi in washington , declined to comment on the matter last night joseph valiquette , an fbi spokesman in new york , said i never had any knowledge that there was ever any effort on the part of kallstrom or anyone at the fbi to discourage the atf from issuing their report the fbi has previously said it gave the atf report to the safety board in march 1997 , with a cover letter from mr kallstrom safety board officials said last week that there was no record that the report had been received , and no trace of any cover letter in the board s log of official correspondence but yesterday , a senior official of the board said that his agency had , in fact , received a copy of the atf report over the transom , although no one could remember precisely when in any case , the official said , receiving the report was not a very memorable event because it only confirmed what the board already knew this same official stressed that it was not his agency that was making an issue of the fbi s handling of the report the account of dissembling by the fbi official came as the senate judiciary committee s subcommittee on administrative oversight prepared to open a hearing today on the fbi s role in the case and on the 24page atf report , which was competed in january 1997 but while the account cast new light on bureaucratic infighting during the tw a 800 inquiry , there were no indications that withholding the report had endangered public safety , or had even affected the perceptions of the safety board investigators or the progress of the investigation in the months after the crash in july 1996 , investigators for the safety board , which ordinarily has jurisdiction over crash inquiries until criminality is established , worked closely with counterparts from the atf and understood informally that they had no evidence of a bomb or missile indeed , by october 1996 several months before the atf made its report safety board officials were saying publicly that the cause of the crash was probably mechanical , a view not endorsed by mr kallstrom and the fbi the washington post reported yesterday the attempts by mr kallstrom to suppress and disparage the atf report a member of the senate subcommittee staff described virtually the same findings to the new york times on friday on condition that they not be published until the morning of the subcommittee s hearing today the subcommittee staff member said that if the fbi had told the safety board about the atf findings promptly , the federal aviation administration and the airlines over which it has jurisdiction might have moved faster to accept recommendations , made in december 1996 , to reduce the risk of future explosions by changing the atmosphere in fuel tanks but the effect on air safety of the bureaucratic squabbling within the investigative agencies is hard to measure , according to officials and aviation experts and the fbi s stubborn adherence to the theory of a bomb or missile did not appear to have much influence on the debate in the community of airlines and federal regulators for example , the safety board s recommendations on fuel tank changes , which came a month before the atf report , were instantly unpopular with the airlines and even with some independent safety experts but in interviews at the time , none cited the stillopen criminal investigation most said they were disturbed only because the airlines , before a definitive finding , were being asked to make costly changes to preclude a problem that seemed to occur very infrequently
nyack as a playwright , gen leroy has big really big and oh , so serious notions but missing footage , a lumbering title for a preposterous play about a luminous ballerina , is , if anything , more a pilot for a soap opera than a metaphor for art and life , even though ms leroy writes about fueling souls , cutting wings and other such activities the play , at the helen hayes performing arts center here , presumes to tell about the perils of celebrity worship , the phoniness of performers , the machinations and caprices of boards of directors \( not to mention artistic directors \) , the pressures of nonprofit arts companies and all manner of betrayal professional and personal on an epic scale , as one character says even though it is hard to believe tanya gingerich \( as julianna ricci , the greatest dancer of her generation \) when she laments her pathetic extension , the actress gives little evidence of past glory , or of an alcoholic or drug addict in rehab did fans really clamor for her glamour \? was she ever really unhinged \? the abrasive , camerawielding marcia etthridge , whose father has important media connections , is under the delusion that she wants to jumpstart julianna s career resurrecting an icon is the way someone says it by filming a documentary of her life the controlling marcia is vicariously living that life and marcia is every grasping publicist come to nightmarish life it is impossible to believe that julianna is to appear in a silent screentype version of nazimova s life , but then , no one has to believe it because the director dies lynn drew , the sort of maid nobody ought to have , is part selfeffacing mother image to julianna , part aging groupie who ca n't get a life just when you expect julianna to be handed a drunk scene , lynn has one , and it is dreadful the role falls to the accomplished anne rogers \( sorry , ms rogers \) both younger \( marcia \) and older \( lynn \) women vie for possession of julianna , and you can bet they tell each other off meanwhile , julianna s selfworshiping gay soul mate , anton mate , pops in , in various black tops \( some seethrough \) and leather pants did the fabulous willa kim really design these costumes \? is julianna and anton s relationship inspired by the classic fonteynnureyev partnering \? i was wonderful , anton tells julianna you made me astonishing or is julianna a composite of manicdepressive prima ballerinas \? as rob sedgwick s performance as anton wears on , he somehow becomes more effeminate and more thickly hungarian , while ms gingerich remains not very italianate anton suggests he and julianna have a child that could turn out like pizza goulash you are my muse , anton says in one of the play s better lines come amuse me the audience is told that julianna s unorthodox interpretations of giselle and juliet angered purists , told of her breakdown , told of her outofcontrol tantrums it s not that the divine fire has been extinguished there seems to have been none there in the first place and marcia keeps talking about her frayed nerves , but in tracy shayne s performance that appears to be the routine way to get through the day speaking of dancing , julianna says , especially in this particular profession , everything must come to an end oh ! accompaniments by elgar , stravinsky and tchaikovsky do not save the show as missing footage keeps promising to sound off with its last words , it seems that scene after scene , whether confrontational or just chattering , under the flummoxed direction of tony walton , who is married to ms leroy , could and should really end the play then julianna tells us about the disappearance of her burning need to be creative and about the very real need to reclaim her own life and ms leroy keeps on telling us about the play she wishes to write missing footage at the helen hayes performing arts center in nyack performances through april 25 box office 3586333
the day after pee wee reese died , my friend bob fitzpatrick called and said i had to write something not really , i told him our people had done an excellent job in the paper , and i felt no need to add anything come on , my friend said you were a dodger fan , like me pee wee was a class act there s always more to say about pee wee i'm going to be very disappointed if you do n't i have long maintained that i want my columns accessible to the reader who is not a hardcore sports fan i like to say i write for a female reader , maybe a retired teacher who lives on the upper west side of manhattan , who reads her new york times along with her morning coffee and danish the truth is , there is no one typical reader , but there are indeed people who pick up the paper every day who know the score , who have expectations there s a lady in massachusetts with a cat named baggio who monitors my soccer output there s a lawyer in cleveland who knows his stuff my man taxerman keeps me respectful toward the yankees my three children my wife and my friend bob , who used to live a few blocks away you nailed that one , bob might say or , you let me down on this one now he was after me to write about pee wee reese , calling me in his unmitigated new england accent wait a minute , i said you come from northern connecticut , right on the cusp between yankeeland and red soxland how come you 're a dodger fan \? he told me how his father had taken him down to the hectic little bandbox called ebbets field in the 40 s , and how he saw pete reiser when he was whole , pee wee reese and then jackie robinson we were a brooklyn dodger household , said sean , his oldest son , the other day we were taught to hate the yankees at an early age he kept a shrine to the 1955 dodgers in his library , a picture of ebbets field he was really into it by the time bob and sharon fitzpatrick and their four children and their house full of books made it down from new england in the late 60 s , so bob could rise in the lord taylor hierarchy , the dodgers were long gone it helped me immensely to know that my friend , with his amherst education , was equally passionate about cormac mccarthy short stories and sports at their best for years , we took in an afternoon at the united states open , watching connors and borg , evert and navratilova , and maybe even the female spectators in the stands , while we giggled like teenagers playing hooky on sunday mornings for years there was a touch football game in the park bob , who was nearly a decade older than me and 10 yards quicker , could breeze past me , but then again so could leo the lawyer and sam the urban affairs expert tennis was more of the same bob did not believe in courtesy points or grace games , and neither did i he played his best , and expected his opponent to look out for himself , even if it meant a 60 drubbing for me in real life , bob and sharon were also classicists they were a handsome couple paul newman and joanne woodward might work and they dressed well and entertained well sharon gallantly brought her love of literature with her every day to a challenging teaching job in hempstead , ny , and she also wrote for herself , without the journalist s daily concern about the typical reader her novels and her poems were taking form time was on her side bob endured a serious illness , went through the treatments , and kept running i would see his lean figure jogging past our house , and i would open the door and applaud , and he would slow down and wave when they retired , they moved farther out on the island he would call every so often to praise or prod life was serene , he said , plus they had their projects i can see them on the night of oct 30 , welldressed for the flight , none of the sweatpants grunge favored by many travelers these days i can imagine sharon studying a serious guide to the pyramids , so she would know what she was seeing , bob perhaps with a mahfouz novel from their wellstocked shelves , so he would have the feel of cairo i can imagine them snuggling together and feeling the egyptair jet s roar , taking them on the trip of a lifetime when we heard the terrible news , i thought of our last conversation , about the old shortstop who had shown us how to live and die with grace upon bob s hectoring , i had worked out a way to pay homage to the captain without intruding on the fine work my colleagues had already done i wrote about latterday pee wee reeses athletes of today we can admire derek jeter adam graves michelle akers david robinson the night the column appeared , bob called me and said , i knew you could do it the job , as well as the living , gets just a little tougher now photo bob and sharon fitzpatrick of long island were among the 217 killed in last weekend s egyptair flight 990 crash \( courtesy of fitzpatrick family \)
just about now a certain winterweariness sets in , at least for those of us who live in the country every morning and evening you can feel the sun pushing back the margins of night , and it s a dull soul who has n't checked sunrise or sunset against his watch several times by now , struck by how early the light comes and how late it begins to go but that just makes a day of heavy overcast and freezing rain feel all the worse , more of an impairment than it would have been when the sodden year was still shrinking the rain falls as it has all winter , over ice and snow , as if to make a nonetoosubtle point about the climate in this part of new york state , a point that those of us who live here start to take seriously only about now the rain falls on frozen ground , and the barnyard looks medieval , a vile compost tea brewing in every puddle where the bird feeders hang , it looks as though we 're running a goldfinch feedlot sullen birds shoulder each other aside and seem to squabble more than finches ordinarily do , which is constantly the other day a mob of robins appeared in the lower pasture on a southeastern slope where the ice cap had retreated they moved like shore birds across the frozen turf , stuttering forward and falling back , not just that lone bird the first robin , sign of spring but a herd , as though there would n't be enough assurance in the sight of only one i filled the horses' water tank the other morning , and as i did a pileated woodpecker cut across the hillside with a cry of demented hilarity on dry , cold mornings , the woodpecker goes to work at early light stitching a row of holes in a hollow tree trunk , waking the woods from hibernation , raising the sap in the sugar maples there s nothing prognosticative about the pileated woodpecker s presence , as far as i can tell it lives here year round , and its plumage does n't seem to change , nor does its lunatic cry before long , the woodpecker will begin trying to drill through the metal roof of the barn the way it did last year it will sound as though the world were an empty 55gallon drum with only the bird on the outside , hammering away the racket puzzles even the crows in the ash trees , and they are foxed by nothing one day soon the rain will let up , and the frost will leave the ground as stealthily as it came there will be yielding all around and a sudden insistent adhesion in the barnyard the urge to clean away winter from the corners of the lawn , from the deep shade beneath the hemlocks , will become irresistible but all of this hides somewhere on the next page of the calendar the good news now lies deep within the beehive , where the workers , their dead cast aside into the melting snow , have set the queen laying eggs once again verlyn klinkenborg

none of the jets and especially their coach came right out and said it , but an anonymous poll of the players might well have shown that they are quite content to meet the jacksonville jaguars , and not the miami dolphins , in their american football conference divisional playoff game next sunday of course , that will hardly be the party line now that jacksonville with its erratic 2510 victory over the inefficient new england patriots yesterday is the opponent but as the pro bowlbound linebacker mo lewis said after having seen jacksonville s films last week , look at the advantage we have on them and they do n't have on us the jets spent three days of their bye week focusing on the jaguars , the central division champions , whom they have not faced in two seasons but jets coach bill parcells knows jacksonville coach tom coughlin , who was parcells s wide receivers coach for three seasons with the giants , including the 1990 super bowl championship team preparation has been a hallmark of the jets this season , especially with their everchanging defenses orchestrated by bill belichick , the assistant head coach after having successfully contained the scrambling quarterbacks doug flutie and steve mcnair , belichick will try to construct a defense that can contain a hobbled mark brunell brunell played gallantly , but stolidly , yesterday and admitted afterward that footwork is something i have to work on this week he has a highankle sprain and returned a week earlier than he had hoped to a healthy vinny testaverde knows the jaguars he faced them six times in the three seasons before he came to the jets , and he has an 06 record against them as a starter it s irrelevant , testaverde said of his record against the jaguars , as he contemplated playing them again i played miami this year and i had never beaten them the jets beat the dolphins twice miami will face the broncos in denver on saturday , and the winners at denver and the meadowlands will meet in the afc championship game on jan 17 i do n't look at what s happened in the past and say , 'well , we 're not going to do well because i have n't had success against them , ' testaverde said i stay within the strengths of my team this jets team , he contends , has so many more weapons than the cleveland baltimore teams he had led against the jaguars this is a different team , he said i always had a lot of respect for jacksonville and the ability they have they 're banged up a little bit , yeah , but they always seem to have guys who come in and work within a system it helped going over the films of their games during the week what he and many of the jets' offensive players saw was jacksonville s zone blitz , a favored afc central tactic in which the defensive linemen slip back into pass coverage , freeing linebackers to blitz it s something we have n't seen too much this year , testaverde said , but it helped that we saw extra days of it lewis said of the jaguars and brunell they 're very explosive , with a lot of weapons we 've got to expect more passes from the left , where he rolls out he has a strong arm and the ability to get out to run linebacker bryan cox described the jaguars as having a real strong running game , a lot of balance , a real huge offensive line that tries to enforce their will on you , tries to control the ball but they can open it up when they want to because they 've got a scrambling quarterback who s very dangerous they all scramble , cox said of brunell and his backup , the rookie jonathan quinn i think it s something they teach when the jets return to the practice field tomorrow , they will be enjoying cold weather , and parcells believes his team will do better in it than almost any opponent it will face the jaguars , for example , will have played in the northeast only once in the last six weeks yet , defensive lineman ernie logan , who played for the jaguars in 1995 and 1996 , said they 're usually ready to play and to play hard for 60 minutes coughlin does a good job of getting them ready
washington , jan 6 the independent counsel kenneth w starr told a federal judge who is investigating his office over possible illegal grand jury leaks that it would have been appropriate for him to disclose to reporters information about negotiations with monica s lewinsky mr starr , in court papers released today by judge norma holloway johnson of federal district court , does not directly address whether he or anyone in his office were the sources for news accounts last year about his office s intense discussions with ms lewinsky over whether she would testify against president clinton but mr starr argued that to have done so would not have been illegal because the negotiations with ms lewinsky did not involve the grand jury david e kendall , mr clinton s chief lawyer in the leaks investigation , responded in court papers by saying that mr starr had starkly changed his position mr kendall told judge johnson that mr starr had argued earlier that none of his office s operations could be disclosed but took a new approach when confronted with evidence that he or his aides had discussed the lewinsky negotiations with reporters the issue of whether mr starr or someone in his office violated federal laws prohibiting prosecutors from disclosing matters before a grand jury has been raised forcefully by the white house the white house won a major victory last september when judge johnson ruled that 24 news accounts about the investigation of the president on their face showed that prosecutors in mr starr s office repeatedly and knowingly violated federal law by leaking grand jury testimony or other secret information the judge appointed a special master to investigate possible illegal leaks by prosecutors the master , john w kern 3d , a former judge here , was given the power to seize the prosecutors' phone records , logs , appointment calendars , memorandums and other documents to determine whether they had disclosed information to the news media it is unclear what progress , if any , judge kern has made , although he was expected to report to judge johnson by the end of 1998 almost all of the public knowledge of the leak investigation comes with a builtin time lag judge johnson has generally sealed documents in the case , only disclosing them selectively months later thus the documents disclosed today reflect the status of the case only as of oct 30 the last significant development in the new batch is judge johnson s rejection of mr starr s appeal to have her reconsider her september ruling in papers filed on oct 15 , mr starr had argued that 15 of the 24 news accounts did not violate grand jury secrecy rules he said that eight of those news accounts concerned the negotiations between his office and ms lewinsky s lawyer at the time , william h ginsburg the eight news accounts appeared in the new york times , the washington post and newsweek and were broadcast on nbc and cnn and variously attributed their information about the talks to prosecutors , one official and federal investigators charles bakaly , a press spokesman for mr starr , said he could not comment on the case because much of it was still under seal

rome , feb 17 last week , when the vatican closed its investigation into the killing of the commander of the swiss guards by one of his junior officers , it hoped the concluding report would finally set the scandal to rest it did not today , the grieving relatives of the slain swiss guard commander , lieut col alois estermann , and his wife , gladys meza romero , who was killed at his side , issued a fourpage letter addressed to journalists and distributed by the vatican press office the letter sought to shame the italian press and implored the media to stop printing rumors about the couple s marriage , but is likely instead to draw still more attention to the case the letter rejected categorically recent media reports , mostly prompted by coverage of a new book god s word , gay word , a roman a clef about the love affair of a senior officer in the swiss guards and one of his subalterns the book was inspired by colonel estermann , 43 , and a corporal , cedric tornay , 23 , who shot the colonel and his wife and then killed himself we do not accept the slightest suspicion about presumed hypotheses about tormented love stories or espionage with which some have tried to stain alois , the letter said we would be grateful if people would stop adding to the pain that we feel since the crime was discovered nine months ago , the vatican has tried hard to to dispel rumors that the killings were a crime of passion or the result of some other scandal in may , a few days after the murders , a few italian newspapers printed articles based on a rumor that colonel estermann was an east german spy , but that line of speculation died right away in closing the case last week , vatican investigators said corporal tornay carried out the killings when he became disgruntled after being passed over for a decoration they also said traces of cannibis had been found in corporal tornay s urine , as well as a cyst the size of a pigeon egg in his brain , which could have impaired his judgment but at the presentation of the new book , the author , massimo lacchei , told reporters that a year before the murders he attended a private brunch at the home of an elderly and important gay politician , where colonel estermann and corporal tornay were also guests he said that they were lovers , and that he had doubts about the vatican version of events instantly , italian newspapers and other publications published articles about the theory that colonel estermann and corporal tornay were gay lovers maria meza romero , a younger sister of the commander s wife , said she had seen news reports about the rumors in venezuela , and came to rome this week with her sisters to meet with colonel estermann s survivors and compose a joint letter at first , we paid no attention to these news stories , but then they started up again recently , with such lies and perversity , ms meza romero said we decided we had to do it none of the people who wrote about my sister and my brotherinlaw had the slightest knowledge of them as a couple if they did , they would n't write such unjust , false accusations mr lacchei now says he too feels like a victim , claiming that italian reporters distorted his words and made up quotes if i were a relative of estermann or tornay , i would be furious , too , he said the italian press is so irresponsible but mr lacchei did not retract his claims or say anything that might reassure the survivors he said he had no proof that the two swiss guards were lovers , but that their presence at the gay brunch and their behavior there certainly made him think so they were so intimate and friendly for a subordinate and a captain , he said he also said he had had a subsequent encounter with corporal tornay that confirmed his suspicions about the young corporal s sexuality in today s la repubblica , mr lacchei s lawyer wrote a letter laying out what his client had in fact said it included mr lecchei s assertion that colonel estermann was a frequent visitor at the elderly politician s gay salon , and brought corporal tornay , who might have been killed because he knew too much , had met too many important people that was certainly not the conclusion drawn by the vatican , which as a citystate has jurisdiction over crimes committed within its walls state criminal investigators were not shown the evidence , though the vatican did consult outside pathologists corporal tornay s mother , who had long insisted that her son was innocent and was the scapegoat of a broader conspiracy , does not accept the vatican explanation but the relatives of colonel estermann and corporal tornay do with deep pain and christian forgiveness we accept the conclusion of the vatican judiciary , their letter stated

with more than 80 beethoven ninth symphonies on the market , it is not surprising that a new version , even by a wellknown conductor , rarely causes so much as a blip on the cultural radar screen and the bloated record catalogue is not all that keeps a new ninth from being an event , as , say , the recordings of arturo toscanini and wilhelm furtwangler were 50 years ago the rise of pop culture , the graying of the classical audience and the beatings administered to european art music by the academic culture wars are all undermining the ninth s status as a cultural icon but 12 years ago , when sir roger norrington recorded the ninth on instruments of its time , aiming for a historically informed performance \( hip , as sir roger liked to joke \) , people talked controversy ensued , as did media coverage and charttopping sales the instruments were a novelty , and the performance was full of new ideas , infuriating though many listeners found them by the mid90 s , five other conductors had recorded periodinstrument ninths now , the belgian conductor philippe herreweghe has joined the club \( harmonia mundi france hmc 901687 \) the impressive singing and playing mr herreweghe elicits should silence any remaining complaints about earlymusic amateurism \( the few flat notes from the soprano could just as easily happen in a moderninstrument performance , and the singing is mostly admirable \) but this account respectable , to be sure , yet unremarkable suggests that 12 years of historical experimentation have brought on a side effect of maturity hip performances now have just as much right as their mainstream counterparts to be , well , nothing special periodinstrument performers were once held to higher standards of insight , or at least novelty , than their mainstream colleagues when they gave a boring mozart performance , it was taken as evidence that their whole enterprise was misguided perhaps the hip are no longer expected to be more interesting than the mainstream of course , being hip used to bestow a compensating advantage it would win performers unearned attention and praise that difference , too , is passing period instruments , for example , once guaranteed by themselves that a performance of the ninth would be interesting , but now they have lost their novelty even a few moderninstrument beethoven interpreters , like sir charles mackerras and nikolaus harnoncourt , find advantages in spicing up their modern sound with historical brasses and timpani paradoxically , the period timpani , for all the hype they have received , are weak points in mr herreweghe s otherwise excellent orchestra they sound tinny , undermining the power of the firstmovement recapitulation beethoven s metronome marks , some of which are astonishingly fast , have also lost their novelty after 12 years , although mr herreweghe s cd jacket makes a big point of them as if sir roger norrington had not done the same , or for that matter , such moderninstrument conductors as hermann scherchen and rene leibowitz before him current moderninstrument maestros like sir charles and david zinman also take these markings into account and so did toscanini , even in the 1920 s beethoven appears to have set some store by these markings , but over the last 12 years , dozens of critics have explained why metronome marks are more problematic than earlymusic enthusiasts used to acknowledge composers , to begin with , often take their own music faster or slower than the speeds they imagined when setting numbers to the page changes of mood can lead anyone \( including a composer \) to different tempos at different times besides , what sounds right inside the composer s head often needs adjustment to work with real instruments in real places beethoven could never make such adjustments with this symphony he was , after all , functionally deaf when he wrote it such deviations between what composers say and what they do may reflect something about tempo it seems a less defining element of a musical work than patterns of pitch , rhythm or harmony change the opening movement of , say , the beethoven fifth to a major key , and you have something everyone will recognize as fundamentally different from the original but play it a little slower than the metronome mark , and nobody will deny that it is the same piece insisting that there is something essential about following a metronome mark imposes a meaningless limit on performance it s like saying that your identity changes when your pulse goes through its usual ups and downs mr herreweghe comes closer than other conductors to the metronome marks , but he does make reasonable compromises his adagio , though fast , is still 15 percent below the metronome speed yet in treating metronome marks as ballpark figures rather than exact quantities , he is no different from other hip conductors like sir roger , or from moderninstrument maestros like sir charles , mr harnoncourt and claudio abbado in their ninths sensible though most of mr herre weghe s choices are , this feature is nothing to write home about
destroying the world to save it aum shinrikyo , apocalyptic violence , and the new global terrorism by robert jay lifton 374 pp new york metropolitan books henry holt company 26 if all had gone according to plan , november 1995 would have been quite a month according to japanese officials and prosecutors , the cult of aum shinrikyo was preparing to make tons of sarin nerve gas and release it in major japanese cities \( and possibly american ones as well \) aum is said to have intended to use its russianmade military helicopter and two smaller cropdusting helicopters to spread the nerve gas , and security experts estimate that hundreds of thousands could have been killed instead , early that same year , aum murdered one of its enemies in a particularly obvious way , and the police began to close in the cult s leader , shoko asahara , allegedly ordered his aides to release sarin in the tokyo subway system to distract the authorities , but at the time aum s best chemist was busy with religious rituals his substitute was rushed , and turned out lowgrade sarin , so when aum followers released the impure gas in the tokyo subway system on march 20 , 1995 , it killed only 11 people and injured only a few thousand and asahara is remembered as only a modest mass murderer , far short of the hitlerian scale to which he aspired robert jay lifton , a prominent american psychiatrist and author , warns in destroying the world to save it that other groups may pursue the aum model not just predicting an apocalypse but trying to bring it about asahara and aum have changed the world , and not for the better , lifton argues , and he explains , its members can claim the distinction of being the first group in history to combine ultimate fanaticism with ultimate weapons in a project to destroy the world lifton continues , the next group of disciples to try might not be quite as small as aum , or as inept , or as encumbered by its own madness the story of aum s rise and fall replete with sex , drugs and violence , with the guru forcing friend to kill friend , with the cult simmering old women in steaming hot baths , with cult leaders administering lsd and then claiming credit for the visions is mindboggling but it is already the subject of a fine narrative , david e kaplan and andrew marshall s cult at the end of the world the emphasis here is different , neither a simple recounting of aum s rise nor a detailed exploration of the security issues involved instead , lifton has zeroed in on aum s theology and on the psychology of the cult s members this reflects lifton s own expertise , for he had earlier studied nazi doctors as well as other cultlike phenomena unfortunately , what asahara thought is rather duller than what he did instead of scenes of aum leaders breaking into the home of an enemy lawyer and killing him and his wife and baby , we get dry theorizing like this this megalomanic guruism , the claim to possess and control immediate and distant reality , was not only wild fantasy but a form of desymbolization a loss , that is , of the symbolizing function that characterizes the healthy human mind this focus on the duller side of aum its theology and psychology would have worked better if lifton had had access to aum leaders but lifton acknowledges up front that he spoke in depth to only 10 former cult members , none of whom were highranking or involved in illegal behavior they were simply , like the vast majority of the aum members in japan , sincere young people looking for spiritual answers , credulous rather than criminal although lifton never met asahara , he draws a persuasive portrait of him , working from solid research in press reports and trial statements lifton describes the young guru , partly blind but able to see better than the other children at his school for the blind , bullying and dominating his classmates he also earned a black belt in judo and developed a love of drama some commentators have suggested that in aum shinrikyo he tried to recreate the environment of his boyhood lifton is at his best in explaining the mixedup feeling of asahara s disciples , the confusion that led them to obey the guru or rationalize what he did when lifton discusses some larger issues , his discussion is invariably thoughtful and informed yet i often found his arguments unpersuasive most significantly , i am skeptical of the idea that asahara has carried us across some rubicon , changing the world in a fundamental way millenary cults have been around for millenniums , and it seems unlikely that any new guru will prove as deadly as the man in mid19thcentury china who proclaimed himself the younger brother of jesus and led the taiping rebellion that uprising resulted in the deaths of countless millions of people and contributed to the collapse of imperial china and it would take quite a remarkable effort to match the biological weapons of the european settlers in america their introduction of smallpox mainly by accident but also by use of deliberately infected blankets helped wipe out much of the native population in the new world i am also unconvinced that cults are quite as dangerous as lifton seems to suggest the main surprise about aum was that it managed to go on for as long as it did without being stopped this had to do with an exceptional circumstance in japan , police and journalists alike are extremely wary of probing any religious organization for fear of being accused of religious persecution my guess is that if sarin or similar weapons are used to kill vast numbers of people any time soon , the source will probably be not a cult but north korea , which western intelligence experts believe has countless tons of pure sarin and whose artillery can easily reach seoul , the capital of south korea moreover , aum demonstrated that biological weapons are hard to get right , more so than chemical weapons the cult devoted millions of dollars and many years to developing anthrax and other biological weapons , and though it released them , apparently no one was infected none of this is to minimize the risks , and lifton is right that a hate group may eventually emerge with chemical or biological weapons whose power matches its rage but as worries go , he does not demonstrate that this should be near the top of our list of concerns
washington , sept 24 in the tense days and hours before and after they signed an agreement to buy a white house in chappaqua , ny , for 17 million , president clinton and hillary rodham clinton sought financial assistance from former treasury secretary robert e rubin and two former white house chiefs of staff , according to several people with knowledge of the arrangement but mr rubin , as well as the chiefs of staff , thomas f mclarty 3d and erskine b bowles , declined to help the clintons buy the first home they will own since 1983 , several people with knowledge of the requests said today they said that mr bowles had originally committed to being the guarantor but declined on sept 1 , just three days after the clintons signed an agreement to buy the house under the condition their loan would be guaranteed the couple then quickly put out feelers to mr rubin and mr mclarty before finally asking terry mcauliffe , the prolific democratic fundraiser , who agreed to guarantee the clintons' mortgage by depositing 135 million in the bank as collateral the mcauliffe guarantee was criticized by republicans and public watchdog groups because mr mcauliffe is also raising millions for the clintons' legal defense fund , the clinton presidential library to be built in little rock , ark , and the first lady s allbutcertain senate campaign in new york state now , three people knowledgeable about the matter say , the clintons are considering seeking a mortgage from a different lender who would not require collateral that would eliminate mr mcauliffe s role it had not been known publicly that the clintons , apparently through intermediaries , had sought help from both mr rubin and mr mclarty the washington post previously reported that mr bowles had agreed , then refused to assist the clintons before mr mcauliffe stepped in earlier this month to put up his own money to cover the full value of the clintons' mortgage with bankers trust none of the three would comment on the matter and it was not clear why they all turned the clintons down mr mcauliffe also would not comment the clintons , indebted by 5 million in legal bills , have slightly more than 1 million in assets , according to their most recent financial disclosure report , made public in may leaders of several public watchdog groups said that the refusals by mr mclarty and mr rubin demonstrate that the favor done by mr mcauliffe was even more important to the clintons than anyone had first realized this is a president who has never had any compunction about going around with a tin cup , said charles lewis , the founder and executive director of the center for public integrity most people would have a very , very difficult time asking someone to write a check for 13 million the approaches to mr clinton s friends were deliberately indirect mr rubin , for example , was never asked outright to help the clintons finance the house instead , according to one person familiar with the delicate dance , he received a quiet inquiry about whether he would be receptive to a direct appeal but he demurred , and the subject never came up again mr rubin declined to discuss the matter , except to say , i spent six and a half years in the administration and i never discussed the president s business during that time and i'm going to stick to that policy now mr rubin , the chief architect of the clinton administration s economic policy , resigned from the cabinet in july before joining the administration , he was cochairman of goldman , sachs company , the investment banking firm , and reported making 265 million in 1992 several years ago , his net worth , mostly in family trusts , was estimated to be 100 million mr mclarty , a close friend of mr clinton since they attended kindergarten together in hope , ark , declined through a spokesman to comment on the matter using mr mclarty s nickname , his assistant , carl lingenfelter , said , mack does not want to comment on any of his private conversations with the president or the first lady mr mclarty s net worth was recently estimated to be 107 million last year , he sold a 51 percent interest in his 19 auto dealerships in arkansas to asbury automotive group of pennsylvania mr bowles did not return several calls this week a longtime confidant of mr clinton , he is a general partner at the new york buyout firm of forstmann little company in his 1997 financial disclosure report , mr bowles estimated his family s net worth at 30 million to 60 million two people close to the clintons said today that the couple was now considering taking out a mortgage with another bank that will not require collateral the clintons intend to put down 350 , 000 as a deposit , or more than 20 percent of the cost jim kennedy , a spokesman for the white house counsel s office , declined to comment the clintons' unorthodox financing arrangement has drawn harsh criticism from several republicans , including mayor rudolph w giuliani of new york , who , like the first lady , is considering a bid for united states senate next year a millionthree is a lot of money somebody putting it in the bank for you is quite unusual , mr giuliani said last week on his radio show one person close to the first family said that the clintons , especially mrs clinton , had been genuinely concerned that they might not qualify for a mortgage in august , several mortgage lenders contacted by the new york times said that despite the clintons' enormous legal bills , the couple would have no problem qualifying for an unsecured mortgage because they would almost certainly earn millions of dollars from book contracts , speaking engagements and service on corporate boards the whiteshingled , fivebedroom house in chappaqua that the clintons are buying had been shown to the public only three days by its owners , dr jeffrey weisberg and his wife , cheryl they then invited closed bids , which were opened at 3 pm on sunday , aug 29 not long afterward , the clintons , who were at the time on vacation in the hamptons , were informed that the weisbergs were prepared to sell the house to them but of the eight bids submitted on the house , the clintons had tied with another bidder for the highest price , 17 million , one person with knowledge of the deal said today it was not until the following wednesday , sept 1 , that the clintons learned that mr bowles had decided not to back the loan the clintons then quickly tried to find someone else to back the mortgage as they put out feelers to mr rubin and mr mclarty , the clintons worried that they might not find a guarantor and could lose the house it weighed very heavily on hillary , said one person close to the clintons she was very worried that they were going to lose the house she was distraught on thursday , sept 2 , mr and mrs clinton , who were vacationing just outside syracuse , asked mr mcauliffe personally for his help mr mcauliffe and the president had played golf together that day mr mcauliffe did not hesitate to help , this individual said terry would do anything for them , this person said he clearly knew there were consequences to helping them and that he would put himself in harm s way , but he was ready to take the heat photo a loan guarantee from a fundraiser that allowed the clintons to buy this house in chappaqua , ny ,

more than a year late but now finally arriving , shiny new bi level coaches are transforming diesel service on the long island rail road and inspiring awe in customers who long ago grew surly about riding the railroad s dingy , rickety diesel trains you see this look of wonder when they board these new cars , said lawrence h silverman , chairman of the long island rail road commuter council , the railroad s watchdog group their eyes are rolling they break out in smiles it has been such a long time coming and people suffered for so long they appreciate it all the more and when the coaches are being drawn by one of 23 new dualmode locomotives that can run on diesel or thirdrail electricity , passengers will have a oneseat ride all the way to penn station , with no change at jamaica officials estimate that the improved diesel service will swell the number of rides taken by 25 million above the railroad s current annual total of 76 million they also expect to lure thousands of customers back to diesel lines they abandoned for electrified ones farther from home if they perform as good as they look , mr silverman said , the railroad may be able to shed its reputation for failure in the next century he was expressing the highest possible expectation for a railroad whose thorny relationship with riders is legendary but he added a catch the electric fleet , which serves 91 percent of the lirr s passengers every morning rush hour it is not as old or uncomfortable as the diesels , but just as prone to breakdown the big asterisk here is that the electric fleet is near or at the end of its useful life , mr silverman said and now it s going to continue to be a problem for years to come the bilevel coaches feature entrylevel handicapped seating areas just inside the doors upper and lower decks are reached by stairs the seating arrangement is distinctly different from the old lirr doubledeckers that went out of service in the 1950 s cantilevered seats extend in a legless suspension that seems to defy gravity while adding to the spare look of the coach interior easier cleaning and more legroom for riders were the goals , the railroad said at the customers' request , there are no armrests between adjoining seats to invite territorial disputes fouracross , twobytwo seating in twotone blue , siliconecushioned seats replaces the fiveacross , threebytwo seating customers rejected the seats are ergonomically correct they offer headrests and lumbar support , and the baggage rack is padded to protect heads but what is most striking to customers is the seamless , jounceless ride the coaches deliver , together with a noise level that is a whisper compared to the rumble of the old cars an improved suspension system makes the difference , the railroad said the customers and the employees are both raving about them , said thomas j prendergast , the railroad president we are very pleased tim zander , a sixfootfour mechanical engineer from stony brook , seemed wedged into his seat on a bilevel coach traveling between port jefferson and huntington the other day but he said he was still enjoying the ride it s a pleasure , he said i'm used to being crammed another doubledecker passenger on the port jefferson line , thomas w goizueta of stony brook , said this is 100 percent better than the old cars they should all be like this mr goizueta was alluding to a point that has almost been lost amid the glee the continuing delay in getting the entire fleet of bilevel trains into service the current schedule calls for all 134 bilevel coaches to be rolling by august they were originally promised by last summer so far , 44 of the silvery , boxylooking coaches have entered service on the port jefferson , oyster bay and montauk branches , and are soon to run east of ronkonkoma the 412 million purchase also includes 46 new general motors locomotives , of which 13 have been delivered none of the 23 dualmode locomotives is in service yet mr silverman , who in addition to heading the commuter council is also a board member of the mta , said production problems had caused delivery delays that prolonged the agony for riders on the old cars all the new equipment was supposed to have come in by now , he said but mr prendergast and c p chip kalkhof , the railroad s general manager for new fleet and equipment engineering , said the delay was normal for such an order they are late but they are not atypically late , said mr prendergast manufactured by mitsui company and kawasaki rail car , the coaches are still rolling off production lines in yonkers and kobe , japan each costs about 15 million and carries about 144 passengers , compared to about 118 in the old coaches mr kalkhof said production problems including leaky doors that let rain in had been resolved we really have all the problems behind us now , he said well , not quite one passenger found problems with a cellular phone , another feature of the new coaches it s weird , said greg alfieri , a welder from port jefferson i tried to make a collect call , it said 'push starthree , ' i pushed starthree and then it just goes , 'thank you for riding the long island rail road' and then i was disconnected
like many manhattan residents , olga hayes is used to doing her major grocery shopping outside the borough in her case , at the pathmark on bruckner boulevard in the bronx and picking up a few things between trips at her local food stores lately , however , ms hayes , who lives on east 114th street in east harlem , has noticed that the associated market two blocks from her home is looking nicer the items she wants are placed at eye level instead of out of reach , and she no longer spots canned goods on display after the expiration date has passed the quality of the fruits and vegetables is not great , ms hayes said as she left the market one night last week with enough soda and juice to get her family through the weekend but they 've changed a lot of things in there it is probably no coincidence that this transformation is occurring just as something else has happened to ms hayes s neighborhood a 15 million pathmark supermarket , about eight times the size of the independently owned associated that ms hayes patronizes , opened april 15 on 125th street and lexington avenue built with private and public money by two black community groups , it is the first chain supermarket to open in harlem in three decades and the first major commercial development completed in the neighborhood since the riots of the late 1960 s on friday , gov george e pataki and other dignitaries will gather on the rooftop of the pathmark to welcome the store in most communities , the opening of a grocery store would not be something to make a fuss over , much less invite the governor to but this pathmark in this community is a very big deal because harlem has been without a chain supermarket for so long , and because this one was delayed so long , in part by a bitter fight put up by owners of independent markets for many people in the neighborhood , who have often had to pay more for inferior quality or travel long distances to have the kind of choices that residents of other neighborhoods take for granted , the pathmark became more than just a grocery store we 've been waiting a long time for a nice supermarket in harlem , said dorothy reece , a retired clerical worker who lives at 135th street and park avenue in harlem , we always have to wait for everything , so we 're used to that one of thousands of harlem residents who have already been sizing up the new 24hour pathmark , ms reece said she was so dissatisfied with the meat available at her local markets that she often used to ask her daughter to shop for her in the bronx ms reece predicted that the pathmark would force the independent markets to work hard to compete even though the broccoli at her local associated and ctown was cheaper 119 a bunch compared with 150 pathmark s was more appealing , so i do n't mind spending the extra change , ms reece said but several shoppers said they were disappointed by pathmark s prices for me , it s a beautiful place just to look , said josefa perez , who lives on 115th street but does not plan to return to the new store until the prices have dropped harvey gutman , a senior vice president of pathmark , said he was unaware of these complaints but he added to the extent that we 're not properly priced on a particular item , that s something we 'll be correcting the new pathmark , one of three in manhattan , occupies a section of east 125th street that is disfigured by tattoo parlors , boardedup windows , and rolldown gates covered with graffiti near the store s entrance , men with shopping carts full of bottles and cans recently lined up in front of the recycling machines not far away , a small crowd of people with shopping carts crammed with bags of groceries waited for gypsy cabs for people accustomed to the cramped aisles that are typical of manhattan markets , the new pathmark \( which is about the same size as its sister store on the lower east side \) is almost breathtaking in its spaciousness it has 25 aisles that are more than wide enough for twoway shoppingcart traffic and it offers a large array of products for hispanic shoppers an aisle full of packaged or canned food , a special section of personalcare products , and a sizeable selection of root vegetables like yuca there is a deli counter , a separate seafood section and enough varieties of cheese to satisfy charleen jones , a nurse at north general hospital ms jones said she used to order cheese through the mail and go downtown to find stouffer s frozen products for her son or hot ketchup to spice up her meals carolyn boyd , a secretary from central harlem , said she was used to dragging her two young sons from store to store to get her shopping done i'm just going crazy in here , ms boyd said everything i need in a store is right here the market also contains a chase manhattan bank branch , a pharmacy and rooftop parking for 125 cars for decades , most big supermarket chains had stayed away from the inner city the buying power of residents was assumed to be minimal , and the likelihood of shoplifting and other types of crime seemed all too real but pathmark has operated in tough new york neighborhoods since 1965 , when it opened the bruckner boulevard market then pathmark started opening stores in partnership with community groups first in the bedfordstuyvesant section of brooklyn in 1979 and in newark s central ward in 1990 the success of both markets convinced the company that there was money to be made in underserved communities today , about two dozen of pathmark s 133 supermarkets are in urban locations , mr gutman said but none has taken as long to open as the one in east harlem
devils 4 , penguins 2 with philadelphia s eric lindros out for the rest of the regular season , the only challenge the devils face for first place in the atlantic division could come from the pittsburgh penguins and it would take a dramatic collapse by the devils because they came much closer to securing the division title yesterday with a 42 victory over the penguins in pittsburgh goals by jason arnott and dave andreychuk 26 seconds apart early in the second period put the devils on track for their 25th victory on the road they need two more to tie the league record for road victories in a season , and they have four road games left the devils \( 412211 \) are more interested in winning a division title for the third consecutive season , and yesterday s triumph extended the devils' margin over the penguins to 7 points the devils also have two games in hand on the penguins \( 362614 \) the devils won 4 of 5 games against the penguins this season today , goalie chris terreri made his 11th appearance of the season , improving his record to 731 we stayed focused against them because they 're a threat to our position in the standing , the devils' bobby holik said we 've come up with good matchups against them with terreri playing this game , martin brodeur will most likely play this afternoon when the rangers visit the devils it will be the coach s decision , brodeur said i was going to play today , but i felt a little something in my knee terreri was a spectator in the first period as he faced only three shots , none dangerous , while the action centered around pittsburgh s goal , where jeansebastien aubin was challenged 14 times by the devils aubin held until arnott leaped on his own rebound in the slot for his 25th goal of the season , 4 minutes 29 seconds into the middle period , on the devils' 20th shot of the game it was arnott s 11th point in his last 10 games alex yannis
malt liquors and boots were among america s 10 largest industries at the beginning of the 20th century a third of americans worked in agriculture fifty years later , cars , aircraft and chemical manufacturing dominated the economy and only about 4 percent of americans worked in agriculture the united states started the century on an economic par with great britain by the middle of the century , living standards were 50 percent higher in the united states than in britain now , at the end of the century , americans , mostly employed in whitecollar jobs , account for only 4 percent of the world s population but for more than 20 percent of its output the american brand of capitalism democratic , lightly regulated and full of opportunities for individuals to fail as well as succeed is widely seen as a model for others to emulate as the end of the century draws near , there is no longer any doubt that the statedominated economies that competed with capitalism for much of the modern era have failed less clear than many americans might imagine , however , is which model of capitalism american , european or japanese is likely to prove most dominant in the decades ahead america s economic success began before this century the country had abundant natural resources from the start , and in the 19th century , immigration and huge investments in railroads helped create a continentexpanding economy entrepreneurs developed the american system of interchangeable parts , first in firearms , to cut down the costs of producing complex products in the 20th century came the assembly line , churning out cars that workers could afford long before europe , the united states provided free high school education , laying the foundation for a knowledgebased economy from the 1920 s on , economic growth was tied to sciencebased technologies , and in the 50 years after 1910 output per hour more than tripled a mostly handsoff , decentralized system rewarded personal skills , entrepreneurial investment and innovation the flexibility of largely unfettered labor markets also helped the economy triple in size in the 30 years following world war ii more people working with more machines account for some of the growth but most of the spectacular gains arose from something more profound educated people working with smarter machines by 1975 , productivity output per worker was twice as high in the united states as in britain the economy has been so hot in the past few years that there is a natural temptation to declare that america s freewheeling cowboy capitalism has triumphed permanently over european or japanese versions but economic historians , taking the longer view , consider such a conclusion premature each of the models has its own strengths and each has stumbled at times in recent decades the american economy , for instance , stalled in the 1970 s after the oil price shocks for nearly two decades unemployment rates remained high and wages of all but the highestpaid workers stagnated inequality soared americans looked abroad for answers europe s system of generous social insurance and regulated labor markets produced comparable living standards and more equal income distribution but then unemployment took hold in the 1980 s attention turned to the success of japan s system of corporate cartels and lifetime employment but by the 1990 s japan had entered a decadelong slumber attention returned to america s hurlyburly economy , which has achieved the lowest unemployment in the industrialized world in part by throwing millions of people out of work each year only to hire them back \( in different jobs \) along with millions more the united states prospered in part because of the accelerating pace of globalization and technological change rapid change puts a premium on flexibility , america s greatest economic asset europe s more stable system of longterm employment may return to favor in more tranquil times indeed , for all these ups and downs , economists and historians see more similarities than differences among successful economies in japan , europe and the united states all are vibrant , literate , scienceoriented democracies with a base of private property they rely on relatively open markets , trade and mature legal systems for resolving conflicts none of the governments are handsoff all of them , including the united states , tightly regulate financial markets the current dominance of the american model rests , in historic terms , on a fleeting experience only in the last few years of the current recovery has the economy created both large employment gains and wage increases but for scholars reflecting on the economic history of the century , there can be no doubt on one central point measured by the feature that best defines economic prosperity productivity growth the market economies of the united states , western europe and japan far outpaced staterun , autocratic , antitrade regimes throughout latin america and africa
rye , ny , april 17 there were more smiles and laughter than usual today for a team already out of the running and going through the motions of a final practice at least until the end , when rangers coach john muckler gathered the team and demanded that wayne gretzky skate a couple more laps up and down the ice his teammates clattered their sticks on the ice in encouragement , but gretzky , for once , chose to exercise his clout he told me to do a couple extra down and backs , gretzky said afterward i said , 'no , i 'll retire right here' so gretzky led the stretch instead , taking a spot at the center of the ice at rye playland with his teammates gathered around him the jokes and banter went on , the sort of thing that gretzky is well aware he will miss more than anything this was his final practice , the final preparation for a final game at madison square garden on sunday afternoon that he admitted there is no way to prepare for gretzky announced his retirement on friday , but as he made his last appearance at rye , the reality was setting in i do n't think i 've ever been in a situation like this , gretzky said i 've been in the stanley cup finals , in allstar games , the canada cup , and i 've always found a way to get through i think the best way is the way i always do i 'll prepare like every game other things will go on around me that i ca n't change , but my routine will be the same on the schedule today was a phone call from president clinton , which gretzky headed home to receive on sunday , many of the players he has befriended in 20 years in the national hockey league are expected to be at the rangers' game against the pittsburgh penguins his former teammates , mark messier and paul coffey , told him they would make the trip , and he also expected his former edmonton coach , glen sather the penguins' jaromir jagr , who had planned to sit out the game , said he would now play the doors will open at madison square garden a halfhour early , at 1 30 pm for the 3 o'clock game , and the rangers will conduct a ceremony following the warmups gretzky will use 40 sticks in the game , change among three jerseys , and there will be none of the usual sponsored events during television timeouts instead , the rangers will air a video tribute to gretzky during each break in play at the end of the game there will again be a video tribute already , gifts were arriving flowers and photos from fans adorned gretzky s locker , and before the start of practice the team got together and presented him with a leather chair in the shape of a baseball glove gretzky , a baseball fan , had seen the same chair in george steinbrenner s office once and spoke of how he liked it , so the team rushed to get him one of the 100 that were made he was also given a lifetime pass to any major league baseball game i can say honestly that the last four days have been a tearful time , gretzky said the other night in ottawa , i came off the ice and the guys on the bench said i had to go back out there when i went out and looked back at the bench , that got me today , i did n't expect anything from the players their friendship is enough but they gave me a beautiful gift it was pretty emotional around the locker room , his teammates seemed little different from the fans surrounding the ice , collecting mementos marc savard seemed to be singlehandedly retiring the no 99 jersey , with three of them in his locker gretzky had joked on friday that darren langdon would steal most of the mementos , and langdon had a good assortment for the bar he owns i got a few things signed by him , langdon said , showing off two sticks and a jersey that was signed , to langer and the bar , great beer ! everybody calls me a weasel this is only today s work if he wants to give me anything else , i 'll take it gretzky finished off the practice session by gathering teammates , coaches and staff on the ice for a team photo , well aware of each final step he was taking it s going to be a wonderful day , he said talking to the young guys today , i told them that this is something for them to remember , that this is what it s like when you get to the stanley cup finals this is how exciting it can be
the law firm of goldberg scudieri block had no desire last year to remain a lameduck tenant in a building headed toward demolition so it was perhaps quicker than some of its fellow tenants at 310

both residential and commercial like many commercial leases , his had a demolition clause , allowing the owner to give tenants six months' notice to leave the macklowe organization , the owner , is planning to demolish the buildings on an assembled site of nearly 40 , 000 square feet and replace them with a new building of almost 600 , 000 square feet once a major tenant is signed close to 300 tenants at 310 madison avenue received notice to vacate last year and all but 14 have moved these displaced tenants have been a leading force in the rental market for small space in the grand central area , focusing attention on the important role that small office tenants play in the midtown rental market and the many multitenant buildings that specialize in catering to them for such tenants , leases normally run from 3 to 10 years and cover anywhere from several hundred to 10 , 000 square feet with the leasing market tightening , many of the tenants at 310 madison have gone to less costly space in south midtown , chelsea or lower manhattan , brokers report but others have stayed in the grand central area , sometimes at rents two or three times higher than they had been paying the goldberg firm , for example , which had been in 2 , 200 square feet at 310 madison for 13 years , expanded when it moved into 3 , 300 square feet on the 14th floor at 45 west 45th street in january its new rent is about 35 a square foot a year , or two and a half times what it had paid , for less space , before it has left a building in which the ownership was making little new investment with redevelopment the expectation for many years for a building striving to attract a higherrent occupancy nowadays , several older buildings in the grand central area whose age and equipment levels would place them in the class b category are aspiring to the status of class a buildings , with more elaborate lobbies , improved highspeed elevator service , more prestigious tenants and higher rents the chrysler building , long known as a home for small tenants , is to become part of the chrysler center that its owners , tishman speyer properties and the travelers group , are producing in a 100 million expansion and improvement project on 42d street between lexington and third avenues the lincoln building , at 60 east 42d street , with 598 tenants , is embarked on a 20 million improvement program and the graybar building at lexington avenue and 44th street , and 230 park avenue , at 46th street , formerly the helmsley building , have begun upgrading campaigns but even lowerprofile buildings that are clearly in the class b category are changing their character businesses that depend on a high volume of traffic , like employment or personnel agencies or trade schools , are being forced out by the rising rents , said brian waterman , senior managing director of newmark company , which manages many multitenant buildings replacing them are internet companies and small computer and software concerns , as well as the standard assortment of servicesector companies he gave as an example 545 fifth avenue , a class b building with 145 , 000 square feet at 45th street its occupancy has almost entirely turned over since a new owner took over in 1996 now , almost half the tenants are in the technology business the average rent is in the mid 30asquarefoot range another example of tenancy turnover changing a multitenant building s character is 317 madison avenue , managed by williamson picket gross despite the address , its entrance is at 41 east 42d street \( and the macklowe building , diagonally across madison avenue , is entered at 30 east 42d street the owners think madison avenue s name has a greater market appeal than 42d street \) there are 75 tenants at 317 madison avenue , said robert m leitner , the leasing agent , and a turnover rate of about 10 a year just as some of my tenants are leaving because they do n't want to pay the higher rents i'm getting , the new tenants i'm getting are coming here because they do n't want to pay still higher rents where they were , mr leitner said arrivals pay in the midtolow 30asquarefoot range tenants with under 5 , 000 square feet of space tend to think of their rents as residential tenants do , in dollars a month three small offices and a reception area often make up 1 , 000 square feet , which costs 3 , 000 to 4 , 000 a month in a class b building in the grand central area five years ago , that rent would have been under 2 , 000 a month rent levels are often determined by windows the more windows per rentable area , the higher the rent many small offices have about 2 , 500 square feet , usually for a firm or business with 8 to 12 employees such space provides four or five private offices with windows and room for an interior conference room and reception area these rents now start at about 7 , 000 a month in a computer study , the real estate firm of colliers abr compared the rental picture in a sample of 30 midtown multitenant buildings none with any single tenant accounting for more than 20 percent of the space with the entire midtown office inventory , and found that the vacancy rate characteristically runs a bit higher in multitenant buildings the rate has declined steadily in midtown multitenant buildings since 1992 it was 95 percent last december , compared with 199 percent in 1992 the comparable rate for the entire midtown inventory \( 2625 million square feet of space \) was 84 percent , down from 14 percent one building that has benefited from the 310 madison exodus is 342 madison avenue , at 43d street trh associates , an executive search concern , landed there after only three years at 310 madison , which followed seven years at 211 east 43d street we moved two blocks and our rent went from 3 , 400 a month to 5 , 500 a month , said tala hoffman , trh s president we had to sign a demolition clause again but we 'll probably be safe for five years photo tenants have been vacating the building at 310 madison avenue \( keith meyers the new york times \)
if you were thinking about going to see the yankees and the mets at shea stadium tonight , tomorrow afternoon or sunday afternoon , you 'd better have a ticket by now if not , fuhgeddaboutit all three games are sold out that s the bottomline rebuttal to anyone who wondered , as both joe torre and bobby valentine did for different reasons , if this season s six metyankee games , up from three in each of the previous two seasons , were three too many even before the yankees won two of three from the mets at yankee stadium five weeks ago , torre dreaded this weekend s rematch at shea it s a nightmare for us , the yankee manager said at the time when you 're not competing against this team for a spot in the standings , i think six is too many it s overkill it s like trying to eat a gallon of ice cream instead of just a pint i hope the fans like six games , but it may be a little too much not for new yorknew york fans judging by the ticket sales at the stadium and at shea , the fans have already consumed that gallon of ice cream the flavor \? pistachio , the color of money the metyankee total of 168 , 404 customers five weeks ago was the largest for a threegame series at the remodeled yankee stadium since it opened in 1976 the sunday night assembly of 56 , 295 was the largest in the remodeled stadium for a regularseason night game and for a regularseason game not on opening day this weekend the mets expect to approach , if not surpass , the total of 160 , 740 that witnessed last season s three yankee games at shea all this attention might be a nightmare for torre , who understandably is more concerned with the boston red sox and the other american league contenders , but it s a midsummer night s dream for all the yankee and met aficionados not for bobby valentine , though it s great for the fans they make up this game , the mets' manager has said , but it s tough to have to play the best team in baseball six times when none of the other teams in our league do in other words , six are n't fair but what , in baseball or in life , is fair \? is it fair that the outfield dimensions in yankee stadium and shea stadium are different \? is it fair that the yankees ca n't use their designated hitter , and their pitchers must bat in shea , a national league ball park \? was it fair that the mets were allowed to use a dh in yankee stadium \? two different ball parks , two different sets of rules that s not fair to teams supposedly playing the same game but that s the way baseball is the fans do n't seem to care what s fair for the mets or the yankees they just keep buying tickets and that s the bottomline argument why major league baseball , in devising its future interleague formula , intends to maintain the new yorknew york games along with the other natural rivalries we want to adjust the interleague play to other divisions , bud selig , the commissioner of baseball , said , but we do n't want to disturb the natural rivalries by next season or in 2001 , the yankees and the mets , for example , might be playing the other league s central or west division teams instead of its east teams as they do now , but the yankees and the mets would still play each other each season in order to maintain their natural rivalry when i was in chicago for the first cubswhite sox series this year , selig said , it reminded me of going to a bearspackers game you ca n't produce that excitement anywhere else except in the natural rivalries nine other natural rivalries exist dodgersangels , giantsathletics , rangersastros , indiansreds , philliesorioles , blue jaysexpos , marlinsdevil rays , twinsbrewers , cardinalsroyals the interleague schedule has tried to create a bravesred sox interleague rivalry based on boston s being the braves' ancestral home before moving to milwaukee and atlanta six other teams are without a rival that is n't already locked into a closer geographic matchup the tigers and mariners in the al , the pirates , rockies , padres and diamondbacks in the nl but the yankees and the mets have proved that the essence of interleague baseball , the natural geographic rivalries , is here to stay that a gallon of ice cream is as easy to digest as a pint especially pistachio photo let s play 6 ! fans relish the new rivalries \( chang w lee the new york times \)
plum island in a highsecurity laboratory suite at the plum island animal disease center , dr luis rodriguez , a microbiologist , was explaining the layer upon layer of precautions that researchers took to contain the highly infectious animal viruses they study after samples of infected animal tissue arrive inside airtight transfer boxes , dr rodriguez explained , they go into a specially designed cabinet with an elaborate airfiltering system donning a surgical smock and snapping on protective gloves , dr rodriguez reached inside the cabinet , moving with all the care of an explosives expert disarming a bomb every instrument , cleanser and container he would need was meticulously laid out so his hands could stay inside until he was done working with vials and bottles that might have contained virus samples everything you do requires planning , he said and then , as he walked away from the cabinet , he dropped one of the bottles there was no harm done the bottle was closed and empty , and should have withstood the short fall in any case even if a virus had escaped , the negative pressure in the room , and indeed throughout the entire biocontainment area of the plum island center , would have captured any contaminated air and routed it into the lab s airfiltering system but still , as the bottle clattered to the floor it sounded a reminder that even in the most careful hands , accidents do happen , and that even in the most controlled environment , uncontrollable events may occur as the federal agriculture department considers whether to seek congressional approval to make the 45yearold plum island center the only government laboratory in the country to study extremely virulent animal diseases that can also kill humans , questions of safety and security are suddenly looming large the department and its highestranking experts have said that an animal disease center with labs that have the highest security rating , biosafety level four , are an absolute necessity for combating viruses that could attack cattle , pigs , sheep and other domestic herds , with the potential to devastate the country s 90 billion livestock industry some of the diseases the kind scientists call zoonotic can also spread to humans with lethal effects , making them a double threat if they were used in a bioterrorist assault fears of bioterrorism prompted the clinton administration to direct the agricultural department and other agencies to take steps to protect the country , and changes at plum island could be part of the response because plum island is now rated at biosafety level three for studying foreign animal viruses , the department has made no secret that the island is its first choice for the level four labs as the wheels begin turning , critics are already questioning the wisdom of importing viruses for which there are no known cures to an island off crowded long island and 95 miles from manhattan robert s deluca , the president of the group for the south fork , said the level four labs were a remarkably bad idea for an island less than 15 miles from the millstone nuclear power complex in waterford , conn , in the path of hurricanes and in an area of long island that could not be evacuated in an emergency short of being on a geological fault , i do n't think you could find a worse place , he said in anticipation of such criticism , the seldomvisited laboratory invited local officials and members of the news media for a tour earlier this month to learn more about the 840acre island fortress , which is ringed with signs warning away intruders even before arriving on one of the laboratory s boats , from orient point or old saybrook , conn , the visitors had been told they had to be prepared to strip naked before entering a realm of innersanctum labs and animal pens , to shower thoroughly upon exiting and to sign an oath promising to avoid all animals except domestic dogs and cats for five days in the lobby of the lab s main research building , displays posted on the crisp white walls told , among other things , of the center s genesis in the 1950 s as the country s front line against footandmouth disease , a disaster for american cattle herds in the 1920 s and still a problem in the world today in a spacious conference room , wilda martinez , the area director for the animal research service , one of two agriculture department agencies at plum island , extended a welcome but minced no words recent news reports , she said , have been inaccurate in their details , and have blurred the reasons the level four labs are needed bioterrorism aside , she said , it is apparent that the protection afforded by ocean barriers and geographic separation will no longer prevent the introduction of foreign animal diseases dr alfonso torres , a native of colombia and the deputy administrator of the animal and plant health inspection service , the other agriculture department agency at plum island , followed with a slide lecture intended to leave no doubt about the importance of the lab in protecting agriculture , the county s largest industry

for the first six innings , an intermittent stream of peanuts , popcorn and other unidentified objects pelted timothy mcandrew s boston red sox cap the yankees fan behind him went hoarse chanting 1918 ! 1918 ! and a variation of the phrase boston stinks ! and a group of young , enraged and inebriated yankees fans vowed to hospitalize mr mcandrew , while hurling an astonishingly vivid array of biblical and barnyard expletives at him but mr mcandrew , a 22yearold insurance underwriter who lives in new york and grew up in rhode island , refused to back down while other red sox fans sat meekly at the first game of the american league championship series on wednesday night , afraid to wear their red sox paraphernalia and in some cases even asking for police protection , mr mcandrew insisted on boldly standing up and clapping each and every time a red sox batter got a hit and each and every time a yankee batter struck out go sox , baby ! mr mcandrew shouted , as dozens of yankees fans hurled food , insults and obscenities at him in the seventh inning , yankees fans leapt to their feet and cheered when mr mcandrew slipped and fell on the stairs during his one trip to the bathroom \( the concession stand attendant refused to sell him beer \) and by the time the game entered the eighth inning as a tense 33 tie , it was increasingly unclear whether mr mcandrew would exit yankee stadium alive it s nothing , he said , after a piece of garbage hit him in the head it s not like it s rocks or cement or anything mr mcandrew represents the sports fan s equivalent of endless purgatory a boston red sox fan trapped in new york city for years , closet red sox fans have endured endless bragging from friends and incessant media accounts of the yankees this , and the mets that they have watched spoiled new york fans gripe when the best teams money can buy fail to win a championship once a decade \( try more than eight decades , they say , painfully conceding that the team has failed to win a world series since 1918 \) and of course , they have suffered through the endless and unoriginal babe ruth , bucky dent and bill buckner jokes but this week , dislocated red sox fans are approaching a near messianic frenzy in new york citing mysterious forces ranging from the dawn of the new millennium to the weakness of the cleveland indians' bullpen to the creation of the major league baseball wild card , red sox fans say a perfect path to glory has been created that will allow a small , starcrossed franchise to exorcise its many demons just in time for the new century and the new fenway park \( and if they fail , inflict another catastrophic heartbreak on a singularly masochistic group of fans \) their team like the mets against the atlanta braves in the national league is in a position its fans are accustomed to distinct underdogs last night , the odds got even steeper , as the yankees won game 2 to take a twogamestonone lead in the series michael bardorf , a red sox fan who grew up in new hampshire and now lives in norwalk , conn , breathlessly called facing the yankees the dream scenario the red sox have to go through the yankees to beat the curse , he said , referring to their failure to win the world series since they sold ruth to the yankees before the 1920 season then they can take revenge on the mets ! he added , referring to a glaring error by buckner at first base that accelerated the red sox collapse in the 1986 world series we can take out both teams in one shot ! mr bardorf wore no red sox paraphernalia at wednesday s game , and he was careful to keep his voice down david gage , a 6foot3inch , 260pound yankees fan wearing a tshirt with the variation of the boston stinks ! theme , had vowed to beat him and another red sox fan senseless if they continued to cheer for the wrong team other yankees fans took things less seriously and chatted amiably with their rivals in another section , bill kerwin , a 43yearold boston fan who drove down from rhode island for the game and wore a red sox cap , had so many napkins and hot dog rolls thrown at him that he had to have a policeman stand beside him but of all the red sox fans , mr mcandrew seemed to be closest to flirting with serious bodily injury as he continued to stand and clap as the game stretched into extra innings gary matthews , 42 , a city sanitation worker covered in yankee logos that extended to his socks , turned around and stuck one , two or three fingers in mr mcandrew s face every time a strike was called against a red sox batter in the top of the 10th inning john re , a st john s university college student hoarse from chanting , composed an impromptu song that included lines like you 're cursed ! sure enough , a bad call from an umpire , followed by a home run by bernie williams , ended the game and the red sox hopes \( for the night \) elated yankee fans descended on a grinning mr mcandrew , running up the aisle to thrust their index fingers in his face and to pour a bag of peanuts over his head but after the jeering subsided , those same fans complimented mr mcandrew for showing such heart and shook hands with him fans from both sides agreed that they had just witnessed a game that brought to life the best in baseball maria maccarone , a 31yearold massachusetts native and red sox fan who moved to new york three years ago , said the reason for the vehemence was simple i think the yankees and red sox fans hate each other because they are the just the same , she said they 're both rude and obnoxious photo some red sox fans are too timid to show their true colors others relish the opportunity \( arthur pollack the boston herald \)

washington , may 25 house republican leaders announced today that they were drafting a broad package of guncontrol measures similar to those passed by the senate last week , and speaker j dennis hastert predicted that at least some of the provisions would succeed in the house as well mr hastert signaled his support today for one proposal in particular mandatory background checks on all buyers at gun shows he suggested that he also favored some type of legislation , like the sale of child safety devices with handguns , to keep firearms from being used by unsupervised children these measures and others are being folded into a juvenilecrime bill expected to come to the house floor next month although the house has traditionally been more resistant to gun control than the senate , the remarks of mr hastert and other republican leaders today were the surest signs yet that the house would be receptive to new restrictions on firearms their comments did leave open the possibility that the provisions the house ends up voting on could contain details significantly different from those in the measures approved by the senate for example , some of the leaders prefer limiting to 24 hours the time a gunshow vendor has to conduct a background check the senate version calls for three days but the speaker was more adamant than ever that a full range of guncontrol issues would be debated on the house floor the house will vote trigger locks , background checks at gun shows and closing the gun purchase loophole , mr hastert said in a speech on the house floor this morning closing that loophole referred to mr hastert s previously stated support for raising the minimum age for handgun purchases to 21 from 18 , a measure that goes a step further than the senate legislation , which does not address age but even as house republicans trumpeted their openness toward gun control today , house democrats questioned the sincerity of that attitude in a series of news conferences that underscored the intense partisan jockeying around the issue each party clearly craves credit for any legislative action in congress house democrats complained in particular about mr hastert s pledge to bring the issue to the house floor within three to four weeks they insisted on votes this week and plotted parliamentary and obstructionist tactics none likely to succeed to try to force the passage of legislation before the memorial day recess representatives nita m lowey of westchester , rosa delauro of connecticut and steny h hoyer of maryland appealed to the house rules committee tonight to add guncontrol amendments to an appropriations bill expected to come to the house floor on wednesday but the committee s republican majority denied that request , saying the amendments were not relevant to the bill explaining the democrats' sense of urgency , representative richard a gephardt of missouri , the minority leader , today called gun violence a national crisis other democrats asserted that republicans were buying time so they could soften the provisions passed by the senate and give lobbyists with the national rifle association a chance to influence votes republicans said they were simply trying to make sure that they fashioned coherent measures and avoided the confusion that occurred in the senate i know emotions are running high , mr hastert said but he added the nation s eyes have turned toward us , looking for responsible leadership we must resist the temptation to score political points last week , mr hastert first indicated his support for mandatory background checks for all buyers at gun shows , a measure the senate passed , and a raise in the minimum age for all handgun purchases to 21 from 18 today he seemed to edge up as well on an endorsement of a requirement that child safety devices accompany all handguns sold by licensed dealers , though his language was a bit vague other house republican leaders , including representative tom delay of texas , the majority whip , have signaled support for mandatory background checks at gun shows in recent days , a loudening drumbeat for new restrictions that would have been unimaginable a year ago more concretely , representative henry j hyde , the illinois republican who heads the house judiciary committee , and representative bill mccollum , the florida republican who heads its crime subcommittee , announced today that they were grafting a broad array of guncontrol measures onto a juvenile crime bill in the committee as recently as a week and a half ago , republicans had insisted that , for technical reasons , gun control was not germane to that bill but this morning , mr hyde and mr mccollum said that a revised version of the bill would include mandatory background

environmental organizations were listed president clinton and hillary rodham clinton gave 99 , 220 of their 504 , 109 income to charity last year , donations that helped lower their federal income tax rate to 158 percent , according to tax returns released by the white house today having paid more than twice as much in federal income taxes as the law required in 1996 and 1997 because of the way they gave away royalties from a book by mrs clinton , the clintons received a delayed tax break that cut their income taxes by 45 percent , to 79 , 480 in 1997 , the clintons had an adjusted gross income of 569 , 511 and paid 91 , 964 , or 16 percent , in federal income taxes the clintons' adjusted gross income of 504 , 109 came from the 200 , 000 salary mr clinton receives as president , 16 ,

securities from a blind trust they sold shortly before they paid a legal settlement to paula corbin jones the clintons changed the way they gave away proceeds from mrs clinton s new book , which is about the presidential pets , said barry toiv , a white house spokesman , so that all proceeds from the new book will go to charity and none to taxes of their charitable donations , 7 , 220 came from their own accounts they donated the 12 , 000 mrs clinton received last year from the henry g freeman pin money fund , established in 1912 to benefit first ladies the clintons gave away 80 , 000 in royalties last year from it takes a village the clintons received the royalties as income , paid taxes on the royalties and donated the aftertax balance in 1997 , the clintons gave away so much money

charitable deductions last year totaling 161 , 938 in three years , the clintons have given away 920 , 000 in book royalties to children s hospitals and other children s charities but had the clintons arranged the book royalties differently they could have given away 107 , 664 they paid in taxes to give the additional sums mrs clinton would have had to have given the copyright to it takes a village to a public charity or a private foundation before the book was published by creating a donordirected fund , an option that the internal revenue service has approved for some public charities , the clintons could have distributed the money to charities of their choosing had they done this , they would have had no royalty income in 1996 , 1997 and 1998 for 1998 , the clintons' income would have dropped to 429 , 820 and they would have paid 139 , 348 in federal income tax , a recalculation of their income tax returns using turbotax software showed their tax would then have been 324 percent of

clinton s prior tax planning for 'it takes a village' is an example of how anyone can get tripped up in the tax code s complexity but several other tax experts said yesterday that some people

several days a week , brad bartholomew climbs into the cockpit of a southwest airlines jetliner and begins his safety routine he checks the instrument panel , radios the control tower , gets the latest update on the weather and in perhaps the most important safety check of all , mr bartholomew looks over at the copilot who will fly alongside him and that look a brief , imperfect observational moment as well as whatever collected knowledge he may have of his colleague , is the best assurance he will get that the person flying next to him is fit enough to help carry scores of people through the skies if either one of us senses a problem with the other , said mr bartholomew , who has flown for southwest for 12 years , we 're probably going to take action the airline industry , which employs tens of thousands of pilots flying millions of people around the globe , has long relied on a system of internal monitoring when it comes to the question of pilot fitness pilots like mr bartholomew are honorbound to report any concerns about their colleagues the pilots union has a panel of volunteers who can provide professional help for troubled pilots , and the airlines have generally been good about allowing pilots at risk to take time off but for years , critics maintained that the industry needed to impose a more rigorous and systematic program for ensuring the mental fitness of pilots critics say only about half of american and foreign airlines give psychological tests before hiring pilots , and after that the pilots are typically subjected only to physicals once or twice a year , during which they are asked about their emotional wellbeing concerns about the risks posed by disturbed pilots are not likely to be eased in the aftermath of the crash of egyptair flight 990 on oct 31 , when all 217 people aboard were killed while investigators have cautioned that they have reached no conclusions about what caused the disaster , government officials said last week that based on the evidence so far , they believe the plane was brought down by one of the pilots , who for unknown reasons intentionally sent the aircraft into a fatal plunge from 33 , 000 feet over the atlantic if those suspicions prove correct , it will be the fourth time investigators have believed that a commercial plane had been intentionally crashed by one of its pilots none of those crashes have involved united states airlines to many pilots , the minimal number of such horrific incidents underscores a fact that even the industry s critics concede pilots are among the healthiest and most proficient groups of workers in america nearly half of the commercial pilots in the united states are former military pilots , who have proved themselves in stressful training the rest have civilian backgrounds , including many who have logged thousands of hours flying corporate jets we all come from the same breeding stock , and it s a really small network , said mr bartholomew , who also publishes a newsletter on airline labor issues with a halfdozen phone calls , you can really find out a lot about people you want to hire people in the airline industry maintain that it would be virtually impossible to devise a foolproof program for preventing such wildly aberrational behavior still , the industry s critics insist that much could be done to further limit risk federal and international rules simply demand that commercial pilots undergo physical examinations at least once a year and in the case of captains of united states airliners , twice dr robert pressman , a clinical psychologist with strategic outcomes , a company in providence , ri , that specializes in selecting personnel for sensitive jobs like flying , calls that a pretty inefficient way of getting at some of the deeper issues he said the airlines generally have been lucky up to now some types of psychological tests have a strong record of detecting signs of depression or agitation that could pose safety problems , dr pressman said he and other experts contend that the federal aviation administration should require pilots to take such tests every six months industry and union officials counter that these kinds of safety problems are extremely rare , and they question whether more testing is worth the time and cost indeed , before the egyptair accident brought new attention to screening issues , pilot unions had begun pushing to relax other longtime safety rules , which bar pilots from taking most antidepressant medications admitting depression often forces pilots to be grounded so even some psychologists complain that the rules have prompted pilots to try to hide their problems , adding to the potential hazards there s a real catch22 there , said john mazor , a spokesman for the air line pilots association , the largest pilots union the faa needs to look at those rules with an eye to bringing them up to date but as air travel expands , there are signs that pilots are facing more stress , and experts say the dangers can manifest themselves in subtle ways a divorce , a financial setback or a death in the family can reduce a pilot s concentration , and depression or other psychological problems can dull their reactions in an emergency
jagdishpur , india , sept 28 like a maharajah in a royal tableau , laloo yadav , selfproclaimed tribune of the downtrodden , sailed to this remote , dirt poor village in a wooden boat , standing grandly at its prow his bejeweled fingers flashed as he waved to the people on shore a servant held an umbrella aloft to shade him from a blazing sun for almost a decade , laloo , as he is universally known , has ruled india s poorest and second most populous state with a sly , rustic wit he had come here to seek the votes of country people in india s monthlong national elections voting largely concludes sunday , with counting on wednesday and thursday when this son of an illiterate cowherd first came to power in the northern state of bihar in march 1990 , he symbolized the rise of india s peasant castes to the political heights and the hope that this new generation of leaders would improve the lives of people long dominated by the ruling upper castes mr yadav s theatrical defiance of the elite and his elevation of his own caste members to high government position have given many poor people a feeling for the first time that they have a place in democracy but with the passage of years , the hope that mr yadav s brand of populism would materially improve the common people s standard of living has been dashed in the 1990 s , as india s national government has loosened its viselike grip on the economy and business people have been given more freedom about where to invest , the gap between the richest and poorest states has widened , with bihar bringing up the rear while leaders in other states have courted private investors , cut budget deficits and built roads and power grids , mr yadav , who heads his party , and his wife , rabri devi , who has replaced him as chief minister while he faces public corruption charges , have let bihar slide further into debt roads are crumbling electrical power is in acutely short supply and the state has attracted virtually no foreign investment mr yadav , 51 , still glories in his folkhero status like a bantam rooster and conjures the symbols of rural life with a showman s mastery he lets his billy goats graze in the rose garden of the chief minister s mansion he thumbs his nose at the brahmans and extols the virtues of cow dung on the floor of parliament and as he picks his toes and squirts chewing tobacco juice from the side of his mouth , he never lets anyone forget that he was once a shoeless farm boy who is missing toenails because water buffalo stomped on his feet but he and his wife have offered no broad vision for building the economy or curbing population growth in fact , they had nine children because the first six were girls and his mother , like most indians , favored boys the state s failure to progress may finally be taking a toll on mr yadav s and ms devi s popularity a recent poll found that 70 percent of bihar s voters are dissatisfied with the state government the current election will test whether their alliance of muslims and yadavs , the large caste of cowherds and small farmers , coupled with some support from other low castes , can retain power mr yadav s party , which governs bihar in an alliance with the national congress party , is opposed by the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party , which is largely dependent on uppercaste voters in bihar , and that party s statelevel allies , who now include another lowcaste leader the only explanation for laloo s continuing hold on power seems to be that he s a powerful symbol for the masses who support him , said ashutosh varshney , a political scientist at notre dame in bihar and uttar pradesh , northern states where a quarter of india s one billion people live , the socalled backward castes above the lowest castes of untouchables , but beneath the upper ranks of brahmans and traders have yet to move beyond the politics of patronage and symbolism and secure better health , education and job prospects as economic growth surged across india this decade , bihar , with a mostly rural population of 100 million , remained what abusaleh shariff , a noted economist , called a black hole right on the face of the earth bihar s economy has stagnated despite its wealth of natural resources its residents have left in droves to hunt for jobs elsewhere more than half the people are illiterate and grindingly poor almost twothirds of the children age 4 or younger are stunted by malnutrition bihar has managed to get food grains that are heavily subsidized by the national government to only 1 out of every 20 households , while states in south india are consistently reaching 7 or 8 out of every 10 meanwhile , bihar s reputation for public corruption has deepened mr yadav was charged in 1996 in what he says is a conspiracy trumped up by his opponents this favorite son of the cowherds' caste has been accused of conspiring with state officials to steal vast sums from a state agricultural program that is meant to help struggling farmers the day before mr yadav went to jail in 1997 , his party installed his wife , ms devi , a village woman with a fifthgrade education , as chief minister freed on bail and with a raft of cases pending against him , mr yadav won a seat in parliament in 1998 and continues to serve as the president of his statebased party , the rashtriya janta dal , which , in hindi , means national people s party
