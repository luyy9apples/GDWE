in these contentious times , we hear a great deal about the singleissue voter , the citizen for whom nothing in the political spectrum matters except a candidate s stand on taxes or the burning of the flag a parallel phenomenon , i have found , is the singleissue reader , whose urge to correspond is set off only by mention of , say , maria callas or glenn gould or original instruments or french opera in the wake of the metropolitan opera s grotesque new production of gounod s faust and its tired revival of saintsaens' samson et dalila , passionate appreciators of those works have leaped to defend them against what they perceive as critical assault on the whole 19thcentury french genre there is something endearing about this reaction from devoted fans theirs is the love that loves without questioning somewhere in the recesses of the intellect they may recognize why french opera does not receive as much serious attention as it once did perhaps because singers who are masters of the idiom are scarce but oneissue opera fans resent having such facts aired , fearing that their favorite opera may be too frail to survive the windy blasts of critics these defensive outcries are rarely heard when productions of the sturdier french operas carmen , pelleas et melisande , manon , les troyens or les contes d'hoffmann come under hard scrutiny but write anything adverse about samson et dalila and there are sure to be anguished complaints protective readers bare their fangs like lassie defending an injured lamb momentarily intimidated , i have to remind myself that i have written sympathetically if not always with unreserved praise of many french operas , including pelleas , hoffmann , manon , cendrillon , don quichotte , werther , carmen even , i confess , thais with regard to faust , fears that criticism will prove fatal at this stage in its history are ungrounded though gounod s opera flounders as drama , it contains a succession of imperishable moments that insures it a place in the affections of all sentient opera lovers the difficulty with the metropolitan s production , as misdirected by harold prince and crudely designed by rolf langenfass , was that the virtues of the opera were obscured and its faults magnified one reader mystifyingly accuses me of being insensitive to the production s use of metaphor and symbol but in fact this faust clubbed one over the head with heavy devices that were too obvious to qualify as symbols i recall , for instance , two oddly recumbent trees that sprang to attention in the love duet one had to hope they were not meant as phallic symbols if so , why in the world were two required \? it was not the critic s duty to softpedal a pretentious new production s failures but to describe them in detail but in distressingly heated terms , a number of readers express the view that failures of staging should be overlooked so that most of the review space could be devoted to an appreciation of the work itself and of the singers this overlooks the fundamental difference between the review of a new staging and reports on subsequent performances on first nights , singers necessarily receive less attention than the production , and properly so if they do not happen to be of golden age quality conversely , with a familiar staging \( the met s samson is 26 years old \) , the main focus can be on the singing while discussion of the production need only be minimal although i have been complaining for years about staging overkill and directorial conceits that obscure the efforts of singers , ignoring the staging at a premiere is hardly the answer to the problem in revisiting the met s venerable samson , therefore , i was faced with the problem of what to say about singing that , even when tasteful and conscientious , fell short of giving much pleasure placido domingo did what he could with samson , but there are few title roles in all of opera that are so musically weak or dramatically flimsy shirley verrett , whose lower voice seemed to have taken french leave for the evening , needed all her experience , artistry and technical legerdemain to deal with the part of dalila all in all , not an evening to hold up as a model of the french opera style as it happens , what that style involves is everywhere evident in a new emi release on cd of massenet s werther \( chs 7 63195 2 \) , a recording that might repay study by any singer of french opera apparently captured live at the paris opera in 1931 , the performance has a matchless werther in georges thill and a charlotte in ninon vallin who , though never well known in this country , was one of the finest french sopranos of her day all the unmistakable characteristics of the style are here clarity without coolness , elegance without affectation , expressive ardor without bathos and , of course , firmness of tone , purity of pitch , evenness of scales and insistence on the meaning of words the disappearance of such idiomatic singing is mainly what keeps works like faust and samson from holding the place in the public s affection that they once did , not any subversive efforts by critics to put french composers in the shadow of verdi , wagner or mozart none of the above is likely to satisfy oneissue readers , i realize what they know is that a beloved old french opera was performed and someone wrote something bad about it to them , that is like burning the flag in this case , alors , the tricolor
serge koussevitzky was one of the musical giants of the 20th century as a publisher in his native russia he brought out the early works of stravinsky for his concerts kousevitzky in paris in the early 1920 s he commissioned maurice ravel to create his orchestration of modest mussorgsky s pictures at an exhibition when he became conductor of the boston symphony in 1924 he sought out music by american composers for performance , forging a quartercentury long alliance unmatched in our history he launched a commissioning program to celebrate the boston symphony s 50th anniversary that yielded among other works igor stravinsky s symphony of psalms , paul hindemith s concert music for strings and brass , ravel s g major piano concerto and howard hanson s romantic symphony at tanglewood in 1940 he created one of the world s great summer music academies in 1942 he established the koussevitzky music foundation in the library of congress for the primary purpose of commissioning new music some of the works that resulted were bela bartok s concerto for orchestra , benjamin britten s opera peter grimes and aaron copland s third symphony on top of all that , koussevitzky was one of the very great conductors his musical disciple , leonard bernstein , has said on more than one occasion that every koussevitzky concert was an event with a capital e in the 25 years \( 19241949 \) when he was music director of the boston symphony , that orchestra was arguably the finest orchestra in the world a miracle of subtle colors , finely shaded nuances and hairtrigger precision intermittently during that quartercentury koussevitzky and the boston symphony recorded for victor records intermittently because for diverse reasons there were three long periods , adding up to fully half his tenure in boston , when no recordings were made at all not until koussevitzky had conducted the boston symphony for five years were the first sessions held , sessions that produced a series of memorable recordings of tchaikovsky s pathetique symphony , pictures at an exhibition in the ravel transcription , ravel s valse and the second daphnis and chloe suite , serge prokofiev s classical symphony and music from stravinsky s petrouchka with such an auspicious beginning , one might have expected a regular flow of koussevitzkyboston symphony recordings from victor in fact , five years passed before the next sessions in symphony hall , but then , between 1935 and 1940 , a great body of music was recorded by koussevitzky , including symphonies by haydn , beethoven , brahms , schubert , mendelssohn , schumann , tchaikovsky , sibelius , roy harris and hanson , along with tone poems by franz liszt and richard strauss , claude debussy s work la mer and music by prokofiev , gabriel faure , copland , liadov and harl mcdonald the classic recordings of the second prokofiev violin concerto and the johannes brahms concerto , both with jascha heifetz as soloist , also belong to this period in 1940 , another curtain of silence descended and there were no more koussevitzkyboston symphony recordings until 1944 from then until december 1950 came music by hector berlioz , randall thompson and walter piston , along with more brahms , ludwig van beethoven , tchaikovsky , richard strauss , jean sibelius and copland , the firstever recording of prokofiev s fifth symphony , and the aram khatchaturian piano concerto with william kapell for reasons unfathomable , bmg rca has seen fit to release none of this treasurehouse of recordings on compact disc by contrast , deutsche grammophon , emi , philips , cbs masterworks and others have given us excellent digital remasterings of recordings by many of koussevitzky s contemporaries , including wilhelm furtwangler , willem mengelberg , sir thomas beecham , bruno walter and arturo toscanini the arrival of a spate of koussevitzky performances on cd should have been a cause for rejoicing , but it is a very mixed blessing indeed no fewer than 11 cd s are at hand , 10 from a label called as disc , the other from stradivarius all the material is taken from live broadcasts preserved orginally on acetate transcription disks and manufactured for cd in italy \( where performance copyright laws are considerably freer than in the united states \) all but one of the boston symphony performances derive from broadcasts on the old blue network \( the precursor of the american broadcasting company \) from the years 1943 to 1948 the lone exception is a 1936 performance \( last movement omitted \) of a triple concerto for piano , violin and cello by alfredo casella here are symphonies by wolfgang amadeus mozart , berlioz , felix mendelssohn , brahms , tchaikovsky and sibelius a collection of miscellaneous orchestral music from richard wagner operas the bartok concerto for orchestra a beethoven ninth symphony in a 1950 performance with the french national radio and television orchestra and chorus , with distinguished french soloists of the time \( singing in french ! \) and sergei rachmaninoff s third piano concerto with the los angeles philharmonic orchestra and vladimir horowitz as soloist from an august 1950 concert in the hollywood bowl it must be said at the outset that the sound throughout is uniformly bad , at times totally unacceptable , with merciless dynamic constriction , dropouts , wild variations in volume level and , toward the end of the beethoven ninth , fluctuations in pitch \( tape stretching \? \) that are excruciating too , the audiences seem to be beset with bronchial problems , so there is much hacking and coughing and frequently there is superimposed onto the music the radio onthehour beep signal with all these negatives , is there any value to these releases \? only if you can adjust your ears to block out all the sound deficiencies , for there are some whitehot performances buried underneath since much of the repertory duplicates what exists in the bmg rca vaults , prime interest attaches to those items never commercially recorded by koussevitzky pride of place therefore attaches to the rachmaninoff concerto \( as 550 \) and the bartok concerto for orchestra \( stradivarius str 13614 \) , along with sibelius s first symphony \( as 558 \) and the berlioz symphonie fantastique \( as 552 \) the sound is barely passable , but these are totally committed , fiery performances the end of the rachmaninoff concerto is something of a scramble between soloist and orchestra , but it is a hairraising conclusion to a noholdsbarred performance the notes are amateurish and misinformed a single stock booklet , with only a sketchy biography of koussevitzky , suffices for all the as releases it even gets the date of his death wrong he died not on july 4 , 1951 , as the booklet has it , but on june 4 and the two brahms symphonies were not played a week apart , as the back liner has it , but a year apart , as the inside of the booklet correctly has it the stradivarius release of the bartok concerto for orchestra is not the dec 1 , 1944 , world premiere performance , but the dec29 repeat four weeks later an instance of koussevitzky s determination , when he believed in a new work , that his subscription audiences should hear it soon again these releases are only for koussevitzky fanatics

by the second inning yesterday , everything had fallen into place as it always does the chicago white sox had seven runs , the yankees had none , the afternoon at the stadium was overcast and dreary , and people were booing , from the box seats to the bleachers ron karkovice struck the deciding blow with a 10thinning shot to left field off lee guetterman , giving the white sox an 87 victory the yankees , who had rallied spectacularly and had chances all day , let one more pass in the bottom of the 10th when bobby thigpen struck out bob geren with the bases loaded to finish the afternoon the loss was the yanks' fourth in a row , and it ruined a big day for kevin maas , the yankee rookie who hit two home runs , delivered a tworun single in the seventh to tie the game and drove in five runs errors continue we played the first two innings worse than the oldtimers , said the yankee manager , stump merrill , referring to the pregame exhibition between two teams of former yankees we got what we deserved by the time the white sox had batted twice , they had a 70 lead , the yankees had three errors and two wild pitches , and their starter , tim leary , was gone but the yanks got two runs in the second , one each in the third and the fourth , and three in the seventh maas made it happen , hitting two homers off adam peterson , the white sox starter , then bouncing a single through the right side off barry jones in the seventh assistance also came from greg cadaret , who relieved leary in the second , gave up a tworun double to dan pasqua , but then shut out the white sox from the third through the eighth innings hopes were up when we battled back , maas said , i think everyone thought it was a written script that we would win but it does n't feel all that great , because we lost a close game yeah , i thought this might be it , merrill said i thought one time we would find a way to win you ca n't say we did n't have our chances the yankees left 13 runners on base the most important were the 3 in the 10th randy velarde had opened the inning with a double to leftcenter off donn pall , the sixth of seven white sox pitchers used by their manager , jeff torborg but roberto kelly , asked to simply hit the ball to the right side and advance the runner , grounded out to short steve sax bounced out in front of the plate , sending velarde to third then torborg went against conventional thinking , ordering don mattingly to be walked intentionally and putting the winning run on base i 've been around donnie too long , said torborg , a former yankee coach , and i know that s not what you do in most situations but when you 've got a guy like that who could kill you , you 've got to take your chances with somebody else risky , but it worked thigpen came in , hit jesse barfield with a pitch to load the bases , then struck out geren for his 29th save , the most in the majors this season perez banished from bench pascual perez s days of playing to the television camera were put to an end friday perez , the disabled pitcher , upset both merrill and the team s general manager , pete peterson , after he was shown on camera thursday night slumped over a medical bag , apparently dozing off he has also mugged openly for television cameras after meeting with perez on friday , peterson said the club would no longer allow players on the disabled list that includes perez and claudell washington to sit on the bench during games both were told to come in for treatment for their ailments , then either sit in the stands or leave the stadium when merrill tried to discuss the matter with perez late thursday , the player walked away , cursing
bonn , sept 29 west germany s highest court today struck down the election rules prepared for the first allgerman vote in december , saying that they posed unfair obstacles to small political groups the eight judges of the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe unanimously upheld complaints by small parties like the reformed east german communists , the environmentalist greens and the farright republicans the ruling has no effect on the formal unification of the two germanys on wednesday , nor is it expected to delay the allgerman parliamentary elections scheduled for dec 2 but it means that small , indigenous east german parties now stand a chance of winning seats in the new parliament officials in bonn said they would prepare new rules that met the court s requirements by oct 16 , the deadline to set rules for the december election all major political parties , even those that could be hurt by the changes , indicated that they would support the new rules big parties had formed rules the rules that the court struck down were the product of a complex political compromise reached in august among the major parties in bonn the existing west german election rules require a party to receive at least 5 percent of the total vote before it can take seats in parliament the rule was devised to avoid the sort of proliferation of splinter parties that afflicts so many european parliaments but applied to allgerman elections , the 5 percent rule would have meant that indigenous parties in east germany like new forum , the popular movement that sprang up last fall , or the communists , now called the party of democratic socialism , or the conservative german social union would be excluded from parliament some of these parties might achieve 5 percent of the east german vote , but not of the allgerman vote such an arrangement suited the major west german parties , though in varying degrees the social democrats in particular welcomed rules that would exclude the former communists and small leftwing groups , since they would split the leftwing vote the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats had little to lose or gain , since none of the east german parties challenged their constituencies but chancellor helmut kohl s rightist ally in bavaria , the christian social union , was eager to include the german social union in the new parliament 'piggyback' was offered so the politicians in bonn devised a gimmick that would enable small east german parties to latch on to large west german parties the piggyback arrangement allowed small parties to form joint tickets with large parties in selected constituencies , and thus to reach the required 5 percent that part of the deal benefited only the german social union , since none of the other eastern parties had any big parties to piggyback onto so other small parties filed suit the constitutional court found that the rules violated the constitutional requirement of fairness and equality of electoral chances the election law , the court said , posed extraordinary problems for the parties and political groups that were created only after the peaceful revolution in the german democratic republic , as east germany is formally known the court suggested , since it has no right to decree , that a new election law be drafted requiring east germanbased parties only to reach 5 percent of the vote in east germany , not of the total german vote , to receive a seat in the new parliament the west german interior minister , wolfgang schauble , said he would prepare a new law based on the court s recommendations next week the judges said the politicians had to take into account that the first allgerman elections were taking place under special conditions that will not be repeated this way they said setting a percentage hurdle , however low , meant an intervention in favor of west german parties the court further suggested that the new law allow small groups in east germany to form joint tickets among themselves to help them reach the 5 percent hurdle such a solution , the court said , would recognize the discrimination that quite a few parties and political gatherings had to suffer at the time of communist rule the ruling has different effects on different parties of the parties that brought the suit , the greens welcomed the prospect of expanding the leftwing benches with the citizens' movements and the former communists spokesmen for the greens hailed the ruling as a blow to the imperiousness of the ruling parties german socialists may gain the court ruling is especially promising for the party of democratic socialism , which won about 16 percent of the vote in the east german elections last march and now has a strong chance of winning seats in the first allgerman parliament among major parties , the new arrangement is on balance a blessing for mr kohl s christian democrats , since it is likely to splinter the left and at the same time weaken the christian social union , leaving it less prone to make major demands in the next cabinet spokesmen for the social democrats insisted they were pleased at the court s decision but they now face a loss of votes to the left , especially in east germany

jerusalem , feb 28 five likud members of the israeli parliament , 13 percent of the party s strength in parliament , announced the formation of their own opposition party today , putting prime minister yitzhak shamir , who is already in deep political trouble , in an even more excruciating predicament faced with an imminent and unavoidable decision on whether to go forward with his plan for palestinian elections or to let the proposal die , mr shamir and his aides say they are , to use a common israeli adage , between a hammer and an anvil if the prime minister chooses to stall or kill his elections proposal , the labor party says it will bring the government down , and the united states government is likely to give up hope and reduce support for the shamir government but if mr shamir chooses to go ahead with the plan , members of his own party led by ariel sharon and the dissidents who made their announcement today , plan to try to vote him out of office calls for resignation already some likud members are calling on mr shamir to resign , while others including several close allies of the prime minister are openly upset justice minister dan meridor , one of mr shamir s closest aides , said it s a struggle with the united states , with the arabs but it s also a political struggle with labor , which is trying to change the government , and to my sorrow also a struggle within the likud another senior aide said today the pressures are enormous i do n't think there has been a time like this the room we have to maneuver , well , there is none he cannot govern without the support of his party mr shamir , under pressure , is considering moving ahead with his plan for palestinian elections and as numerous officials commented , today s troubles give only a hint of the anger and violence that israel will probably face from within if the government ever does actually try to make peace with the palestinians decision in 2 weeks speaking to a parliamentary committee on tuesday , mr shamir promised to decide within the next two weeks whether to accept the american and labor party terms for attending a meeting of foreign ministers from israel , egypt and the united states next month the first step toward opening direct talks between israelis and palestinians a senior aide who spent the morning with mr shamir today said he had not made up his mind earlier this week , aides said , he had decided to accept the american terms and break the siege by moving ahead with the process , as a senior government official put it at the time but once word of that decision became known , the rightwing opposition grew to be so intense that mr shamir is now reconsidering , the aides added on tuesday evening his office issued an unusual public statement saying everything that has been published indicating that the prime minister has given his consent to the american plan for starting talks is without basis at issue is the composition of the palestinian delegation that would hold talks with israel the united states has indicated that secretary of state james a baker 3d will not attend the threeway meeting until agreement is reached on this question on the delegation under the american plan openly endorsed by the labor party , the delegation would include at least one palestinian deported from israel and at least one resident of arab east jerusalem fearing that mr shamir will accept those terms , even some of the prime minister s allies within the likud and his own office are openly questioning him several officials said mr shamir was particularly concerned that benjamin begin , the son of the former prime minister who is a likud parliament member and an important political figure in his right , was upset and might defect from mr shamir s camp mr begin would not return phone calls today in an interview today , mr sharon , head of the large and growing dissident faction within the likud party , said that the threeway foreign ministers' meeting is the red line we would not like mr shamir to cross if the prime minister does cross the line , mr sharon says he will be able to call another meeting of the likud central committee , at which mr shamir might lose a noconfidence vote by his own party party for 'zionist idea' this week , 23 of the likud s 40 members of parliament signed a letter demanding that mr shamir explain himself before the parliament after word of that became public , three or four of those people came forward to tell the prime minister that they were still with him , though they were concerned still , a senior aide said the prime minister now counts between 13 and 15 of the likud s parliamentary factions as inalterably opposed to mr shamir and his elections plan while another five , at least , are troubled and wavering the five who formed their own minority party today are headed by economics planning minister yitzhak modai , and the separate but affiliated group is calling itself the party for the promotion of the zionist idea mr modai declined to rule out the idea that this group might abandon likud altogether and join the labor party already , the defection of these five from likud has made labor israel s largest political party with 39 seats , compared with 35 for likud along with the dissent within likud , mr shamir must fight three smaller farright parties that control seven seats in the 120seat parliament they openly declared war this week
to the editor according to hodding carter \( in public schools , class will tell , oped , june 13 \) , the public school system in the united states has deteriorated largely because the rich have sequestered themselves in private schools and academies while this may be a striking phenomenon of the last quartercentury , it is scarcely believable that it has caused the damage he attributes to it he would seek some sort of moral conversion of the upper middle classes that would lead to a political solution nothing i have read in years about our educational woes is so fatuous i find it striking that mr carter never mentions the words teaching or teachers apart from all other motives to selfsegregation , the true underlying reason may involve the quality of the educators and the vacuity of much of the curriculum there may be fewer than a dozen quality public high schools in the entire country most of the people i grew up with were what mr carter calls the powerless , the poor , the firstgeneration children of usually semiliterate parents but our teachers and what they taught us empowered us i have been teaching english at a great public university , the university of california , los angeles , since 1961 , when i settled in santa monica , a mostly white , middleclass and very small city yet none of my three children attended its public high school they and their parents saw to that , financial struggle though it proved to be ! nor did they attend the university of california , one of the premier university systems in the world again , because of quality of teaching and a curriculum kept mediocre by masses of illprepared students , something i know about from long experience even the graduates of beverly hills high , a notoriously good public high school in the richest city in america are not properly , or well prepared for the university of california , which accepts the top 12 percent of graduates in the state i know they are my students they cannot read or write acceptably on entering and have not had much in the way of a challenging curriculum the schools of education in our country , which prepare teachers to teach , have been since about 1940 disaster areas our ucla education majors avoid junior and senior literature courses , as they probably do upperlevel math and history they are our cplus students no , my children had but one crack at serious teaching after sixth grade , and that was only to be found in a \( relatively \) rigorous private school experience even if they had to suffer segregation with the awful kids of awful , affluent parents , liberals and conservatives alike until what is taught , and the teachers who teach it , are valued in this society , valued by being educated themselves , you can arrange whatever socal mix you care to i think you will find most privateschool teachers are scarcely as well paid as their peers in public high schools why are they where they are \? not because they like rich kids particularly , but because public schools demand the mediocre in every way jascha kessler los angeles , june 14 , 1990
miraflores locks , panama , jan 28 most firsttime visitors to this famous vantage point on the panama canal , eight miles from the pacific , come away dazzled by the majesty of the 512mile waterway and the nearmiraculous ingenuity and sacrifice that went into its construction more than 75 years ago but fernando manfredo jr , who escorted vice president dan quayle on a brief tour of the canal today , wishes people would try to think of the place in more downtoearth terms mr manfredo , who took over jan 1 as the first panamanian to administer the canal since it opened in 1914 , often escorts wellknown tourists around the vistors' center at the miraflores locks , and he says he has developed a routine a lot of our guests come in thinking of the canal as some historic monument or curiosity , or as something that has to be protected , said mr manfredo , who studied management at harvard business school i try to get them to see that it s a commercial enterprise and that we depend on business from the outside 'keep the canal efficient' now that gen manuel antonio noriega is out of the picture , mr manfredo said , panamanians must find ways to keep the canal efficient , so that by the time they take over from the americans at the end of 1999 , as specified under the 1979 canal treaties , the waterway will still be a major source of income and not merely panama s answer to the great pyramids our users were very much concerned by the prospect that the canal was going to be in the hands of a dictator , said mr manfredo , who is acting head of the panama canal commission , the 10yearold united states government agency that is to operate the waterway until 1999 now i think the panamanian government has to show that it can manage the canal efficiently at the height of panama s political and economic turmoil , many of the canal commission s 7 , 602 employees , more than 85 percent of them panamanian , were harassed and threatened by the noriega government mr manfredo said that two days before the united states invasion , he learned that the general had been plotting my physical elimination the canal employees also found themselves caught by united states economic sanctions when the reagan administration suspended canal revenue payments to panama in april 1988 , general noriega retaliated by virtually banning them from activities like traveling abroad , receiving packages in the mail and even registering cars revenue is off but through it all , ship traffic on the canal was hardly disrupted in fact , canal economists say , none of the waterway s business problems in the last six years have had anything to do with general noriega , who avoided any action that the americans could interpret as a threat to the canal since 1986 , about 12 , 000 ships have used the waterway each year , although last year s toll revenue declined 10 million from 1988 , to 329 million tolls are based on vessel size and cargo economists say the drop was caused by plummeting grain sales , a slump in imports of japanese cars , and economic slowdowns in japan and the united states the new civilian government has immediate and longterm decisions to make about the waterway for one thing , the panamanians will have decide whether they want to try to operate the canal at a profit over the last decade , the americans have run it as a breakeven operation , as mandated by congress since 1979 , it has taken in 4 billion and spent 4 billion in the short term , mr manfredo and other canal officials say , panama needs to demonstrate to shippers that it is committed to running the waterway in a businesslike fashion the most obvious place to begin , they think , is to rehabilitate the canal s two ports , balboa , on the gulf of panama , and cristobal , on the caribbean near colon , the country s second largest city the government runs both ports balboa , where ships enter from the pacific ocean , is mainly a refueling and servicing depot cristobal , on the atlantic side , handles a huge volume of goods going through the colon free zone , the world s largest dutyfree port after hong kong under general noriega , balboa , cristobal and the country s nine other ports fell into the same spiral of graft and corruption as other government agencies maintenance and security fell off , docks rotted , equipment rusted and pilferage spread the decline accelerated under the effects of the american sanctions and sporadic disputes between the government and dock workers' unions noriega appointed a lot of people who knew little or nothing about running the system , and now the ports are a total mess , said richard a wainio , an american who is director of planning at the canal commission ports need money if they 're going to spend their limited funds wisely , they 're going to have to concentrate on the ports , mr wainio said that would be a positive sign that panama really means business mr manfredo said the government of president guillermo endara had taken an important first step by naming jerry salazar , a highly experienced lawyer and engineer , as the new director of the national port authority general noriega used to say he built his 15 , 000member military in part to fulfill a treaty requirement that panama prepare to defend the canal mr manfredo smiles at that explanation
austin , tex , feb 4 the times have been few and far between when university of texas fans could complain about a scarcity of tickets to a longhorn basketball game for that matter , it has been awhile since the southwest conference itself could generate much excitement in the sport but as arkansas prevailed over texas , 10396 , in overtime this afternoon , passion for basketball seemed abundant here and around the swc a capacity crowd of 16 , 231 at erwin center experienced a range of emotions this afternoon as the longhorns , the conference s secondplace team , took on arkansas , the leader without an swc loss , in a wild shootout that featured a scuffle and a coach walking off the court in the closing seconds of the game to protest officiating , then coming back after his team had tied the score streak reaches 11 arkansas , ranked no 3 in the newsagency polls , extended its winning streak to 11 games and all but locking up its second consecutive regularseason conference championship this was the greatest win of my career , bar none , said nolan richardson , the arkansas coach it s just wonderful to come into texas and play a great team and pull off a victory like we did here today but richardson almost certainly made his share of enemies this afternoon when he walked off the court with 13 seconds left in the game , to protest an intentionalfoul call that he believed was sealing a razorback loss with texas leading by 8483 , lee mayberry of arkansas was called for an intentional foul against lance blanks explains his motive the intentional foul is always a tough call , and it s a real tough call to make in a game that s going down to the wire , richardson said i just did n't want the official to decide who won the basketball game asked if walking out or pulling one s team off the court to protest officiating might be considered bad sportsmanship , richardson , who also left the court in a game against texas a m this season , said , a lot of coaches have left the court benford williams , a texas guard , said i felt like he was giving up his players , and giving up on the game but what it did was really motivate them to play harder as a team richardson s departure was met with boos and taunts , which were replaced by even louder cheers when blanks made both foul shots texas retained possession of the ball , and the longhorns' travis mays was fouled with 12 seconds left but he missed the first shot of a oneandone , and arkansas got the rebound mayberry , the country s leader in 3point fieldgoal percentage , wound his way up court , spun left , spun right , and with blanks right on him , fired a 3point shot that hit nothing but net the basket tied the score with four seconds left and , as it turned out , sent the game into overtime coach is retrieved the arkansas managers sprinted to the locker room to bring richardson back to more taunts and boos for the fiveminute extra session the texas coach , tom penders , complained that richardson should have been awarded a technical foul for leaving the court but the officials said that since the arkansas coach left during a deadball foul situation , no technical was called for when coach does something like that , it pumps us up more , said oliver miller , the arkansas center in addition to being a test of the state of the swc , the game was a barometer for how far the longhorns have come since penders became their coach in 1988 last season , his first , the longhorns were 259 and finished second in the conference the previous season , they were 1613 and finished fourth pressure defense decisive tempers flared several times today , and there was a scuffle in the first half , though no one was ejected once the game went into overtime , arkansas s pressure defense , which forced 25 texas turnovers , finally took its toll penders , while unhappy about the loss , said he was satisfied that the conference was beginning to attract attention the southwest is where the big eight was , about four or five years ago , he said there s tremendous interest in basketball now there was n't five years ago
in the new confessions a novel by william boyd dealing knowledgeably with the early years of the movie industry the protagonist is a film director with striking views a film technique , he declares , originates in dreams we could dream slow motion before the movie camera was invented in our dreams we could cut between parallel action , we assembled montage shots this is where film derives its particular power it recreates on the screen what has been going on in our unconscious it is precisely this fantasist aspect of cinematography that holds out the greatest creative challenge , not only to professional film makers but perhaps even more so to video amateurs for while professionals must stay within the bounds of commercial acceptability , ambitious amateurs are free to extend their videographic essays beyond conventional limits until recently , however , their imaginative exploits were constrained by a lack of suitable editing equipment facilities for producing the effects required for the more venturesome and impressionistic kinds of movie making were found only on professional editing consoles , beyond the financial reach of most lately , however , some of these capabilities have appeared in relatively affordable home video gear the simplest setup for editing involves just a camcorder and a vcr or , alternatively , two vcr s the procedure is to copy selectively from one to the other , joining sequences in the desired order and eliminating unwanted footage the basic mode of transition in such an arrangement is the cut one scene abruptly abuts the next this can be accomplished simply by hitting the pause button on the recording vcr when the first scene ends and hitting it again when the next scene that is wanted appears on the monitor screen however , subtler cinematographic devices like a wipe , a fade or a dissolve will lend to home video presentations a touch of finesse a wipe is a line pattern moving across the screen like a sponge across a blackboard it appears to erase the foregoing action , leaving a new scene in its place it is particularly effective in suggesting the passage of time between two scenes a fade , by contrast , involves the slow disappearance of whatever is on screen , dimming gradually into the background traditionally , this background is black an esthetic convention left over from the precolor era of movies however , in video , the background for a fade can be made almost any color that seems dramatically appropriate the rate of fading is also variable , from swift extinction to hesitant lingering a fade is the traditional way to end a feature , perhaps with the closing titles emerging into the background but it may also be used as a transitional device between adjoining scenes one fading out while the other fades in in which case it is called a dissolve these four basic visual connectives cut , wipe , fade and dissolve are all available now on the more elaborate vcr s known as editing decks panasonic , jvc , philips , sony , toshiba and mitsubishi now offer decks with such capabilities some have a socalled jogshuttle control that enables the editor to define the exact frame at which a cut , wipe or fade is to be made several vcr s even offer a choice of impressionistic effects , such as giving the whole image the texture of a mosaic there are also models notably panasonic s new pvs4990 \( 1 , 599 \) that permit editing in the supervhs mode and also synchronize starts and stops between the playback deck and the recording deck however , synchronization is possible only if both decks \( playback and recording \) are made by the same manufacturer where playback and recording units of different provenance are to be used for dubbing and editing , it is best to connect a separate editing module between them perhaps the most versatile unit of this type is the directed plus \( 599 \) , made by videonics of campbell , calif in addition to a wide repertory of editing forms , the machine keeps the entire editing sequence in its digital memory this allows several alternate editing schemes to be previewed on a trial basis the videonics directed plus can also insert titles and other graphic material another useful editing aid is jvc s jxsv55 video editing processor \( 700 \) it lacks the digital memory in which cutting sequences can be preprogrammed therefore , each editing operation must be carried out individually , one after the other however , it can process signals in the supervhs mode \( without degenerating the quality of the supervhs image \) and allows corrective color balancing as well as soundtrack mixing the color balancing may be used to improve incorrectly exposed scenes or to tint various scenes at will , and the sound mixing permits adding narration or background music none of these devices put you on par with hollywood but they provide directorial options to challenge the imagination and will make you feel proud as the credits unroll on your own show
land of the long white cloud maori myths , tales and legends by kiri te kanawa illustrated by michael foreman 119 pp new york arcade publishing little , brown company 1695 \( ages 8 and up \) although adults may be drawn to this book by dame kiri te kanawa s name , children are not as easily influenced by celebrity authors a handsome cover will attract them initially , but only good stories will keep them reading from their folklore they expect heroism , romance , courage , imagination or cleverness virtue should be rewarded and malice must be punished the stories may be long or short , but the telling needs to be clear and direct with strong imagery yet a minimum of description this is n't an easy task for even an experienced writer , but dame kiri is so successful in her first book for children one suspects the patupaiarehe \( maori fairies \) themselves must have helped her land of the long white cloud , a collection of 21 stories , begins and ends with tales of the mythical demigod maui , the polynesian trickster in maui and the great fish , the hero uses the north island as a fishhook to catch the south island , hence the origin of new zealand , the land of the long white cloud in one of the most haunting stories , two young lovers from different tribes risk danger and the wrath of their families feminists will be pleased that hinemoa , the young heroine , undertakes a dangerous journey alone , as her loved one waits for children who enjoy a good scare , there are tales of taniwhas , huge , horrible monsters with an appetite for human flesh that lurk among rocks and deep water , waiting to seize and devour people in a contrasting fey tale , patupaiarehe are quietly charmed not by beautiful jewelry , but by the shadow of the jewelry the british illustrator michael foreman visited new zealand and his vibrant watercolor pictures are impressive the most striking paintings are those of the sea and the dreaded taniwhas unfortunately , the dragonlike monsters look more european than asian , and the image of the flutist tutanekai bears a striking resemblance to the greek god pan facial tattoos , such an important part of early maori culture and the subject of one story , appear in a single illustration , that of a cloud , not a person on the other hand , a dramatic ocean scene depicts the ornately carved stern piece of a maori canoe , and the spiral motifs of the culture decorate the text a map would have been helpful , especially to children , but the overall design is elegant and inviting students of folklore may be surprised to find only four maui stories , none of them trickster tales nor is there mention of the creation myth of rangi and pupa in the preface , dame kiri explains the basis for her selection the stories in this book are purely my recollection of those tales that i remembered and loved best when i was a child to refresh my memory i carried out limited research but i made no attempt to 'authenticate' the stories i simply wanted to record them as i remembered them and thus share my own childhood enjoyment even the most polished oral retelling requires considerable revision to be successful in print dame kiri has a true ear for the oral tradition listen to the final line of one story , to this day , the sun travels on his long lonely path across the sky at a very slow pace , giving us many more hours of sunlight than he used to do the melodic maori names beg to be read aloud , if one only knew how to pronounce them unfortunately , there is no guide to pronunciation , so readers will have to improvise the narrative is spare and taut description serves to move the plot along , as in one tale he could see the water glittering , but the glittering was not caused by the moonlight but by torches , and it was moving nearer and nearer to the land likewise , characterization is skeletal yet reveals essential personality traits one story begins rona was very much loved by her husband and her sons but , unfortunately for them all , she was very quick tempered fascinating stories would be reason enough to celebrate , but this collection also reflects early maori life values such as fidelity , obedience , politeness , modesty , courage and respect for nature are embedded in them the supernatural plays a major role in some of the stories , as characters enter and exit the underworld , tangle with the fairies and battle the monstrous taniwhas at the beginning of most of the stories , the author explains early maori beliefs and customs some of these prefaces also include childhood impressions and memories , a personal touch that children enjoy in her introduction to the stories , dame kiri , the daughter of an irish mother and maori father , says , i hope they will give you a glimpse of the unique maori culture that so coloured my childhood very little oceanic or polynesian folklore has been published for children , but land of the long white cloud does not win praise by default dame kiri te kanawa has proved herself an engaging storyteller and guide draiwing

bangkok , thailand , feb 4 the golden triangle of southeast asia , whose flow of drugs the united states has been trying to control for 25 years , is once again the singlelargest source of heroin coming into america , with production levels rising sharply in 1987 , only 18 percent of the heroin in the united states originated in southeast asia today the figure is at least 45 percent six years ago , 5 percent of the heroin in new york city was southeast asian today , according to the united states drug enforcement administration , the figure is 80 percent the increase is a result of many factors , western diplomats and lawenforcement officials say , ranging from unrest in myanmar , formerly burma , to a decision by some drug smugglers to bypass latin america , which has gotten increasing attention from governmental authorities , and seek safer routes the changing patterns of heroin supply have brought new and unwanted attention to thailand as the main smuggling and shipment center for heroin from the golden triangle , where myanmar , laos and thailand meet thai economy booms although thailand is praised by western diplomats for having sharply reduced the amount of opiumpoppy cultivation on its territory , the rapidly developing communications and transport systems of it booming economy are also being used for shipping the increasing amounts of heroin being produced in laos and myanmar to europe and america the large growth in thai exports and in tourism here provides more options for smuggling , ranging from individual couriers to large shipments hidden deep in legitimate exports moving through containerized ports the amount of money at stake , western diplomats and thai officials say , makes the problem of corruption among thai police , army and customs officials , none of whom are paid very well , a growing concern even for a wellintentioned thai government that cooperates with western lawenforcement authorities thai sensitivity to public suggestions of corruption and complicity is very high , but the tone of even private discussions about drugs between american and thai officials is becoming more forthright and even , at times , angry , western diplomats say , despite extensive cooperation between the two governments we 're trying to get across to the thais that drugs are an international problem and that thailand is a target , too , a diplomat said 3 million in antidrug aid despite the increased flow of heroin from the region , the united states provides only 3 million a year in antidrug aid to thailand , down from 35 million in the 1989 fiscal year the request for the 1991 fiscal year is 4 million the money is used to help thailand install computerized immigration checks , support raids on opium refineries and opiumcrop eradication , help a cropsubstitution program and finance some drugtreatment centers given that less than 2 percent of the region s opium is grown in thailand but that most of it is shipped from here , the aid is being focused more on improving customs checks and police training the major increase in opium cultivation is taking place in myanmar and laos , two of the world s most isolated countries the laotian government , which the united states has in the past accused of involvement in drug production , agreed only last month to start a cropsubstitution program , with an initial american commitment of some 200 , 000 in aid a 6 million to 8 millionayear program to aid myanmar s military government in crop eradication was suspended along with all other american aid and loans in september 1988 , after a bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators that aid was in part siphoned to other military uses and only held down the rate of increase in opium production but some members of congress , like representative charles b rangel , democrat of new york , argue that with opium cultivation in myanmar out of control , the aid should now be renewed , despite objections to the regime on humanrights grounds and some evidence that the burmese government is itself involved in the drug trade to boost its tiny foreigncurrency reserves productions rising sharply western experts say that depending on the growing season , which runs through march , at least 2 , 600 metric tons of raw opium will be produced in the golden triangle and perhaps as much as 3 , 000 tons , producing 300 tons of heroin even the lower figure represents an increase of 44 percent over two years ago , much of it coming from myanmar western experts estimate that about 2 , 200 to 2 , 600 tons of opium will be produced this year in myanmar , compared with 2 , 000 tons last year and about 1 , 600 in 1988 thailand will produce about 50 tons , about the same as the last two years , but only a third of the 150 tons produced in 1970 the estimated figure this year for laos is between 300 and 400 tons last year , the estimate was between 200 and 300 tons , and the year before that , between 100 and 200 tons but western experts say no one really knows for sure with the increase in heroin production , thailand s role of regional entrepot is drawing more criticism concern in congress
from a black screen , the yiddishaccented words ring out nostalgically i came to america in 1914 , by way of philadelphia , a gentle voice recalls that s where i got off the boat and then i came to baltimore it was the most beautiful place you 've ever seen in your life the voice is that of sam krichinsky , a wallpaper hanger , a jewish immigrant , and suddenly he is walking down a baltimore street festooned with lights , lights hanging in an arch from one side to the other there were lights everywhere , sam says what lights they had it was a celebration of lights i thought they were for me and then there are fireworks , for it is the fourth of july the sky exploded , sam says people cheered the man walking down the street and intoning the words is the german actor armin muellerstahl the words themselves are by barry levinson , baltimore native , screenwriter and director , for whom the sky has been exploding and people cheering loudly in recent years in hollywood the movie is avalon , which is set in baltimore and opens friday mr levinson won an academy award for his direction of rain man , which has grossed an estimated 500 million and which also won oscars for best film of 1988 and for dustin hoffman as best actor the previous year , he directed good morning , vietnam , which starred robin williams and has grossed about 250 million before that , his baltimore films , diner and tin men , which he both wrote and directed , garnered him critical raves and a reputation as a creative and idiosyncratic film maker , one not wedded to , or even largely interested in , the action and violence endemic to modern moviemaking now barry levinson is back in baltimore but this is not the late1950 s baltimore of diner , with its high school buddies hanging around and talking mostly of girls , or the 1963 baltimore of tin men , with its aluminumsiding salesmen ever on the make for a profit this is a different baltimore the humor of the earlier movies is there , but it is longer ago , and the memories are more melancholy the time is just after world war ii , and the story is the story of mr levinson s closely knit family , his parents , his grandparents , his aunts , his uncles , his cousins , and of how the postwar society led to the breakup of that family , and , by extension , of almost everyone s the cast includes lou jacobi and the yiddishtheater star leo fuchs as two of sam krichinsky s brothers , the veteran british actress joan plowright as sam s wife , aidan quinn and elizabeth perkins as their son and daughterinlaw \( mr levinson s parents \) , and elijah wood as michael , who is really the young barry the producer is mark johnson , who has worked with mr levinson on all of his films as avalon continues , the audience sees that the voice of sam krichinsky is the voice of an older man telling a group of young children how he came to this country it is the late 1940 s , and the setting is a family circle meeting at sam s rowhouse home in baltimore sam s tale is one of five brothers , all of whom become wallpaper hangers , and all of whom work together to help one another to get ahead in america but even as sam is telling the story , both outer and inner forces the advent of suburbia , the prosperity of some family members that is unshared by others , the invention of a piece of livingroom furniture that talks and shows images are beginning to conspire to change that way of life and banish that closeness forever i was always intrigued by some of the stories my grandfather told me , says the 48yearold mr levinson , speaking by telephone from his southern california home but for a long time i could n't make any sense of them in terms of how they could be used in a movie but then i began to think of them in terms of his story the immigrant experience and my father s life and i connected them to the advent of television now those ideas seem on face value to be radically different from one another but it all suddenly began to make sense to me he hesitates i know it sounds like a crazy combination , he says immigration , assimilation and the effects of television on the family is a peculiar blending but it made sense it all began , mr levinson says , with one line of dialogue , a line that is spoken by the grandfather at the end of the movie if i knew things would no longer be , i would have tried to have remembered better you know how somehow you remember something , and it stays in your head , but you do n't know where it came from \? mr levinson says the line was just there and it seemed very important for a long time , though , he says , he did not realize what the importance was and then , as the movie came together in his mind , the meaning of the line began to cohere for him in a very crucial way he understood that what he was trying to do was to preserve something from the past we 're at a crossroads , he says , which in fact may lead to the complete breakup of the family structure in america it is drifting and coming apart , and as it deteriorates it means less and less it s responsible for less of our behavior it does n't monitor us in any way remember the old idea that you would bring shame upon your family if you did certain things \? do you ever hear it any more \?
most of the pitchers could use a few more innings , davey johnson said , bidding farewell to baseball s short spring most of the guys could use a few more atbats but , i think we 'll win , the manager of the mets conntinued in fact , i think we should be favored to win johnson took charge of the mets in 1984 , when they were a lastplace team looking for answers he found them the mets zoomed to second place in the national league east for two years , then won the world series in 1986 and have never run worse than second during his six years of predicting pennants now the mets are recast , and johnson is still predicting pennants , and for good reasons he has fewer crosscurrents to contend with this year , and he has more starting pitchers to throw and they are his ultimate assets rich in pitching dwight gooden and frank viola , who both have won the cy young award david cone , who won 34 games and lost 11 in the last two years and ron darling and sid fernandez , who won 14 games apiece last year and , in the bullpen bob ojeda , who once won 18 as a starter in 1986 , and alejandro pena and john franco are the new stoppers the most threatening question mark also seems to have been removed gooden , disabled for three months by a torn muscle in the right shoulder , has apparently healed johnson s team is entering a transition from the years when gary carter and keith hernandez were the senior stars , but the manager s relations with the front office seem more stable than usual and his new players are established stars with winning credentials plagued by extensive slumps and injuries , the mets ran second last season , six games behind the chicago cubs they will open the 1990 season against the pittsburgh pirates tomorrow at shea stadium with the old feeling that they can still win against any kind of opposition fewer complexities this time i think this team has a chance to be very good this year , johnson said , and outstanding in 1991 we do n't have the complexities of last year , when we had carter and hernandez both injured and both preoccupied because they were playing the final year of their contracts and we had some problems with jobs and roles , and some tensions maybe we 're not the best but we 're a happy club and i'm more relaxed because this is the club i want to manage the roles are clearly defined we do n't have 10 guys waiting to play one position the senior stars , who were hurt , are n't here it 'll make for a less controversial year normally , when a team loses superstar cocaptains , it suffers a loss of leadership and virtuoso quality but carter and hernandez were both past their primes last season , both spent nearly half the season on the disabled list , both tended to withdraw as their time grew shorter there is no guarantee that their heirs will do the job but they have experience and some record of success barry lyons , the reserve catcher for three years , will succeed carter behind the plate with help from mackey sasser and mike marshall may not carry the gold glove of hernandez at first base , but he hit 137 home runs in eightplus seasons with the los angeles dodgers , and he arrived with enough power to nudge dave magadan out of the job and onto the bench miller put in center field the only other vacancy on johnson s team is in center field , where the front office has been playing musical chairs lenny dykstra was traded for juan samuel last june , then mookie wilson was traded in august and finally samuel was traded in december so , having traded three centerfielders , the mets suddenly had none but they are facing that shortage by opening the job to one of their favorite allround players , keith miller miller s arrival gives the mets an interesting cast in the middle of the defense lyons behind the plate , kevin elster and gregg jefferies at shortstop and second base , respectively , and miller in center lyons and miller may have something to prove , but elster grew into a highly professional shortstop last season and jefferies survived his ordeal as the teacher s pet and a marked man around the league the difference up the middle is allimportant to a club , johnson said our kids are going into their second full year at short and second , and they 're established the power part of the lineup also established is the power quadrant of the lineup howard johnson opened last season at third base with a sore shoulder and a bruised ego after hearing rumors all winter that he would be traded but he recovered from both problems , hit 36 home runs , knocked in 101 runs and became the leader of the offense darryl strawberry , who hit 29 home runs but batted only 225 , underwent treatment for alcohol abuse during february and seems solid as he opens his seventh season in the big leagues this is also his walk year , meaning that he can walk if the mets do n't sign him to a longterm contract on both counts , he is crammed with motivation the other big bats are carried by kevin mcreynolds in left field and the newcomer marshall at first base in their best seasons , these four have hit a combined total of 132 home runs and to davey johnson , a graduate of the earl weaver school of threerun home runs , power is a thing of beauty can the manager of the mets mingle all these new elements and orchestrate a rave performance \? i did n't mind all the complexities of last year , johnson said , not too convincingly but i like it better when you get through them and can have a little fun i think we 'll have some fun this year i think we 'll win photo

washington , march 6 king fahd of saudi arabia donated 1 million to nancy reagan s antidrug campaign in 1985 while the reagan administration was considering a request from his country to buy surveillance aircraft , a former white house official said today the saudi donation to the community foundation of greater washington , one of at least two organizations that managed mrs reagan s antidrug programs james rosebush , who served as mrs reagan s chief of staff , confirmed the donation and that the saudis were lobbying very hard at the same time for the purchase of awacs surveillance planes but to say that this particular gesture tipped the scales is highly unlikely , he said mr rosebush said king fahd wanted to do something on a problem of social concern that he knew the president and mrs reagan were concerned about despite strong protests from israel , president reagan decided to send saudi arabia the planes in 1986 , though in smaller numbers than requested mr rosebush said that several heads of state may have contributed to mrs reagan s program but that none contributed nearly as much as king fahd he said the sultan hassanal bolkiah of brunei donated 500 , 000 to the national federation of parents for drug free youth , a second organization tied to mrs reagan s antidrug program , in september 1983 as a goodwill gesture he said the sultan also gave a halfmilliondollar donation for the homeless in new york city to mayor edward i koch s administration the post also disclosed a 1 million contribution to mrs reagan s efforts by a syriansaudi businessman , mouaffak al midani around the time they were helping mrs reagan s antidrug efforts , both king fahd and the sultan of brunei also covertly contributed money to the nicaragua rebels at the request of the united states
both the house and senate have approved expansions of a wonderful but littleknown antipoverty weapon called the earned income tax credit this income supplement helps working parents with low wages by reducing their income taxes or , if they owe no tax , by paying them cash the program now totals about 6 billion yearly the senate would raise the earned income tax credit , or eitc , only for families with children under age 4 , at a cost of 3 billion , and spend an additional 75 billion on other tax subsidies all over five years the house version would adjust for family size , increase credits for families with children under age 6 , and would cost 185 billion over five years above present expenditures the eitc is the best means available to the nation for lifting the working poor out of poverty the house bill recognizes this more profoundly and generously than the senate s , and should prevail the earned income tax credit is paid only to poor parents who work , thereby discouraging welfare a fulltime worker would need to earn about 650 an hour to lift a family out of poverty in 1991 the minimum wage will rise to 425 an hour , leaving a gap of 225 for the eitc to fill the current eitc is worth at most 50 cents an hour the house bill would roughly double that amount , still leaving a typical family well short of the poverty threshold if congress tripled the eitc , a minimum wage worker would earn about 575 an hour in combination with day care , medical and other federal subsidies , that would be enough to push many singleearner families out of poverty expanding the eitc much further becomes prohibitively expensive , according to david ellwood of harvard university the problem is phasing it out once the family s income rises above poverty if congress tries to control costs by phasing it out quickly , it would discourage families from working longer or for higher wages the upshot is that the eitc by itself cannot end poverty among working families but it can be tripled , which would be well beyond what the house , let alone the senate , has so far proposed the senate bill spends too little money on the eitc in part because it spends too much on other , less effective tax credits it would create a refundable tax credit to offset the cost of medical insurance for the working poor the goal is admirable , but the plan is flawed this credit would encourage employers to shift more of their health care expenses onto their lowpaid workers the money is better spent on the eitc another provision in the senate bill would make partially refundable the existing dependent care tax credit thus poor families that owe no tax would receive a cash payment to offset part of their day care expenses this is a good idea yet most poor families would be better off if the money were spent instead on a higher eitc for one thing , its benefits are protected against inflation while the dependent care credit is not even with a substantial eitc , poverty would remain sickeningly prevalent nearly threefourths of povertylevel families with children have no parent working full time these families are beyond the eitc s reach and there are other problems almost 40 percent of eitc payments were sent to ineligible families and an unknown percent of eligible families do n't even know how to apply none of these problems are insurmountable the eitc is already a good program the house bill would make it a whole lot better
rrthis is the prime month for those who fish in the hudson river for striped bass , the adult populations of which are making their annual spawning runs for several years , production of stripers in the hudson has been booming , a situation that this spring has resulted in the river s shad fishermen complaining that they are spending too much time releasing bass from their nets the stripers cannot be sold because their flesh contains concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl \( pcb \) above the level deemed fit for human consumption by the food and drug administration the shad and their young , which spend a relatively short time in the river , are not dangerously contaminated new york state allows rodandreel anglers in the hudson to keep one bass a day of 18 or more inches , but issues health warnings about consumption of those fish hudson striper fishing is not a simple endeavor there have been years when every time i fished the lower part of the croton river or off the reef that extends downstream from croton point in the hudson , i caught at least two or three stripers on every sortie and there was one may afternoon in the croton itself when for at least an hour every third cast resulted in a strike or a hooked fish on the lastnamed adventure we were fishing from a canoe in the first pool below croton gorge , using small , lightweight swimming plugs , rebels and rapalas none of the fish were over six pounds , but the action was furious on the other hand , i have spent hours on the big river with tom lake of wappingers falls and taken only a few tiny stripers on bucktails and lake has been intimate with the hudson for decades lake , who for the last four years has been netting shad commercially with his son before that he worked as a crew member on other netting operations said he had caught quite a few 21 to 24inch stripers in his net , but he added that such fish appeared to be showing up more in fixed nets rather than the drift nets that he and several other upriver commercial fishermen use lake , who is also a dedicated sport fisherman , said that rodandreel fishing for stripers was slow earlier this spring it has been a crazy spring , windy , wet and rather cold , he said we had forsythia blooming when snow was coming down but about a week and a half ago , one fellow caught a couple of dozen stripers between 6 and 18 pounds in haverstraw bay on one trip , and there was one over 30 pounds taken from catskill creek where would he recommend fishing for stripers this week \? if you had called me a couple of days ago , i would have suggested haverstraw bay , he said , but the water temperature is now in the mid50 s when that happens , it s as if someone turned on a switch and the stripers begin to swim upriver to spawn right now i would be looking for them in the hudson highlands between west point and poughkeepsie , and in the week ahead , there should be good fishing even farther upstream to kingston and beyond lake says that some of the best may fishing for larger stripers can be had in the tributaries or their mouths using large rebels or rapalas at night such tributaries include the croton annsville creek in peekskill popolopen creek , which enters the hudson on the west side just above bear mountain bridge fishkill creek in beacon wappingers creek in hamburg roundout creek in kingston esopus creek in saugerties and catskill creek in catskill rrrichie ferriss , whose croton bait and tackle shop has been on riverside avenue \( route 9a \) in croton for 26 years , said they 've been catching an awful lot of stripers if you have a boat , haverstraw bay and the area around croton point have been hot spots ferriss said anglers using bloodworms fished right on the bottom were accounting for many of the bass in the croton point area there are locations on croton point where one may angle from shore one spot is adjacent to the ball field and in recent years those shorebased bottom fishermen have been doing very well lures seem to work best , he said , where bait fish congregate and there is a heavy flow of water , as at the outlet of the croton river ferris said years of angling on the hudson and talking with other anglers had not enabled him to devise any formula for choosing the best tide phase one day the fish are there the next day , under the same conditions , they are not , he said a lot of it is hitormiss he added that the biggest striper taken in his area this year thus far weighed a little over 27 pounds new york state s season for stripers in the hudson opens in midmarch and by the end of may the best fishing is over

february , the bank asked him to provide additional collateral for an outstanding loan mr meador offered a portion of the artworks , and the bank accepted the object or objects , the director said the bank gets a lawyer when willi a korte , a west german specialist in the recovery of cultural property , visited the bank on may 7 and told mr farley that the artworks had been stolen from germany , mr

yankee fans who hoped that last year s amicable settlement was the last dreary chapter in the long and distracting dispute between george steinbrenner and dave winfield were inflicted with a rancorous epilogue yesterday the daily news reported that steinbrenner s chief informant in the dispute , howard spira , a former associate of winfield s , reneged on an agreement with the yankee owner by pestering him for money and threatening to disclose tapes of their telephone conversations that prompted steinbrenner to file an extortion complaint with the federal bureau of investigation , the news said fbi officials in new york said yesterday that agents searched spira s home in the bronx earlier this month they would give no other details of the investigation 40 , 000 payment spira , who could not be reached yesterday , confirmed key points of the daily news account in an interview with the associated press steinbrenner s office released a statement saying only that the matter had been referred to federal authorities the daily news s account , which included transcripts of the telephone conversations none of which indicated any impropriety on steinbrenner s part said steinbrenner gave spira 40 , 000 in january after spira promised to make no further demands steinbrenner , denying spira s claim that the 40 , 000 had been part of a promised payment for spira s help in the winfield dispute , told the news he had given spira the money out of the goodness of my heart , and because i cared about this guy , who in my opinion was a lost human being there was , however , one indication that steinbrenner may have had another humanitarian motive shielding yankee fans from further distractions stemming from his dispute with winfield this dispute was over contributions the yankee slugger s contract required the owner and the yankees to make to a foundation established by winfield to help children the daily news s report said that before receiving the 40 , 000 , spira signed a twopage agreement including a promise that he would not seek or create any publicity , or make any public statement with respect to the nature or substance of this matter in discussing the matter with the daily news and providing the newspaper with the tapes and other materials , spira said he had been under emotional duress when he signed the agreement the news said that spira had asked it , other newspapers and television programs to pay him 50 , 000 for his story , but after all refused , he told the news his story for no money or promises sought more money the tapes spira provided the news included recent telephone conversations in which steinbrenner rebuffed spira s demand that steinbrenner pay him an additional 110 , 000 and spira threatened to go public with the matter the 30yearold spira , a former employee of winfield s foundation , supplied steinbrenner with information supporting steinbrenner in his dispute with winfield last september , after filing a series of lawsuits against each other , steinbrenner and winfield reached an agreement in which winfield acknowledged he had not made 230 , 000 in required contributions and steinbrenner released 600 , 000 in yankee contributions that had been held in escrow

eduard tubin is one of music s loners estonian by birth , the composer spent the last half of his life in sweden he followed no fashions , belonged to no school when he died in 1982 , he left a legacy of 10 symphonies , two operas , two ballets and a variety of concertos , cantatas and works in smaller forms virtually none of this music is widely known in the united states the release of the 10 symphonies and seven other works on seven bis compact disks shows that the loss has been ours in harmonic and expressive range , tubin s nearest kin are bartok and prokofiev but tubin speaks with his own voice , which like bartok s and prokofiev s is that of a 20thcentury european uprooted by war , persecution and flight from his homeland the works on these disks are not merely well crafted they move strongly and surely toward emotional centers born in 1905 , tubin studied composition in estonia and budapest , where he learned the music of kodaly and bartok though primarily a composer , he became the conductor of a theater orchestra in tartu , estonia , and later married one of the theater s dancers tubin remained in tartu through the successive soviet and german occupations of estonia in world war ii when soviet forces advanced on the country again in 1944 , he and his family fled across the baltic to sweden he spent the rest of his life in stockholm , but without allegiance to the prevailing avantgarde anthony hodgson s 1984 scandinavian music , one of the few studies in english to deal with tubin , allots him only one paragraph , which places him outside the swedish line of 20thcentury development because of his estonian roots it took an estonianborn conductor , neeme jarvi , and a swedish label , bis , to bring the music to a wider audience through the recorded cycle the project was a lengthy one , beginning in the early 1980 s , reaching fruition this year and involving four scandinavian and german orchestras bis is issuing the series only as cd s \( cd227 , cd297 , cd304 , cd306 , cd342 , cd351 and cd401 \) , but lp versions of some of the earlier releases may still be available tautness is the music s most striking quality the symphonies last about a halfhour each , typically in three movements themes reappear from movement to movement in changing contexts and guises , providing a unifying force unexpected overlays and juxtapositions of ideas a kaleidoscope of dance rhythms in the sixth symphony , for instance heighten the drama restless energy and a strong rhythmic drive find release in arching melodies , distant fanfares and horn calls , and brooding or spectral touches like bartok , tubin draws on his folk heritage , which saturates the music with a resiliency that transcends mere nationalism like prokofiev and shostakovich , he celebrates the endurance of the human spirit amid the hardships of war especially in the early works , the music is strongly contrapuntal that and a predilection for surging timpani , trombones and basses sometimes create a bottomheavy web of sound , as in hindemith some melodramatic and tawdry touches also intrude yet there is a clear progression from extroversion and profusion of ideas to introspection and economy of means , with the wartime symphonies nos 3 and 4 as the dividing line while the first and second \( the legendary \) symphonies suggest carl nielsen s sinfonia espansiva in sheer exuberance of event , the later works grow sparer and darker , seemingly shadowed by tragedy together with the 1946 fifth symphony , the third and fourth form a powerful war trilogy composed in 194042 , the third has the ominous repetitions and epic sweep of shostakovich s wartime symphonies , though it ends with a march of triumph that recalls the roman legions' thunderous tread in respighi s pines of rome the fourth was completed in 1943 in a soviet air raid just before the 1944 premiere in tallinn , the manuscript was singed when the safe containing it fell into the cellar of the burning theater the performance went on , but the score finally crumbled and tubin had to redo it in condensed form in sweden lyrical and reflective , the fourth carries only distant echoes of war olav roots , who conducted the tallinn premiere , said that after the third s heroic struggles , in the fourth the nordic night seems to have spread a soft light over the countryside of the homeland , whose features had lost their sharpness in the gloom to end the trilogy , the fifth symphony , which draws its lyricism from estonian folk melody , bursts into exultation in the subsequent symphonies tubin continued to refine his craft the anguished , restless seventh is almost a chamber symphony the eighth and ninth look more deeply inward the tenth , in one movement like sibelius s final symphony , is the most concise and introspective of the series the shorter works that fill out the disks are equally varied and striking the suite from the ballet kratt , in which a peasant sells his soul to the devil , is colorful and folklike , in the vein of stravinsky s and falla s ballets on folk subjects the piano concertino has the brilliance and driving energy of the prokofiev concertos most remarkable and atypical of all is the 1979 requiem for fallen soldiers , scored for mezzosoprano soloist , male chorus , organ , drums and trumpet recalling estonia s defeat in a 1919 war of independence , it is at once a dirge and an expression of patriotism a swedish student choir sings it radiantly the swedish radio symphony , gothenburg symphony orchestra , bergen philharmonic society and bamberg symphony do not always have the seamless finish and blend of the best european and american orchestras , but under mr jarvi s direction they have something more important fire and conviction the bergen performance of the fourth symphony is outstanding it is the 1981 premiere of tubin s revision , recorded live , and the playing pours out of the speakers like molten lava the recorded sound loses focus on some disks , but never enough to interfere with listening the records whet the appetite to hear our american orchestras play these absorbing works photo eduard tubinthe

if more of america s schoolchildren knew the difference between dan quayle and yasir arafat , the competition between channel one and cnn newsroom would be moot unfortunately , tests of teenagers keep revealing prodigious ignorance of much of what is going on around them so the question becomes whether television can do anything to improve a painful condition and , if so , whether either of the two daily news programs now being offered to schools may help in that job , and whether one is preferable to the other the argument , which began last spring with a sixweek tryout of channel one , whittle communications' 12minute newscast , including commercials , resumed with the program s return last week turner broadcasting s cnn newsroom , a 15minute newscast with no commercials , has been running since august without knowing anything more than that , most teachers would reasonably choose the commercialfree program but there is another factor using the revenue from advertising , channel one is able to give schools , without cost , the equipment they need to deliver the program to classrooms cnn newsroom gives nothing but itself , and charges 1 a day for teacher guides one must assume that newsroom is most attractive to schools that are already blessed with cable hookups or satellite dishes , with video recorders and with television monitors in their classrooms , while less fortunate schools , most in need of whatever help they can get to attract and hold students' attention , will find channel one inviting newsroom is now shown in some 4 , 000 schools , but turner cannot say how many students actually get to watch whittle , which has started out in 400 schools , foresees rapid expansion it promises that by 1991 channel one will be reaching 6 , 000 , 000 students across the country the programs have a lot in common the anchors cassandra henderson and brian todd on newsroom and michele ruiz and hicks neal on channel one are young and peppy both programs offer a mix of quick headlines and uncomplicated background pieces of 2 to 4 minutes last week , channel one carried a series on postwar berlin and newsroom had a series based on a poll on drug use the packaging is colorful , the focus on youth newsroom spoke with a young woman who was at bloody sunday in selma , ala , 25 years ago and channel one offered an enterprising piece on how the cut in military spending was affecting teenagers in kentucky for whom the army has offered a way out of the coal mines both programs move to a rock beat and toss in bits of trivia along the way the big difference is that channel one is interrupted periodically by spots for such items as m m s , cheetos and gillette razors as well as antidrug messages for sheer information , newsroom wins as well as being plugfree , it offers five minutes more of news and background that tap seasoned cnn correspondents , and the pace is somewhat less frenetic but it s a close call should students in schools that lack the television sets to show newsroom simply be left to do without \? the school authorities in new york , california and a few other states have so decided indeed , virtually the entire educationist establishment has come down hard on channel one on the grounds of commercial pollution a virtuous position , but it may also mean that many youngsters , particularly in the poorest neighborhoods , will be deprived of the possibility of receiving information in a form that they might actually absorb the sorry record of those who run public education makes their opposition to channel one a sort of testimonial it remains a source of astonishment , given the muchlamented failings of america s schools , that groups like the american association of school administrators , the national association of secondary school principals and the national pta should proudly take the high road and leave principals and teachers to struggle along in the trenches a number of cable channels as well as public television offer worthy programs for youngsters , especially on science , but as one of the advertisements for channel one puts it , the problem is that students ca n't watch a television news show without a television set a recent gallup survey commissioned by whittle found nearly all of the teachers \( 94 percent \) who teach in a school with a thousand or more students say none of their classrooms are equipped with permanently stationed tv s , compared with 82 percent of those teaching in less populated schools is it better for students to have virtually nothing than to have some sort of regular supply of news interrupted by commercials \? is it better , as some educators argue , to have nothing than to have a daily dose of television in the classrooms with or without advertising \? there is good reason to resist the intrusion of the tube , but if the alternative is to leave many young americans in their present state of blankness , that surely constitutes a powerful reason to swallow one s misgivings and give television a chance some tests indicate that students who watch the news programs are learning from them , while all tests indicate that many are learning precious little about current events without them neither newsroom nor channel one can succeed unless teachers follow up and carry the classroom discussion beyond the headlines helping them find ways to do that would be a more fruitful as well as a more taxing role for the authorities and the experts than making pronouncements against commercialization the battle against commercialization in america is lost whether advertising makes its way into the schools or not teenagers can hardly be virginal about marketing techniques while high school coaches shill for sneaker makers if , as some fear , the whittle commercials prove an advance guard for other forms of merchandising , can that be more destructive than the prevailing condition \? the ideal of schools as zones of purity has appeal , but their main function is to teach and it is their failure at that basic task that is opening the doors to the merchandisers if principle prevents some principals from tolerating commercials , then it is up to them to find the money for the equipment needed to take advantage of the commercialfree program in fact , many principals and teachers are apparently welcoming channel one maybe they are being seduced by the electronic goodies , but it is just possible that they are desperate enough to try anything as for educators who are appalled by the invasion of the classroom by pop news , their criticisms would be more persuasive if they could come up with other ways to teach current events that show results granted , neither of the present offerings can bring joy to those who would like youngsters to spend more time over books than in front of the tube , but with an epidemic of ignorance raging , is that really the choice outside the most privileged communities \? if the prospect of television in the classrooms shakes up the establishment and inspires innovative alternatives , then channel one and cnn newsroom will have performed an even greater service than they promised meanwhile , let s see what both can do photo the channel one and cnn newsroom news programs for schools are battling for viewers students at central high school in knoxville , tenn , watched channel one in a test
allegations that dave winfield has bet on nonbaseball sports events , raised in this week s issue of sports illustrated , have brought strong denials from the outfielder and his lawyer , jeffrey klein , who also questioned the credibility of the magazine s sources the magazine reports that two sources , one of them a freelance writer , allen barra , said though they did not witness winfield placing a bet , they did overhear him discussing his own apparent involvement in sports gambling barra , the magazine said , recalled that five years ago he heard winfield talk about sports wagers in which he apparently had been involved and heard him make phone calls to get odds on sports events winfield , in the article , denies the accusations against him , calling them all fabrication klein said yesterday that winfield does not gamble , does n't discuss gambling or point spreads or consort with gamblers the article also quotes an unnamed source as having said that howard spira placed bets for winfield spira , who is under federal indictment , last night declined comment at this time but klein said , my understanding is that mr spira has never claimed that winfield gambled and never claimed he was placing bets for winfield according to spira s own statements , he was attempting to sell dirt for dollars so at a time when he was providing information to george steinbrenner he never mentioned any of this the magazine quoted john dowd , who investigated steinbrenner for baseball , as having said steinbrenner was asked for substantiation of gambling allegations the yankees' owner made against winfield and steinbrenner provided none
washington , may 24 president bush vetoed legislation today that would continue the federal subsidy for amtrak , the national passenger railroad system , saying he objected to a provision that would subject certain takeovers of freight railroad lines to government review although the white house said the veto had been provoked by this issue unrelated to passenger service , the bush administration has consistently opposed the subsidizing of amtrak operations congressional defiance in defiance of that opposition by both the president and his predecessor , ronald reagan , congress has repeatedly voted over the years to continue the amtrak subsidy , which under the current bill would amount to almost 700 million in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 if the veto is upheld , rail passengers will eventually face cuts in service or an increase in fares but the bill passed the senate by voice vote without debate , and passed the house of representatives on a vote of 322 to 93 it thus appears likely that the veto will be overridden , although it is possible that the language involving freight railroads will first be omitted upon reconsideration by a housesenate conference committee the administration s objections to the amtrak subsidy were not mentioned in the veto message issued by the white house today instead , mr bush criticized the freight rail provision , which would require the interstate commerce commission to review for approval all proposed acquisitions of railroads by companies that are not already involved in the railroad business 'unwarranted roadblock' under current laws , mergers and acquisitions by railroad companies are already reviewed this new regulatory burden would interfere with the ability of the nation s largest freight railroads to obtain needed capital or to change existing capital structure , the veto message said this requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the financial restructuring of the railroad industry many large railroads have been consolidating by spinning off small segments of their lines to smaller companies amtrak officials said the legislation was vital to their continued operations and urged that the veto be overridden the measure would authorize federal spending of 684 million in operating subsidies and capital investments for the fiscal year 1991 , which begins on oct 1 , and 712 million in the 1992 fiscal year an amtrak spokesman , clifford black , said the veto would have no immediate effect on daily train operations because the railroad is working with money that congress had already appropriated for 198992 had raised spending issue on may 1 , transportation secretary samuel k skinner said in a letter to representative john d dingell , the michigan democrat who heads the house energy and commerce committee , that he would recommend that mr bush veto the bill because of the unjustified amounts of federal spending it allows amtrak s own revenues have paid for an increasing share of the railroad s expenses over the years , and the operating subsidy has been shrinking but the rail line has said that to attract more customers and insure its eventual selfsufficiency , it must spend hundreds of millions of dollars in the next few years for new cars and other equipment the railroad has said that its ticket sales remain too small to pay for these investments the veto was the president s first this year last year , mr bush s first in office , he returned 10 bills to congress , and none of those vetoes were overriden
during the heady days of psychedelia and flower power in the 1960 s , terry riley suddenly found himself leading the life of a famous composer his in c \( 1964 \) garnered minimalism its first public acclaim and his rainbow in curved air \( 1968 \) , with its brightlycolored electric keyboard arpeggios and wideeyed hippie sentiments , attained genuine crossover status , linking classically oriented new music and progressive rock into a promising new synthesis but in the 1970 s , mr riley dropped almost entirely from view while his minimalist colleagues steve reich and philip glass achieved international fame , mr riley ceased notated composition altogether so complete was his disappearance that in the early 1980 s , when the kronos quartet finally coaxed him back toward musical notation , many listeners were shocked to discover that his new quartets sounded nothing like in c could these pieces really be by the same composer \? the answer to that question will become obvious this week , when new yorkers will have the opportunity to hear music spanning mr riley s entire compositional career on friday , at the rapp arts center , 220 east fourth street , in manhattan s east village , mr riley s new ensemble , khayal , will make its debut as part of the bang on a can festival during the second of the evening s two sets , the kronos quartet will jam with khayal , offering an impromptu version of in c and on saturday at alice tully hall , the kronos quartet will present the new york premiere of mr riley s mammoth string quartet , salome dances for peace all in all , it is not a bad week for the 55yearold composer , who has long enjoyed cult status as one of minimalism s founding fathers yet in the past mr riley has been in the unenviable position of finding himself inextricably linked with a single , youthful work , in c none of his subsequent compositions have had quite the same impact it is not hard to understand why in c , with its unrelenting pulse , clear tonal center , repeated melodic patterns and communally organized modular form , came as a breath of fresh air to an avantgarde that was suffocating under the weight of ultrarational , atonal serialism nothing that has happened since in american minimalism not the music of mr reichor mr glass or john adams would have taken the same course if not for in c , a fact that all thosecomposers readily admit but mr riley was never interested in exploring the abstract , systematic musical processes that came to fascinate mr reich and mr glass considering his background in jazz , it is perhaps not surprising that by the 1970 s he had stopped notating his compositions during a recent telephone interview from his remote northern california ranch , he said that that decision occurred partly because at the time there were n't enough new music groups that were really dedicated to learning the music well but one also suspects that it occurred primarily because mr riley s heart lay with improvisation , a process he could work out much more easily as a solo keyboard performer than as an ensemble composer the major difference between me and reich and glass was that they were n't improvising musicians they were writing everything out , mr riley said since i was really looking for ideas that would emerge during performance , i had to take the route of not writing things down , because otherwise i 'd have to follow my own road map and i wanted to be as spontaneous as possible another crucial factor , one that also worked to drive mr riley away from formal composition , was the study of nonwestern music in 1970 , he traveled to india to study with the vocalist pandit pran nath \( who also taught that other pioneering minimalist , la monte young \) when mr riley returned , he began setting aside a large amount of time for my studies in north indian classical music , which i felt needed to have six to eight hours a day of my attention and practice in fact , it is possible that if mr riley had not met the kronos quartet in 1978 when they were all teaching at mills college in oakland , calif , he might never have returned to notated composition david harrington , the kronos sfirst violinist , immediately attempted to convince mr riley to write a string quartet but , said mr riley , it took me a while to change gears from being a solo performer who composed music just for myself , to trying to write everything down at first i tried to make improvisation charts , but that was n't the way to work with the kronos they preferred to have everything written out at least all the notes mr harrington recalls being startled when the kronos quartet first began rehearsing mr riley s sunrise of the planetary dream collector \( 1981 \) it consisted of little slips of paper , not like any piece i 'd seen before right there in his studio we began to put these little fragments together , to assemble them into an order instead of feeling stifled by the notational process , mr riley felt liberated and he became obsessed with the stringquartet medium , one which offers the western composer opportunities to inflect pitch in ways more commonly associated with nonwestern music by 1984 , when he completed cadenza on the night plain , he had turned his back on the minimalism of in c , instead exploring sonic realms stretching from the longbreathed lyricism of north india to the spiky , fragmented development of bartok

bernie nicholls s debut in madison square garden had all the ingredients for a hollywood ending except that the rangers' flamboyant center failed at the fadeout nicholls had 10 shots on goal in the 22 tie with the st louis blues wednesday night to set a club mark for most shots in a game by a player this season but none found the back of the net , something nicholls has been doing with regularity in his nine seasons in the national hockey league i was credited with 10 shots , nicholls said , but i know i had about 20 at the net and at least 10 great opportunities most nights , they 're going in gets an assist nicholls , who came to the rangers from the los angeles kings for tomas sandstrom and tony granato 13 days ago , did earn his first point at home by assisting on darren turcotte s goal , which gave the rangers a 20 lead 12 minutes 49 seconds into the game nicholls had plenty of chances late in regulation and the overtime for what he called a good story ending his best chance was perhaps his last one with 1 29 left in the overtime , nicholls swiftly worked his way into the slot to get into shooting position and let go a 15foot wrist shot that curtis joseph , the rookie goaltender , put away with his glove i do n't think that save was as good as a lot of people thought , nicholls said when most of his teammates had already left the dressing room i did n't get all of that shot if i do , he s not saving it shutout relief joseph did save it , along with 26 others , after he replaced the injured vincent riendeau , and kept the st louis goal empty the rest of the way joseph entered the game at 13 54 of the first , after riendeau had allowed the goals to brian mullen and turcotte the success by joseph countered nicholls s debut at home and also john vanbiesbrouck s sharp goaltending for the rangers although it was his first start since jan 4 , vanbiesbrouck played without any signs of rustiness and was not responsible for brett hull s 47th of the season and dave lowry s 11th , a shorthanded goal that tied the game with 6 20 left in the second you sit out a bunch of games and you feel like a rookie again , said vanbiesbrouck , who has been involved in trade rumors again since mike richter has become the team s premier goaltender i was n't bombarded with a bunch of shots i just wanted to stay calm i did n't want to put much pressure on myself fans welcome nicholls despite vanbiesbrouck s sharp goaltending , the chant of beezer , beezer , which so frequently filled the garden in the past , was never heard on this night perhaps the crowd felt the night belonged to nicholls the fans cheered nicholls as he deliberately made a late entrance for the warmups , and fans in the blue seats chanted , bernie ! bernie ! during the national anthem fans can make it very tough , nicholls said , but in the same sentence , it gets you pumped up if they 're backing you i heard the crowd and i was pretty excited i 've been here for a couple days and i like it already
washington , jan 11 as american investigators try to piece together the business and political affairs of gen manuel antonio noriega , one of the most intriguing figures remains an israeli who some say was a key adviser to the former panamanian strongman the shadowy role of mike harari , a 62yearold retired agent of the israeli intelligence service , mossad , stirred speculation and debate well before the united states invasion began mr harari is variously rumored to have been an israeli spy , a gunrunner , or a military adviser to general noriega but mr harari , who was rarely seen in public when general noriega was in power and was heard even less , insisted last week that he is none of the above , but simply an ordinary businessman i'm not noriega s adviser and i never was , he said in an interview on israeli television , his only appearance since he vanished from panama on dec 20 , the day of the american invasion noriega is not my partner i did n't run his business i did n't manage or instruct his forces i did n't organize his personal bodyguards refuting his denials but mr harari s statements have been greeted with skepticism by some americans and panamanians who know or have met him they describe mr harari as one of general noriega s closest associates a man who placed the general s daughters in an israeli kibbutz one summer , who managed some of the general s business ventures and who used his israeli government contacts to entertain and protect his powerful friend they also say that mr harari appeared to have earned considerable sums for himself and panamanian friends through shrewd business deals that were sometimes aided by general noriega s government the truth could emerge soon , officials said this week , because general noriega s personal documents and some of his closest government aides are now in american hands noriega used him as a vehicle , one state department official said in an interview he really relied on him a lot , not just for security services but as a bag man on trips to the states more than a businessman charles stone , a retired army colonel who served in panama from 1982 to 1987 , said of mr harari he was a businessman , like he portrays himself but it goes far beyond business and into military links with the israel defense forces the united states embassy in panama heightened the speculation on mr harari s shadowy status by reporting on dec 22 that mr harari was an american prisoner of war , only to recant the statement two days later without offering a clear explanation of the error last week , the new head of the reorganized panama public force , col eduardo herrera hassan , said that mr harari received a tip that the invasion was imminent and fled with two israelis hours before troops arrived mr harari denied this after he surfaced in israel last weekend he said he had left panama on his own when the fighting broke out despite mr harari s desire for secrecy , israeli and american officials and press accounts provide a partial picture of his background and activities his career with mossad mr harari was born in tel aviv he joined the haganah , the jewish militia that preceded the israeli army , at the age of 18 in 1945 , three years before israel s independence after a stint in rome in which he helped to smuggle jews into palestine , he began a career as a counterintelligence specialist for mossad , the israeli spy agency mr harari is reported to have helped in the planning and execution of israel s successful strike at uganda s entebbe airport in 1976 , which freed 105 israelis held hostage by palestinian terrorists who had hijacked their plane prime minister golda meir also assigned him to head a hit squad that located and assassinated the palestinian terrorists who massacred 11 israeli athletes at the 1972 munich olympics that group completed its task , but not before the commandos misidentified a moroccan waiter in a restaurant in norway as one of the black september killers and gunned him down before horrified diners six commandos were imprisoned in norway a 1988 report said that mr harari was dispatched to mossad s mexico city station until the furor died down while based in mexico he visited panama and became friends with gen omar torrijos herrera , then panama s leader , and his intelligence chief , lieutenant colonel noriega when general noriega seized power and elevated his rank after general torrijos died in a mysterious plane accident in 1981 , the friendship between the two men blossomed helped noriega visit israel mr harari has said he retired from mossad in 1980 to enter private business in recent years he has shuttled between israel , panama and other central american nations , and he once arranged a trip by general noriega to israel , where the general bought at least one house mr harari also arranged for panamanian counterterrorist commandos to receive training in israel , mr stone said the commandos also served as an elite security detail for the general in turn , mr harari reaped some profits of his own at mr harari s apparent behest , mr stone said , general noriega shifted a contract to service panamanian aircraft in the united states from a longtime supplier to a miami business owned by an israeli aviation company he also negotiated a sale of israelimade radar and airtraffic control equipment to panama s military , he said colonel herrera has been quoted as saying that mr harari was nicknamed mr sixty percent for the large commissions he made on the deals he brokered general noriega also made mr harari his honorary consul and commercial attache in israel photo i'm not noriega s adviser , said mike harari , a retired israeli intelligence agent \( agence

in the late 1960 s i umpired a game between the mets and the philadelphia phillies at shea stadium the mets' pitcher i forget who it was hit one of the phillie batters with a pitch the next inning , the first batter for the mets was hit no fuss no one charged the mound i turned around and brushed off home plate , and as i did i told the catcher 'go out to the mound and tell your pitcher that s enough you both had your shot now it s over' and that s what happened these days , things are n't so simple there s nothing new , of course , about tight pitches , hit batsmen , retaliation or even benchclearing brawls those are part of baseball but today it seems things are more spontaneous a fellow is hit , his bat goes down , and he s off like a thoroughbred in the starting gate in the old days , a player would mutter something , or say something to the catcher or the pitcher a lot of the shouting or arguing would take place as the hitter was going down to first and that would give the umpire and the players a sign , and let them know to be prepared for things like this today , it happens too fast , and the umpires or other players ca n't stop it there s no slow fuse now , it s like an instant explosion the fights seem more prolonged , now , too they go on and on , and escalate , as new players fuel the fire umpires can only do so much policing i remember a fight in the 50 s in brooklyn where frank dascoli just walked to the dugout and sat down someone asked him afterward why he did n't try to stop the fight and he said , i'm hired to umpire a baseball game , not referee a fight let s face it , it does n't take a genius to figure out when the situation is ripe for a batter to get hit a pitcher winning by 90 does n't want to hit anyone he just wants to get everyone out but a pitcher getting his brains beat out will start throwing at people and people know it i almost always knew when a pitcher was delibertately throwing at a batter in the past , when a home run was hit , the next batter did n't dig in he knew the first pitch would knock him down brushback pitches were part of the game and pitching inside , controlling the plate , was an accepted fact drysdale threw inside , gibson threw inside it was part of a pitcher s job to move you off the plate batters knew that ron hunt of the mets always stood close to the plate , and he was hit a ton of times but he was n't in a lot of fights maybe none because he knew that by standing over the plate he was going to get hit he accepted that even pitchers knew they would be a target if a pitcher dusted off a batter , he 'd hear from the dugout , do n't forget , you have to hit , too you have to go to bat you 'd hear that all the time the fact is , it s just not as acceptable today to brush someone back , not like gibson or drysdale did and that s why there s so many visible outbreaks of brawling are batters taking more offense today \? maybe , i'm not sure i think it s because there s a different breed of kids playing today they 're much more spontaneous players seem to be poised on the top step of the dugout , ready to go a lot of it , too , is frustration a hitter might be in a slump , or feeling the pressure of a pennant race or a chase for a batting title all of a sudden he thinks people are throwing at him the stakes are higher now the money s too good , there are incentives a player has more concerns so down the stretch , no one wants to get taken out with a broken arm it makes everyone more uptight of course , most brawls are wrestling you rarely see a tysondouglas fight out there baseball players have a tendency to find their threshold for fighting and stop it before serious injury is done so although players seem to move out more quickly to fight , it s still the same brand of wrestling the umpires' role in these incidents has come under scrutiny lately but sometimes the only way to get the job done is to get in and move some bodies and the umpires are at risk , too i remember a brawl in st louis one night when a relief pitcher came running in from the bullpen and threw a punch at another player that came so close to me i felt the breeze on my ear another night cleon jones took a hard slide into home plate and the catcher , ronny brand , came up swinging at jones unfortunately , his first swing hit me by the time i recovered they were both rolling on the ground sometimes , though , it s the umpire who s on the ground , underneath the pile no one gets too upset about that some incidents go on and on during one brawl , joaquin andujar was in the clubhouse , and he came out to join the fight i sent him back to the clubhouse then went to attend to another little scuffle when i looked up , there was andujar again so i sent him back into the clubhouse i turned around , and there he was again this time i walked him back myself the bottom line is , nobody likes to get hit with a baseball but if a pitcher tries to use the inside part of the plate without throwing at a batter s head , it s part of the game everyone should know that brawling , too , is a part of the game but it s not good for the game drawing
washington , oct 21 the redskins knew that the eagles would enter this confrontation today confident that robert f kennedy stadium could once again become a cozy nest the redskins knew that containing randall cunningham was the pivotal goal in their hopes to remain hot on the giants' heels in the national conference east on both counts , the redskins were successful , as they sapped the eagles' offense early and throughout the battle trapped cunningham before he ran and passed them silly the result was a hardfought 137 victory before 52 , 567 fans that lifted the redskins to a 42 record they face the giants again sunday in the meadowlands cunningham passed for a clubrecord 447 yards in the eagles' comefrombehind 4237 victory here last season but today there was none of that , as cunningham was sacked five times for 44 yards in losses and the eagles were shut out until 43 seconds remained the washington defensive front , led by charles mann , pressured cunningham all afternoon , limiting him to 21 of 42 passing for 220 yards and the eagles ground game to only 94 yards credit for defensive line hey , let s face it we 've got a great defense , mann said monte coleman , the redskins' 12thyear linebacker , explained it all started with our defensive line randall made some plays , but most of the time there was n't just one guy chasing him but a second and a third that s the key to getting to him you force him one way and then you have to have the backup to finish the play otherwise , he s gone the redskins defensive front gained all five sacks of cunningham , with mann , eric williams and fred stokes each having one and tim johnson two for good measure , the redskin s defensive tackle darryl grant recovered the game s only fumble the game began as one of missed opportunities for both teams chip lohmiller of washington missed his first four fieldgoal attempts and the eagles' roger ruzek missed his only two attempts on the eagles' first series , a 49yard touchdown pass from cunningham to fred barnett was nullified because of an eagles holding penalty on ron heller , the offensive tackle washington finally broke through first , riding stan humphries s passes of 33 yards to gary clark and 44 to art monk that set up a 1yard gerald riggs scoring run with 1 28 left before halftime washington s 70 halftime lead was increased in the fourth quarter when lohmiller finally connected on field goals of 33 and 39 yards tough in close games cunningham lofted a fourthand2 pass 9 yards into the end zone to barnett inside the final minute for the eagles' lone score their onside kick that followed was unsuccessfull , and washington was able to run out the clock and beat the eagles for the eighth time in their last 10 meetings seven of the last eight games in this series have been decided by 7 or fewer points and the redskins have won six of those philadelphia had held its opponents to 69 yards rushing a game , but the redskins gained 121 rushing yards and humphries passed for 200 more that helped the redskins control the clock , gaining a 32 27 to 27 33 advantage in possession time and helped drop the eagles to 24 i thought we showed some character after a bitter disappointment last week , said joe gibbs , the redskins' head coach , of this game and his team s previous 2420 loss to the giants buddy ryan , the eagles head coach , said we played hard , but that s not enough we 're in the winning business it s disappointing when we move the ball and do n't get anything out of anything but we 'll be in the playoffs we 've just got to suck it up and overcome all these adversities photo charles mann , left , and eric williams of the redskins celebrating over a sacked randall cunningham of the eagles yesterday in washington \( reuters \)
pediatricians throughout the 50 states are rejoicing at the remarkable success of a oncerevolutionary screening program and diet therapy to prevent mental retardation in the nearly 300 american babies who are born each year with an inherited metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria but the doctors are now mobilizing to combat a new problem generated by their very success they are seeking to prevent mental retardation in the next generation of children , those born to women who have been saved by the original program among the many beneficiaries of the original program are these a 20yearold junior at a minnesota college who plays varsity football and maintains a b average a 17yearold long island youth with an iq of more than 140 who is about to graduate from high school with honors and will enroll in an ivy league university in the fall a 10yearold boy in upstate new york who is in the top mathematics and reading groups in school and plays allstar baseball and hockey in the past , all three would probably have been doomed to severe mental retardation and life in an institution heelprick screening test instead they are among thousands of young americans who were saved by the simple heelprick screening test in which a few drops of blood are taken to detect the condition in the first days of life the test , first introduced in 1961 , became mandatory in most states by the early 1970 s within weeks of birth , children found to have phenylketonuria , or pku , were placed on a special diet that protected their developing brains from irrevocable damage by phenylalanine , a nutrient their bodies could not process the lowprotein formulabased diet severely limits intake of phenylalanine but now the physicians who have given such children the chance for a normal life face a new problem hundreds of girls with pku who have been spared retardation are growing up , marrying and wanting to have children of their own once they are grown , they may no longer need to stay on the restricted diet , and most have long since gone off it as a result , they have abnormally high levels of phenylalanine in their blood that could severely damage their genetically normal unborn children one person in 60 has gene pku is an inherited abnormality involving the enzyme that normally converts phenylalanine to tyrosine , an amino acid that the body can manufacture the enzyme may be missing entirely , defective or in short supply for a child to develop it , each parent would have had to carry at least one pku gene only children who inherit the gene from both mother and father will have the disorder parents who carry only one pku gene are normal and would not know of the hidden danger unless they had already produced a child with pku or unless one of their parents had the disorder the gene occurs in only one person in 60 now the physicians who helped the women with pku blend into society are trying to single them out once again the doctors want the women back on the special lowphenylalanine diet even before they conceive risk to the pregnancy experts like dr harvey levy of children s hospital in boston have found that exposure to toxic levels of phenylalanine and its metabolic products can jeopardize the pregnancy and seriously damage an unborn baby who is otherwise free of the disorder the risk of damage may be especially high during the first days of embryonic life , long before a woman even realizes she is pregnant , dr levy said in an interview babies born to mothers with uncontrolled pku are often mentally retarded , have very small heads and may have heart defects there is also a greatly increased risk of miscarriage and premature birth preliminary findings indicate that careful control of the mothers' diets , especially if started before conception , can avert such ill effects nearly 200 babies have already been born to pku mothers enrolled in a preventive study at five medical centers in the united states and canada in the study thus far , only one baby was born with pku the babies born to mothers in good dietary control seem normal at birth , said dr bobbye rouse , pediatrician and pku specialist at the university of texas medical branch in galveston but we have to monitor their development for years to be sure there are no delayed effects everything looks fine so far for the first baby born in the texas branch of the study , dr rouse said the child , tracey messer , who will be 3 years old on july 3 , is an active , intelligent toddler , the daughter of ginni messer of pasadena , tex mrs messer , who has severe pku , was herself spared from retardation by an alert mother who noticed developmental delays in ginni s older sister both girls were born before pku testing at birth was routine in texas the sister was tested and found to have pku subsequent tests showed that ginni also had pku , and both girls grew up on the restricted diet rigorous diet is required by the time ginni was old enough to marry , physicians were just becoming aware of the risks of maternal pku to unborn children who were themselves free of the disorder ginni suffered several miscarriages before learning of the special program at galveston , part of a study being sponsored by the national institute for child health and human development once in the program , she started the rigorous diet , along with detailed recordkeeping and frequent blood tests she continued the regimen throughout her otherwise uneventful pregnancy

' said mr sultan , whose mother , two brothers , sister and five uncles were in kuwait everyone was doing the same thing he has since heard , he said , that one uncle has been taken to iraq and imprisoned besides having most of its top management present , the kuwait petroleum corporation had another bit of luck none of its tankers , carrying 15 million barrels of oil , were in kuwait during the invasion but still in kuwait were records containing vital information about the ships' locations , cargoes , destinations and the status of bills and orders for hundreds of customers an instant hero shipping agents helped to locate the tankers by providing their telex numbers and call names and one kuwait petroleum corporation executive , khalid haroon , became an instant hero when he remembered that they had a guest list of all those invited in the last two years to the company s annual party at the institute of petroleum , a londonbased industry organization armed with that and a christmas card list , the company got in touch with customers around the world , asking them to send a copy of their last 8 to 10 communications with kuwait petroleum and a copy of contracts all were forthcoming , mr sultan said the immediate problem facing kuwait petroleum international , the european refining and marketing arm , was securing supplies but it had time between the oil on the tankers and stocks on land , it had a minimum of a 90day supply , mr sultan said it also began buying cargoes both directly and indirectly , with the help of western oil companies on aug 3 , the day after the invasion , saudi officials gave assurances that kuwait petroleum international would get all of the oil it needed kuwait petroleum international officials say they are currently buying 185 , 000 barrels of saudi oil a day although the kuwaiti government in exile has offered financial assistance for any kuwaiti financial institutions and businesses operating outside kuwait that need it , executives of kuwait petroleum international are determined to make it on their own we have become 100 percent standalone , mr sultan said the shoulder of our parent is no longer there one reason the company has so much cash is that it has not had to reimburse its parent for the oil on the tankers at the time of the invasion set up as profit center it also has discipline in its operations before the invasion , some analysts said the parent company did not stress efficiency and profitability mr sultan said this was especially true of production operations in kuwait but kuwait petroleum international , he said , was set up as a profit center and had to pay market prices for kuwaiti oil kpi has acted in an arm slength commercial way , said graham duxbury , a director of petroleum economics ltd , a londonbased consulting firm photos nader h sultan , president of kuwait petroleum international ltd , supervises kuwait s foreign refining and marketing operations \( universal pictoral press \) the company operates a chain of service stations , like this one in sussex , england , under q8 name \( jonathan player for the new york times \)
at least 50 prison inmates and 30 guards were injured last night in a melee at the correctional institution for men on rikers island after prisoners barricaded themselves inside a dormitory and set fires , a prison spokeswoman said the disturbance was quieted within an hour , and none of the injuries were life threatening but coming exactly a week after 135 inmates and correction officers were injured in a prisoner uprising at another rikers building , last night s disturbance indicated that tensions remained high at new york city s largest jail complex it also posed a further challenge to mayor david n dinkins and correction officials , who have been criticized from various quarters for not dealing with the explosive mood in the jails last night s rikers outbreak was the second of the day in the city s jails earlier , five inmates at the bronx house of detention , armed with a makeshift knife , tried to escape by disarming two correction officers in a jail library , locking them in a closet and then breaking into a corridor , where they subdued two other officers before being finally captured two of the prisoners were seriously injured as they were captured seven officers and three supervisors suffered minor cuts and bruises , prison officials said correction officials yesterday continued to grapple with the fallout from last week s disturbance at rikers , in which correction officers were accused of systematically beating inmates after the prisoners had taken over most of the otis bantum center during a wildcat job action by the officers a board of correction member , addressing an emergency meeting of the board , said yesterday that correction officers had told him that after suppressing the uprising they grabbed prisoners , forced them into a cement corridor and beat them , while shouting , we control the jails ! the rikers melee last night began around 8 30 when an inmate was stabbed by a unknown assailant , said ruby ryles , the spokeswoman for the correction department after the stabbing , ms ryles said , officers told other inmates to go back to their cells they were told to lock in , so there could be an investigation , but they refused , ms ryles said she said 17 inmates barricaded themselves in an area of the complex known as c 76 and began setting fires more than 40 correction officers responded and had the situation under control shortly after 9 pm , she said she said the injuries were minor , most due to smoke inhalation ambulances required escort robert leonard , a spokesman for the city s emergency medical service , said prison officials called for ambulances to transport approximately 50 patients to city hospitals ms ryles said 50 inmates and 30 officers were taken to hospitals for medical evaluation and treatment thomas doyle , exective director of ems , said last night that his dispatchers first learned of the rikers melee at 8 30 pm they were told by the correction department that there was some sort of disturbance and that there were multiple casualties mr doyle said 20 ambulances arrived at the bridge to rikers , but did not actually go onto the island because of a recent agreement with the city that no ems unit would cross the bridge to the prison complex unless escorted by city police none of the ems workers went onto the island last night the injured officers and inmates were brought to them by correction vans emergency medical service units have been reluctant to go on the island because of reported beatings of ems personnel by correction officers during the job action last week at the bronx house of detention , at 1 pm , five inmates entered the secondfloor library , surprised two corrections officers and two inmates working as law library clerks , and put them in a utility closet , ms ryles said broke through a window the five inmates then broke through a plexiglass window in the library to gain access to a hallway leading to a prison commisary where they subdued two more guards by this time , however , the two officers and law clerks had managed to free themselves and the officers rang an alarm shortly after 1 30 pm , the five inmates attempting to escape were tracked to the commissary and subdued , but not without resistance , ms ryles said two of the inmates , who were not identified , were listed in serious condition at an undisclosed hospital , ms ryles said the stark version of what happened a week ago at rikers was presented by the board member , the rev irvine a bryer jr , during an emergency meeting of the board yesterday it provided new support for allegations by prisoners that they were lined up while guards systematically beat them and banged their heads against the walls the officers union and the correction department have said that the beatings occurred only while officers were trying to quell the disturbance and that they had taken place in an upstairs area at the otis bantum center , one of nine jails at the rikers complex only later , they said , were the inmates taken to the downstairs corridor , and only for frisking 'they said this happened'
a big sayles advance acting as his own literary agent , john sayles , the writer of movies and television scripts , sold his new novel last week for a sixfigure advance , choosing harpercollins over several other bidders mr sayles not only conducted his own negotiations he also stipulated that the novel be published as is , that is , without editorial changes the 680page manuscript , entitled los gusanos \( the worms \) , is a contemporary tale set largely in the cuban community of miami harpercollins , formerly harper row , will publish the book next may or june the publisher thought so highly of it that it bought world rights , book club rights and audio rights , along with first serial rights i ca n't think of any editing that is needed , said terry karten , the editor who bought the book i took notes while reading the manuscript and it did n't even occur to me that any editing needs to be done mr sayles is still polishing the last chapter , and he has asked someone to go over the parts of the book that are written in spanish otherwise , except for normal copy editing , the book will be published exactly as he wrote it over the course of this decade while many novels are published with little editing , few writers make that a condition of the sale even fewer make it a condition when they have written only two other novels \( in mr sayles s case , pride of the bimbos and union dues \) , the last one in 1977 , and a collection of stories \( the anarchists' convention \) , none of which was a major seller but mr sayles has won acclaim for his narrative gifts , and for such screenplays as the return of the secaucus seven and matewan what apparently helped persuade mr sayles to sign with harpercollins is ms karten s discussions with him about the house s plans for publishing and marketing the book i saw this book as serious literary fiction and thought our first job is to establish john sayles s credentials as a writer , she said we plan a good sized printing we 'll set up readings in the best book stores , and we 'll do what we do for our best literary authors the seabrook furor after almost 20 years of protests , mass demonstrations and legal battles , the seabrook nuclear power plant in new hampshire recently began operating at full capacity in a few weeks , the university of massachusetts press will publish a book recounting that controversy seabrook station citizen politics and nuclear power , by henry f bedford the author , who has written five other books , taught for many years at phillips exeter academy , close to the seabrook station bruce wilcox , the director of the press , said that while the book was primarily an objective historical account , it raised serious questions about the adequacy of emergency evacuation plans at seabrook and many people are still wondering , mr wilcox said , how a nuclear plant that was originally budgeted at 800 million could have ended up costing eight times that much mr wilcox called it sheer coincidence that the book was being published just as the power plant was going into operation
for years , e gerald corrigan , the president of the federal reserve bank of new york , has warned anyone who would listen that wall street firms have as much potential to disrupt the financial system as commercial banks do if not more thanks to their rapid growth in the 1980 s , securities firms today like banks have billions of dollars of financial obligations yet , unlike banks , securities firms are not answerable to any government agency with the authority to supervise them in their entirety regulators fear that gives them too much leeway to get into risky ventures the collapse of drexel burnham lambert inc raises many of mr corrigan s fears anew drexel s financial problems , which seemed to spring up overnight , materialized in a unit of the firm the brokerage firm s parent company that was not regulated by any government agency yet the mere possibility that problems in that unit could cause pressures elsewhere in the financial system raised the specter that the fed might be forced to extend credit to the financial system to assure the rescue of a securities firm over which it had no direct control this is a nightmare that none of them wanted to confront , said robert e litan , a senior fellow at the brookings institution fed s overall responsibility technically , only banking institutions and some savings and loan associations have the right to borrow emergency funds from the federal reserve the fed , however , also is charged with protecting the integrity of the financial system as a whole , and it is in that capacity that it could have been forced to put its own money to work so far , that seems to have been unnecessary under the supervision of the federal regulators , drexel yesterday proceeded to sell off or liquidate various portions of its brokerage business perhaps even more surprising , the financial markets reacted calmly both to the news of drexel s problems and to the sale of securities drexel held , which might have been expected to send prices down but if the markets were on their best behavior , and if the situation seemed under control , wall street officials cautioned that there was still much about the situation that is unknown or unresolved problem of retail customers for example , while most of drexel s retail accounts were sold to other brokers last year , there are still some retail customers whose accounts have not been transferred these accounts may require some form of government guarantee against possible losses before any other firm would agree to take them over some wall street executives speculated that there could also be unforeseen problems with complex , exotic products that created financial obligations for drexel but which may have been on the books of other subsidiaries and which might not , therefore , be included in a regulatory safety net what about options contracts , what about futures contracts , what about interestrate swaps , what about nondollardenominated interestrate swaps \? asked henry kaufman , who is the head of a new york investment firm bearing his name it is precisely this lack of information that is at the heart of many regulators' complaints richard c breeden , the chairman of the securities and exchange commission , has urged congress to pass a measure that would enable his agency to receive information about other affiliates of a securities firm , rather than just the brokerdealer and mr corrigan , in an aptly timed speech in late january , took that suggestion even further he said it seems to me that careful thought should be given to the suggestion that minimum capital standards and a limited degree of consolidated supervision should apply not only to registered broker dealers , but to the securities firm as a whole , including its parent holding company wall street executives have long feared that the fed intended to extend its regulatory reach over their industry as well but mr corrigan has stated that his interest stems from concerns for the health of the nation s payments systems 'potential to disrupt the system' mr corrigan wrote in 1987 , in a document on financial regulation that was widely read , the hard fact of the matter is that linkages created by the largedollar payments systems are such that a serious credit problem at any of the large users of the system has the potential to disrupt the system as a whole drexel s problems come at a time when congress is considering erasing the regulatory barriers between banking and the securities industry if the financial industry were restructured along those lines , firms like drexel could gain the right to rely on the fed to provide a safety net fed officials are reluctant to grant that privilege without gaining an increase in their regulatory powers some wall street executives thought it was no coincidence that the regulators were apparently working hard to preserve drexel s brokerdealer unit , which is regulated by the sec and the new york stock exchange , and the governmentsecurities subsidiary , which reports its financial condition to the fed , but seemed prepared to let the unsupervised units fail my instinct is that they are going to try to keep their hands off , mr litan said they 're very nervous about setting a major precedent , especially in the midst of a debate over financial restructuring
baltimore , june 10 stump merrill s plans for the yankees very much include imbuing the club with the confidence he believes the players have somehow lost in what has been new york s most difficult start to a season since 1913 to do that , merrill has set out to project as positive an image in the clubhouse as he possibly can but eight straight losses , four of them in merrill s newborn regime , can test the most fervent resolve all the yankees , including the new manager , needed a victory it finally came today as the yankees stopped the orioles , 52 , to avoid a threegame sweep it was good to get that one out of the way , believe me , merrill said when you step into this position and struggle , each day becomes more difficult callling on righetti merrill sat at his manager s desk in a sweatsoaked tshirt as he spoke , his voice wavered , but his face reflected the relief he felt the manager was also a touch sentimental he had a save opportunity presented in this game , and in that situation he wanted , and got , dave righetti , whom he managed in west haven way back in 1979 he was the perfect guy to close it out for me , merrill said i thought it would be a perfect ending if rags closed the door righetti did , after yielding a twoout pinch single as merrill quietly cheered him on , righetti got cal ripken to line to left for the final out he s won a game as manager of the new york yankees , righetti said and that might seem trivial right now , but it s a heck of an achievement now , it s time for a reality check an 'ugly' victory indeed , the yankees are still 11 1 2 games out of first place and sport the worst record in baseball they were beaten up by the orioles in the first two games , having been outscored , 155 today s game was less than perfect , what with some wildness by jimmy jones \( five walks \) and three errors but , said jesse barfield i do n't care how ugly it was we 'll take it barfield said he would also take what he perceived to be a new attitude i could feel it leaving the locker room , that today was going to be different , he said guys were at the tickedoff stage it was like 'enough is enough' you get mad enough , you take it out on the baseball and the other team the yankees did give the orioles chances baltimore had poked and prodded at four yankee pitchers , none more so than jones the righthander , who was called up saturday , started and pitched five innings in which he allowed three hits and five walks but the orioles managed only one run off jones , converting a leadoff walk drawn by phil bradley in the first a stolen base , a throwing error by the catcher , bob geren , and an rbisingle by steve finley followed but jones allowed no more and that performance earned the former san diego padre his first victory of the season lineup revamped merrill not only started jones , but reshaped the lineup in an attempt to turn some of the key players around his lineup used in his first victory reflected his continuing efforts to find the right blend after merrill and a host of coaches and major league and minor league yankee executives watched the team lose , 101 , saturday night , they retreated to the to visiting manager s office and kicked around lineup after lineup what the braintrust wound up with was one that had , among other things , roberto kelly batting leadoff with steve sax following the group also found a spot for the rookie jim leyritz at third by moving randy velarde to short claudell washington was put in left , the veteran s first start since june 4 and only his third since may 22 the results were mixed kelly struck out three times , but got a thirdinning hit and scored in the fourrun inning against the orioles' starter , jay tibbs leyritz was 2 for 4 but committed an error but sax , who was 4 for 25 in the previous six games of the road trip , picked up three hits , including a swinging bunt single in the third that drove in a run sax also scored twice and barfield , batting fifth , doubled twice and drove in three runs , two on his first twobase hit in the third inning and the other on a fielder schoice groundout we seemed more normal today , sax said we have n't seemed that way at all lately but what s happened happened and you ca n't change it now we 're down in the bottom so we should just go out and play loose and what happens happens
jacksonville , fla , march 11 a gunshot fired into a greyhound bus outside jacksonville injured seven people yesterday , the police and company officials said the attack apparently involved just one shot , said steve weintraub , a sheriff s spokesman although none of the injuries appeared life threatening , all seven victims were taken to hospitals and two people underwent surgery for shrapnel wounds in the throat and side , mr weintraub said it was the latest incident of violence since the start of a strike by the company s drivers on march 2 george gravley , a spokesman at greyhound s dallas headquarters , said the bus was fired into through the roof about 8 pm from an overpass 12 miles south of jacksonville on interstate 95 there were about 41 passengers on the bus the driver brought the bus to a stop safely beside the road after the incident , mr gravley said asked if the incident was related to the strike , mr weintraub of the sheriff s office said i think it is i do n't know why anybody would want to shoot a greyhound bus but bill nicholson , executive board member of the jacksonville local of the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions , said he doubted a striker was to blame as far as i'm concerned it was n't one of our strikers , he said they 've been like choirboys service to 120 towns resumes greyhound said earlier that bus service had been restored yesterday to 120 communities that had not been served since the strike began the company added routes in the southeast and southwest after new drivers completed training courses , said elizabeth hale , a greyhound spokeswoman on saturday , greyhound carried 38 percent of the number of passengers it did on the same saturday a year ago and operated onethird of the number of departing buses , ms hale said figures for yesterday would reflect the larger number of routes , she said , but were unavailable on saturday , federal mediators called representatives of the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions , which represents 6 , 300 drivers and more than 3 , 000 office and maintenance workers , to washington for a meeting today the company may be called to a separate meeting , a greyhound negotiator said as of yesterday , no date had been set for company officials and mediators to meet , ms hale said

washington , oct 25 a former federal examiner recounted today in vivid detail how she was harassed by superiors and ultimately dismissed for raising questions two years ago about the financial condition of a large savings and loan that regulators tried unsuccessfully to take over the account of the examiner , lisa r walleri , offered a rare insight into the conflicts facing regulators and was supported today by a stunning admission by the office of thrift supervision at a congressional hearing , an official of the agency said an internal review had found substantial evidence to support mrs walleri s account and added that she was owed an apology by the government faults examination mrs walleri said she was dismissed from the federal home loan bank of seattle after refusing to sign a highly misleading examination of far west federal bank , the largest savings institution in portland , ore , that is not now under government control she said she was told to drop her questions about 300 , 000 in bonuses to far west s management that were backdated to make it appear that they were given during better days mrs walleri s account , presented to the house task force on urgent fiscal issues , raises new questions not only about the regulators' oversight of savings institutions , but also about the federal law written to protect whistleblowers that law was strengthened last year to encourage federal employees to come forward without fear of reprisal to document instances of fraud and other abuses , but it continues to include an exemption that makes it all but irrelevant to the regulation and bailout of the savings industry the testimony also illustrates the conflicts that arise when the government becomes involved in lending money to a private institution and in so doing develops a strong interest in its survival mrs walleri said her supervisors had tried to put pressure on her to sign a 1988 report that she said vastly overstated far west s worth she said the supervisors had been motivated to do so because the federal home loan bank in seattle had lent the bank 15 billion , giving the government a stake in the institution s survival in addition , the bank s restructuring with government assistance was being featured nationwide by regulators as the model for resolving difficulties at other savings institutions thus the government would lose face if big problems arose far west , with assets of 33 billion , has so far warded off federal takeover attempts because of a 1987 agreement between the government and far west , which mrs walleri had questioned under that pact , far west was able to reclassify about 325 million in liabilities , which it has said it was able to do because of the 15 billion government loan also , far west was able to show a 27 million positive net worth based on an investment of that sum by a venture capital group suit is stalled mrs walleri is now out of work and seeing a doctor for what she said had been diagnosed as a depressive illness her wrongful termination lawsuit against the government has been dismissed by a federal judge on the ground of immunity despite today s admission by the savings agency , her workers' compensation proceeding has gone nowhere because it has been repeatedly postponed at the insistence of the government some of the same officials who purportedly harassed and threatened her have since been promoted , and despite the agency s finding , none have been removed asked whether it would be a good idea to reinstate mrs walleri because her dismissal was unjustified , and as a sign to other regulators , john f downey , the savings agency s deputy director for regional operations , said it s something we would consider we need good people while the whistleblower law applies to most federal departments and agencies , it exempts employees of federally chartered corporations , like the resolution trust corporation and the federal deposit insurance corporation , so that many regulators who know of or suspect fraud have little protection representative charles e schumer , democrat of brooklyn , who headed today s hearing , said he would introduce legislation early next year to protect employees like mrs walleri performance downgraded mrs walleri said her supervisor , j steven scott , had improperly inflated appraisals of certain assets and had blocked efforts to get the federal bureau of investigation involved in an inquiry into whether the management of far west may have criminally misled federal examiners during the course of the far west examination , scott tried to suppress exam findings , disclosed sensitive information to an outside director before it could be fully documented or discussed with management , permitted the public reporting of higher than actual profit earnings by far west federal banks and also intervened to reschedule the closing conference which prevented my invited presentation of exam findings to the far west board , mrs walleri said in a memo dated oct 10 , 1988 , mr scott said mrs walleri had one day either to sign an examination report or be removed as examinerincharge of far west mrs walleri refused to sign several evaluations by mr scott and another supervisor , michael cline , gave mrs walleri unacceptable ratings for her work , even though previous evaluations had all been strong mrs walleri later learned that the examination had been substantially revised and sent under her name to the federal home loan bank board headquarters in washington she was ultimately dismissed by mr cline , who she said had told her that there was no more work available asked about mrs walleri s testimony today , mr scott said i am unable to comment because of the litigation i also have n't had an opportunity to review what was said at the hearing mr cline , who has since been promoted to field manager of the portland office of thrift supervision , did not return phone messages left at his office seeking comment asked about the 300 , 000 in bonuses , far west s president , donald tisdale , said he could not comment because of pending litigation over the matter photo lisa r walleri said she had lost her job because she questioned a savings and loan s soundness she talked with her lawyer , thomas ryan \( george tames for the new york times \)
to judge by the stock market , there is life after bankruptcy for global marine inc , the oil driller that came out of chapter 11 proceedings less than a year ago with a rebound in oil drilling , global s revenues are up but not by enough to enable the company to meet all the interest payments on time that is not an immediate problem , because the bankruptcy agreement allows it defer those interest payments still , the cash shortfall might be expected to cast a pall over the company s stock price far from it valued at about 150 in the bankruptcy reorganization last spring , shares doubled by late last year and doubled again in the first several weeks of february , trading as high as 6 on friday , amid rumors of takeover interest yesterday , the rumors of a buyer were confirmed norsk vikingolje , a norwegian investment and oil drilling concern , said it had acquired a 528 percent stake , with recent purchases at 350 to 425 a share the company said the purchase was an investment and it left open all its options on wall street there was disappointment that the buyer was not a bigger company , not to mention the fact it bought some shares on margin global marine shares slipped to as low as 5 , but bounced back to close at 550 , down 125 cents , on the new york stock exchange yesterday global marine , whose main business is leasing out oil drilling rigs , is a classic case of a stock that can be valued in two ways , providing widely different valuations an analysis of earnings , of which there are none , or cash flow , of which there may be a little this year , would be hardpressed to support a stock price anywhere close to the current level but the stock is cheap based on what it would cost to build drilling rigs whether that calculation of replacement value is relevant is where the bulls and bears part company certainly , it does not have much to do with current values for one of our older drill ships , you might have a replacement cost of 85 million and a market value of 17 million , said david a herasimchuk , a vice president of global marine even the best rigs might not bring as much as half of replacement value , he said at the moment , mr herasimchuk said , global s rigs rent for 12 , 000 a day for a smaller rig in the gulf of mexico to 50 , 000 a day for its best north sea rig those rates are less than half the 1980 peak at current rates , mr herasimchuk said , the company is likely to lose about 30 to 40 cents a share this year , compared with a loss of 61 cents a share in 1989 but he said cash flow would be positive , at least until capital spending was counted one way that global gets along is that the bankruptcy plan provides that interest on loans secured by oil rigs will be paid in cash only to the extent that each rig throws off the cash flow needed the extra interest is simply accrued , to be paid if the rig begins to produce cash last year , the company paid 215 million in cash interest and accrued another 333 million to bears on the stock , like john c boland , the editor of bankruptcy values , a baltimorebased newsletter for institutional investors , the fact that some global notes have changed hands at 70 cents on the dollar is a useful comment on the equity he thinks that even using optimistic assumptions , the stock is not worth as much as 2 a share when global emerged from bankruptcy in march , it did so in part by issuing stock to settle numerous claims as a result , there are 100 million common shares , plus another 17 million that could be issued on the exercise of warrants or options so every dollar the share price goes up adds more than 100 million to the market capitalization of the company its current book value is about 12 cents a share , with total equity of 13 million against 560 million of liabilities you have a humongous market capitalization on a company with little chance of making good on the promises implied by the price , said michael katz of reynard asset management , a new yorkbased hedge fund that has sold the shares short but kenneth miller , an analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc , finds all such comments shortsighted as the offshore market tightens , he forecasts , rig rates will rise sharply he estimates that global s rigs have a replacement cost of 18 billion or so , or about 13 billion after subtracting debt and he thinks that global could eventually trade at 75 percent of that value , or more than 10 a share you ca n't point to profitability at the moment , mr miller acknowledged but he added that he thought a strong oil market was here to stay , and it was just a matter of time before profits caught up with global s buoyant stock price

a critical ruling in the central park rape case is expected this week when the presiding judge is scheduled to decide whether to admit as evidence the incriminating videotaped statements made by five of the six youthful defendants charged in the attack the statements are regarded by both sides as the most crucial evidence against the defendants , who are accused of the attempted murder and rape of a 29yearold investment banker who was jogging in central park on the night of april 19 last year defense lawyers in the case said they believe the prosecution cannot get a conviction without the statements several legal experts , including most of the defense lawyers in the case , said they think the judge , justice thomas j galligan of state supreme court in manhattan , will admit the statements as evidence when he rules on friday they said very few defense attempts to suppress confessions succeed 'a safe decision' peter rivera , the lawyer for 15yearold raymond santana , said he expected all the statements to be admitted despite his argument that they were coerced i believe the judge in the case will choose to make a safe decision and not a tough one , he said michael joseph , the lawyer for antron mccray , 16 , said , i did not see any telling blows against the statements there were n't any bombshells a critical issue in this and many other juvenile cases is where does the officer s right to question any suspect in the heat of the chase end and the prohibition against questioning a juvenile suspect without a lawyer or a parent present begin \? there was great confusion during the hours between the first reports that 30 youths were rampaging through the northern end of the park and the discovery nearly four hours later of the badly beaten female jogger many of the suspects were already in custody , suspected of assaulting a male jogger defense lawyers' contentions did the police , as the defense contends , break rules in the confusion or did they make a goodfaith effort to protect the rights of the suspects \? police efforts to bring parents to the central park station house are one issue some parents could not be found , prosecutors said , and one parent failed to come after several requests nonetheless , prosecutors contend , a parent or adult relative was present during every videotaped confession though their arguments differ , the defense lawyers contend that the preliminary admissions by the youths and their subsequent videotaped statements were coerced , that laws protecting juveniles were violated , and that there was no legal justification for some of the arrests mr rivera said officers had no probable cause to arrest mr santana and steve lopez , 16 , when they were spotted with several other youths on central park west , even though the other youths ran away officers were looking only for a group of black youths not enough information to link his client to any assault , mr rivera said and his client did not run 'confessions are powerful' if the judge agrees with any one of these arguments , the defense contends he must throw out any statements made by the defendants assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer argued in pretrial hearings that the police and prosecutors made extraordinary efforts to protect the constitutional rights of the youths , and that the defendants' statements were given voluntarily h richard uviller , of the columbia university school of law , said any error involving a juvenile confession is an error made largely because confessions are so powerful and juveniles are often unsophisticated about their rights gerald l shargel , one of the defense lawyers in the just completed trial of john gotti , said courts have a natural inclination to allow confessions but in cases where defendants are children , he said , the courts must be more sensitive to their rights videotaped statements along with mr mccray , mr santana and mr lopez , the other defendants are yusef salaam , 15 kevin richardson , 15 , and kharey wise , 17 a seventh defendant , michael briscoe , 18 , is charged only in the attack on a male jogger the police said it was the assault on the male jogger , who described his attackers , that led to the arrest of the suspects , who were charged with attempted murder and rape only after the woman was discovered in written or videotaped statements , five of the six defendants place themselves at the scene of the attack on the woman and several of them admitted holding her while others raped her none admitted raping her except mr mccray , who in a written statement admitted raping the woman but said in his subsequent videotaped statement that he simulated raping her the only defendant who did not make a statement was mr salaam , who several other suspects said was at the scene mr lopez denied any role in the attack under the rules of evidence , a statement by one defendant cannot be used as evidence against another as a result , defense lawyers are expected to request separate trials if the defendants are tried together , ms lederer has suggested a highly unusual procedure having multiple juries see videotapes censored so that the statement of one defendant is not used against another
the prosecutor called the shooting a nearperfect crime , the wellplanned act of a man obsessed with his neighbor s loud stereo , convinced of racism where there was none and determined to resolve himself what the police , the courts and others would not the defense lawyer for rafael rivera garcia , the 61yearold puerto rican art professor on trial for attempted murder , described the desperate act of a man terrorized because he was hispanic and betrayed by the justice system in which he held faith as the two lawyers delivered their closing arguments before a bronx jury yesterday , there was no dispute about who shot nicholas dematteis on may 2 , 1989 , or how many times and there was no agreement about any other issues involved in the case selfinterested liars the assistant district attorney , angelo g macdonald , and the chief defense counsel , ruben franco , each dismissed the other s witnesses as selfinterested liars each found the other s account of the shooting illogical and each apologized for their own star witness , while painting the other s as incomparably worse implicit in both summations was some disagreement even as to who was on trial over and over , mr franco reminded the jurors that mr macdonald had to prove mr rivera guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of attempted murder and eight other charges of assault and illegal weapons possession but as he has throughout the fourweek trial , mr franco also sought to indict mr dematteis , a 34yearold highschool dropout who owns his own appliancerepair business arrests are recalled within weeks after mr rivera , his wife , and their 11yearold son rented the adjoining oceanfront condominium in the throgs neck section of the bronx , mr franco said , mr dematteis began a campaign of terror to drive them out because they were puerto rican mr franco recalled mr dematteis s teenage arrests for burglary and shoplifting , his frequent speeding tickets , and his 500 fine by landlords for refusing to move his speedboat from the condominium dock nicholas dematteis does what nicholas dematteis wants to , mr franco said he is above the law after complaints to local police officers , the county s institute of mediation and conflict resolution , and other agencies , mr rivera obtained a temporary court order requiring mr dematteis to keep away 'racism is shown' the fact that mr rivera quoted mr dematteis as using an ethnic slur against him only once , on the night of the shooting , did not mean that racism was not in the air , mr franco said we know that it is expressed not in words , mr franco said racism is shown , is manifested in other ways , and i think we saw that here by contrast , the prosecutor dealt summarily with mr rivera s claims of ethnic hatred he has inflated this giant balloon of racism , said mr macdonald , who noted that mr dematteis s estranged wife , the mother of his two children , was halfpuerto rican and you know what \? that balloon burst in this court some of the 12 jurors eight of them black , two hispanic and two white did not appear convinced a violent struggle mr macdonald concentrated on mr rivera s account of the shooting the defendant had said that his unlicensed gun went off in a violent struggle , after mr dematteis had attacked him yet a police photograph of mr rivera taken soon after the shooting , mr macdonald noted , showed no blood , bruises or torn clothing and his tie was still perfectly knotted that must have been quite a struggle , ladies and gentlemen , mr macdonald said sarcastically the prosecutor questioned mr rivera s contention that he shipped his gun to the united states unwittingly , never cocked it or removed the safety catch , and then lost it after the shooting mr macdonald argued that mr rivera , nonetheless , had almost covered himself with his frequent complaints about his neighbor , his dogged court appeals , and his rush to turn himself in after the shooting he almost committed the perfect crime , mr macdonald said one problem mr dematteis lived
there was a time when isiah thomas s greatest goal was to prove that a little man could make it in the national basketball association it was a personal goal , and a personal struggle , though it had another layer to it , one of universality for an underdog there were times when thomas , the second pick in the nba draft in 1981 , as a sophomore out of indiana university , drove inside against the big guys , and sometimes sank the shot , but other times forced it and had the ball stuffed like a sandwich between his teeth there were times when , coming down the stretch of a game , he was convinced that only he could save the day for the pistons , or should , and so he launched a shot amid two and three defenders that sometimes went in , sometimes did n't but thomas got inside successfully enough times , and hit the clutch shot enough times , that he indeed proved that a little man can make it little , that is , in terms of his profession , since thomas is listed as standing 6 feet 1 inch in his basketball suit he was one of the high scorers in the league , one of the assists leaders and one of the steals leaders he was regularly a first or secondteam allpro and he received munificent financial rewards for these deeds and this acclaim as thomas grew in stature , he also grew in maturity he began to understand that although personal goals were splendid , they were at bottom insufficiently gratifying what was left was a yearning , a hole in the soul and thomas took out after a new goal to win a championship but he was n't quite sure how to go about achieving this thing the pistons did not make the playoffs in his first two seasons in the league , got knocked out of the playoffs early in the next three years , and then , in 1987 , when it seemed they were going to beat larry bird and the celtics in six games and advance to the nba final , the celtics suddenly rose up and smote them in seven games this was mightily disturbing to thomas the year before , he had gone to magic johnson and to bird , and sat with both , more or less like a supplicant to the oracle of delphi , to learn the secrets of winning a championship in those days , magic s team won the title one year and bird s won it the next , and then they reversed it , like a twosided jacket what they told thomas was , basketball is a team game , and the greatest player does not necessarily make the greatest team he must want to win above all personal and statistical considerations thomas recalled yesterday a talk he 'd had with johnson earvin said 'when you 're the best player on your team , none of your teammates can play at the level you are capable of playing at therefore , in order to get the most out of your team , you have to moderate your skills in that way , everybody rises' he comprehended that , as the point guard , the general of the army , the commander of the tub , he had to make the players around him better players , nailing them , for example , with passes at the most opportune moments , playing a kind of selfless defense that only your teammates and canny observers might appeciate , as well as dismayingly the enemy while the pistons made changes and got an improved cast of characters around thomas , thomas also helped improve the cast he was the team leader on the court as well as off the team went to the nba final in 1988 , but lost in seven games to the lakers , with thomas hobbling on a sprained ankle in game 7 and when his friend , mark aguirre , was traded from dallas to detroit the following season , thomas initiated a welcoming party that included a few of the other standout pistons , and explained to aguirre , a sometimes pouty operative , that he was joining a team , with a capital t , that lusted for a title aguirre , like thomas , would underplay his particular figures for the overall play of the team and all of them went merrily on to win the 1989 nba championship , beating the lakers in four consecutive games after the final game , he walked out of the locker room alone , and quietly how do you feel , isiah \? someone asked isiah smiled no words were necessary but it was n't the end there was next year that is , this year and to return to the nba final , against portland starting tonight , the pistons had to beat the bulls on sunday in game 7 of the eastern conference final thomas had perhaps his best game of the playoffs , scoring 21 points , with 8 rebounds , 11 assists and a significant block of an air jordan jump shot , in detroit s 9374 victory now i know , thomas said later , how tough it was for earvin and larry to try to repeat as champions to repeat is a new goal and thomas knows the answer to achieving it all that is left , of course , is a little matter called execution photo isiah thomas \( the new york times \)
washington , oct 24 the senate today approved a bill that would require colleges and universities to disclose their graduation rates and the crimes committed on their campuses the house passed the measure by voice vote on monday , and the senate did the same thing today the bush administration said president bush would probably sign the bill the legislation was hailed by senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , as providing students and parents a basis on which to choose a college the measure started as a sports bill that would show prospective college athletes what their chances were of getting a degree after playing basketball or football for a university reacting to the mood in congress , the national collegiate athletic association preempted the lawmakers this year by requiring that its members publicize athletes' graduation rates , which are minuscule on some campuses but the ncaa represents just 800 of the nation s 2 , 200 fouryear colleges and none of the 1 , 200 twoyear colleges under the measure approved today , those institutions would have to report such graduation rates as well the statistics would have to be made available to students and athletes in stages in the next two years
closeup lessons in the art of seeing african sculpture is an attempt to deal with the paradox of the western perception of african art on the one hand , the visual refinement and sophistication of the european tradition has enabled western artists to be highly responsive to the inventiveness and dynamism of african art on the other , this visual orientation has a tendency to blind or distance westerners from african art s essential and very different reality just looking at , not touching , feeding , conversing with , or otherwise living with these figures is not very african , the photographer jerry l thompson has written in the catalogue to the show but he concludes that it is the western involvement with vision , our exuberant and subtle refinement of visual skill , that gives us access to african sculpture the exhibition argues for the importance of appreciating african sculpture as sculpture not as artifact , or as implement , or as object that can make sense only within its own context it is clear from the catalogue that the works in the show can be appreciated from the perspective of greek sculpture , which demands to be seen in the round from the perspective of michelangelo , who felt the magic of materials and the need to release the image imprisoned in the stone and from the perspectives of the modernist developments partly inspired by african art , including cubism , with its belief in transformation and shifting points of view not only is it all right to look at african art through western eyes , the exhibition suggests , but it is through western eyes that the sculptural imagination of african art can be fully appreciated the implications of this point of view are clear approaching art solely within its own context is never enough to make the case for the richness and scope of any artist or artistic tradition great art can always be approached from many directions great art always has some common ground with other great art but a visual and sculptural approach to african art has limits , as both the catalogue and the printed material available in each room make clear african art was not made only to be looked at often its feet or bases are not level , indicating that works were not intended to stand on display many works were kept in dark places and were seen by few people , susan vogel , the executive director of the museum , writes in the catalogue many of the wooden figures and masks in this show were meant to be worn , carried or held a number of the objects were oiled , which was a way of preserving , washing and feeding them an african sculpture could be worshiped , like an ancestral spirit , or tended , like a flower or a tree it was , dr vogel writes , a new being the sixyearold center for african art , on manhattan s upper east side , has approached african art in a variety of ways , including anthropologically , historically and esthetically the museum takes risks it does not toe a party line the 110 objects in this exhibition come from two firstrate private collections one belongs to udo horstmann , a businessman living in zug , switzerland the other collector , an american , is anonymous most of the works date from the 19th and 20th centuries not everything is well suited to an exhibition that wants its works to be understood in terms of sculptural issues like volume and space , solid and void , internal energy and scale a number of objects are simply artifacts , without any particular sculptural distinction on one level , the exhibition is a response to the distorting effects of the latemodernist belief that flatness is truer than volume , and twodimensional art is somehow better than threedimensional dr vogel writes that the idea for the show \( which continues through march 24 \) grew out of an observation i noticed that people in our galleries rarely looked at the sculptures on display from more than one angle they looked at threedimensional objects as if they were looking at paintings , or perhaps reliefs that could be appreciated from a single point in general , the sculptural figures in this show are selfcontained they seem indifferent to whether or not they are seen whether or not the spaces or voids within them are pronounced , they are important through them the composed , selfcontrolled bodies and heads enter into an active relationship with their environment space may seem to accommodate itself to , even hug , the surface and armature in the elongated senufo figure from the ivory coast , standing upright , her long arms resting on her squat legs , space seems to have nestled between arms and torso like a bird the bulkiest sculpture in the show \( the biggest piece of african sculpture i know , dr vogel said \) , a sevenfoot urhobo mother and child from nigeria , seems almost held up by space the massive female figure , frontal and seated , holding her child like a gun , her legs slightly bent , was a shrine to maternity and procreation her collarbone , shoulders and arms are a single sculptural shape that seems to have the capacity to revolve the small , springy , almost insignificant space circulating in and around the squat , steadfast legs seems to hold up her body and give it the power to react
tokyo , wednesday , feb 28 toshiki kaifu was formally reelected prime minister on tuesday and was immediately plunged into disputes over the composition of his cabinet , including the ouster of the ruling party s most prominent woman early this morning , when the membership of the new cabinet was announced , mr kaifu appeared to have prevailed in his insistence on appointing what he termed a cleanpolitics cabinet , refusing to appoint several politicians who had been involved in a bribery scandal last year and one who had been sentenced to prison for accepting bribes in another scandal 14 years ago with trade and security disagreements likely to dominate his meeting ments likely to dominate his meeting with president bush this weekend , mr kaifu reappointed ryutaro hashimoto , the current finance minister , and taro nakayama , the foreign minister but mr kaifu forced out mayumi moriyama , who last august became the first woman appointed chief cabinet secretary , the government s chief spokesman mr kaifu also replaced the only other woman in the cabinet , sumiko takahara , the director of the economic planning agency a round of factional fighting since the governing liberal democratic party overcame scandals to retain its 35year hold on power by a surprisingly large margin last week , mr kaifu has been struggling for control of the party leaders of several party factions , who are hoping to increase their power now that the election is over , have made little secret of their efforts to undercut mr kaifu and have been battling each other to place their members in cabinet posts the three most powerful factions in these negotiations are led by former prime minister noboru takeshita , former foreign minister shintaro abe , and former finance minister michio watanabe , who has taken leadership of the group that was headed by former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone mr kaifu s chief challenger in forming the cabinet was mr watanabe , who demanded that a number of cabinet seats be filled by members of his faction one of mr watanabe s candidates was takayuki sato , a former transportation ministry official who was convicted of accepting a bribe in the lockheed aircraft kickback scandal of the 1970 s mr sato received a twoyear sentence , but it was suspended because his parole period has since run out , mr watanabe argued that his appointment to a cabinet post was overdue but mr kaifu resisted , saying he wanted no taint of scandal in his cabinet , and after a frantic night of negotiating mr watanabe withdrew mr sato s name similarly , mr kaifu objected to naming anyone who had been implicated in the socalled recruit scandal which rocked the ruling party in the late 1980 s women dropped from cabinet mrs moriyama was replaced by misoji sakamoto , a longtime member of parliament who appeared to have been a compromise choice not strongly identified with any faction mrs moriyama s appointment last year was part of a partly successful effort to win back women who had defected to the socialist party in protest of a new sales tax and the sex scandal that forced the resignation of mr kaifu s predecessor , sousuke uno in an interview on tuesday , mrs moriyama expressed anger that the liberal democrats' commitment to keep women in the power structure lasted only until the elections were over i told mr kaifu that is was essential that any cabinet , from now on , include women , she said but the new cabinet has none in a meeting with the prime minister on monday that was widely reported here , mrs moriyama also protested that she should be treated in a proper way after the party used her as a counterpoint to takako doi , the leader of the socialist party and japan s bestknown woman in politics for appearance' sake i knew that the reason that they appointed me was to attract the attention of women and to draw attention from miss doi , mrs moriyama said i think that was a good idea after her appointment , however , senior members of the party say mrs moriyama was frozen out of many key decisions , and some criticized her abilities in resolving disputes between ministries and party factions , a main job of the chief cabinet secretary mrs moriyama became embroiled in a muchpublicized argument several months ago with the sumo wrestling establishment , which refused to allow her into the ring to present the prime minister s cup to the winner of a major tournament traditionally , women have never been allowed in the ring the conflict became embarrassing to the party and mrs moriyama withdrew her request , but said later that she was satisfied that she had made her point though cabinet posts are politically important in japan as factions within the liberal democratic party battle for power , the cabinet ministers themselves usually play less of a role in formulating and administering policy than do american cabinet officials that task is usually handled by japan s powerful bureaucracy
chichibu , japan no , that s wrong ! growled akira kurosawa as two giant fans sent clouds of brown dust into a farmhouse on the set of his latest movie the 80yearold director leaped up and rearranged the machines for a different combination of wind , rain and dust in his artificial storm back in his chair , mr kurosawa shouted yoi staato ! \( ready start ! \) this time he grimaced while crew members with hoses spewed water into the wind from atop three tall cranes that spray is much too thin it looks like fog , he declared , shaking his head by now the ground was soaked , and the cast and crew realized that the scene could not be shot again until it dried see you tomorrow , mr kurosawa grumbled with a cursory nod this was definitely not a good day but for mr kurosawa , the making of rhapsody in august has been a happy milestone for the first time in more than 25 years , the patriarch of japanese cinema is working on a new movie immediately after completing a film , akira kurosawa s dreams , which is now playing in the united states he could not be more pleased to be back on a set running out of time since 1965 , mr kurosawa has had to wait five years between each of his films while he and his colleagues looked for financing his search for backing has taken him to the soviet union , france and hollywood , where steven spielberg and george lucas helped make dreams possible indeed , until rhapsody in august , his 29th film , mr kurosawa has not been able to win japanese backing for any project in two decades the chance to make movies back to back is of no small importance wearing baggy cotton pants and a polo shirt , mr kurosawa charges around his set like an old bull filled with restless energy , sometimes lost in a world of his own concentration but the people around him know he does not have many years left to execute all his ideas asked recently if he would ever retire , mr kurosawa snapped it 'll never happen i will be the happiest man if i die at the precise moment that i'm saying , 'yoi staato ! ' rhapsody in august marks a break with the past for mr kurosawa in many other ways it will also be his first film featuring an american movie star , richard gere , who speaks only japanese in the movie memorizing the sounds in an interview , mr gere explained that he did not learn the language itself but studied and memorized the words and worked hard to pick up a natural cadence and sound i knew what i was saying , but not much more than that , he said mr gere has a minor but pivotal role in the movie , playing a wealthy american of mixed parentage who comes to japan from hawaii to visit his old japanese aunt and her children and grandchildren as the story unfolds , it turns out that the aunt s husband was killed on aug 9 , 1945 , under circumstances that for years the whole family had swept under the rug the dropping of an atomic bomb on nagasaki by the united states it s not a large or demanding part , mr gere said of his role when you do a kurosawa film , you want to play macbeth in 'throne of blood' but the idea of working for kurosawasan was very exciting to me this is a film about death , but there s also a lot of humor and poetry in it the screenplay of rhapsody in august is based on a short novel published in 1987 about a grandmother and her family discovering the existence of a rich relative living in hawaii but it was mr kurosawa who wrote the screenplay , adding the connection with nagasaki and the bomb the film is thus mr kurosawa s first attempt to explore cinematically the complex emotional relationship between japan and the united states it is also his first film dealing directly with the american nuclear attacks a difference in 2 cities mr kurosawa said he was intrigued by the fact that nagasaki , unlike hiroshima , does not publicize itself very much as a bomb victim i was interested in finding out the reason for the silence , he said i wanted to find out through the character of this grandma many details about the movie are being kept secret , but it appears that rhapsody in august takes a different approach from that of i live in fear , also known as record of a living being , a 1955 movie with a darkly satiric vision of the nightmare of a future global holocaust in this film , the japanese family members are embarrassed to talk about the bomb , fearing it will hurt their chances to ingratiate themselves with a rich american relative but to their surprise , the american is deeply sympathetic , anxious to ease the grandmother s feelings of loss in one scene in a moonlit garden , he tries to comfort her and she replies it s all right , thank you very much the scene is described as summarizing the theme of forgiveness and friendship by both the united states and japan with the approach of the 50th anniversary of the start of the war between them the movie is to be released in the summer of 1991 mr kurosawa said he never meant to take advantage of the anniversary of pearl harbor but that it was a subject that needed to be aired there are so many things that we should be discussing with americans , he added the issue of the atomic bomb is one an intimate setting
one of the mysteries about act of betrayal is why it should take four hours to tell so simple a tale the story , which begins tonight at 9 and concludes tomorrow night at the same time on the arts entertainment cable network , has to do with the tracking down of a former officer in the irish republican army named michael mcgurk , whose conscience has compelled him to turn in his excomrades because they set off bombs in the vicinity of children the first two hours tell of the immediate aftermath of this act of betrayal or of conscience mcgurk \( patrick bergin \) is given a new identity by the authorities and resituated in sydney , australia , with his wife \( lisa harrow \) and their young son they are accompanied by an avuncular inspector \( bryan marshall \) among the emotional complications are the son s disaffection from his dad , whom he considers to be a coward the growing affection between the wife and the inspector , and for mcgurk a little something on the side in the agreeable form of an australian looker what begins intriguingly as a topical exploration of conscience lapses into domestic melodrama the actors , particularly mr marshall , lend appeal to the somewhat obvious script do you think they 'll come looking for us \?

a receding issue as israel s major parties struggle to put together a government with potential coalition partners , one bargaining chip that caused consternation for many american jews in the past is missing this time around , none of the small , pivotal religious parties is demanding legislation that would narrow the definition of who is jewish when such who is a jew legislation was made a negotiating point after the israeli elections of 1988 , american representatives of conservative and reform jewry descended on israel to fight the legislation , saying it threatened to undermine their movements and cause a rift between israel and the diaspora the legislation would recognize only orthodox conversions for those converts seeking to enter israel as jews the debate also caused a backlash against the lubavitch hasidic group in brooklyn , one of the important backers of the legislation lubavitch , which raises much of its money from nonorthodox jewry , acknowledged at the time that it had lost some financial backing because of its support for the legislation several jewish officials familiar with the current political jockeying in israel said the leader of lubavitch , rabbi menachem mendel schneerson , had signaled supporters in israel to drop the issue through intermediaries , the rabbi has also let conservative and reform rabbis know that he will not pursue the legislation he finally realized that it was counterproductive , said one official who asked not to be identified lubavitch , which in 1988 acknowledged its involvement in the issue , has since taken a position that it has never pushed for the who is a jew legislation when asked about the current political maneuvering , a spokesman , rabbi yehudah krinsky , said i have n't the foggiest notion lubavitch is not involved and has not been involved in the political horsetrading o'connor and press amid the worshipers and sightseers who pack st patrick s cathedral each sunday for the 10 15 morning mass , there is a small knot of newspaper , radio and television reporters who come to follow one of the city s most provocative newsmakers , the archbishop of new york , john cardinal o'connor the journalists have been there , off and on , every sunday since the archbishop was installed at the cathedral more than five years ago but these days , their presence is causing some controversy there s a growing annoyance among some us bishops , said an editorial in the current national catholic reporter , that the new york media in general and the new york cardinal john o'connor in particular are all too frequently determining the church s public agenda in the united states new york , the editorial notes , is the center of the communications industry and what is said here causes ripples in churches thoroughout the nation what apparently got the journal s dander up was the stir caused by the cardinal s sermon that rock music was contributing to the work of the devil and that exorcisms had been performed in the archdiocese suddenly , priests all over the country were being asked questions about satan a few weeks earlier , in a news conference after mass , the cardinal disclosed that he had counseled ivana trump about her separation from her husband , donald joseph zwilling , director of communications for the archdiocese , said that to my knowledge no bishops had complained to cardinal o'connor he noted that the none were quoted , either by name or anonymously , by the national catholic reporter , a liberalleaning publication i was left wondering where their information came from , he said mr zwilling added that the cardinal was sometimes portrayed as asking the press to come to the cathedral to listen to his sermon and attend a press conference that is not the case , mr zwilling said he is simply making himself available at his news conference last sunday cardinal o'connor said he was not unaware of the journalists' presence as he preached i'm doing a doubletrack thinking , the cardinal said i'm thinking what i'm saying to the people and i'm thinking what the press is going to say to the public turnabout in romania in what religious news service

washington , jan 4 recommending choices to appease both environmentalists and the oil industry , a panel headed by interior secretary manuel lujan jr says more study is needed before oil companies drill off the coasts of california and florida new measures are needed to protect the environment before the government leases offshore areas for drilling , the panel said in a report sent to the white house today the report , dated jan 1 and made available by federal officials , listed a number of options for president bush but none that called for a permanent drilling ban all called for a delay of at least three years for lease sales off florida and a delay of at least a year for those off california president has many options president bush may choose from among the options or choose another course entirely government officials have said a decision could be announced by the president in the state of the union message this month , but a white house spokesman said that was speculation federal efforts to develop the nation s offshore oil and natural gas reserves have been debated , contested and often effectively blocked for nearly a decade the coastal states and environmentalists contend that they pose an unacceptable risk to the marine and coastal ecology and threaten fishing and other economic activities , including tourism the oil industry and the federal government , pressing for development of offshore oil , say that would promote economic growth and protect the nation from dependence on foreign sources of energy the panel , which includes representatives from the interior , energy and commerce departments , the environmental protection agency and the office of management and budget , concluded that more study is needed on the environmental , economic and social effects of the drilling no option is pushed the options for the florida coast called for the cancellation of lease sales for at least the duration of the interior department s current fiveyear plan for developing the oil resources of the outer continental shelf , which expires at the end of 1992 the options for two california areas called for a deferral of lease sales for at least a year while additional data about the effects of oil activity are collected the report did not recommend which option the president should choose it concluded that the risk of a major offshore oil spill was small but warned that if such a spill occurred the environmental effect could be significant many of the environmental effects of oil and gas activities , taken individually , are acceptable , the preliminary report said but it added , collectively , environmental effects of oil and gas activities could result in unacceptable changes to the local environments among the measures proposed were prohibiting the discharge of fluids used in drilling in ecologically sensitive areas , improving the ability of communities to respond to oil spills , and requiring that oil from the outer continental shelf be transported by pipeline rather than in tankers , which are considered more prone to accidents white house declines comment a white house spokesman , stephen hart , said the president would consider the document in deciding what to do about pending lease sales the leases involve 11 acres of ocean off southern california , 67 million acres off northern california and 14 million acres off south florida in the gulf of mexico in 1981 , interior secretary james g watt announced plans to make the entire billionacre outer continental shelf available to industry for exploration and development his action touched off an outcry from coastal states and environmental groups who said that such leasing would cause severe degradation of the coastal environment they charged that the plan violated the outer continental shelf lands act amendments of 1978 , which requirs that the government balance the need for oil with the need to protect ecological systems shortly after taking office last year , president bush postponed the three lease sales scheduled for last year and formed the panel headed by mr lujan a statement issued by the american petroleum institute , a trade association that includes the nation s biggest oil companies , said we urge the president to choose the option to move ahead expeditiously a long delay would hurt our nation lisa speer , a staff member of the natural resources defense council who is an expert on offshore oil drilling , said the report appeared to be flawed because it included no option for the permanent cancellation of the lease sales she also said the administration was trying to suppress open debate on the issue by keeping the report secret
the melee in which 66 officers and inmates were injured friday on rikers island was termed particularly distressing and ominous yesterday by the chairman of the new york city board of correction , because it indicates a failure to control the jail even when it is not overcrowded the recovery of 17 or 18 shanks handmade knives indicates to me that searches for weapons have been inadequate , said the chairman , robert kasanof , and i am concerned that limitations on searches imposed by budget restraints on overtime are creating a very dangerous situation the board has oversight responsibility for the system the number of injuries to correction personnel , occurring at a time when the prisons are not overcrowded , mr kasanof added , is particularly distressing and ominous precautions were n't taken rikers , which currently houses 13 , 800 inmates , is at 988 percent of capacity , said ruby ryles , a spokeswoman for the correction department the jail where the melee occurred , the anna m kross center one of nine on the island currently holds 2 , 600 inmates , 200 less than capacity on friday afternoon , 39 officers and 27 inmates were injured , none seriously , when a group of muslim prisoners seeking to avenge the slashing of their imam , or religious leader , stormed the cell of his attacker yesterday , the situation was back to normal at the jail , ms ryles said , and prisoners were not confined to their cells on friday , the number of injured had been placed at 40 correction officers and 47 inmates the muslim prisoners had tried to crush their way into the closed cell , ms ryles said the imam , 26yearold andrew jackson , had been slashed on thursday by another inmate , rolando gonzalez , 24 , in a corridor it is clear , mr kasanof said , that an attack on an imam should have alerted authorities to the likelihood of retaliation the suspect should have been removed from the institution , and that fact made known to the population more searches than ever before mr kasanof added , i believe there now exists a situation systemwide on rikers island which makes it imperative that thorough searches be undertaken to purge the system of weapons the president of the correction captains association , donald cranston , said he met with correction commissioner allyn r sielaff tuesday to complain about staff cuts what they 're committed to , mr cranston said is cutting overtime in the department i believe security is one of the areas that has suffered but mr sielaff said that during his four months in office there have been more searches than ever before asked how 17 knives could still be recovered at the scene of a single disturbance , mr sielaff said i guess i 'd have to give you a course in institutional dynamics to answer that when one section is searched there may be weapons made in other sections it s a constant , constant effort to reduce homemade weapons the commissioner also said he had created a task force to identify and recommend the steps we need to take to lead to a reduction in violence the task force , he said , has issued a draft report with several dozen things that we will be doing 'capacity' was never ideal whatever the plan , running rikers island will to continue to be difficult a description of the problems was provided by the president of john jay college of criminal justice , dr gerald lynch , the chairman of a recent task force investigating the use of force against inmates even if the population is at capacity , dr lynch said yesterday , the capacity itself is far beyond anything resembling ideal management size even the physical design of rikers is a problem onto the original buildings , which were separate , dr lynch said , they 've attached modules , which are really big , big trailers you end up with very long corridors with modules attached , each with 40 to 60 inmates in them , with their spaces not clearly defined during the day , he said , they push the beds together so that people can move around but then to get to your own bed you have to step over other inmates of course , drug use , both in and out of jail , contributes to the tension you have a population , 80 percent of which has some relation to drugs , especially crack , dr lynch said crack creates a very manic person then you have the volativity of ethnic and religious disputes rumors fly they get distorted 'will i be convicted \? ' thomas reppetto , president of the citizens crime commission , a private oversight group , pointed out that a city jail , by definition , will always be more volatile than state prisons because there s much more turnover most of the city prisoners are detainees , he said the average guy stays less than two months there s a great deal of uncertainty in their status am i going to be convicted \? am i going to get out on bail \? long waits to eat , long delays going to court long delays for visitors to come onto the island , restricted time in the library all are sources of tension , dr lynch said there are disputes about what program to watch on the one television , he continued there is no air conditioning , in most buildings and trying to keep everything cool are the officers one to a dormitory and unarmed they must be counselor , judge , traffic cop and dispute resolver in a way that would tax anyone s capacity , dr lynch said the amazing side of it is that most of them do a superb job

as they move into the third month of their shared response to saddam hussein s aggression , the governments of the us , most middle eastern countries and most members of the un security council deserve applause together they have established a winning position unless they become divided in ways that none can desire , the iraqi aggression , sooner or later , will fail oddly , the principal threat to this prospect is that one or more members of this extraordinary coalition may not appreciate the strength of their present position and so may lose patience because the americans are the linchpin of the coalition , it is america s patience that matters most , and it is precisely among americans that there are voices calling for moving from blockade to decisive combat these voices are wrong in three ways first , if the us takes the lead in escalation , it will put heavy strains on the unity and steadiness of the coalition it has done so much to bring together and will gravely threaten the blockade constructed under our leadership second , there is no need for escalation because the blockade itself , over time , is a winner there can be no durable success for saddam hussein while the blockade remains in force , and his strength , military and political , is bound to decline month by month as it continues already he is weaker than he was , and his behavior shows he knows it his threats get thinner and his search for a political escape more frantic because it is necessarily slow , the blockade can easily be underestimated iraq is unusually vulnerable to blockade largescale imports and exports are vital they are readily blocked the necessary participants in this process are few , and all are deeply interested in success we ca n't be sure a cornered saddam hussein will never strike out , but it is reasonable to expect that the allies will be able to turn any such act into a clear defeat for him a third error is the assumption that because it was wrong in vietnam it is wrong now to use force in a limited and graduated way this assumption is entirely understandable to me , because i know at first hand what we tried to do in vietnam and how it ended in disaster it was a disaster , not because we did too little , but because we tried to do too much we tried to do with our own forces what in the end could be done only by the vietnamese tragically , there was a persistent and eventually fatal imbalance of effectiveness between the vietnamese communists and their opponents it makes no sense to let an honorable but deeply mistaken view of the american tragedy in vietnam be misapplied in the wholly different situation of iraq and kuwait this time , as a result of quick and excellent work by our own leaders , we and our friends are doing enough to prevail a position we never reached in vietnam and we need not do more unless saddam hussein makes war a blockade has daily costs , but even a year of blockade will be cheaper for both sides by every measure of cost than even a week of war it is true that blockade will not by itself do more than bring independence back to kuwait it cannot settle the political future of that country or insure a stable peace between iraq and its neighbors as president bush made clear at the un , there will be much to work out after the iraqis leave kuwait in particular , there are other dangers in the iraq of saddam hussein , notably a deep preoccupation with the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction but these are not matters to be settled by warfare at least not by warfare of american choice we shall do better on these larger problems if we keep to what president bush has described a course that does only what we must to restore the independence of kuwait once that goal is attained , there will be a new political and military balance of power in the region that will help in larger matters as an open war begun by the americans will not
despite years of concessions from workers , the labor costs of american companies are rising again not since the early 1980 s have they gone up so fast but the increases do not reflect labor militancy the problem this time is n't escalating wages , but the escalating cost of benefits and they are not easily controlled by labor or management that makes the impact on the nation anyone s guess today s labor costs are hard to deal with at the bargaining table the big collectivebargaining issue is wages , but they are rising only mildly , failing even to keep up with inflation the growing burden for corporate america is in nonwage items particularly big jumps in health insurance premiums , imposed by the insurers , and higher social security taxes , imposed by the government you are really hard pressed , when you look at the numbers , to talk of wage explosion going on there , said daniel j b mitchell , a labor economist at the university of california at los angeles when you back out the benefits , nothing is really going on in labor costs that does not make the problem less painful , from several viewpoints one is inflation when economists talk of the inflation threat these days , the chief concern is that companies will raise prices to recover their higher outlays for labor but in a sluggishly growing economy , price increases are hard to come by , even when the labor department s employment cost index , measuring the cost of wages and benefits , goes up alarmingly \( the index for the private sector rose 52 percent in the year ended march 31 , compared with increases of 46 percent and 38 percent , respectively , in the two previous years \) without the option of price increases , many companies are paying for the higher labor costs out of profits the labor department measures the profit from the sale of each unit produced in the nation , whether the unit is in the service sector \( a newly cleaned suit , a haircut \) or in manufacturing \( a toy , a computer , a car \) this index plunged to 1125 last year from 1288 in 1988 not since 1983 , a year in which the nation was emerging from a recession , have unit profits been so low another alternative is to obtain more production from each worker that increases profits by spreading the labor cost over more units a presser is pushed to iron more suits , and the 10 workers in a toy factory to make more toys , for the same wages and benefits this exercise in greater productivity is particularly noticeable among companies competing with foreigners a competition that often forces them to hold down prices thus , the bank of america , with headquarters in california , where japanese banks have a huge presence , is relying on incentives loan officers , for instance , get extra pay to negotiate more loans and the bank s real estate appraisers to churn out more appraisals we are moving from traditional merit increases to this sort of incentive payment , said norman snell , a vice president similarly , with its health insurance premiums rising 16 percent a year , the union camp corporation is spending millions on machinery to increase output at mills making liner board , a material used in shipping containers in addition , the mill workers , whose wages are rising only 25 percent a year , have agreed to rules changes that increase their output production and maintenance people , for example , now do each other s tasks but in a sluggish economy , productivity has its ceiling fewer people are taking out loans , no matter how motivated bank of america s loan officers are and while liner board demand is rising , it is not rising as fast as the capacity to produce it american corporations are trying two other routes around the labor cost burden one is to reduce the outlay for benefits , particularly companypaid health insurance many companies are pushing employees toward less expensive doctors and hospitals some are also lobbying congress to help bear the cost of some health care but if none of this slows the rise in labor costs , american companies could return to more drastic measures the early 1980 s were a period of wage givebacks and layoffs that fell heaviest on bluecollar workers and the early 1990 s could become a similar period , but this time focused on whitecollar employees whitecollar wages and benefits are rising more rapidly than bluecollar compensation \( 102 percent over the last two years , versus 84 percent \) and their average income is higher \( 1850 versus 14 an hour \) already , reports of layoffs or hiring freezes for whitecollar employees are appearing regularly involving such giants as caterpillar , ibm , lockheed , chrysler and h j heinz you do n't necessarily cut functions , but you cut the number of people who do each function , said donald hilty , a chrysler economist one way to do this is to reduce the layers of whitecollar management drawing
tomorrow is the deadline for filing 1989 taxes , and many lastminute filers are spending the weekend putting the final touches on their returns in fact , so many people drag their feet that april 15 traditionally is the biggest day of the year for investors' telephone calls at the new yorkbased oppenheimer management corporation , one of the largest mutual fund groups this year , oppenheimer has been logging in a record number of calls , said sam freedman , president of oppenheimer shareholder services last monday alone , it took 4 , 960 calls , far ahead of the 3 , 913 it took on the monday before filing day last year , and it is bracing for about 6 , 000 calls tomorrow many calls reflect the complexity of tax rules but questions about individual retirement accounts abound mr freedman said the number of new ira s began falling after upperincome investors were barred from taking a deduction for them in 1987 , but new ira s at oppenheimer are running about 90 percent ahead of last year he said investors have finally started to recognize the benefit of taxfree compounding of earnings , even if the initial investment is n't deductible consider someone who invests 2 , 000 a year for 20 years in the end , assuming a 9 percent rate of return , the ira investor will have 111 , 529 before taxes the one who pays taxes annually on the earnings has 78 , 443 following is a sampling of questions that investors are asking oppenheimer this year buying ira s q can i use the money that i invested in a mutual fund to open an ira \? a yes , but you pay a price you have to sell your shares in the fund and then use the proceeds to open the ira even one in the same fund that means you pay income taxes on any profit from the sale muni funds and state taxes q to reduce taxes , i bought into a municipal bond fund i know that i do n't have to pay any federal taxes on the income , but my neighbor told me that part of the earnings were free of state taxes , too true \? a that depends on where you live and what issues the fund holds a taxfree municipal bond fund holds issues from municipalities in some or all of the 50 states when you buy a municipal bond issued by your own state , you usually do n't pay any state taxes on the income the same holds true when you buy shares of a municipal bond fund or taxfree money market fund that buys issues from the state where you live in that case , a portion of the fund s earnings are taxfree for investors who live in the state each fund should be able to tell investors how much of their income is free of state taxes foreign tax credits q i own shares in a fund that invests overseas does any of my income qualify for a foreign tax credit \? a that depends on what countries the fund invests in and the laws there when funds invest in foreign securities , taxes are withheld by most foreign governments on dividends or interest earned in that country shareholders usually deduct foreign taxes paid or take a foreign tax credit against the final amount of federal tax owed the credit , a dollarfordollar offset against taxes , is worth more than a deduction , which is worth 28 or 33 percent , depending on your tax bracket but because the form used to claim the credit is so cumbersome , some investors prefer the deduction the amount of the deduction or credit varies because of different tax laws in various countries breaking out tbill income q my accountant asked me to find out how much of the income from my government bond fund came from treasury bills why do we need to know that \? a government funds invest in all types of united states government issues keith lawson , assistant general counsel for the investment company institute , the industry trade group , said that although the constitution prevents states from taxing the income from federal issues , seven states tax all government fund dividends some states tax only part of the earnings and others none at all how much of your fund s income is taxfree on your state return \? that depends on what types of federal issues your state levies taxes on and what type the fund invested in most states exempt income earned from treasury bills and most agency obligations , but they tax income from issues guaranteed by the federal government like bonds of the federal national mortgage association taxing shortterm gains q my fund says i earned three types of income this year ordinary income , shortterm capital gains and longterm gains how are the shortterm gains taxed \? a shortterm capital gains profits from assets owned a year or less are taxed at the same rates as ordinary income this year some funds have switched to new accounting systems that combine shortterm capital gains with ordinary income on the forms they send to shareholders time for pacific bargainhunting \? the japanese stock market began its free fall toward the end of last year and took a nosedive during the first quarter , losing about 25 percent of its value when a market loses so much so quickly , investors have to ask is it time for a turnaround \? mutual funds investing in the pacific region , which is dominated by the japanese , turned in an abysmal showing in the first quarter compared to other funds that invest overseas and they hardly had a sterling record for the previous 12 months , mainly because fourthquarter 1989 results dragged down the whole year mutual fund experts are now saying that the firstquarter results were so bad that a recovery must be coming , and that the availability of bargains in the pacific region outweighs any risk that the market may drop even more for investors who believe that the japanese market may be coming close to the bottom , now may be the time to scout out some good buys chart number of mutual fund i \?

washington , sept 23 president f w de klerk of south africa , citing the rev dr martin luther king jr as an inspiration for the changes he has begun in his own country , arrived in washington today for talks with president bush after four decades in which washington has kept south africa at arm s length because of apartheid , mr de klerk stepped off his south african airways jet into a redcarpet reception at andrews air force base mr de klerk , who was invited to washington in february by president bush after he released the black south african leader , nelson mandela , from prison and began negotiations to end white minority rule , clearly relished the moment i am deeply aware of the historical importance of this visit , mr de klerk said to the assistant secretary of state for africa , herman j cohen , who headed the american welcoming party south africa has embarked on a great journey it is a journey towards full democracy at home and abroad , full participation in the family of nations it is a journey that i sincerely believe will bring the fruits of both justice and economic wellbeing to every south african family antiapartheid sanctions in a few moments , we will begin our visit to washington at the reflecting pool , said mr de klerk , referring to the ceremony where he was formally welcomed by secretary of state james a baker 3d it is there where the reflections of the great monuments to washington and lincoln come together and it was there that many thousands of americans heard the rev martin luther king describe his dream for an america of justice and harmony through nonviolence when mrde klerk referred to the family of nations , it was no idle oratorical flourish to be welcomed at the white house on monday , with the south african flag waving next to the stars and stripes , will be for him and other white south africans the ultimate sign that their country is finally breaking out of its pariah status it was striking that moments after mr de klerk s plane landed , almost all of the south african airways flight attendants gathered around one of the united states marine honor guards and asked him to pose for a picture with them next to the aircraft , which he gladly did the flight was the airline s first to land in the united states since congress banned air links with south africa as part of the 1986 antiapartheid sanctions although the small official welcoming party that met mr de klerk was in marked contrast to the tumultuous tickertape parades that greeted his negotiating partner , mr mandela , the african national congress leader , last june , it did not diminish the south african leader s evident satisfaction he is the first south african head of government to visit the united states since 1945 'with charity for all' the words and deeds of presidents washington , lincoln and dr king still ring out to us all , continued mr de klerk , 54 , who at the time of dr king s civil rights activities in the 1960 s was an enthusiastic advocate of apartheid inscribed in stone above lincoln s statue are the great words , 'with malice towards none , with charity for all , let us do all which may achieve a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations' these are words which also describe our efforts today in south africa mr de klerk s reference to dr king and his famous 1963 speech , one of the most inspiring of the civil rights movement , was seen as offensive by some american black leaders randall robinson , executive director of the africanamerican lobby transafrica , argued that dr king died in a lifelong effort to perfect american democracy , while south african blacks are fighting to establish the very essentials of a democratic system against a white minority , including de klerk , that has insisted on retention of its privileges mr de klerk was closeted with his aides much of the day and dined this evening with vice president dan quayle monday morning , he will meet with mr bush after a working lunch at the white house , the south african president will go to the state department for talks with mr baker on tuesday he will deliver an address at the national press club and also meet with congressional leaders a new constitution during his talks in washington , the south african leader is expected to receive mixed messages from the white house and congress administration officials say he will hear praise for his bold decision to release political prisoners in return for the suspension of armed struggle by the african national congress , and for his decision to begin talks with mr mandela on how to draft a new constitution to govern a postapartheid south africa the bush administration wants to heap enough praise on mr de klerk to encourage him to keep moving forward and give him something to point to when his rightist white critics ask what , if anything , his reforms have gained for south africa abroad but this praise , administration officials say , will be tempered by admonitions that the african leader still has not gone far enough in his reforms to justify a lifting of sanctions by washington mr de klerk , officials added , will also be questioned about how he plans to contain the factional violence in south africa s black townships , which threatens to undermine the constitutional negotiations many black leaders have accused the south african police and rightwing organizations of instigating some of that violence , which has led to more than 1 , 700 deaths this year 'a sad and tragic situation' these and other issues explain why not everyone in congress welcomes the de klerk visit transafrica is planning a demonstration across from the white house while mr de klerk is in the oval office and on saturday the congressional black caucus announced that it was canceling a scheduled meeting with mr de klerk mr robinson , of transafrica , said he had encouraged the cancellation because of his group s feeling that the de klerk visit is nothing more than a superficial photo opportunity , staged with the assistance of president bush , to put a smiling face on a sad and tragic situation the american public , mr robinson said , must be reminded that the major pillars of apartheid remain firmly in place in south africa a senior administration official briefing reporters at the white house before mr de klerk s arrival said , we recognize , as will this visit , that president de klerk has played a major role in bringing changes about the administration official said , though , that he was certain that mr de klerk was under no illusion that the sanctions against south africa , embodied in the comprehensive antiapartheid act , would be lifted the united states has specific legislation relating to sanctions , and those cannot

to the editor i understand that a sense of perspective often comes with age , but does that mean that one must give vent to the kind of immature complaining demonstrated by the collegestudent author of growing up in the shadow of aids \? the article \( oped , sept 30 \) a lament that acquired immune deficiency syndrome has prevented the author from engaging in promiscuous sexual activity but has committed herto her livein boyfriend was a classic of insensitive selfpity in a time when aids has brought true suffering not only is it hard to be sympathetic to her position , but the factual premise of her essay is wrong she writes that , o f course , everyone , gay or straight , is in the same situation now this is hardly accurate evidence indicates that the incidence of hivinfection is still very limited among heterosexual american men who do not use intravenous drugs as a result , using a little common sense and taking certain precautions , she and other women of her generation could within limits engage in casual sex with little risk there is promiscuity , and then there is promiscuity , however if by the word the author means knowing more than one partner inher life \( as she suggests at one point \) then she need have no fears if , at the other extreme , she means having multiple partners simultaneously , about each of whom she knows little , then she has indeed suffered a lost possibility assuming this is her grievance , there is something offensive about her complaining that the shadow of aids has caused her to be monogamous , while the disease is killing so many like the author , i have lost few friends to aids \( in fact , i have lost none \) yet one need not have suffered any personal losses from aids to recognize that complaining about the lost possibility of sexual promiscuity demeans the true suffering of the disease s real victims it is not unlike watching famine victims on television while lamenting that the neighborhood grocery store is out of mint chocolatechip ice cream martin kimel washington , oct 8 , 1990
washington , june 1 a draft report by an americanled policy group of the united nations has proposed international measures to cope with global warming caused by pollution , but it calls for no specific goals or timetables for action environmentalists and some european diplomats who have seen a summary of the report , which was prepared by american officials , complained that its recommendations did not reflect the urgency evident in a report on scientific knowledge about global warming that report , prepared by a britishled panel and released last week by another united nations panel , , found that unless the emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that are trapping heat from the sun are immediately cut by more than 60 percent , global temperatures would rise sharply in the next century with unforeseeable consequences for humans the draft policy report by the americanled panel calls for a general international treaty to address global warming , but none of the signers would be obligated to take specific action other recommendations are to use energy more efficiently , to strengthen existing institutions that could address the climate change issue , and to accumulate more information on scientific , technical and economic implications of the problem 3 panels examine problem three united nationssponsored working groups are gathering information to help nations decide what to do about global warming the britishled panel completed its report last week a sovietled group studying potential effects of global warming is still working on its report the americanled group was assigned to examine strategies for dealing with the problem the information provided by the three groups is intended to form the basis of further international action to deal with the problem an international conference will be held in geneva this november to plan the next steps the policy group s recommendations generally parallel the bush administration s approach to the problem the administration wants to delay specific international action , like mandatory reduction of carbon dioxide and other pollutants , and to focus on more study of the scientific and economic implications of the shift in climate european governments are expected to press for a stronger report when the members of the americanled working group meet in geneva next week to prepare its final report , said an official in the netherlands embassy here the official said western european governments were concerned that the policy summary prepared by the united states put more emphasis on uncertainties than was warranted by the findings of subcommittees that did the research for the report but he said that his government could not comment officially on the report because it was still in draft form 2 panels at odds daniel lashof , a global warming expert for the natural resources defense council , an environmental group , said there is a real disconnect between the recommendations of the science panel and the draft report by the working group on policy responses he said the science panel made a strong statement about the science and the need for at least a 60 percent reduction in carbon dioxide , while the policy group did not even analyze the policy measures needed to reach that reduction frederick m bernthal , deputy director of the national science foundation and chairman of the policy working group , did not respond to several telephone calls over the last two days the draft report on policy options was prepared by the response strategies working group , one of three working groups that make up the intergovernmental panel on climate change , which was created in 1988 by the united nations environmental program and the world meteorological organization , another united nations organization the response strategies working group identified a number of measures that it said would be particularly important and feasible in the short term it suggested the development of a framework convention , or general treaty on climate change , without specifying any particular obligations or deadlines for reducing the pollution that is accumulating in the atmosphere and trapping radiation from the sun in a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect it proposed carrying out measures that are already economically and socially justifiable in their own right and which also provide benefits from a climate change standpoint such measures would include increased energy efficiency and improved use of forests and other natural resources it urged increased research into scientific , technical and economic uncertainties about the magnitude , time and regional effects of global warming potential policies to lessen its impact , and measures to adjust to a warmer earth when and if that happens it unlike the bush administration , several western european countries have concluded that enough is known about the potential dangers to warrant substantial countermeasures , including stabilizing and reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
joseph papp , director of the new york shakespeare festival , announced yesterday that he had received pledges for gifts totaling more than 60 , 000 following his rejection of a 50 , 000 grant from the national endowment for the arts because , he said , he could not accept the federal agency s restrictions on obscenity those who pledged money ranged from mark goodson , the television producer , who told mr papp he would send a check for 50 , 000 , to l howard fox , a resident of montclair , nj , who sent a check for 100 in his letter to john e frohnmayer , chairman of the arts endowment , mr papp said yesterday i cannot in all good conscience accept any money from the nea as long as the helmsinspired amendment on obscenity is part of our agreement i am therefore turning down the recently awarded 50 , 000 grant for the festival latino 'immediate financial problems' in an interview yesterday after receiving calls from mr goodson and others , mr papp said i'm very happy about it because it s going to take care of some immediate financial problems , but i ca n't depend on a crisis to make up a gap on an annual basis an institution like mine needs the continuity of support that the nea provides but maybe this will create a climate in which this obscenity issue can be dealt with in a different way mr goodson said he supported a number of experimental theater groups but had not realized until reading about mr papp s decision that the law passed by congress last october would not only affect painting and photography but would also affect plays recipients notified since october , recipients of grants from the national endowment for the arts have had to pledge that none of the government s money would be used for works that might be deemed obscene and without artistic merit the restriction was imposed after some members of congress , led by senator jesse a helms , republican of north carolina , objected to the financing of exhibitions featuring works by the photographers robert mapplethorpe and andres serrano rostropovich criticizes curbs on arts funds washington , april 27 \( ap \) mstislav rostropovich , artistic director of the national symphony orchestra , on friday compared restrictions on federal aid to the arts to the soviet union s censorship of writers , artists and composers testifying before a senate hearing on financing for the national endowment for the arts , mr rostropovich recalled how he had chafed under soviet censorship and smuggled dmitri shostakovich s 13th symphony , the babi yar , out of the country it was that life under censorship that led me to the united states , mr rostropovich said only now , he added , are the soviet people learning about some of their own writers and seeing their works published art and literature should be judged by the conscience of the creator , his peers in his field and all of the people , he said , not by a separate bureaucracy , artificially compressing the arteries and veins of this lifesustaining circulation supports reauthorization mr rostropovich was among the witnesses supporting reauthorization of the endowment before the education , arts and humanities subcommittee of the senate labor and human resources committee phyllis schlafly , president of the eagle forum , a conservative group , argued at the hearing that federal support for the endowment should be cut off she said the issue was not censorship but responsible use of taxpayers' money nobody has a right to receive unrestricted grants of the taxpayers' money , mrs schlafly said the nea was born in the mid1960 s , when unregulated handouts to targeted constituencies were the passion of the day , she said that era is over having proved its irresponsibility in spending the taxpayers' money , the national endowment for the arts should be completely defunded 'confusion' exists mr frohnmayer , the chairman of the arts endowment , had appeared at a house subcommittee hearing a day earlier and had called the restrictive language a compromise probably fully satisfactory to none he said confusion about the restrictions among artists was demonstrated by mr papp s action mr frohnmayer said the language has made our task more difficult rather than easier , and repeated his request that no content restrictions be added to the next appropriation

ordinances proposed by municipal officials in union city that establish a program of random drug testing for public safety personnel have raised federal and state constitutional issues and may be an infringement on police officers' and firefighters' rights , legal experts and labor union officials say random drug testing , in which employees are subject to the unannounced collection of urine samples for tests to detect illicit substances in a person s body , is also criticized as being unreliable and as being a potential means of harassment and intimidation of employees by officials several new jersey municipalities have tried to establish random testing programs in the past those attempts have been challenged in the courts and have resulted in conflicting opinions on the issue in federal and state courts union city officials say the proposal has been drawn up to withstand judicial scrutiny since it provides written procedures aimed at maintaining the integrity of the city s public safety department in addition , they say the program is constitutionally acceptable because it protects employees' rights to privacy , uses fair and accurate testing and provides a second chance and free counseling and education for those who test positive for drug use the debate arises as state and federal leaders call for stricter drug enforcement efforts to stem what is seen as a rising tide of drug abuse in society in new jersey , the antidrug effort is underscored by the recent establishment of a permanent state assembly committee specifically formed to deal with drug and alcoholrelated legislation no one can be smug when it comes to how drugs have invaded and corrupted every corner of our society , said bruce d walter , commissioner of public safety in union city , a small but densely populated community in hudson county it s probably very hard to find anyone in this community who has not been touched by the scourge of drug abuse as a result , he said , municipal officials there have drafted ordinances requiring every police officer and firefighter to submit to unannounced randomly administered urine tests at least once a year although union officials and the rank and file in union city and across the state generally agree with the concept of drug testing , most staunchly oppose the idea of tests administered at random we are definitely opposed to random testing , said steve winters , president of the local firefighters' union not only is it unconstitutional , but it gives the city officials unlimited power that they can use for political purposes state firefighters' union officials agree it s like the police having the right to break down everyone s door on a city block hoping to find stolen merchandise , said william f flynn , president of the 5 , 000member new jersey state firemen s mutual benevolent association we feel that random testing could be used as a tool by the employer to vent his anger or frustration against the employee , he said another problem with drug testing , mr flynn said , is that the tests used are often not very reliable and even the best tests available have a 1 or 2 percent margin of error i sure would n't want to be one of those 2 percent , he said some municipalities dismiss an employee immediately upon obtaining a positive result on a drug test union city officials , however , say their proposal provides for a twostep testing procedure when the results obtained are positive , with the second test being highly accurate and less likely to lead to a false positive than the first the same sample is used for both tests in addition , the officials say , the randomness of the testing will be guaranteed by the use of computergenerated lists administered by an independent party like an accounting or data processing company i ca n't see anybody objecting to this type of random testing , mr walter said we 've provided for privacy , anonymity and sensitivity we would be happy to let the unions pick the firm to do the selecting we would subject ourselves to the testing to be enacted , the union city proposal requires approval by three of the five members of the board of commissioners after public hearings are held testing has been resisted random drugtesting programs have consistently met with resistance in new jersey in 1985 , for example , plainfield officials ordered an unannounced testing of all the township s firefighters they came in and locked all the doors and took all the telephones out , said earl johnson , president of the firefighters' union there the telephones were removed , he said , to prevent employees on one shift from giving a warning of the test to those arriving for the next shift as a result of the testing , 16 firefighters were found to have traces of drugs in their systems and were suspended from duty those firefighters , with the support of the american civil liberties union , sued the city in federal court on constitutional grounds the court ruled that adequate written guidelines for the testing had not been established , and it found in favor of the firefighters they were reinstated with all their back pay , and the city was ordered to pay punitive damages to each suspended firefighter
washington , jan 30 a federal district judge today ordered former president ronald reagan to turn over excerpts of his private diaries to john m poindexter , the former national security adviser , who had argued that they would show mr reagan had authorized his actions in the irancontra affair the decision could provoke a legal clash over the issue of executive privilege , the doctrine that protects a president from disclosing private communications unless there is an overwhelming need for disclosure judge harold h greene gave mr reagan until monday to comply with his ruling so as to provide the former president s lawyers with time to challenge the decision new challenge possible theodore b olson , one of mr reagan s lawyers , declined to comment on the judge s order or whether he would cite executive privilege to challenge it such a challenge may be the only avenue left for mr reagan s lawyers , who have failed since last november to persuade the judge to cancel a subpoena for the diaries sought by the defense as national security adviser , mr poindexter played an important role in the irancontra affair , in which the proceeds of secret arm sales to iran were diverted to the nicaraguan rebels when congress had banned military aid to the rebels , known as contras mr reagan has insisted he knew nothing about the diversion and left the details of other aspects of the affair to mr poindexter and other subordinates the reagan diaries are handwritten notes by mr reagan that contain his private thoughts on his years in office , his meetings with foreign heads of state and his personal reactions to people and events mr poindexter s lawyers have said that they do not know precisely what the diaries contain , but that they are seeking access to them based on mr poindexter s recollection of dates and meetings when mr reagan may have discussed irancontra matters judge greene is one of the few people to have seen the diaries , which have been closely held by mr reagan lawyers for lawrence e walsh , the independent prosecutor , and investigators for the congressional investigating committees have also reviewed irancontra entries , but they were not permitted to make copies and were allowed only to take notes in his order today , judge greene said , upon its review of the reagan diary excerpts , the court concluded that some but not all the diary entries produced in response to various subpoena categories are relevant to defendant s claim the excerpts that the judge ordered to be turned over relate to specific events like mr reagan s successful efforts to persuade the honduran government to release an arms shipment destined for the nicaraguan contras that had been held up by honduras poindexter stake is upheld the judge also ruled that mr poindexter was entitled to be furnished with diary entries related to mr poindexter s trip to central america in december 1985 , his meetings held to discuss arms sales to iran in december 1985 and one other entry that addresses briefly the proceeds from the arms sales in his order , judge greene offered no assessment of whether the diary entries supported mr poindexter s attempt to show presidential authorization for his actions but in one footnote , the judge commented that one entry includes a somewhat ambiguous comment arguably indicating that the former president knew of defendant s activities on behalf of the contras such a conclusion contrasts with mr reagan s statement contained in the final report of a presidential review board that he did not know that the national security council staff was engaged in helping the contras the judge s order , requiring mr reagan to produce diary entries for 29 dates in 1985 and 1986 , is an important victory for mr poindexter his lawyers have argued that mr reagan s diaries are vital in helping the defense demonstrate that the former president authorized mr poindexter s activities in the irancontra affair defense lawyer is elated we are pleased with this decision by the court , said richard w beckler , mr poindexter s chief lawyer we have always maintained that the president is a necessary witness judge greene s ruling was also the first time a judge has ordered a president or former president to turn over such private deliberative material for use in a criminal trial since former president richard m nixon was ordered to turn over secretly recorded oval office tapes in the watergate affair mr poindexter s court battle to force his reluctant former commander in chief to provide evidence that might bolster his defense also underscores how the case has turned into a forum that is revising the record of mr reagan s role in the irancontra affair mr poindexter , a retired navy rear admiral , served as national security adviser from december 1985 until he was reassigned in november 1986 when the affair became public he faces five criminal charges , including accusations that he obstructed congress and made false statements by denying that the reagan administration was aiding the nicaraguan rebels further move by judge if mr reagan refuses to turn over the material , claiming executive privilege , judge greene said in his order said that he would reconsider his decision the judge also said he would provide mr reagan s lawyers and the justice department with copies of the sealed legal papers filed by mr poindexter that explained how the diary excerpts were relevant to his defense if judge greene conducts another private hearing on the documents , he could further narrrow the list of diary entries to be turned over to mr poindexter to a small number that mr reagan s lawyers might accept without further legal wrangling the justice department , representing president bush and the office of the presidency , has also sought to cancel the subpoena for the documents but the department had no comment today on whether it would join with mr reagan s lawyers if they decide to engage in further legal action but if mr reagan fails to keep mr poindexter from obtaining the diary excerpts , the former national security adviser may still face difficulties in trying to use the diary entries in court because the material is classified as such , the excerpts are subject to the classified information procedures act , which could permit the attorney general to prohibit their disclosure on national security grounds assessment on reagan role of the 100 diary entries reviewed in private by judge greene , he said none shed further light on one of the major unresolved issues of the affair , whether mr reagan knew about the diversion of arms sales proceeds to the contras upon examination of these entries , the court has concluded that they contain no information to sustain defendant s contention that president reagan knew of and authorized the diversion or other nsc activities in support of contra military operations , the judge said , using the initials nsc to refer to the national security council the judge refused to permit mr poindexter to have access to other diary entries that related to mr reagan s knowledge of the iran arms sales and another category of entries that reflected his concern for american hostages in lebanon and his concern for their families
the folks that live on the hill by kingsley amis 246 pp new york summit books 1895 kingsley amis s 20th novel , the folks that live on the hill , begins in the kitchen with the fierce whooshing noise of an electric kettle there follows a giantmosquito whine as the overhead strip lighting goes on , after which the dishwasher enters the throbbing , growling part of its cycle observing all this , bunty streatfield notes that even tiny kitchens in quite small flats were no longer the quiet places they must once have been it s even worse outside in the supposedly quiet , imaginary suburb of london called shepherd s hill , where bunty and the assorted folks of the novel s title reside they are overseen by the book s central figure , twicedivorced harry caldecote , who lives with his widowed sister , clare , and feels obliged to look after various characters in various shades of distress bunty , for example , who has left her husband to live with a lesbian named popsy at her best , popsy \( who looks to bunty like an ethereal soccer hooligan \) is given some of mr amis s original way with language , as when she catches two men in a chelsea restaurant , staring at her and bunty and nudging one another leaning over , popsy says , not very loudly , and in just an interested tone , 'what line of work are you in , sammy \? sewage disposal , would it be \? ' and offers to give him a really good punch up the bracket but more often she s just a bully , so bunty needs rescuing as does harry s brother , the hapless freddie caldecote , enslaved to his wife , who is aptly named desiree we first meet this lady in a pub , where she assures harry \( with freddie present \) that his brother has been altogether different since he had his prostatectomy in a voice not exactly loud but penetrating , none the less , quite penetrating , she proceeds to describe to harry s not at all eager ears how the prostatectomy was done and how freddie no longer needs to get up in the night \( to urinate , she explains \) in fact , she goes on coyly to emphasize , the operation has had other effects \( to be explained later \) the other occupants of the pub drown out desiree s good news by bawling things about wallpaper and breakfast cereal and the pope at one another throughout the book , this noise level maintains itself almost continuously harry also feels responsible for piers , his layabout son from his first marriage , and for fiona , a niece whose alcoholism supplies the book with its most graphic and disturbing passages \( it is of note that the writer who began his career with that comically immortal scene in which lucky jim wakens to a colossal hangover should , 36 years later , treat the ravages of booze in a very different way \) mr amis is , however , less interested in exploring harry s burden of obligation toward others than in focusing on the novel s different characters as they undergo their troubles when certain disruptive forces have been expelled , or at least temporarily held at bay , the comedy can end and things quiet down to an entirely adequate moment wordlessly shared by harry and his sister but much of the fun is in the noise and , as is typical with the work of kingsley amis , more happens with individual words and sentences than in average novels a cypriot wine dealer says thanks very much to one of the two asians who run the local post office \( they are known as howard and charles , whatever their real names are \) after the merchant leaves , charles says , mutts indeed thank you very mutts a dead giveaway none of them can pronounce words like that properly \( them meaning greeks , to these impeccable gentlemen , who act as a sort of chorus in the novel \) the presence of a single unexpected word turns crude sex commentary into something else , when howard says of another customer , fine pair of bristols , did n't you think \? and elsewhere , there is the pure linguistic fun of a selfpitying pub owner s lament \( to a momentarily confused harry \) we 're on the way out we 're a dime breed sorry , you 're a what \? a dime breed dine out like the dinosaurs but when desiree describes the improvement in her sex life with freddie , we must , as harry does , wince more than a bit things ai n't what they used to be yes , but a little bit of do you know what he calls it , a little bit of numnum on a sunday morning , then a cup of tea and a glance through the observer , and then perhaps , depending on how we feel that s actually our best time , sunday morning you can imagine well , replies harry i expect i could if i were to put my mind to it and indeed some readers will wince at mr amis s tone as the author of stanley and the women , in a passing description of a shop display of magazines and books , directs a rather gratuitous low blow at copies of a pornographic shortstory collection by a local feminist writer , signed by her on the titlepage too but everyone should be pleased by the odd stroke of telling literary criticism harry quotes keats s like stout cortez , when with eagle eyes he stared at the pacific and remembers , as a schoolboy , arguing with his brother about how much a difference it was supposed to make that cortez had eagle eyes while all his men presumably only had ordinary human ones , and so their wild surmise might be meant to be not worth much

i'm sure i must have heard his name a few times as i was growing up , but i do n't think i ever actually read anything by voltaire until the early 1960 s when , as a halfhearted graduate student of english literature , carefully husbanding a student deferment during the vietnam war days , i was assigned an essay comparing candide and samuel johnson s rasselas both books had first appeared in 1759 i went on to learn a good deal more about dr johnson , but voltaire had served his purpose , and was forgotten by 1965 the army was , for various reasons , no longer a threat to me , and i abandoned a halffinished dissertation and came to new york to earn my living as a dealer in rare books about two years ago voltaire resurfaced there was no special reason for his reappearance beyond a chance accumulation on my shelves of about a dozen 18thcentury english printings , not from any plan , but simply because no one seemed to want them very much it must have been a slow day at the shop , and i remember thinking that it might be rather amusing to build a small collection of voltaire as he was published in england during the course of his lifetime his continental editions i rejected as being too numerous and outside my usual area of interest the first step , then , was to learn the limits of my chosen universe this would have been a slightly cumbersome task 25 years ago , but technology has gradually made its way into the antiquarian book world , and i now had access to some rather powerful tools , such as the eighteenthcentury short title catalogue \( estc \) , a data base available in most large libraries , whose purpose is to record every book , pamphlet and broadside printed in english or , for foreignlanguage texts , in the englishspeaking world , between the years 1701 and 1800 , and to provide the locations of actual copies where possible and across my desk was a metal cabinet containing more than 9 , 000 microfiches this is the national union catalogue , compiled over the years at the library of congress this catalogue tries to list every book printed up to 1955 of which copies may be found in the institutional libraries of north america it is not complete , or wholly accurate , but it is impressive nonetheless there are almost 4 , 200 entries for voltaire alone , each representing a different printing with these , and a few lesser sources , i was able to compile a list of about 450 printings of voltaire up to the end of the 18th century now all i had to do was find them i was a bit surprised by the size of my project , but in a way this was encouraging , because it meant , if nothing else , that voltaire had been of substantial interest to his english contemporaries a similar list , say , for henry fielding , whose dates \( 170754 \) fall entirely within those of voltaire \( 16941778 \) , would be no longer , and fielding was by any standard one of the great literary successes of the period and british as well the profusion of voltaire also meant that his books were not too hard to find , and by the end of a year i had accumulated some 40 titles in about 75 different printings it was now time to look more closely at what i had , and i entered into a world of often bewildering complexity take candide , for a start during 1759 no fewer than three different english translations had appeared , two in london and one in edinburgh before the year was out one of these had gone into a second edition and another had been pirated in dublin , where cheap reprints were often manufactured for export to the colonies there were even two london printings in french , both apparently produced by a bookseller named john nourse , with whom voltaire seems to have maintained some contact through his geneva printers , the cramers this international connection has one surprising consequence we know from surviving documents that the text of candide was first set in type in geneva in january 1759 a copy was then dispatched to nourse in london for reprinting and distribution to the frenchreading english market the original was followed closely , and the two editions indeed look much the same each has 299 pages , and each has a leafy ornament on the title page with a little post horn sticking out at the top if one puts the two side by side it is not hard to see differences in typeface and layout , but superficially the resemblance is close but there is a catch voltaire , like many an author before and since , made some lastminute changes after his text had already been sent off to england as a result the two editions are not , after all , quite the same the most notable difference occurs on page 242 , where the london printings have a paragraph beginning , candide etait afflige this passage goes on to speak in a rather critical way of contemporary german poets and has been interpreted as an oblique attack on frederick the great , the homosexual autocrat of prussia with whom voltaire had a long and involved intellectual relationship voltaire apparently had second thoughts about this paragraph , and it does not appear in any surviving copy of the geneva edition only the london printings remain as testimony to his first intentions the 1759 english translations are from the london text , and somewhere in england there may survive a copy of the frenchlanguage geneva edition in its unrevised state this would be a very valuable little object indeed exactly what it would be worth is anyone s guess 50 , 000 \?
fort lauderdale , fla , march 1 picture this breezes brushing gently off the atlantic , sailboats cruising the intracoastal waterway , bikinied bathers frolicking along the beaches and joggers soaking up the afternoon sun if it s springtime , this must be baseball season so where is everybody \? if you must know , on day 15 of baseball s lockout , tim leary went fishing , wayne tolleson removed trees along the side of his house , claudell washington ran his rottweiler , barry lyons bowled and tim teufel , well , he went to disney world this is no way to run spring training , but with camps locked tightly again , there is little players can do but wait and enjoy their imposed vacations thoughts of baseball diminish for some , though , the longer the lockout , the harder it is to think about the game i think about it less and less , said washington , the california angels' veteran outfielder i 've played 17 years and i 've been through a lot of these wars you get tired of it , tired of hassling over petty stuff everybody is making money and we 're arguing over stuff that seems petty , at least in my mind they wait , and they try to make the best of it i have mixed feelings , steve sax , the yankee second baseman , said from sacramento , calif i built a new home , so this gives me a chance to spend more time in it and i love the extra time i can be with my family on the other hand , there s a part of me that wants to go and play baseball i love the game it s not something i have control over it s just in me it s a sad thing that we ca n't be out there getting in uniform , making some plays and swinging bats what do they do \? most are spending significant portions of their days working out , but there are still enough hours left to be husbands and fathers plenty of work for tolleson my wife s got a 'honeydo' list that s about 15 yards long , tolleson , the yankee infielder , said stuff like cleaning up here and there , making some additions to the house , having some trees removed , putting down a new sidewalk it s a different feeling to be home now you ask them if this is good , if the time at home is so enjoyable that they do not really miss baseball invariably , you hear this i 'd much rather be at spring training , said lance mccullers , the yankee pitcher , who was doing dishes at his tampa , fla , home when the phone rang i want to be with the guys , getting ready for the season you find yourself thinking more about it because you 've never been home at this time a typical day for leary , the new yankee starter who lives in the pacific palisades section of los angeles up by 8 , feed the youngest of his two daughters , work out at a nearby gym , play golf or fish the same things i 've been doing all winter , he said being home is a luxury , but for me , spring training has never been that exciting anyway i could do most of the things at home something he also did at home was hook a great white shark , although it was caught in late december , long before owners took a bite out of spring training with their lockout the 6foot , 124pound shark was landed off santa monica bay , where two of leary s friends also caught sharks the next day we could have eaten it , leary said , but i'm having it mounted instead it s a onceinalifetime thing there are n't many great whites caught on a rod and reel washington , the former yankee , keeps later hours than leary but does almost as much at his home in orinda , calif he said he is up by noon , does some light weight lifting , shoots the basketball , takes a run with the fivemonthold rottweiler he gave to his son , then i wait for the troops to come home he has shot pool with rickey henderson and is also putting in a hardwood floor in the upstairs hallway of his home but i 'd just as soon be in spring training , he said you can work out at home , but it s hard to get the same drive you get being around the guys idle time grates on teufel without question , there is something missing in florida when there is no baseball teufel , the met infielder , migrated south with his family in early february , visited relatives and took his children to disney world but lately , there is less to do and less to keep him occupied it s had its benefits , being able to go to the movies or go out to dinner , he said there s definitely a lot more free time , but i 'd rather be busy the majority of us would rather have something to do rather than find something to do the days down here do n't go by as fast as when you 're home i'm staying up later at night waiting for espn to come on so i can find out what s happening on the talks the pace is definitely slower in faraway sacramento , sax said he was considering conducting a minicamp with several players who live in the area , including lloyd moseby and dion james he has already been throwing and hitting in a batting cage with his brother , dave , a yankee farmhand but no matter what you do , sax said , there s no substitute for spring training you want to be in the stadium , around other players your mindset is different tolleson , who has occasionally visited the college near his spartanburg , sc , home to find battingpractice pitchers , said it s a whole different level , a different mentality , being in camp here , you just try to keep an edge and not fall too far behind you do what you can but you ca n't just jump into a game somewhere mostly , there is nothing more than busy time spent between news updates on the lockout workouts , whether they are done individually or in groups , cannot match the intensity of spring camp routine \? there is none golf and bowling i work out when i can , said barry lyons , the met catcher i play golf , i spend time with my fiancee we might go bowling tonight there s no routine i pretty much prepared myself to be ready to go to spring training for five or six weeks , and now everything is up in the air i'm at a crossroads as far as what to do exactly i wish everything was as it is year in and year out , but it s not so i'm making do the best i can that means stretching , running , lifting , playing catch , although the mets who were at the team s port st lucie camp decided to call off their informal workouts this week but they have kept one activity going pickup basketball somewhere , frank cashen is flinching photo mets' davey johnson playing golf at port st lucie , fla , something he said he never thought he would be doing at this time of year \( associated press \)
there is a nineyearold photo hanging in the lobby at playwrights horizons that shows a jubilant scene from march of the falsettos , the off broadway celebration of the unfettered gay existence written by william finn and directed by james lapine there , on the wall , frozen in midsong , are the youthful gottasing gottadance faces of stephen bogardus , michael rupert and chip zien , the play s lead actors what you can say about that picture is that nine years is a very long time ago , mr bogardus said on a recent afternoon as he , mr rupert and mr zien sat in an empty office in the theater at 416 west 42d street in manhattan they have all recreated their characters in the sequel to that show , falsettoland , also written by mr finn and directed by mr lapine the musical has been highly praised by critics for its tragicomic energy , its intricate lyrics and exuberant music the show s run has been extended through aug 12 , and there is talk of a move to another theater , which would keep the production running into the fall always with laughter we 're nine years older , and we 've all grown up , mr bogardus continued , speaking slowly and seriously well , all but chip , he said , deadpan suddenly the three actors began laughing , mr zien most energetically of all falsettoland is that kind of play , where somber moments lead to uninhibited laughter it is the third installment of mr finn s marvin trilogy , which began in 1978 with in trousers , the play that told the story of young marvin s search for selfdiscovery and his sexual awakening with both men and women in march of the falsettos , the second play in the series , marvin , played by mr rupert , left his wife and son for a lover named whizzer , played by mr bogardus meanwhile , his wife took up with marvin s psychiatrist , mendel , played by mr zien a strange illness in falsettoland , marvin , whizzer and mendel have returned they are busily engaged in a witty musicalcomedy battle over the bar mitzvah of marvin s son , jason , played by danny gerard but the year is 1981 marvin s lover is stricken with a mysterious disease in this play , as in the real new york of the time , the appearance of that malady , which we now know to be aids , inevitably changes everything it s astounding , how naive we all were then , mr zien said none of the three actors remember talking about aids during the 10month run of march of the falsettos , although the disease had already begun to spread not only were we naive , but so were the characters , he added in the first show , we were all neurotics screaming at each other some of what we sang was a glorification of passion and sex , with no inhibitions in falsettoland , which takes place a short time after march of the falsettos ends , it s amazing how dramatic the change for these characters has been , in just a few months , he said their worlds are totally turned around he shook his head it s been a very sobering nine years changes in life and onstage the characters are mellower this time around , and so are we , mr rupert said we 're all a little older and hopefully a little wiser mr rupert is 38 years old now mr bogardus is 36 , and mr zien is in his late 30 s , he said we 're much better actors now , mr bogardus said we 've been more demanding of the director and writer this time around , when the lyrics did n't seem to be working , we 'd just pounce on bill , he said of mr finn i guess we demanded more nine years is a long time i went through one marriage , and now i'm in my second marriage mr zien said my first child was only 16 months old when i was doing 'march' now we have a second daughter , and life is in a very different place when he was in march , mr rupert said , i was writing 'three guys naked from the waist down' that off broadway play opened in 1985 , and mr rupert then composed the music for another show , the broadway musical mail he has also worked as a director in the intervening years , the actors' lives have intertwined professionally both mr zien and mr rupert auditioned for the role of charlie in the la jolla \( calif \) playhouse reworking of stephen sondheim s merrily we roll along mr zien won the part , but that version of the show did not come to broadway mr zien and mr rupert also auditioned for another role , that of oscar in sweet charity mr rupert got the part , and when it came to broadway , mr rupert won a 1986 tony award for featured actor in a musical 'a kind of shorthand' even after a nineyear hiatus , it was as if we 'd never stopped working together , mr bogardus said by now we use a kind of shorthand , working together we almost do n't need to talk about things but all of us are so much more established now much more was at stake we all felt we did n't want to be involved in something that could crash and burn in 1981 , their careers were just taking flight since then , mr zien created the roles of the baker in into the woods and marty sterling , the doctor in is n't it romantic he played otto kringelein in grand hotel on broadway , and even supplied the voice of howard the duck in the movie of the same name mr rupert , in addition to his

his wife , susan pilarre , a former dancer at the new york city ballet , teaches at the school of american ballet all of us have been moved by the show , he added mr rupert said i think we needed to have nine years go by before we could deal with aids in this way a commitment to one another the fact that the three are appearing together again was pure serendipity , mr bogardus said all juggled other projects so they could commit to the production none of us wanted to do the show unless the others were there too , he said why did they agree to try on nineyearold personas again \? how often , in musical theater , do you get a chance to deal with material like this that has so many levels , and how often do you get wonderful music like this \? mr rupert responded i think it s a show that needs to be seen and i do n't think i ever felt that about a show before of course , it does give you an incongruous feeling after all that s happened through the years , here i am , still in the same corduroy coat and same khaki pants you think , 'what have i really done with my life that i'm doing this again \? ' but of course , there is an answer to that i think we all got involved with this because we loved the idea of doing it mr zien added it does sound really corny but that s what it is a labor of love photo chip zien , michael rupert and stephen bogardus in falsettoland \( jack manning the new york times \)

san francisco , aug 23 reversing a recommendation made last year , a fivejudge panel appointed by chief justice william h rehnquist today called for allowing television , radio and photographic coverage of civil proceedings in federal courts in an experiment such coverage , prohibited for more than 40 years since the sensational coverage of the lindbergh kidnapping trial , would give the television viewing public its first chance to see cases involving constitutional interpretation and federal law the recommendation of the panel , headed by federal district judge robert f peckham of san francisco , will be considered sept 12 at a meeting of the united states judicial conference , which sets policy for the 13 appeals courts and 94 trial courts that make up the federal court system nationwide the judicial conference , a 26judge committee headed by chief justice rehnquist , is expected to follow the recommendation , experts say , although it is not bound to optimistic about proposal i'm sure they will accept it , said representative robert w kastenmeier , a wisconsin democrat who is the chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on courts , intellectual property and the adminstration of justice mr kastenmeier , an advocate for cameras in the court , had implored the panel to reconsider its original position he praised the group today for laying out a detailed blueprint for a threeyear experiment the experiment would not include coverage of criminal proceedings , also prohibited for more than 40 years , because only congress can revise the federal rules that govern criminal cases the decision of the judicial conference also has no direct bearing on the united states supreme court , which sets its own rules and is not expected to introduce cameras anytime soon they 'll decide when they decide to decide , said toni house , a spokesperson for the high court similar to tests in states the coverage proposed by the panel is similar to experiments in various states at present , 44 states permit cameras in their courts , to varying degrees the experiment in federal courts , if approved , would begin in 1991 in as many as two circuit courts and as many as six trial courts , chosen by the panel from those who volunteer , and would follow these guidelines the experiment would begin on june 1 , 1991 , and end june 30 , 1994 it would be monitored by the federal judicial center , with a report to the judicial conference by mid1994 the presiding judge would have wide discretion to refuse requests from news group to cover certain cases or make cameras off limits when certain witnesses were testifying one television camera and one still photographer , with one camera , would be allowed at trials a second television camera would be permitted at appellate proceedings the camera equipment would have to be free of news organization insignias and produce no distracting sound or light , thus disqualifying motorized drives , flashes and the like camera operators would be required to wear appropriate business attire camera positions would be designated by the judge , and there would be no modifications of existing courtroom sound or light systems without judicial approval all expenses would be borne by the news organizations , and the court would not mediate disputes about pooling arrangements , whereby organizations decide whose cameras will be present in its report , the panel said it remained unpersuaded that it would be appropriate to drop all restrictions of federal court proceedings , but decided an experiment was in order after considering advice from several quarters of the five members of the panel only james c cacheris , a federal district judge from alexandria , va , did not endorse the experiment judge cacheris was on vacation today and did not respond to messages left with his law clerk judge peckham , the chairman , said through a spokesman that he was not going to make any comments at this time about the report or the reasons for the panel s changing its earlier position in its report , the panel said it had been influenced by petitions from news groups by a letter from mr kastenmeier , who told them the time has come and by a letter from chief justice rehnquist , written to the wisconsin congressman and sent to the panel , which said the chief justice was by no means averse to an experiment among the groups petitioning the panel was a consortium of 17 news organizations , which included the four major television networks , the new york times , the washington post and the associated press another key voice was that of steven brill of the american trial network , a 24hour cable television network owned by time warner inc , which expects to begin broadcasting early next year news consortium 'delighted' timothy b dyk , the lawyer for the consortium , said his group was delighted by the report mr dyk said the proposed experiment was well designed and included a larger number of courts than the consortium had proposed when it made a presentation to the panel last spring mr brill , during the panel s reconsideration , provided the five judges with a 100page analysis of state experiments with cameras in the courts , accompanied by two cartons of supporting documents none of the states allowing cameras in the courts have reported significant difficulties , and all of those that completed experiments have since moved to permanent camera coverage mr brill and others predicted that a federal experiment would have the same results , converting those judges or lawyers who remained skeptical it will be shown to be harmless and a great benefit to public knowledge , mr brill said with a 24hour cable network about to be started , mr brill would appear to be a major beneficiary of the panel s decision he said today , the program plan assumed no federal cameras and we did n't hang the whole thing on this lawyers who oppose the idea of cameras in federal court were concerned that the proposed experiment would open the way for changing the rules on criminal trials , including political and drug cases it is these more sensational cases , the opponents said , that would most likely be influenced by camera coverage , particularly television 'education value is zero' those sound bites reinforce the worst of people s preconceptions , said seth waxman , a washington lawyer who specializes in federal court litigation and heads the litigation section of the american bar association the education value is zero and it probably detracts from public understanding the approval of cameras in federal courts would surely build pressure on the supreme court judge rehnquist s willingness to see an experiment in the federal courts may signal openness to the idea for his own court in a recent public statement , justice anthony m kennedy said that the advent of cameras in the high court was inevitable on the other hand , justice sandra day o'connor has said such a decision should be made only by unanimous vote and at least one and possible several of the nine justices are thought to be staunchly opposed these are the other members of the panel judge john p moore of the united states court of appeals for the 10th circuit in denver federal district judge sam c pointer jr of birmingham , ala judge walter p stapleton of the court of appeals for the third circuit in wilmington , del
police work is portrayed on television more often than any other profession it has been that way since the cowboys rode off into the television sunset the difference now is that in a growing number of shows on television the police officers on the screen really carry guns , really chase drugdealers through the streets , really save people s lives real police officers and actors recreating their lives are the stars of three weekly television series and often appear together in two others one series that touches on police work , nbc s unsolved mysteries , \( wednesday at 8 \) is regularly among the toprated series in prime time another , cbs s rescue 911 , \( tuesday at 8 \) has increased steadily in popularity over the last year and is among that network s strongest programs a third , cbs s top cops , was so popular as a shortrun series over the summer that it has won a place in the network s regularseason primetime schedule , starting tomorrow night at 8 fox broadcasting carries the two other realitycop shows america s most wanted \( friday at 8 \) , which tracks criminals at large and is responsible for the arrests of over 100 criminals , and cops , \( saturday at 9 \) the most real of all the realitycop shows , a weekly tour of duty on the streets with police officers from various american cities a first for fox america s most wanted was the first fox show to gain a strong national following , and it continues to be successful though less so than the programs on the major networks the audience for cops has never been large , but it has always been extremely loyal people like reality , says arnold shapiro , the executive producer of rescue 911 they like heroes poeple also see a lot of real crime on television news , of course sonny grosso , the executive producer of top cops , says that has a lot to do with why they are tuning in to see the real police taking some real \( or at least recreated \) action people get inundated with all this harsh stuff on the news , says mr grosso they want to see the crimes solved they want to see that there are people out there doing something about all the criminality viewers have always liked police shows , and mr shapiro says they have become accustomed to seeing fictional police shows presented more realistically , especically in the years since hill street blues rewrote the policedrama genre 'french connection' connection mr grosso was a policeman in new york for more than 20 years he participated in the famous french connection drug case \( he was portrayed by roy scheider in the oscarwinning film , which started mr grosso s own career in show business \) he says , people have sparked to the more realistic police shows we 're just taking the reality one step further in top cops , actors recreate the story of a dramatic moment in the career of a real policemen or policewoman , who comments on the screen about what happened before , during and after the event rescue 911 uses some real videotape of rescue efforts by the police \( as well as fire and medical emergency personnel \) , along with recreations of rescues unsolved mysteries and america s most wanted follow similar formats , which focus on the crimes , the criminals and the victims and bring the real police in occasionally cops takes a straightforward , cinema verite approach , following the real police in action this week top cops , which had a sevenweek run this summer as an hourlong series on wednesday nights , makes the move to thursdays at 8 pm as a halfhour show cbs wants top cops to take the heat from the shootout between the cosby show and the simpsons in that time period mr grosso says he is feeling ambushed facing those two monsters , especially since in its last appearance on wednesday night , top cops , the summer series , easily beat two betterknown and much higherbudget shows about fictional police one was the longrunning hunter on nbc the other was the mostpublicized new series of the season , cop rock , on abc i find it confusing that they would move us , mr grosso says , and we may have to tone down our content at 8 o'clock but it s better than being canceled explaining the phenomenon the stopgap function partly explains the entire realitycop show phenomenon the networks have turned to them for a reason beyond the perceived public interest in the lives and work of real police officers these shows offer one other significant advantage they come cheap it always boils down to finances , mr grosso says , adding that top cops costs only about half the 400 , 000 to 500 , 000 that it takes to produce a network situation comedy , the standard format for a halfhour time slot and mr shapiro says rescue 911 costs only about half of the 900 , 000 to 1 million that is usually spent to produce a fictional police show all of the shows except unsolved mysteries were generated by the networks' inhouse production units as cheap solutions to problem time periods another benefit , the producers say , is the socially positive contributions the realitycop shows can make both unsolved mysteries and america s most wanted keep tallies of the crimes they have directly helped solve most wanted gained widespread national attention when its account of the john list case , in which a new jersey bookkeeper murdered his entire family and then became a fugitive for 18 years , led directly to his arrest and conviction mr shapiro keeps a record of lives that he says have been saved because of rescue procedures shown on rescue 911 \( the total is now 38 , he says \) supporting the system beyond that , mr shapiro says , his program offers proof that the system can work well he acknowledged that rescuers often make mistakes , but none of those turn up on rescue 911 the positive outcome is crucial to our show , he says i think that s how we 're different from 'cops , ' on fox , which is a show i personally like but at the end of 'cops' you 're often depressed by what the cops do and see you 're never depressed at the end of 'rescue' by the time each of our stories in finished , you really like somebody , whether it s the rescuer or the victim or both stephen chao , the fox executive who brought cops to television , says his show s strength is its strong emotional content i am emotionally more moved by what i see on 'cops' than i am on any scripted police show top cops , like rescue 911 , has a heromaking goal the police save wouldbe suicides , get into shootouts with drug dealers , are wounded in the line of duty you see a shootout on our show and the cop is shot in the face and you know it really happened , mr grosso says and at the end you see that person alive , and it s a shock mr grosso says his show has one other socially redeeming purpose convincing people that they should cooperate with the police if we can get people to have more faith in the police , we can take the streets back from these bums photo a scene from rescue 911 , one of cbs s strongest programs \( cbs \)
washington , may 15 the cochairmen of the knight foundation commission on intercollegiate athletics said today that the 22member panel would likely press for more liberal allowances for recruits , the abolition of athletic dormitories and an end to offseason tournaments for prep basketball players the cochairmen the rev theodore hesburgh , president emeritus of notre dame , and william friday , president emeritus of the university of north carolina system also criticized the increasing harvest of college undergraduates by professional football and basketball they met with reporters after the commission had spent two days hearing from 17 of the nation s premier college basketball and football coaches none of the coaches attended the press briefing hesburgh said the coaches had proposed a major change in recruiting rules , barring coaches from even talking to high school students who do n't show academic promise for college meaning at least a 20 , or c grade average in 11 key courses the idea , proposed by the notre dame basketball coach , digger phelps , won immediate support on the panel and among other coaches on hand , hesburgh said we 're hearing a lot of static about athletic dorms , which take the kids out of the normal college experience and put them over there like a bunch of freaks , hesburgh said my guess is we 're probably going to be coming out against that while the panel remains opposed to paying student athletes , we 're not against helping these kids , hesburgh said some of the rules now are silly , he added for example , he said , athletes should be entitled to receive expenses to go home for regular vacations or for personal emergencies , such as a death in the family and he said it would cost peanuts to keep them in decent clothing some of these kids ca n't afford a decent coat , hesburgh said we dress up the olympic team , and i think every school ought to be able to dress up their kids hesburgh said the commission hoped to meet in june with commissioners of the national football league and the national basketball association he said we ought to say to them , 'you should think long and hard before you start enticing people to leave school before their education is completed' hesburgh noted that 30 juniors , including the heisman trophy winner andre ware of houston , had quit school this year to make themselves available to the nfl , and only 10 were claimed that means that 20 youngsters now ca n't go back and take up intercollegiate athletics , he said , because they 're no longer eligible , and they 've got no hope of getting a degree unless they go back and pay for it , which many of those youngsters have no money to do that is n't a very salutary effect on the lives of those 20 youngsters hesburgh said the commission was pointing toward fundamental change not nitpicky things in the rules for college sports , with its final report to the national collegiate athletic association and the nation likely next march among issues yet unresolved , he said , was the question of freshman eligibility , an end to which was proposed monday by the penn state football coach , joe paterno friday said there was a split down the middle on that one
why is this weekend on broadway different from all other weekends \? because three tony award winners are closing , two of them prematurely by industry standards the grapes of wrath , the best play winner of 1990 , which will have played 188 performances , and jerome robbins s broadway , the best musical winner of 1989 , which will have played 634 performances , are both surrendering to high running costs , their producers say the closing of the heidi chronicles , the best play and pulitzer prize winner of 1989 , is less surprising it will have run 621 performances on broadway , many more than most plays do nowadays what wo n't be different this weekend is that while the big award winners are folding around it , black and blue , the jazz revue that lost the 1989 best musical tony to jerome robbins s broadway , keeps on running at the minskoff theater , where it will have played 675 performances by sept 1 but when you compare its boxoffice grosses to those of other broadway musicals , you find that practically every other show , jerome robbins included , does consistently better business than black and blue what s its secret \? reasonable running costs , according to norman rothstein , the show s general manager and equally important , it has what neither grapes nor jerome robbins ever had strong word of mouth from a target audience that has been painstakingly and successfully developed , which in this case means tourists , especially nonenglishspeaking tourists two pluses no words , no plot a major reason for its attraction to foreign visitors is that , like dancin' and sophisticated ladies , black and blue has no spoken dialogue or anything even resembling a story line it is a revue , featuring jazz classics like st louis blues , everybody loves my baby , and , of course , black and blue , sung by the veteran singers linda hopkins , lavern baker and carrie smith , and tapped by oldtime dancers like bunny briggs and as mr rothstein points out , europeans have traditionally been more sophisticated and better educated about jazz than americans still , the show did n't catch on immediately when it opened in january 1989 , it had almost no advance marilynn levine , the associate producer and press agent for the musical , recalled the other day that none of the huge theater parties that account for many large advance sales were interested in black and blue they did n't know what it was , she said , and they were put off because it did n't have a star the reviews for the show , which were mixed , did little to help forty percent of the theater critics did n't understand the show , ms levine said to americans , revues have come to mean las vegas , even though it is a respected form everywhere else in the world the producers decided to fight by committing money for an extensive advertising campaign to establish an identity for their show they also started conducting market research surveys at the theater to determine who their audience really was what they learned was that while most broadway shows have an audience that s onethird from new york city , onethird from what is called the suburban ring and onethird from outside the region altogether , an overwhelming 70 percent of the audience for black and blue was from outside the new york metropolitan area and half of that 70 percent were foreign visitors ads placed overseas it was not too much of a surprise black and blue was originally produced at the chatelet theater in paris in 1985 , where it had a successful run claudio segovia and hector orrezolli , who conceived and directed the show and designed its sets and costumes , had already had an international success with tango argentino , another revue that relied on dancing and music rather than on plot what followed was an emphasis on selling the show abroad we immediately went into foreign language publications with our ads , mr rothstein said and after discovering that of our foreign audience , between 75 percent and 10 percent were asian , which we guessed meant primarily japanese , we started advertising on the japanese cable station called ohayo new york , and went into any number of japanese tourist guides we also went into every international carrier s inflight magazine , and very heavily into all the hotel publications the show was also helped enormously , its producers believe , by the telecast of the tony awards on june 4 , 1989 black and blue had been nominated for 10 awards when the cast performed on the show , their segment , with its energetic dancing and glitzy costumes , played exceptionally well the revue had been virtually guaranteed at least one tony award because its major competitor , jerome robbins s broadway was ruled ineligible for a best choreography award since its dances had already been seen on broadway but ruth brown also won a tony as best actress in a musical and black and blue picked up a third tony , for best costumes there s no question that the tony show made us , mr rothstein said our advance doubled in the week afterward and half doubled again
moscow , may 22 movement toward compromise on the baltic republics' campaign for independence stopped today , as lithuania rejected demands to suspend its declaration of independence and president mikhail s gorbachev warned all three baltic republics that they must abide by soviet law lithuanian legislators voted in principle today to suspend important laws enacted since the republic declared independence on march 11 , as soon as moscow agrees to begin negotiations parliament is expected to formally approve the text of a resolution on wednesday , but none of the variations being considered includes any mention of freezing the declaration itself , and members of parliament confirmed that such action had been ruled out mr gorbachev has demanded that lithuania place a moratorium on its declaration as a condition for beginning talks with moscow about independence , and it seems unlikely that he will be satisfied by a move that puts a hold only on independence laws the soviet leader had a brief and tense conversation today with the president of latvia , anatolijs gorbunovs , and the president of estonia , arnold ruutel , and reaffirmed his intention to deal toughly with all three baltic republics in their quest to leave the soviet union mr gorbachev confirmed his demand to the three baltic states to abolish their decisions on independence , mr ruutel told the estonian news service tonight he also described the 20minute conversation as unpleasant for both sides , people who spoke with him said the kremlin and the baltic republics seemed to have struck more conciliatory tones toward one another during a visit by secretary of state james a baker 3d to moscow last week during the baker visit , mr gorbachev met with prime minister kazimiera prunskiene of lithuania after the republic s parliament proposed suspending independence legislation passed since its decision to break from the soviet union advice from baker american and lithuanian officials indicated that mr baker had encouraged mrs prunskiene to make some concession on the declaration itself , telling her that freezing the act did not amount to revoking it but in today s debate , only a handful of lithuanian legislators proposed suspending the declaration and the vast majority agreed that there was no way to tamper with the independence declaration without leaving the republic vulnerable to moscow let us be honest , kazimieras moteika , deputy chairman of the lithuanian parliament , told the legislators today having chosen the road of independence , we must be firm and remember that we will not veer off it lithuanian officials said that the resolution being debated differs from the proposal brought to moscow last week by mrs prunskiene in that parliament now says it is not only willing to , but in fact will suspend independence laegislation when moscow confirms that talks are to begin the lithuanian decision was made despite the worsening effects of an economic blockade imposed by moscow on the renegade republic more than a month ago deputy prime minister algirdas brazauskas announced today that , as a result of a continuing soviet embargo on fuel , stricter gasoline rationing would go into effect on wednesday hardships ahead describing lithuania as being in a crisis situation , mr brazauskas said gasoline would be allotted only to ambulances , police and food transport vehicles fuel for public transportation will be cut back , he said , and for private vehicles will be cut off the new measures will put about 23 , 000 drivers out of work , doubling the number of people who have been laid off from their jobs since the economic sanctions were first instituted , a spokesman for the lithuanian parliament said officials also said that hot water to homes would be reduced by friday because of the fuel shortages and that power to most industries might have to be cut by the end of the week , although medical and food enterprises will continue to be served most of the republic s apartment buildings are served by a central hotwater pumping station , officials said , adding that for the time being , those buildings that heat their own water with natural gas will not be affected in his conversation with mrs prunskiene last week , mr gorbachev threatened to broaden the economic blockade against lithuania if the republic failed to comply with his demand to suspend its declaration of independence the parliaments of latvia and estonia tried to avoid a similar confrontation with moscow , by voting for transitional periods to independence after lithuania had voted for a clean break with moscow so far , the kremlin has not imposed any sanctions against latvia and estonia , but mr gorbachev has condemned both republics' actions as illegal and today repeated his warning that the only way any republic can leave the country is through a new law on secession recently adopted by the soviet parliament

as carnegie hall prepares to open its centennial season wednesday night , there may be no better moment to toast not only the health of the dowager queen of american concert halls but the durable values she typifies carnegie was designed according to an ancient and honorable esthetic that increasingly shows signs of returning to fashion it is primarily a place to listen to specific kinds of music \( classical is the inexact but useful word \) in a civilized atmosphere by design and in practice a hall best suited for symphony orchestras , it survives and thrives as a rebuke to the allpurpose auditoriums that sprang up all across america a generation ago and that still disfigure the musical landscape a couple of decades ago it all appeared so simple our symphony halls and opera houses , like the musical institutions they housed , were done for their counterparts in past centuries , we were reminded , had bowed to historical imperatives and disappeared or changed almost beyond recognition why should the 20th century be any different \? it was not really a chilling prospect for most of us that the american concert hall would in time be one with nineveh and tyre probably no one but antiquarians , after all , would think it useful to mourn the loss of the athenian agora , the roman arena or the esterhaza music room gathering places that helped define the societies that produced them but whose time is long and irretrievably past churches , which gave birth to concert halls , do survive in some recognizable form but churches too are all but finished as creative music centers they can hardly pretend to be the artistic force they were in palestrina s or bach s time , or even in bruckner s but change rarely comes fast enough for those who yearn for apocalypse now pierre boulez , annoyed that the world was taking its time about embracing his music and adopting the drastic esthetic changes that he and fellow avantgardists espoused , once suggested blowing up all the major opera houses as the best solution to the problem other advanced thinkers of the time predicted that artists of the future would not be caught dead in a traditionally configured concert hall , but would be out in the streets improvising happenings for the arthungry masses amplification , video and other technical wonders were already making this expansion of the tribal village possible one particularly visionary composer dramatized his alienation from the traditional concert venues by performing his electronic works under water in a swimming pool more temperately , leonard bernstein , stepping down as music director of the new york philharmonic , pondered in print whether the symphony orchestra a creature born in the 18th century and surviving in the 20th like an appendix could have any future faced with that somber question from a distinguished valedictorian , the concerned reader logically had to question whether there continued to be a need for the buildings that housed these cultural anachronisms not likely obviously , rethinking was in order and so , reflecting a social outlook increasingly receptive to gordianknot solutions , cultural movers and shakers all across the nation went into action in new york , the shabby but historic old metropolitan opera house was torn down and replaced in the mid60 s by a glassy faced xanadu at lincoln center carnegie hall itself was reprieved from death row in the 1960 only through the lastminute efforts of isaac stern and a few other doughty and appalled citizens , with results that most sensible people now applaud but that at the time were far from certain with lemminglike determination , cities of every size and cultural condition also began to abandon their old but viable halls and theaters in favor of erecting performing arts centers in apparent response to the lincoln center model the central feature of these complexes was usually a bleakly utilitarian auditorium capable of seating half the town meant to suit a variety of performance types , it typically satisfied none the ideal architect of the period , it seemed , was one who could design an acoustically dead hall for symphony audiences in which 5 , 000 or 10 , 000 popmusic customers also could be comfortably accommodated and a ballet dancer s toes were clearly visible from all seats civic planners and politicians , as the joke went , were in the grip of an edifice complex inevitably , as it now seems , a few thoughtful community leaders began to react against this frenzy for piling up concrete and marble in the name of the arts unsuspected or forgotten qualities began to be discovered in timeworn music halls and theaters in chicago the monumental auditorium theater , the work of frank lloyd wright s student louis sullivan , was painstakingly restored after decades of lying in ruin \( during world war ii , its main floor had served as a bowling alley for servicemen \) ornate movie houses , abandoned in the wake of the television revolution , were rescued from the wreckers and remodeled for orchestras and other performance organizations the detroit symphony s 71yearold orchestra hall , abandoned for half a century and saved from destruction only in 1970 , was restored just the other day to its original appearance and function st louis , long in need of a home for its orchestra , refurbished a handsome old movie palace and renamed it powell symphony hall the same strategy was followed in new orleans and elsewhere
du pont announced yesterday that it would design four plants to produce refrigeration chemicals that do not endanger the earth s ozone layer , but said it was continuing to delay a commitment to produce another family of compounds that would have a different use the company said the decision to build the plants put it among the leaders in the production of environmentally friendly refrigerants these commercial facilities would be among the first to produce worldscale quantities of nonozone depleting alternatives , said joseph p glas , director of the freon products division of e i du pont de nemours company freon is du pont s trade name for current refrigeration compounds both groups of chemicals are intended to replace the most widely used refrigerants , known as chlorofluorocarbons , or cfc s the chlorine in cfc s that escapes to the atmosphere has been identified by scientists as the principal agent responsible for the thinning of the ozone layer because the ozone shields the earth from harmful solar rays that can cause skin cancer and disrupt the food chain , most industrial nations have agreed to phase out the use of the cfc s by 2000 more than two billion pounds of the chemicals are used annually worldwide , a third of them in the united states they are also used in insulation and as cleaning agents in electronics the company said the new plants would produce four types of hydrofluorocarbons , or hfc s , for use in automotive airconditioners , home refrigerators and commercial refrigeration equipment the new compounds contain no chlorine and are therefore not expected to pose a threat to the ozone layer when they become operational , between 1992 and 1995 , the plants will have the capacity to produce 140 million pounds of refrigerants annually , which the company said could supply most worldwide refrigeration needs through the end of the century the plants will be in corpus christi , tex louisville , ky dordrecht , the netherlands , and chiba , japan du pont said it was holding back on plans to expand production of a third group of chemicals , known as hydrochlorofluorocarbons , pending passage of the revised clean air act hcfc s , as they are known , have been scheduled to replace cfc s in the roughly 75 percent of applications where hfc s are not suitable among the cfc applications where hfc s will not work are as refrigerants in large industrial chilling equipment and in the production of insulating foams , du pont officials said hcfc s have much less ozonedepleting potential than cfc s , but they do contain chlorine as a result , some environmental advocates have called for their use to be phased out soon after cfc s are eliminated in the next century big producers like du pont have said the hcfc ban should not take effect until 2030 , to allow it and makers of equipment using the chemicals to recoup their investments in equipment to make and use the compounds but an amendment to the senate version of the clean air act revision would ban their use by 2015 mr glas said large chilling units that cool office buildings and hospitals have an economic life of up to 40 years anyone buying equipment designed for hcfc s could face a shortage of refrigerant long before the equipment was scheduled to be retired chemical industry executives have argued that the use of hcfc s is necessary for a quick phasing out of cfc s and they have warned that if hcfc s are banned too soon , developing countries may continue to use the more dangerous cfc s , to the detriment of the ozone layer , until environmentally benign alternatives are found redesign necessary phasing out cfc s means redesigning all equipment that uses them as a refrigerant fluid none of the proposed alternatives can be used in machines designed for cfc s mr glas said du pont , which is one of the world s largest producers of cfc s , is working with manufacturers to assure that substitute fluids deliver adequate performance he said domestic automobiles with noncfc airconditioners would probably be available toward the end of next year the substitute would be an hfc compound designated hfc134a du pont said that by the end of the year it will have invested 240 million in research and capital spending on cfc replacements it said total expenditures by the end of the century could total more than 1 billion
it s rare when a team gets the better of two other teams in a trade it s unheard of for a team to get the better of two other teams in a trade when one of the other teams was n't even involved in the trade the seattle mariners can make that claim , one year after , because the montreal expos gave them three pitchers for mark langston , then lost him as a free agent , and the california angels gave langston 16 million and he is n't pitching as well as the young pitchers collectively have for the mariners the minnesota twins ca n't boast of having taken the mets in their major 1989 pitching trade because frank viola has been the mets' savior and the mets did n't need the pitchers they gave the twins but the twins have emerged from the trade with a highly effective closing relief pitcher and the kind of promising young starters the mariners acquired from the expos we have to feel very good about the trade , woody woodward , the mariners' general manager , said we 've got all three pitchers on the big club and they have been productive they all have a chance to be very effective pitchers faced with the impossible task of signing langston , woodward traded him to the expos a year ago the expos , thinking langston could clinch a division championship for them , gave up randy johnson , brian holman and gene harris langston won 10 of his first 13 decisions for montreal but lost 6 of his last 8 then he signed with the angels , leaving the expos with nothing from the trade but an empty spot in their rotation and an empty feeling in their stomach this season langston has matched the angels' disappointing start he has a 34 record and a 357 earned run average , completing none of his eight starts and struggling with his control he has walked more batters than he is accustomed to \( 29 \) and he has struck out fewer \( 42 \) , giving him a 1451 strikeouttowalk ratio , not very good holman , a 25yearold righthander , has twice as many victories as langston \( 62 , 347 \) johnson , 26 and lefthanded , has the same number \( 32 , 439 \) holman knows he belongs , and every time he goes out there he s confident he can win the game , woodward said randy needs to have more consistent control , and harris needs to become more comfortable coming out of the bullpen harris , a 25yearold righthander , was a starter until last season in seven relief appearances this season before last night he had an 01 record and a 715 era rick aguilera has no comfort problem in the minnesota bullpen he has adapted to the job as easily as dennis eckersley did when he made a midcareer change three years ago , shedding his starting job for a relief role with oakland aguilera had 11 saves and a 165 era before last night he s been terrific , andy macphail , the twins' general manager , said that s a tough role to fill we thought we were getting three starters in the deal we needed starters but aguilera also was a hedge if we were unable to sign jeff reardon the twins did not resign reardon , who moved to boston , but aguilera , 28 , is six years younger and has been equally effective in trading viola , the twins also received kevin tapani \( 26 , righthanded \) , david west \( 25 , lefthanded \) , tim drummond \( 25 , righthanded \) and jack savage \( 26 , righthanded \) savage is in the minor leagues , but the other three are in the twins' rotation drummond made his first start last friday and pitched against the yankees last night he entered the game with a 286 era tapani has a 53 record , and until baltimore battered him tuesday night , he had a 279 era it now is 391 west has a 23 record and 468 era it s kind of the perfect deal , macphail said of the trade everybody got what they wanted they needed the big starting pitcher and they got it we needed quantity and we feel good about the quality we got the twins had only two established starters , viola and allan anderson , and decided on july 31 to give up viola and his hefty contract for a group of young pitchers viola did n't produce for the mets last year \( 55 \) , but all is forgiven he has a 71 record and a 166 era power explosions mickey tettleton , last season s surprise slugger with 26 home runs , hit none in baltimore s first 33 games this season he then hit four in the next six games , entering last night s game eric anthony had also hit four in houston s last six games after not having hit any joe orsulak , tettleton s teammate , had hit one home run , then splurged with three in the last five games jose canseco of oakland has hit home runs all season , but he has picked up his pace recently after hitting 8 in the athletics' first 28 games , he had 7 in the next 10 going into last night s game on a reduced scale , tim wallach of montreal hit 4 in the expos' first 31 games , then erupted with 5 in the last 8 dale murphy of atlanta and lou whitaker of detroit have doubled their season outputs in recent days after hitting 3 home runs in the braves' first 34 games , murphy hit 3 in the last 3 whitaker slugged 3 in the tigers' first 37 games , then 3 in the last 4 carlton fisk had been shut out on home runs in the first 27 games the chicago white sox played , but then he hit two in a sevengame span both homers won games those individual efforts have been much more impressive than the team production of the texas rangers and the st louis cardinals entering last night s games , the rangers had hit 3 home runs in their last 12 games , the cardinals 3 in their last 11
to the editor none of the commentaries i have read on the sovietlithuanian crisis have mentioned some crucially important facts in december 1989 , alexander yakovlev , a senior adviser to mikhail s gorbachev , shed important light on the soviet position in on the political and legal assessment of the sovietgerman nonaggression treaty of 1939 , a report issued by the soviet governmentappointed commission of which mr yakovlev was chairman the report was accepted by the second congress of people s deputies , which issued a resolution on the political and legal assessment of the sovietgerman nonaggression treaty of 1939 the resolution was signed by president gorbachev here , one may be assured , is the official position on the lithuanian question as stated at the highest levels of the soviet government president gorbachev wrote during the conclusion of the treaty and its ratification it was concealed that a secret additional protocol was signed at the same time as the treaty he continued the protocol delineated the spheres of influence of the contracting parties from the baltic to the black sea , from finland to bessarabia the congress notes that at that time the soviet union s relations with latvia , lithuania and estonia were regulated by a system of treaties in keeping with the peace treaties signed in 1920 and the nonaggression treaties concluded in the period from 1926 to 1933 , their parties committed themselves to respect each other s sovereignty , territorial integrity and inviolability , regardless of circumstances the congress of people s deputies of the soviet union condemns the signing of the secret additional protocol' of aug 23 , 1939 , and the other secret agreements with germany the congress recognizes the secret protocols as illegal and invalid right from the moment of their signing the protocols did not create a new legal base for the soviet union s relations with third countries nevertheless , stalin and his associates used them to set forth ultimatums and put pressure on other states , in violation of their legal obligations before them seldom does one see politicians using such categorical language what this represents , i believe , is a very clear statement of president gorbachev s intentions on the three baltic states he named and , by inference , on other wouldbe independent states within the soviet union of course , the soviet president s intentions have stimulated rightwing , bureaucratic and military opposition , which he will have to placate temporarily but his longrange intentions are unmistakable , and it is this that the west should begin to take into account dwight james simpson professor of international relations san francisco state university san francisco , may 14 , 1990
as government agencies and private companies have struggled to serve more and more people who do not speak english , they have leaned hard on their bilingual employees for help now the employees are leaning back in a swelling tide of lawsuits , job grievances and contract demands , employees who say their foreignlanguage abilities bring them extra work are demanding extra pay from california beach towns to new york city , spanishspeaking police officers , teachers and hospital workers are pressing for bonus money , salary differentials and promotion points employees fighting the police department of tucson , ariz , for bilingual bonuses are heading for a trial in federal district court hispanic patrolmen just beginning a similar case in miami have threatened to selectively forget their spanish on the job a court ruling in favor of hispanic agents who charged the federal bureau of investigation with shunting them to undesirable spanishspeaking jobs has unleashed a stream of similar complaints against other federal lawenforcement agencies widely watch suit in west and from california s central valley has come a federal court suit that could have wide implications for the private sector backed by the equal employment opportunity commission and her union , paula soriano , a 58yearold telephone service representative , has charged that because she is the daughter of mexican parents and fluent in spanish her job duties have been made overwhelming her anglo coworkers , she says , have faced no such demands , and in fact have made money for the work she performed with them all of this , i think , is going to be the new frontier of equal protection and antidiscrimination legislation and litigation , said laurence h tribe , a professor of constitutional law at harvard law school it s a little surprising that there was n't more ferment along these lines before the rising demands are partly the product of earlier battles against discrimination of the job opportunities they helped to create , the pride they bolstered and the growing economic power they brought to ethnic minorities yet perhaps even more sharply than the lingering debate over bilingual education , the workplace dispute has brought into focus a basic issue of america s changing ethnic makeup to what extent will the ability to speak languages besides english come to be accepted as a valuable skill even among workers hired to do other jobs \? or will it simply be regarded as a product of cultural circumstance , to be used as circumstances require and meriting no special rewards \? new demands by consumers companies and government agencies have scrambled in recent years to service growing legions of nonenglishspeaking consumers yet for hispanic as well as other bilingual employees , a chasm remains between the fees commanded by a professional translator and the value assigned a stopgap interpreter into the gap have plunged thousands of bilingual nurses , dishwashers and secret service personnel who , in a pinch or out of habit , are called on to answer the telephone , write a letter , read a suspect his rights for monolingual colleagues it s a constant source of irritation for the bilingual workers , said ruben castillo , a chicago lawyer representing hispanic agents in a suit against the united states customs service virtually every level of government employee has talked to me about doing some kind of case for a shoe salesperson , the extra time spent helping coworkers might mean fewer commissions for lawenforcement officials and social workers , the result is often less time for their own cases and nothing to show for their efforts hispanic and asian rights advocates say the situation often begets a discriminatory pattern in which bilingual employees must work harder to qualify for promotions if their language skills become indispensable , they are sometimes kept in lowerlevel jobs dealing directly with the public regardless of their performance , the advocates contend extra pay rare in us although not unheard of in schools , police departments and social service agencies , especially in the southwest , extra pay for bilingual work is rare elsewhere in the country and in the private sector generally , employer associations say in the federal government , the first extensive foreignlanguage bonus policy is just being set up in the fbi and drug enforcement administration , two years after congress voted to allow them to pay agents differentials of up to 25 percent of their salaries for bilingual work legal experts say the mere handful of lawsuits now pending in court are less a measure of the problem s scope than test cases in a realm where laws are illdefined i would have absolutely no trouble filing 10 of these cases tomorrow if i had 10 lawyers to handle them , said jose roberto juarez jr of los angeles , who like mr castillo is a regional counsel for the mexicanamerican legal defense and educational fund really what they 're going to have to do is await the outcome of these cases impetus for the lawsuits the relatively few disputes that have reached the courts have been propelled by demographic and socioeconomic shifts of extraordinary speed
in design , luxury takes many forms at times , sheer grandeur has been the ideal , and we have fallen under the spell of rare woods , extravagant marbles and glimmering gold leaf in other , perhaps more spiritual , times , harmony and proportion have been valued more highly than costly materials but today , ask a resident of new york , london , tokyo or any highdensity city to define luxury , and the answer will be the same true luxury is more room in a sense , acquiring additional living space is simple pare down or move out yet for most people , limiting their possessions and heading off to wideopen acres is not an option , and so , having chosen to be urban , we must try to become urbane the past abounds in examples for centuries , great cities and fine houses have demonstrated how , in the race for space , ingenuity can overcome all consider , for example , the choice to build up rather than out manhattan may have the world s most famous skyscrapers , but new york is by no means the first city in which space constrictions have sent buildings soaring in san gimigniano , italy , a little town outside of siena , the fiercely competitive nobles of the early renaissance constructed evertaller towers , the only symbols of machismo they had room to build on plots that were the size of handkerchiefs the merchants of 17thcentury holland took a similar approach , but with a light and airy effect in haarlem and delft , their narrow , steeply gabled houses jostled cheerfully along the waterfront , having the plain walls , tiled floors and high windows we know so well from the paintings of vermeer and de hooch in their calm orderliness , these rooms suggested that we had all the space we could need , and all the time , too during the same era , louis xiv s courtiers built five and sixstory houses lining the quays of paris , with rooms opening off an enfilade of doorways , contrived to give the greatest suggestion of grandeur within a restricted compass this sort of intricacy in planning also characterized the jewel box , a detailed space geared to one individual s taste throughout history , connoisseurs and collectors have delighted in the fittingup of these little rooms , in which they could enjoy their most precious treasures these dens of art and curiosities ultimately gave rise to our great public museums , but in earlier centuries , they were intensely private spaces , dedicated to tranquillity and study like the studiolo , the often minuscule office library retreat of the renaissance prince , they offered a different kind of spaciousness an escape from the cares of the world through the gathering together of everything rare , refined and delightful in , for example , the duke of urbino s studiolo , intricate intarsia woodwork created in the 15th century features trompe l'oeil panels that depict cupboard doors half open , revealing shelves of scientific instruments , books , armor and other curiosities nearer our time and perhaps closer in scale are the spacesaving solutions of the designers and architects of the late 18th and early 19th centuries the georgian town house , for instance , was a model of rational arrangement though tall and narrow , it customarily had at least two good rooms on each of three , four , or five floors , comfortably accommodating a family and servants even at that time , however , houses were often subdivided , and in fashionable areas , smart bachelors would take a set of rooms , which often contained a folddown bed concealed by a dummy bookcase or disguised as a handsome mahogany bureau how much more elegant and livable these seem than the sleeping platforms often found in today s oneroom apartments in america , the shakers created a remarkable style of living based upon the efficient use of every inch of space they hung chairs on a line of pegs along a board on the wall , and gave every tool and article of clothing , along with their few personal possessions , its precisely allotted place their communal houses were skillfully planned to make them easy to clean and heat , and they were equipped throughout with handcrafted , utilitarian objects of great beauty and simple lines their austerely elegant furniture , for example , may have been based on the esthetic of the spacesaving builtin cupboards in the belowstairs servants' quarters of wealthy colonial america at a more fashionable level , thomas jefferson exercised almost limitless ingenuity in the planning of monticello , his great neoclassical house jefferson clearly delighted in his clever arrangements for storing and transporting household goods , such as a chimney piece that swings open to reveal a dumbwaiter for carrying wine from the cellar but most remarkable , in a house full of quirky touches , is the idiosyncratic layout of his own rooms placing his rather small bed in an open alcove between his bedroom and his study , for example , allowed him to get up in either room even jefferson s talent in planning spaces pales when measured against that of the great english regency architect sir john soane over a long period of building and collecting , soane transformed his london house in lincoln s inn fields into nothing less than a rubic s cube of shifting levels , false walls and trompe l'oeil tricks played with mirrors within , he kept one of the finest collections of architectural fragments , plaster casts , books and drawings ever assembled but his particular , almost fanatical , genius lay in his ability to compress architectural grandeur into small spaces , and to tease the mind with his visual and historical ambiguities his spatial games become most complex toward the back of the house , where corridors that feel like tunnels suddenly burst into the light and become vertiginous galleries overlooking a chamber that houses soane s egyptian sarcophagus and roman cineraria above are busts and vases on hundreds of nails that extend up to the house s tall skylights , once filled with colored glass that cast an eerie glow as his life progressed , even soane s picture collection grew unmanageable , and the cunning architect devised a small room whose walls consist of vast panels that swing out to reveal another layer of paintings behind the first

wimbledon came naturally , said navratilova , who plotted for a year to peak there and satisfy her hunger for a record ninth title here , everything was a struggle tonight i was fighting , but i was up and down although i was trying to concentrate , it was n't simple , it just was n't there my serve sort of went away for a while and it cost me the first set study in contrasts maleevafragniere approached the match with a style and attitude quite unlike those of navratilova her patient baseline drives contrasted with navratilova s frenetic scurries netward , and her concentration was impeccable it s probably what i have lived for in my tennis career , said maleevafragniere , who faces eighthseeded mary joe fernandez in the quarterfinals maleevafragniere said she had trained for the last two years to develop the stamina necessary to beat a grand slam player like martina i was so much looking forward to this match that i thought i would not let anything bother me , maleevafragniere said i really felt like today something could happen with a thunderstorm threatening to erupt at any moment and maleevafragniere sizzling like a sharpshooter from the baseline , navratilova , who made an emergency visit to the restroom after the third game of the second set , was the player who became unhinged the first sign of trouble arose when navratilova relinquished her 41 firstset lead once maleevafragniere settled down to business , she began catching navratilova out of position jolted and frazzled that s the best i 've ever seen her play , said navratilova i wimped out on a lot of balls , and she also read my shots very well i did n't get her guessing enough i was letting her anticipate meanwhile , navratilova jolted and jerked around the court like a pulltoy in the first set , repeatedly frazzled by the robust passing shots launched by maleevafragniere from her post at the baseline navratilova recouped in the middle set , where she modified her style of attack and was more careful about countering maleevafragniere s impassive rallies but when navratilova bobbled a pair of overheads and let herself be ambushed at midcourt , the bulgarianborn player got an early break in the third set for a 31 lead poor forehand hurts trailing by 25 , navratilova broke maleevafragniere as she served for the match but she lost her own serve and the match on a weak forehand reply to maleevafragniere s unexceptional backhand service return at break point of the next game mistakes in judgment abounded from navratilova , who showed none of her usual poise on the court and resorted to frantic playmaking even while serving maleevafragniere , on the other hand , stuck to the simplest of game plans she aimed for the baseline from the baseline , kept her shots inbounds , and patiently waited as navratilova selfdestructed in her poorest open performance in a decade photo martina navratilova after losing her balance in her match with manuela maleevafragniere last night \( barton silverman the new york times \)

in addition , early this year moscow stopped its worldwide marketing of iraqi oil , which it had received in exchange for arms shipments , according to experts experts say iraq produced that oil , estimated at 145 , 000 to 200 , 000 barrels a day last year , outside its quota set by the organization of petroleum exporting countries , and its loss further reduces world supplies the soviet union s own exports will average about 33 million barrels a day this year , down from 37 million barrels a day last year , according to robert e ebel , the vice president for international affairs of the enserch corporation of dallas mr ebel , a former government intelligence officer , said that in 1988 exports reached 41 million barrels a day eastern european countries that took about half the soviet exports , paying for them through barter or in currencies that are not freely exchangeable on world markets , have borne the brunt of the export cuts , according to western experts some of that crude was refined and sold to western countries they were also major users and processors of iraqi oil , generally acquired by barter there is also some reduction in sales of soviet crude to western european countries that paid in hard currency , but soviet oil income could still rise because the price of a barrel is up sharply the soviet union is the world s biggest oil producer , but as an exporter it trails saudi arabia , the world s largest , which had an opec quota of 538 million barrels under the last agreement before the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 but it is ahead of iraq , which had a quota of 314 million barrels , and kuwait , which had a quota of 15 million the united nationsled embargo has denied world markets the 46 million barrels a day from iraq and kuwait , but opec has authorized other members to produce more oil to try to make up the loss the united states is the secondlargest producer , with about 85 million barrels a day of crude oil and condensates , but it also the world s largest importer , buying about the same amount it produces , in normal times compared with these numbers , the soviet declines are small , but they come at a time of market tightness the iraqi barter with the soviet union ended early this year , months before the invasion of kuwait robert mabro , director of the oxford institute for energy studies , said that the iraqis had been paying for arms , flour , tractors , whatever , and that none of the oil actually went to the soviet union it was simply sold or rebartered western experts are not sure why the barter stopped one suggested that it was for a debt that had been paid off with demand heightened by tourism and other factors , eastern european countries like yugoslavia and bulgaria , which were large users of iraqi oil either through direct barter or through the soviet union , are importing refined products , adding to the pressure on western european refineries , according to western experts and oil traders in new york say that demand for gasoline in europe is so strong now that some cargoes have gone from the gulf coast of the united states to northwestern europe , opposite the normal flow , driving up prices in the united states moscow was also channeling 90 , 000 barrels a day of iraqi oil to india , and is reportedly making that up from domestic production with that diversion and the decline in soviet output , deliveries to eastern europe are down by 30 percent , by some estimates soviet officials have told the former members of the soviet bloc that they will demand payment for oil in hard currency beginning next year , and have reportedly asked for cash even sooner from some countries but western analysts doubt that the countries can meet the deadline the main reason for the decline in soviet production is a decision early last year to decrease investment in the oil industry , in favor of investment in areas that could put products for consumers on store shelves if perestroika means anything , it means cuts in energy and military capital expenditures , said one analyst based in paris , who said he could not be publicly identified the oil and gas sector had soaked up 70 percent of the new investment capital available in the late 1980 s , according to thane gustafson , a professor of government at georgetown university and an expert on the soviet oil industry , when production began to drop in 1985 , he said , their response was to throw money at the problem but this time they 've decided explicitly not to do it again the soviets have said 'no , ' they will let oil output fall ethnic unrest and a general breakdown of the soviet economy are adding to production problems , experts say , but have not been as important as the lack of investment mehdi varzi , an oil expert at kleinwort grieveson securities , in london , pointed out that soviet production peaked in 1988 , before the unrest in azerbaijan , site of much of the oil service industry , and before the restiveness of other republics and the general breakdown of the economy they really have n't undertaken the necessary measures in maintenance , well workovers , replacement of equipment and so forth , what is normally called good industry practice , mr varzi said a wild card for future oil production , according to mr gustafson , is that some republics have asserted a claim to their mineral resources the soviet ministry of geology and the government of the turkmen republic made a joint announcement earlier this week that they would open about 90 , 000 square kilometers , or 56 , 250 square miles , to exploration by western companies this was the first joint announcement between the national government and a republic , professor gustafson said about 85 percent of existing production is in the russian republic , however soviet and american oil production is declining at roughly the same rate but oil companies in the united states say that soviet geology offers far more promising possibilities than does that of the united states they have not developed a technical base for drilling deep for oil , said mr ebel of the enserch corporation rather than drill below 10 , 000 feet , he added , they moved on to other oilfields , but now they have run out of new fields photo oil drilling in the tyumen region of western siberia output is down , but the soviet union is still the world s biggest oil producer \( tass sovfoto , 1980 \) graph daily oil production in the soviet union , 19761990 \( 1990 , estimate \) \( source international energy

ten people , including a 9yearold boy and seven teenage girls , were wounded in the bronx last night when a man who had apparently been arguing with his girlfriend pulled a gun and began firing , the police said none of the injuries were believed to be lifethreatening , but a 16yearold girl who was shot in the groin was in serious condition , a police spokesman , officer fred weiner , said the victims were taken to four bronx hospitals , where detectives were interviewing them last night the police were also talking to witnesses to the shooting , which occurred about 10 pm at 1368 webster avenue outside the butler houses , a public housing complex between east 169th and 170th streets in the morrisania section , the police said the incident was first reported as a driveby shooting , but officer weiner said it appeared to have been some sort of dispute between boyfriend and girlfriend , or between two women , with a man drawing a gun supposedly the male pulled out a weapon , possibly a 9millimeter , and fired numerous shots , officer weiner said but witnesses at the butler houses and the adjacent webster houses , another public housing complex , said the dispute was over a bicycle they said that at one point a group of youths who had been congregating outside began beating up another youth who was on the bicycle then , they said , a friend of the youth ran up with a gun that witnesses described as a sawedoff gun or an uzi who did this \? the witnesses said the friend had demanded all of them , replied the youth who had been beaten , according to one witness , lee williams , 17 , a junior at isaac walton high school and then the next thing , he just started shooting , like this ratatattat , ratatattat real fast and then people were running in every different direction , and there were a lot of girls screaming , 'oh my god , oh my god , oh my god' another resident , diamond wilson , a sophomore at walton , was coming from the grand market at 1393 webster avenue when she heard the shooting there was one shot and then one right after , and another real quick , she said 'he s not moving' mr williams said he saw the 9yearold boy lying on the sidewalk he s not moving , but i could n't tell if that was just because he was scared or if he was really hurt , mr williams said witnesses said the most seriously injured appeared to be a 16yearold girl whom they identified as tamara mcpherson , a student at walton she was just a girl who liked to hang out and go to parties , ms wilson said this shooting is nothing she 'd ever be in four people were being treated early this morning at bronxlebanon hospital center , fulton division , at 1276 fulton avenue the 9yearold boy for a wound in the left leg , a 16yearold girl for a wound behind the ear , a 21yearold man for a leg wound and a 25yearold man for a chest wound all were listed in stable condition two 15yearold girls were being treated at the concourse division of bronxlebanon , at 1650 grand concourse , one for a wound to the right leg and the other for a wound to the right thigh the 16year old girl who was shot in the groin was taken to lincoln hospital and reported in serious condition two young women , one 17 and the other 19 and both with wounds in the left arm , were reported in good condition crowds mill about another 16yearold girl was being treated at jacobi hospital for a wound to the buttocks and reported in good condition it was not immediately clear if the girlfriend of the gunman was shot last night , long after the shooting , residents milled about in the warm night the mood was at once angry and tearful and yet almost carnivallike when some youths set off firecrackers , everybody jumped then they laughed out of every seven days in the week , you 're going to hear gunshots on three or four days , ms wilson said , but nothing like this
east fork lake , ohio , june 16 the wisconsin crew caught up with harvard at last today at the cincinnati regatta and beat the crimson eight in a 2 , 000meter race to decide the nation s best college heavyweight crew the badgers from madison held off the expected harvard sprint in the final 400 meters to win by 43 seconds , or a full boat length the wisconsin eight had been behind harvard on two finish lines this season , by 5 seconds at the san diego classic on april 7 and by 41 seconds at the eastern sprints on may 20 harvard won the latter event and seemed invincible so coach randy jablonic s badgers , in less than a month s time , improved themselves by almost two boat lengths relative to harvard , the benchmark crew in college rowing on a day with temperatures close to 90 degrees , and over a smooth course , wisconsin s time was a swift 5 minutes 525 seconds then came harvard just ahead of ucla , 5 5684 to 5 5687 syracuse , 6 0009 and washington , 6 039 there is little room for strategy in 2 , 000meter sprint races , and wisconsin essentially had none we wanted to be ahead at 750 meters and then give it all we had , said todd hinrichs , the captain and 7 oar it worked out almost that way wisconsin had its lead at 1 , 000 meters and went on everything felt good , said hinrichs a great row travis metz , the harvard coxswain , said we just could n't catch them they rowed a great race and we were a little flat crimson crews had won this regatta , and thus a claim to the national championship , every year since 1983 except for 1986 we did well , said coach harry parker it s tough to win them all
medinah , ill in the 90th united states open , which begins thursday among the towering trees of medinah country club s no 3 course , the big question is can curtis strange join willie anderson , a turnofthecentury champion , in winning the championship three consecutive years \? but there s another big question inside a sentimental question is this jack nicklaus s last open \? the answer probably not , but maybe for more than three decades , the golden bear has not had to qualify for the open because of his various accomplishments but at the age of 50 , the fourtime open champion s last automatic exemption is about to expire his fiveyear pass earned as the winner of the 1986 masters even with his limited schedule , nicklaus might earn another exemption before next year s open at hazeltine outside minneapolis if nicklaus , sunday s winner of the mazda tpc senior title , were to win the senior open at the ridgewood \( nj \) country club at the end of this month , or finish among the top 15 and ties in this open , he would be exempt next year or if he were to win this open , the british open , the pga championship or next year s masters or players championship , he would also be exempt but if any of those automatic exemptions elude the golden bear , he would be required to qualify for the open as if he were an assistant pro from oshkosh that provokes the real question will the united states golf association require arguably the best golfer in history to qualify for the open \? probably not right away each year the usga may grant as many as three special exemptions this year , only one was awarded , to hale irwin , a twotime open champion arnold palmer accepted several special exemptions , but also succeeded and failed in sectional qualifying years ago , ben hogan , another fourtime open champion , declined to qualify yes , the open is the most democratic golf tournament it attracted 6 , 198 entries this year but it s time the usga created a lifetime exemption category it should be as demanding as having won the open at least once and as enduring as having played in , say , 20 opens this will be nicklaus s 34th open , a record asked not long ago if he would try to qualify , nicklaus spoke vaguely about how his schedule might not allow the time he sounded as if he hoped that situation did n't develop if the usga is smart , it wo n't humiliate jack nicklaus and embarrass itself by demanding that he qualify the lifetime exemption would allow nicklaus , palmer , lee trevino , whose exemptions have also expired , and others to tee it up in the open if they wish nicklaus has no intention of being what he calls a ceremonial golfer , an indication that he might not compete too much longer i'm neither fish nor fowl , he said recently the biggest enjoyment i get out of golf is competition , but do i want to play more golf or have i done enough of that \? golf is no longer my business and frankly , i'm 50 my dad passed away at 56 that s another question do you want to kill yourself playing tournament golf next year i may play 15 or 20 tournaments or i may play none this week s open will be nicklaus s seventh appearance on the pga tour this year , with a sixth at the masters his best finish in three tournaments as a senior pga tour rookie , he has won twice nicklaus has continued to use the jumbo driver that he , raymond floyd and jumbo ozaki popularized at the masters , but not long ago he removed its graphite shaft and inserted a steel shaft i 've played with steel shafts all my life , nicklaus explained the graphite shaft was quite a bit lighter i can hit it three or four yards farther with the graphite , but the steel kept the same feel and balance i have with all my other clubs according to tests conducted by the wide world of golf video magazine , the jumbo driver , alias j s professional weapon , a metal wood manufactured in japan by bridgestone , apparently does n't help the average golfer that much with an iron byron machine swinging at an average golfer s clubhead speed of 90 miles per hour , tee shots with a taylormade metal driver carried 1857 yards in the air , compared to 1807 with the jumbo driver at a touring pro s clubhead speed of 108 mph , tee shots with the jumbo driver barely edged those with the taylormade , 2360 to 2352 yards the clubface loft also was found to be closer to 6 degrees , not 95 degrees as professed , causing many average golfers to hit the ball low or along the ground for all the mystery and magic of the jumbo driver , which greg norman is also using , the length and accuracy of tee shots in the open will depend on the driver himself , not the driver itself especially the driver named jack nicklaus in what could be his last open photo jack nicklaus
key west , fla but the memorial service for mr kopenhoefer is only one sign of the openness and unity with which the citizens of key west appear to be facing the human destruction that aids is wreaking in absolute terms , the 280 diagnosed cases of aids in key west are minute compared with the thousands in miami and the tens of thousands in new york , san francisco and other major urban centers but because key west is a small island with a large population of gay people , the incidence of aids is among the highest in the country answering the epidemic key west has answered the epidemic by drawing on its long tradition of togetherness and tolerance right from the start we were very active in responding to aids , said liz kern , the director of the local hospice that provides care for many people with aids there was no resistance instead people asked , 'what can we do \? ' aids is a test of community , she added quietly it s a test of how we respond to this terrible thing it is an approach that perhaps holds lessons for other towns in a country that is struggling to come to terms with a crippling disease that will directly and indirectly affect millions of americans and that is predicted to kill as many as 400 , 000 of them by 1993 many american cities have adopted extensive programs to deal with aids but in part because of the anonymity of large cities and the continuing prejudices surrounding homosexuals and people with aids , few cities appear to have addressed the disease with the closeknit and communitywide effort that key west has forged an unusual effort we have certainly seen many other small towns react very badly , said carisa cunningham , assistant director for communications of the gay men s health crisis in new york city , a leading advocacy group for people with aids it still happens it happens in new york city we still have people who do n't want aids organizations in their neighborhoods this kind of community effort is quite unusual there are several programs here , involving homosexuals and heterosexuals , to help people with aids live out their lives with dignity and to help those in the earliest stages of the illness muster the spiritual and physical strength to fight the virus and continue to lead meaningful lives the town also has a constant , extremely frank and publicly financed sex education and aids prevention program that includes regular seminars on safe sex , distribution of posters and leaflets urging safe sex and handing out tens of thousands of free condoms these measures are credited by local officials with saving perhaps hundreds of lives key west has also publicly and privately financed programs to educate all teachers , the staff of the local hospital and the staffs of several hotels and other businesses about aids this is a town where a visitor can enter a doctor s office and find a poster showing a little stick figure standing in a bed of bright flowers with his arms upraised in appeal i have aids , he says , please hug me i ca n't make you sick 'the healing business' the rev steven m torrence , pastor of the metropolitan community church , which has a special ministry for gay people , said he had tended at least 300 people who died of aids , some of them outside key west such suffering , he says , has only deepened his christian faith in the midst of all this destruction of human lives , mr torrence said i still see god in the healing business healing relationships , healing families not all residents are so open in addressing aids some involved in tourism appear to fear that illinformed public reaction to aids might undermine the industry that is the town s main source of income but tourism does not appear to have suffered , perhaps because tourists run no risk of acquiring the disease unless they engage in unsafe sex , use unclean needles , or somehow receive a tainted blood transfusion none of them common activities for the average visitor a personal mission part of the reason that more people have not been affected is randy t jansen , the local aids prevention officer of the florida department of health and rehabilitative services with a mix of dedication and humor , he has made safe sex and sex education accepted parts of local life hopping on his bicycle to make what is jokingly referred to here as randy s rubber run , mr jansen pedaled on his weekly sex education tour he left bags of condoms at local stores and at guest houses that

berkeley , calif michele g and nancy s , a lesbian couple , had lived together for 11 years when they decided to rear children ms g found a sperm donor , took part in the artificial insemination of ms s and was present in june 1980 at the delivery of a baby girl on the child s birth certificate , ms s was listed under mother , ms g under father five years and a second child later , the two women split up now the only place they are together is in a california appellate court there they are battling over the children and , perhaps , helping to redefine the laws of parenthood as homosexual men and women become more public , and an increasing number of lesbian couples choose to rear children , they are taking their private problems to court increasingly , judges face the daunting task of handling what amount to divorces involving people who cannot legally marry they must address contracts disputes , the division of property and businesses , and support payments more cases are expected but none of those issues have the poignancy of michele g v nancy s and other cases that involve children in most legal divorces , custody and visitation are determined according to the best interests of the child but because only blood relatives generally have standing in the courts , questions of the child s interests do not even arise in these cases the birth mother is presumed to represent those interests the women in this and other cases agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they be only partly identified , saying they were concerned that their children might face harassment they are also identified that way in court papers , an arrangement a judge can approve if he believes it will best serve the children in the last year , other custody and visitation battles between birth mothers and their estranged partners have reached courts in los angeles , new york and maryland and since as many as 10 , 000 children are now being reared by gay women , many more such cases are expected ten years ago we all said , 'we want babies , too , ' said amy oppenheimer of oakland , a lawyer for ms g , , who lost in the lower court but lesbian couples break up as often as straight ones do and now we 're experiencing the fallout of having families without having laws or agreements to protect us implications for stepparents it seems certain that gay men will soon find themselves in similar predicaments , as they split up and begin fighting over children one of them has adopted or may have fathered the court cases also have implications for stepparents , whose relationship with their stepchildren have generally enjoyed no legal protection the concept of parenthood as a onemotheronefather phenomenon is very engrained , even though it is clearly not true in many situations , said nancy d polikoff , a professor of family law at american university law school in washington the legal system has not caught up with the reality judith hooper shub of baltimore , who represented the birth mother in one case , agreed to children , what the adults do in their bedroom does n't make any difference , she said as long as society says it s ok to form such families , then the courts must accord the children of these families respect and attention judges are trying with some bewilderment to apply legal doctrines dating from the conventional ozzie and harriet television era to evolving family configurations cases around the nation in march , the appellate division of state supreme court in brooklyn ruled that a birth mother s former partner , alison d , had no visitation rights the ruling prompted a harsh dissent from justice sybil hart kooper , who based her opinion in part on the broadened definition of family posited by the new york court of appeals last year , when it ruled that a gay couple was family under the rent control laws the lawyer for ms d , paula l ettelbrick of the lambda legal defense and education fund , a gay rights group , will soon ask the new york court of appeals to take the case in ruling on another lesbian custody dispute in california last december , one judge conceded that the courts were simply not up to the task this is a case dealing with issues which traverse uncharted legal waters and involve deeprooted concepts of human relationships in marriage and parenthood , wrote judge dana henry of los angeles county superior court it is absolutely imperative that the legislature reexamine its laws in order to adequately deal with the increasing number of children of homosexual couples in the berkeley case , ms g , a 43yearold graduate student in evolutionary biology at the university of california , refers to the children she and ms s reared as my daughter and my son parental status , she argues , can be conferred by exposure and experience as well as by biology or adoption but in february 1989 , an alameda county trial court judge disagreed regardless of ms g s role in the children s development , he ruled , they are in no way hers , and she has no legal right to see them it is this decision that is now on appeal
from the day ronald reagan arrived in washington until the day before saddam hussein s troops reached kuwait city , energy policy was a fringe issue in the united states now , the deployment of american troops in the persian gulf to assure a steady flow of oil has left many policy makers wondering whether the united states has options other than force to insure an adequate supply of energy but many proposals including driving at the speed limit , paying high taxes on gasoline , running cars on natural gas and bicycling to work seem a radical departure from how americans work and play and live and how they think about natural resources here are 10 frequently mentioned proposals and their prospects for adoption 1 reduce speed limits and enforce them a car that gets 28 miles a gallon at 55 miles an hour gets about 21 miles a gal lon at 65 miles an hour , the insurance institute for high way safety says driving more slowly would seem to benefit both individuals' pocketbooks and the nation s balance of payments and energy security , not to mention side effects like saving lives and reducing pollution \( remember earth day \? \) but a few minutes on any interstate highway demonstrates that when it comes to getting from point a to point b , most drivers agree that the proper speed is as fast as possible in new york , where the speed limit is 55 miles an hour , a vacationer who toured 180 rural miles of the new york thruway at 60 miles an hour last month was the slowest vehicle on his stretch of road even the proverbial milk wagon went faster after the arab oil embargo of 197374 , when most people worried where their next tankful of gas was coming from and children on halloween dressed up like opec ministers , congress responded to the new national mood by imposing a national 55mileanhour speed limit most people actually slowed down almost to that speed but when gasoline once again became inexpensive , washington responded by allowing the states to raise their speed limits to 65 miles an hour speed aside , encouraging drivers to keep their tires fully inflated , and providing air hoses at a time when fewer gas stations do , would also increase gas mileage considerably prospects no change unless a crisis mentality takes hold or lawenforcement officials deploy their troops to stop speeding 2 insist on cars with better mileage six million bar rels of oil a day , out of total domestic consumption of 16 million , is used to provide fuel for cars and light trucks federal policy has already had a major impact on gas mileage alarmed by the arab oil embargo in 197374 , congress required car makers to raise the mileage of cars , step by step , until the average of all cars sold reached 275 miles a gallon as new cars were built and old cars retired , the average efficiency of cars on the road in the united states has risen from 133 miles a gallon in 1973 to about 20 miles a gallon today , an improvement of 50 percent even if the government does nothing more , average fuel economy will improve as new cars replace older ones but the collapse of crude oil prices in 1986 pushed gasoline prices so low that car buyers stopped demanding the more efficient models between the 1988 and 1990 model years , buyers moved so heavily to bigger cars with bigger engines that average fuel economy declined by 3 percent the average fuel economy of 1990 modelyear cars is 278 miles a gallon , down from 286 two years ago \( on the other hand , cars do accelerate more quickly the 1990 models , on average , go from 0 to 60 miles an hour in seventenths of a second less than it took the 1988 s \) a bill in the senate would raise the corporate average fuel economy standard by 40 percent by 2001 , to about 40 miles a gallon that would save nearly three million barrels a day when the new cars are fully phased in , according to the bill s supporters this is a big number in relation to the seven million barrels a day currently being imported and far exceeds the 730 , 000 barrels a day that the united states had been getting from iraq and kuwait supporters say the senate bill , sponsored by richard h bryan , democrat of nevada , would stimulate the development of engine and transmission technologies , along with increased use of lightweight materials but the auto makers say they used almost every trick they knew to double fuel efficiency from the mid1970 s to the mid1980 s nearly all cars made today have frontwheel drive instead of rearwheel drive , and use fuel injectors instead of carburetors all have been redesigned to cut wind drag if substantial advances are to be made , the manufacturers say , it will have to be by making the cars smaller i do n't think it s reasonable to hold that the most mobile society in the world can meet its personal and business transportation needs with a fleet of minicompacts , subcompacts and compacts , said thomas h hanna , president of the motor vehicle manufacturers association sales , the only barometer of consumer preference , support this , he said in 1989 , cars rated at 50 miles per gallon or better accounted for less than 3 percent of us sales
galveston , tex , june 9 three explosions rocked a norwegian oil tanker carrying more than 38 million gallons of crude in the gulf of mexico off galveston early today , setting off a fire and killing at least two crew members the authorities confirmed that two crewmen had been killed in the first explosion , at 1 am , aboard the 853foot tanker the mega borg they added that two others were missing and presumed dead of the ship s 41 crew members , 17 were injured , none seriously , officials said the authorities said it was unlikely that texas beaches would be fouled by oil from the ship , which was hauling light crude the coast guard said the cause of the explosions , which occurred 57 miles southeast of galveston , had not yet been determined the fire continued to rage out of control this evening in the afternoon , two fire boats had sprayed water on flames that shot up hundreds of feet from the ship s air vents thick , black smoke , which could be seen 40 miles away , curled from the ship s aft section blast during oil transfer the explosions began in the engine room while the 15yearold tanker was transferring its shipment to the italian tanker framura the mega borg had transferred nearly 3 million gallons of of oil when the first explosion occurred , capt tom greene of the coast guard said two more explosions occurred shortly before 2 pm today , chief petty officer rich muller said captain greene said about 7 , 000 gallons of crude oil or ship fuel spread on the water , creating an oil sheen about 11 miles long and a quartermile wide coast guard officials speculated that fuel had poured into the water from hoses used to transfer the oil to the italian tanker , or that it had poured out the top of the tanker as the fire heated up the oil and caused it to expand no more pollution expected ensign larry meredith of the coast guard s marine safety office said we do n't expect any of the oil to reach the texas coast it will mix with natural ocean water and if nature takes its course evaporate captain greene said the biggest fear was that the fire , which apparently was being fed by burning engine oil or lubricating oil , might spread to three of the ship s cargo tanks those three tanks hold about 15 million gallons of crude captain greene said the authorities had assembled representatives of the environmental protection agency , the coast guard atlantic strike team and other state and federal agencies to monitor the incident a boom to contain oil was being brought from mobile , ala , he said captain greene said a disaster like the nearly 11 milliongallon spill by the exxon valdez in 1989 was unlikely in that accident , more than 1 , 100 miles of alaskan shoreline were soiled by heavy crude the mega borg s shipment of light crude would disperse much more rapidly than heavy crude , he said after the initial explosion , the mega borg s captain and first mate were taken aboard a coast guard cutter the other surviving crew members were taken to nearby freeport by a commercial vessel the 17 injured crew members were taken to brazosport memorial hospital in lake jackson a hospital spokeswoman said their injuries consisted mainly of burns , fractures and smoke inhalation two of the injured were admitted and were in stable condition , linda runnels , a nursing supervisor , said the tanker is operated by mosvolds shipping of farsund , norway the company s managing director , geir larsen , said his company owns a little less than 50 percent of the tanker
washington inspired by origami , the oriental art of folding paper into ornamental objects , a researcher at the american telephone and telegraph company s bell laboratories has patented a method for solving large computational problems invented by alan huang , the method is intended to facilitate parallel computing , a procedure in which a large , complex problem is broken down into many parts and solved by scores of separate processors working simultaneously one of the biggest stumbling blocks in developing such systems has been coordination how should labor be divided among different processors , and how can their activities be synchronized and consolidated to yield a coherent solution \? the traditional approach has been to write elaborate software to orchestrate everything , but the complexity of the instructions often constitutes a roadblock in itself mr huang said his method coordinates the process with almost none of those instructions instead , it is based on the inherent mathematical logic of folding , and was inspired by childhood memories of using origami to build sophisticated paper airplanes a flat piece of paper i 'd be the first to confess this sounds crazy , he said of his method its curse is its simplicity mr huang , head of bell s optical computing research department , gained national attention earlier this year when he introduced an experimental computer processor that performed calculations using light pulses instead of electricity to illustrate his method , mr huang cited the problem of measuring wind over every square inch of an airplane fuselage one can do this , he said , by placing processors over every square inch of the plane s surface to measure air flow and then search for some way to consolidate all the measurements into a coherent picture mr huang said he begins the process with a flat piece of paper , which is evenly divided into scores of squares that each represent a microprocessor he then folds the paper into the shape of the airplane , assigning responsibilities to the processors based on their location the plane is then unfolded , back into a flat piece of paper , which now constitutes a map for the processors the flat map is refolded vertically into a fan shape and folded a third time , horizontally , into what looks like an accordion this is done to progressively simplify the pattern this is where the magic is , mr huang said the new shape is simple and compact , yet it constitutes an accurate model for how the actual microprocessors should be arranged and assigned responsibilities mr huang said the same method can be applied to mapping most other computational problems instead of forming a paper airplane , the computer designer merely works out a flow chart of activity on a flat piece of paper and then starts folding mr huang obtained patent 4 , 943 , 909 photo alan huang has developed a new method , based on origami , for solving computational problems \( att bell laboratories \)
a remarkable comeback appears to be taking shape on wall street the man who stitched together a patchwork of investment firms to build what is now one of wall street s biggest brokerage houses , only to lose control after selling it to the american express company , may return to run his old firm , shearson lehman hutton inc sanford i \( sandy \) weill garnered the respect of wall street as his once small firm grew ever larger over two decades then he knocked the street on its ear in 1981 when he sold the firm to american express in a bid to create what he , and many others , thought would be the financial services company of the future but the corporate culture of american express and the maverick mentality of mr weill did not mesh in 1985 , he resigned , and the next year he took charge of a financial services operation in baltimore from the control data corporation for a couple of years , he lived in relative obscurity running the firm , the commercial credit company but in 1988 , mr weill returned to his familiar surroundings with a vengeance , buying the primerica corporation , a diversified new york financial services company that is the parent of the brokerage house , smith barney , harris upham company and yesterday , the circle in the career of sandy weill appeared to be nearer than ever to closing wall street executives said mr weill was in negotiations with the american express company that could lead to the creation of the largest brokerage firm in the country and put him back as chairman of shearson shearson has been in financial and internal turmoil over the last year , resulting in the recent resignation of its chairman and chief executive , who was a protege of mr weill as a measure of its trouble , the firm yesterday told its employees that it planned 2 , 000 layoffs by april the serious negotiations between mr weill s primerica corporation and american express began last week , and have focused on the possible merger of smith barney with shearson to form what would become the largest brokerage on wall street people directly involved in the negotiations stressed that the talks were at a tentative stage , meaning that they could result in a preliminary agreement as soon as a matter of days , or could fall apart one person involved in the talks emphasized that no agreement had been reached , while another said last night that they had ended right now , it s the magical mystery tour , a person involved in the talks said we 'll see where it takes us assets for stock under the terms of the deal that has been discussed , mr weill would assume the post of chairman of shearson , while retaining his position as chairman of primerica the potential deal , which was described as a swap of assets for stock , would merge the two brokerages , with primerica receiving a large stake in shearson the two companies would then be partners as parents the sources said that there were no talks under way yesterday , but that they were expected to resume soon they added that other possible structures to the deal have been considered , including bringing in another party along with mr weill a spokesman for american express confirmed the talks , but stressed that no deal had been made and that many possible structures for one had been considered , including the type of deal described by the other wall street executives as under discussion he said , however , that none of the proposals involved the sale of shearson mr weill did not return a call for comment , and a spokeswoman for primerica would not comment howard clark jr , the chief executive of shearson , also confirmed last night that talks had been held and said that the deal that had been discussed involved the purchase of smith barney by shearson shearson would have paid for the transaction by issuing new stock in the firm to primerica , mr clark said mr clark said the talks between the various parties had broken off but other wall street executives directly involved in the situation said that while they thought the talks could go either way , they had no reason to believe they had ended for mr weill , an emotionally charged executive with a strong leadership manner , such a deal could well be his ultimate achievement the 56yearold executive would be able to run a firm with the strength of shearson and maintain the relationship with american express at the same time , he would be able to stay as the top man at primerica , and therefore shape his own culture two top executives the talks began between mr weill and james d robinson 3d , the chairman and chief executive of american express the two men , who have remained friends since mr weill was president of american express and mr robinson was his boss , reportedly had spoken about a possible combination in general terms for some time and recently began to consider such an action aggressively since the serious talks began , lawyers and investment bankers have been brought into the negotiations for example , joseph flom , a partner with skadden , arps , slate meagher flom , was said to be playing an active role in the deal , as was j tomilson hill 3d , the head of mergers and acquisitions at shearson neither man returned telephone calls yesterday you 've got law firms all over the place now , one wall street executive said it seems like there are 19 , 000 people involved
for 13 years , television viewers have looked into jane pauley s smiling eyes and seen exactly what they wanted to see the hip have detected a suppressed soulmate , restraining herself in deference to the bland requirements of morning television traditionalists have perceived a fresh , levelheaded young woman forced to cope with but miraculously unchanged by the fasttrack world she inhabits i think i'm unique in that way , ms pauley herself said on a recent afternoon in her office at rockefeller plaza viewers project upon me their own values in recent months , ms pauley has been seen filling in for tom brokaw on the nbc nightly news but on wednesday , july 11 , when the initial installment in a series of five summer specials with her as host will be broadcast at 10 pm on nbc , she will at last begin to define herself on her own terms , in her own forum the series , real life with jane pauley , is intended as a proving ground if all goes well , it will reappear next january as a weekly primetime news magazine developed and written with its star s active participation , in some ways it may be the public s first chance to meet the real jane pauley in some ways , it may also be the 39yearold newswoman s first opportunity to learn a few things about herself for example , ambition her vault to fame when she landed the job of cohost \( opposite tom brokaw \) of the today show at the age of 25 spared her the period of struggle when most people learn how much drive they have how ambitious is she , really \? i'm not sure , she replied she frowned a little into the smoked glass of her desk , then looked up in person , ms pauley gives off a strangely vibrant aura , as if , in fact , she were on television i think i'm ambitious i think i 've always been a lot more ambitious than i was comfortable admitting launching a primetime magazine will be a good way to find out even if the network s executives are satisfied with what they see this summer \( they 'll be looking in particular at whether ms pauley , a consummate team player , can carry a show of her own \) , television history is littered with failed primetime news shows when they work , of course , such programs are gold mines think of cbs s 60 minutes or abc s 20 20 far more often , though , they are sheer cliffs up which talented people toil slowly , painfully and , finally , in vain among numerous others on nbc alone , primetime sunday , anchored by tom snyder , nbc magazine with david brinkley and monitor , anchored by lloyd dobyns , none of which survived more than two years currently undergoing retooling are abc s prime time live and cbs s saturday night with connie chung i have a very realistic sense of the risk , said ms pauley historically , these kinds of programs have had a low probability of success still , she feels she has profited from the lessons of those who have gone before i think in the past nbc has pulled its punches a little , she said they have n't been able to commit to a concept they 've backed it up with a secondary concept that confused the original , or they 've been unwilling to trust a news magazine to a single individual , so they paired someone with someone who was n't a good fit citing herself , the executive producer david browning and the senior producer shelley lewis , she added , we have a sense of the show we want to do , and we 're doing it , noting that so far , anyway the network shared the creators' vision of the show it might ultimately fail , but at least we 're sticking to our original intent as currently structured , each hour will present what the network calls four stories of american life in the 90 s , including some serious segments but concentrating mainly on the quirkier aspects of contemporary reality among segments now in the works is one titled all work , no play , about americans' vanishing leisure time , another about why manners are getting worse , a serious portrait of a homeless woman and a piece on how little americans understand the technology in their own homes , vcr s for instance ms pauley will be responsible for at least two segments on each show nbc news correspondents will cover the rest i 'll be the captain , ms pauley said , but the show is not going to be about me i will not dominate this program in the way that connie dominates her show i am definitely more comfortable as part of a group until last fall , of course , the group ms pauley was most comfortable in was the one that staffed the today show she speaks of the events leading to her welldocumented departure from the show with a tranquillity bordering on anesthetization it s like talking about my wedding , she said , with one of the flashes of dry humor that characterize her conversations i 've talked about it so much , i do n't know if i'm talking about the wedding pictures or what i actually remember the fiasco began with a network decision to bring the younger , more glamorous deborah norville in from her initial position as mere news reader to what amounted to a third anchor today has consistently attracted fewer younger women viewers than abc s rival good morning america , and it was hoped ms norville s presence might win them over alarmed about her own role , ms pauley initiated a series of intense negotiations with the network
the remembered present a biological theory of consciousness by gerald m edelman illustrated 346 pp new york basic books 2995 it is a characteristic of aging brain scientists to turn their minds to the problem of consciousness sir john eccles , roger sperry and sir charles sherrington are examples gerald m edelman , who received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1972 for his work on immunology and who has more recently been doing research on the brain , has now joined their ranks while their ambition is admirable , the result is usually lamentable almost everyone , including dr edelman , would agree that there is a complete correlation between a person s state of consciousness and the state of his brain malfunctioning in a small area of the brain can not only cause epilepsy but can render someone highly religious and make him give up all addictions , such as drink and tobacco it also takes away sexual desire \( it may be that the form christianity took was the result of an epileptic attack suffered by st paul on the road to damascus \) when the epileptic focus is removed , the person returns to normality he gives up religion , enjoys a drink and takes an interest in sex this is admittedly an extreme example of the relationship between neural and mental states but one can make a broader argument if the nervous system is a physical substance , then all behavior must be directly caused by it there is no room for intervention by anything nonphysical , since if such intervention were to occur , the brain would no longer be obeying the laws of physics and chemistry but since conscious states are reflected in behavior , particularly in language , they too must be in a onetoone relationship with brain states , at least within the individual although dr edelman does not make this argument explicitly , he would agree with the conclusion in posing the problem of consciousness in the remembered present , dr edelman starts off well he proposes to account for its evolution \( if it evolved it must have a function \) , and for the fact that our thoughts are about something \( when i think of dr edelman there is a relationship , which philosophers call intentionality , between my conscious state and him \) , as well as for the existence of subjective states known as qualia \( when i see green i have a particular subjective impression of greenness that could not be apprehended by someone who was colorblind , even if he had a full knowledge of how the brain categorizes colors \) dr edelman also notes that there are two kinds of consciousness , a lowlevel form \( primary consciousness \) presumably possessed by babies and by some animals , and a more sophisticated kind in which the person can reflect on his own experiences , thoughts and goals dr edelman terms this latter kind secondorder consciousness among his other aims is to account for the difference between the two in short , he sets out to solve a set of problems that have baffled philosophers for 3 , 000 years having stated the problem , he presents a potted version of his own theory of the brain , known as neural darwinism or \( in an extended version \) the theory of neuronal group selection he thinks the brain is composed of groups of cells the exact composition of each group varies from one individual to another and also within an individual over time he repeatedly invokes reentrant pathways , that is , pathways that connect two groups in each direction as a result of reinforcement , some groups grow others dwindle the theory has many oddities for example , dr edelman believes that primary consciousness , and indeed all learning , depend on valuecategory successions related to fundamental homeostatic needs , such as hunger and thirst but it is known that learning can occur throughout the mammalian kingdom irrespective of such needs curiosity is an underrated but pervasive drive a hungry rat in a novel environment will ignore food in order to explore of more general importance , he proceeds by assertion rather than by argument the generation of a mental image depends on reentrant connections of the special valuecategory to cortical systems carrying out perceptual categorizations as so often , this assertion is extremely obscure but even if one goes to the labor of working out the meaning , it is hard to know why he believes what he says it is never made clear nor is it clear how the reentrant systems work , or under what conditions they are needed after all , there are many existing simulations of neural networks that learn to categorize without specific reentrants for the most part , dr edelman disdains to mention the theories of others , let alone to consider the advantages or disadvantages of his own his explanations of behavior often have an ad hoc quality he thinks depression is caused by the inhibition of a pleasure reward system , the disinhibition of a central pain regulatory system and the inhibition of a

jeff torborg talked about his left hand , the hand that caught most of nolan ryan s booming fastballs in 1973 when the two players were with the california angels it was the year that ryan , with his 100mileperhour heater \( give or take a mile or two per hour of smoke on a given outing \) , established the major league record for strikeouts in a season , 383 the index finger of the left hand , right where the joint meets the palm , is much thicker to this day , torborg said recently by telephone , 17 years after having speared ryan s fastball for the last time of course , that was n't just from catching nolan i caught sandy koufax at the end of his career when i was with the dodgers and there were other hard throwers along the way the swelling was cumulative but no , said torborg , nolan did n't help this hand he could certainly do damage torborg , now the manager of the chicago white sox , was at the end of his major league career in 1973 , but memories of ryan , who last night with the texas rangers gained the 299th victory of his career , are indelible , just as they are with two other retired catchers , jerry grote , formerly of the mets , and alan ashby , the exastro those three catchers hunkered behind the plate during a good portion of the games that ryan , now 43 and still formidable , has pitched in his 24 years in the major leagues with , first , the mets , and then the angels , the astros and the rangers that trio of catchers also , of course , caught a large number of the record 5 , 000plus strikeouts ryan has amassed i caught nolan when he first came up to the majors in 1966 , said grote , now a sales manager of a real estate company in san antonio , and for his four years with the mets after that i caught him with padding , of course , and with my forefinger out of the glove , for extra cushion so my hand was pretty well protected but , yes , sure , the finger portion of my hand still took a bit of a beating ashby , newly retired from baseball and living in houston , recalled that ryan sometimes hid the catcher s mitts , tossing them under the dugout bench i used to like to catch with old rag gloves , recalled ashby , and nolan hated them he was like most fastball pitchers he wanted you to use new leather so that there was a louder pop to his pitches he 'd say , 'aw , c'mon , make it at least sound right' that s a big part of the psychology of pitching a bigger poom ! can scare hitters everybody sitting in the dugout looks at each other and says , 'jeez , he s throwin' good tonight when catching ryan , recalled grote , he could n't squat in the normal receiver s position you had to get up a little straighter , he said , otherwise there was no way you could get to his fastballs at the letters we had some very hard throwers on the mets in those years seaver and koosman , for example but none threw quite as hard as nolan i 'd say it boils down to about a twofoot difference in the year that ryan broke the singleseason strikeout record , 1973 , one of his victims was ashby , then a rookie with the cleveland indians i remember i got a hit off him the first time , said ashby , and the next time i maybe took too big a swing i think i swung hard and spun around it was like i was saying , 'i'm in charge' on the next pitch , he cleaned off the inside of the plate a little bit it was a fastball , high and tight , and i hit the ground i said to myself , 'oh , oh , i 'd done something wrong' and he was saying , 'hey , kid , if you wanna spin , i 'll be the one to spin you' i found that he s the greatest guy off the field but between the lines , he s the most serious player there is what s made nolan so effective is his curveball , said torborg it was the same with koufax major league hitters can begin to time even the best fastball and earlier this year , when nolan pitched a onehitter and struck out 16 of our batters , it was the curveball that was killing us and he s improved that considerably since i last caught him grote talked about ryan s excellent pitching mechanics , his low dropanddrive delivery torborg mentioned his work ethic and his superb conditioning , and ashby marveled at his competitiveness i remember when pete rose was going for the national league alltime basehit record and needed two hits to break it , recalled ashby , and he had predicted that he 'd do it on a certain day and on that day he was facing nolan rose got a base hit his first time up , and then nolan struck him out the next three times and after the last everyone in both dugouts had been standing to see what would happen pete turned to nolan and doffed his cap , and then walked on i'm sure that all the rest of the players felt like doffing our caps to nolan , too photo nolan ryan
washington , feb 25 declaring that sweeping , fundamental changes must be made in education , the nation s governors committed themselves today to work with the white house on a 10year program of reforming primary and secondary schools america s educational performance must be second to none in the 21st century , they said in a statement a new standard for an educated citizenry is required roger porter , the chief white house domestic policy adviser , said that the historic action culminated a process that began in september , when president bush met with the governors in charlottesville , va i am unaware of any time in the previous history of this country that the nation s governors have developed a set of national goals for anything much less for education and then agreed to work collectively with the president to accomplish them , he said bipartisan panel pledged the members of the national governors association agreed unanimously at their midwinter meeting on six national goals in education that reflected the cooperation of the white house they also pledged to establish a bipartisan panel to monitor progress and urged mr bush to direct some of the savings from reduced military spending to education we urge the president to dedicate the peace dividend in a balanced manner between the federal budget deficit , education and productivity investments , the governors' statement said the goals include bolstering preschool programs so that every child will start school ready to learn and strengthening of mathematics and science achievement to make american students first in the world in those areas by 2000 since the meeting on the university of virginia campus at charlottesville , a 14member study group of the association has been working with mr porter and other white house officials to frame the goals they were touched upon in summary form in the president s state of the union message on jan 29 looking ahead to 2000 these goals for the year 2000 were adopted here today all children will start school ready to learn the high school graduation rate will increase to at least 90 percent students will demonstrate in the fourth , eigth and 12th grades that they can handle such subject matter as english , mathematics , science , history , and geography every school will make sure its students learn to use their minds well so they will be ready for responsible citizenship , further learning , and productive employment american students will rank first in math and science every adult american will be literate , with the knowledge and skills to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship every school will be free of drugs and violence and offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning excellence in teachers making american students the best in the world in math and science , the governors said in their statement , will require a 50 percent increase in the number of teachers with a substantive background prominent educators at today s session hailed the action others present had questions you 've got to be pleased , said gordon ambach , executive director of the council of chief state school officers for the first time in our history , the governors and president have gone together and help set up an ambitious set of goals for education but keith geiger , executive director of the national education association , the teachers' union , said it s hard to disagree with anything they did they still have not told us how they are going to pay for it the governors pledged to hold one another accountable for progress through a bipartisan group to monitor and report regularly on the progress this group , the governors said , should stay in existence until at least the year 2000 it was not immediately clear what form that group might take we just have n't had time to think it through , mr porter said some democratic governors sought an independent bipartisan blueribbon group of political , business and educational leaders to be named by the president , the governors and congress others argued that , since the governors and the white house had set the goals , they should be responsible for monitoring much of the debate over the last five months revolved around the federal government s role in promoting educational reform , especially in preschool programs democratic governors urged specific commitments like enough money for head start to serve all eligible children republicans echoed the administration s caution about budgetary restraints

ndjamena , chad , feb 1 from start to finish on his latest african pilgrimage , pope john paul ii has sent up danger flares about otherwise welcome developments in eastern europe yes , the polishborn pope said , the budding of democracy is good news , but there is also a risk that the european events will steal attention and desperately needed aid from struggling thirdworld nations there was no letup on this theme , even as the pope wrapped up his fivenation visit today in the chadian capital , where bulletpocked buildings attest to this country s long years of civil war among his last appointments was a speech to the diplomatic corps , and he used the occasion to warn in strong terms that africa needs help and that prime responsibility rests with the most powerful , who have control over the economy , over military aid , over alliances prosperous nations , he said , must recognize the errors , the abuses of power , the injustices and the exploitation that lie behind ageold conflicts , and take steps that advance peace for the good of all people and not just for their own prestige papal feelings about the vast gaps between the rich and the poor seem to run deep after a similar address the other night in ouagadougou , the capital of burkina faso , john paul had dinner with local bishops , and told him he was thankful to have had the opportunity for such a speech if i had n't done it , he said , i could not die in peace when in doubt , kiss as even the most casual popewatcher probably knows , it is john paul s custom upon arriving in a new country to kiss the ground on occasion , the gesture can whisper of political significance , but most times you must remember this a kiss is just a kiss that became clear in ouagadougou when the pope at first hesitated , then knelt and pressed lips to the airport tarmac what did it mean \? was he making a statement \? could he possibly have forgotten that he visited that nation 10 years ago \? if not , was he perhaps signaling his approval of the country s decision in 1984 to abandon its colonial name of upper volta \? the answer , papal aides replied , is none of the above john paul , they said , simply had suffered from momentary confusion about the right thing to do , and , in the end , played it safe after all , no one has ever got into trouble with a redundant kiss of the ground the basilica that is n't a point of curiosity on john paul s sixth trip to africa was a stop that he did not make , the ivory coast apparently , rumors had been strong in the main ivorian city , abidjan , that the pope might make an unscheduled detour to bless an enormous roman catholic basilica , bigger even than st peter s , that president felix houphouetboigny had built in his hometown , yamoussoukro this basilica , its cost estimated unofficially at 150 million or more , has an esplanade that can hold 300 , 000 people it contains 30 acres of marble and four times the stained glass of the french cathedral in chartres it is also the world s largest airconditioned space but for all its grandeur , the basilica of our lady of peace is technically still just an outsized building and not a church because it remains unconsecrated it is said to be the fond hope of the longruling mr houphouetboigny that the pope will come to offer his blessing maybe someday , says the chief vatican spokesman , joaquin navarrovalls but such a trip does not seem likely soon the holy see has clung to the middle ground , calling this a local matter it does not condemn the project , as some in europe have , as an outrageous expenditure for such a poor continent when europe s great cathedrals were built , europeans , too , were mired in poverty and disease , dr navarro acknowledged but clearly the basilica has no one at the vatican jumping for joy it would be nice , the spokesman suggested , if the yamoussoukro compound contained more than the church an institute dedicated to social development would not be a bad idea , dr navarro said praise from the east although the pope s emphasis was on thirdworld problems , he did not leave european issues completely behind the presence of the first soviet journalist on a papal journey underlined the vatican s own rapidly altered , and improved , relations with the eastern bloc the reporter , pavel negoitsa , works in rome for the tradeunion newspaper trud , and he served as sort of a scout for an eventual papal trip to the soviet union that has been proposed by president mikhail s gorbachev judging from his remarks , the vicar of christ can expect good press back in once solidly atheistic moscow mr negoitsa said he admired john paul s simplicity and ease in dealing with people he also appreciated the pope s pleas in behalf of destitute countries , as well as his admonitions , as in his speech here today , that african countries should work together more closely for their mutual benefit if he had a quibble , the man from moscow said , it would be with the lack of specifics in the speeches but on balance he viewed the pope as a great moral force , and not unlike drops of water on a stone in the way he endlessly repeated major themes the stone in this case world opinion ultimately must wear down , mr negoitsa decided , and give in map of ndjamena , chad
following is a transcript of a televised conversation between president saddam hussein and several englishspeaking foreigners held at an undisclosed location in iraq mr hussein s remarks , in arabic , were translated by an iraqi interpreter some sections were inaudible the broadcast was recorded by the new york times from cable news network hussein when did you come here \? a inaudible hussein are all your needs whatever you require available \? a yes , it was hussein does stewart get his milk \? a yes , he does hussein are you getting your milk , stewart \? and with corn flakes , too i do n't think all iraqi kids can get corn flakes do you have any younger ones \? in school \? a i have another , and he s 14 hussein do you have enough a place for exercise \? playing sports or whatever \? a yes a volleyball hussein go on say what you like you were playing volleyball \? boy yes hussein when \? just now \? boy yesterday hussein do you have a team here \? iraqi players \? do you play with iraqis \? do you have a team here \? boy yes hussein do you have any iraqi families with you \? boy no hussein come on please do n't you play anything \? do n't you play games , stewart \? like what \? boy football hussein football you have got talent and the ladies \? how are you passing time \? a \( inaudible \) hussein i ca n't hear you a playing games playing with the children word for shield hussein i'm sure that you 'd prefer to be in britain now yes i am an iraqi and i realize that if i were in your shoes , i 'd rather be in my in iraq , my country but sometimes one is forced to face situations which are not of his own choice your presence here and in other places is meant to prevent the scourge of war , to avoid war in arabic , we say preventing danger there is a semantic and linguistic problem here we , in our communique , used the word , dher \) , which means , to put away , or to prevent , or to avoid the scourge of war , or the danger of war we used the dher which means in arabic to prevent but when we used this word , western media misunderstood the pronunciation of the word dher into dhar , which means shield and they thought that they were using people as a dhar , which means shield , rather than as a dher , which we meant , which means to prevent war so that was a perhaps deliberate misinterpretation or inadvertent misinterpretation of our wording of the communique woman we appreciate that he has come in person simply because nobody else has been able to answer our questions hussein i am here to answer all your questions woman we have schoolgoing children here , right here i have myself got two sons school begins in about in a week s time , on the first of september and some of them are in the middle of important exams and that itself is going to cause immense problems hussein we hope that your presence here is not going to be long woman he is the only man giving answers schooling promised hussein but despite that if , by the time schooling begins , school days begin and you 're still here in iraq , if by the time schooling begins and you 're still here , we are going to exert unusual efforts to make sure that the children are not deprived of their continued schooling and we will send to you experts from the ministry of education to see the curricula and the levels of schooling in which your children are , so that everything that we can prepare should be prepared for the children not to lose the opportunity of schooling because all religions urge us to learn more and more and to continue our learning and in our religion , the first time god almighty addressed his prophet mohammed , praise be upon his soul , through gabriel , god said to mohammed through gabriel , 'read' that was the first instruction and so reading and learning is a fundamental thing in the life of man and we know what it means one would have wished that the kind of coincidence which occurred to you should have been reserved should have been reversed we would love to have a coincidence but to see you in a different kind of situation but it has happened and we are faced with the outcome of acts , some of which have come by chance , by pure coincidence and some of which have come , actually , by deliberate scheming but we , for our part , we shall try to treat you in the same way as we treat iraqis , the people of iraq because you 're not hostages here we ask nothing we want nothing from britain or the united states we want nothing from them we they owe us nothing we want nothing from them we owe them nothing the question should be addressed to them what has iraq taken away from you which has made you come and bring your forces threatening iraq and the lands and territory of god and the muslims \? what has iraq done to deserve this \? taking of kuwait we have taken nothing from london or from any other english or british city we have taken nothing away from the united states we have our viewpoint we have our point of view in politics in any case , the arab nation is one nation it s a single nation british colonial rule scissored away cut away the arab nation all that happened was for this spot , this particular part , called kuwait , has now come back to its motherland
paris , june 8 there is no comparing anyone to andre agassi , at least not with his permission he is very much his own invention and amalgamation , from the hairdo he kind of shares with dweezil zappa to the ground strokes he kind of borrowed from zorro to the las vegas panache with which he punctuates every syllable and gesture under the cloud of metallic hair and the lava pink headband , though , is a talent that has been tamed and timed to erupt at the french open agassi , at 20 years old , is intent on winning his first grand slam tournament , and with a 61 , 64 , 36 , 63 victory over jonas svensson of sweden in the semifinals today , he earned the right to do just that on sunday his opponent will be andres gomez , who has played in 27 grand slam tournaments without reaching a final he won today s other semifinal from thomas muster of austria , 75 , 61 , 75 wo n't settle for second agassi said he was unsurprised and unfulfilled by his progress like any good player , the more that s expected of them , the more they rise to the occasion i did n't stay in paris for two weeks to come in second place agassi makes a point of being different from his peers , but he would have to look hard to locate an opponent more different than gomez gomez , the genial gentle giant from ecuador is , at 30 , a decade older than agassi and , at least on clay , the most practiced candidate in paris this is his 11th visit to this event , and since it has taken so long to reach his first grand slam final , he has the dubious honor of being the first finalist here to hail from the over30 generation since nikki pilic tried and failed to win the french open in 1973 if agassi is a sprinter , gomez , despite shedding 11 pounds this spring , has to be considered a plodder when his smooth , swift serve does n't work and his ferocious forehand fails to stun , he 'll come up to the net and swat the ball until he s gotten his point across long awaited chance gomez has been doing a slow simmer at this tournament for the last 10 years or so but , like agassi , he is primed to prevail this year three times in the quarterfinals gomez s ambitions were detoured by ivan lendl he said he would probably be on the beach somewhere by now had lendl included the french open in his 1990 itinerary instead of worrying about lendl , gomez has had the comparative luxury of shouldering his way through a draw in which he received a fourthround walkover and in which none of his matches has lasted over two hours playing muster , who until today was the most successful player on clay this year , did n't faze the fourthseeded gomez he served fairly well and successfully varied the pace of his shots , disrupting the austrian s attempt to get in a groove afterward , gomez said he felt no anxiety about playing the thirdseeded agassi it s hard to intimidate a 6foot4inch , 200pound person , said gomez , who predicted that agassi s flash and flair would roll off him as easily as had muster s power he can wear whatever he likes this time the best is coming out of me neither of these semifinals was particularly compelling , and both sets of players blamed poor playing conditions both matches were splattered by rain delays , and a chill wind that turned center court into an unpleasant sandbox took its toll on muster s accuracy and svensson s confidence muster said plenty of shots went careening off his racquet frame svensson said a combination of nerves and cold froze him into being a nonthinker for the first half of his match overcomes poor conditions it was n't so much a question of me beating him as who was going to deal with the circumstances better , agassi said the secret is doing what you need to do , and that s what i 've done agassi let svensson handcuff himself in the opening set and raced to a 51 lead when the swede launched a wild forehand at break point in the second set , agassi continued to apply pressure to svensson s serve , pouncing on the ball the instant it bounced and sending it back at improbable angles agassi had already jumped to a 40 lead by the time svensson settled down to business , and although the swede broke back to 34 , he never caught the american , who used a brash service winner to take a twosetstolove lead in the third set , said agassi , his opponent got into a good groove the fourth set was the tightest , with svensson stung by a line call that went against him as he served at 4015 with a 34 disadvantage what he thought was an ace was called long , and agassi went on to break him and served out the match at opponents' mercy the best way of playing tennis is your way , said svensson , who credited his opponent with refining his game since they 'd last met muster was , like svensson , at his opponent s mercy like a modest magician with a mixed bag of tricks , gomez quietly but efficiently unhinged the hardhitting austrian but fitness was no point today , because it never came to the point where fitness paid off , said muster , who drilled himself into condition during his recuperation from knee surgery that he required after being struck by a car last year in miami you feel like you want to go under the ground when you play like this , muster said in review of the respective deficits he failed to cope with in each set , 30 , 50 , and 31 photo andres gomez , left , during his victory over thomas muster , and andre agassi , who beat jonass svensson yesterday in paris \( associated press \)

an artful life a biography of d h kahnweiler , 18841979 by pierre assouline translated by charles ruas illustrated 411 pp new york grove weidenfeld 2495 danielhenry kahnweiler was 23 years old when he opened his first art gallery in paris it occupied a tiny space on the rue vignon , near the madeleine , and its aspiring proprietor did not have a single artist under contract indeed , he had hardly met any the year was 1907 an important date in the history of the paris avantgarde like many of the people who took an avid interest in avantgarde developments in paris at that historic moment , kahnweiler was a foreigner a german jew , born in mannheim , whose prosperous family had expected him to follow tradition by making a career in the stock market or the banking business instead , he decided to become an art dealer , and what was even more shocking a dealer in avantgarde art he knew nothing about the business of selling art , pierre assouline writes in his biography of kahnweiler , knowing more about art itself than about the art market what kahnweiler did possess in large measure , however , was a keen sensibility for the modernist art that was meeting with such adamant hostility from established opinion for those in the know , of course , paris loomed as the international capital of the modern movement the magnet that drew ambitious , independent talent from every corner of the western world but neither the french public nor the french press was yet willing to grant the achievements of the modernists even minimal recognition the rejection of everything avantgarde in paris was still fierce and unforgiving in 1907 , the brunt of this philistine abuse was directed against matisse and the fauves wild beasts who had lately exhibited their audacious paintings in the salon d'automne \( 1905 \) and the salon des independants \( 1906 \) it was indicative of the course kahnweiler set for himself that he promptly got to know matisse and began acquiring pictures by the other fauves andre derain , maurice de vlaminck , georges braque and kees van dongen for his new gallery matisse , though ridiculed in the press with the others , already commanded prices that were too high for kahnweiler to handle at that early stage of his career , and matisse was in any case attached to an established gallery \( bernheimjeune \) none of the others were it was through another german resident in paris the collector and writer wilhelm uhde , who was later to write a book titled picasso and the french tradition that kahnweiler met the artist with whom , above all others , his name would be forever linked pablo picasso was then 26 he had just completed a large painting that left all of his artist friends deeply shocked uhde described it to kahnweiler as assyrian in style , and urged him to see it kahnweiler , who as mr assouline writes knew nothing about picasso , thus went to picasso s studio to have a look at this strange assyrian painting it turned out that picasso had already paid a visit to the gallery in the rue vignon with ambroise vollard , a dealer kahnweiler greatly respected with that irresistible touch of malice the young dealer would soon become familiar with , picasso immediately repeated to kahnweiler a disparaging comment vollard had made about him on that occasion do you know what vollard said to me on leaving your gallery \? picasso asked he said , 'this is a young man whose family gave him a gallery for his first communion' kahnweiler was naturally wounded by this gibe , but he \( characteristically \) sloughed it off he was transfixed by the painting les demoiselles d'avignon , as it was later called when kahnweiler finally saw the painting , mr assouline writes , it came as a complete shock he was astounded at first and then dazzled he felt that something admirable , extraordinary , inconceivable had occurred he was totally unprepared for this vision , and it stunned him it was wonderful , crazy , and monstrous at the same time , and yet moving without a doubt this work was completely new and important for a work of art to be both new and important was already for kahnweiler the key issue , and he had great confidence in his own judgment the next day he returned to picasso s studio to buy some of the paintings that were preliminary studies for les demoiselles as for les demoiselles itself , picasso was n't ready to sell it and kahnweiler was n't then in a position to buy it but a bond of a sort had been established between them at the crucial moment kahnweiler had n't flinched he had in fact responded with genuine excitement equally important , he acted upon his response with prompt cash purchases picasso was touched by his exceptional enthusiasm , mr assouline writes kahnweiler was one of the few people to believe in him completely and absolutely at a moment when picasso had touched bottom from that moment their fates were sealed
jackson , miss , jan 19 mississippi , where one of every three adults is functionally illiterate , is embarking on an ambitious experiment in electronic education put an ibm computer program in every kindergarten and first grade , and try to have every child reading and writing by the end of the first grade the experiment , the first effort to use one computer program throughout a state , is backed by two millionaires who put up money on the condition that the state buy computers from the international business machines corporation and use an ibm program called writing to read while mississippi is overjoyed with the initial results , some educators say the arrangement raises questions about the economic and political forces at work in efforts to improve the educational system , the proper role of technology in education and the power of business leaders to impose their solutions on schools a 7 million contribution part of the money is coming from richard riordan , a california philanthropist who had given the same ibm equipment and software to school districts elsewhere and was sold on the results when an ibm executive suggested that he donate computer programs to an entire state , mr riordan turned to mississippi and found a partner to share the cost he and his partner , richard dowling , a new york city businessman , contributed a total of 7 million for a fiveyear program the state agreed to put up 6 million the gift was seen as manna from heaven by mississippi , which trails most other states in education spending per pupil , teacher salaries and per capita income for ibm , the gift was a business and publicity windfall and for educators and computer specialists , it offered an intriguing case study are computers the best way to tackle illiteracy \? is ibm s phoneticsbased approach , which teaches reading by sounding out words , the right one \? is it better to use one ibm program statewide or to offer a range of other computer education programs \? many mississippians , from gov ray mabus to teachers and students , rave about the program so far , 72 computer centers out of a total of 523 have been installed 'they know more words' they are definitely further along this year , said dorothy jenkins , a kindergarten teacher at boyd elementary school in jackson they know more words we 've not had children at this stage writing stories before i believe we 're going to see a lot of improvement in this state advocates of electronic education say computers are infinitely patient , and they can tailor programs to the needs of each student but educators say computers are no substitute for good teachers or group learning in a classroom the problem with computers in education is that people expect the same kind of wonders that they see in other areas , like medical research , said dr m d roblyer , author of a book evaluating research on computerbased teaching if they 're expecting miracles in mississippi , they 're going to have to try harder a question of choice others question whether a businessman s vision was being imposed on the state because he had the means to make a gift with strings attached it s too bad the teachers in mississippi were n't given a choice , said leroy finkel , coordinator of instructional technology in the san mateo county office of education in california what s just been said to mississippi is there s only one way to do it schools may refuse the computers if they wish , but none have so far governor mabus and dr tom saterfiel , the interim state superintendent of education , said that they did not consider the writing to read program the only way to teach and that it was only part of broader educational changes being planned in mississippi we need to do something dramatic , and this is dramatic , the governor said but it s not the only thing we need to do if something does n't click in writing to read , you 've got to catch them with another teacher , or more time in school a vast potential market computer education represents a vast potential market in the 198788 academic year , elementary and high schools spent a total of 210 million on educational software , said natasha thomsen , an analyst at link resources she estimated that by the end of 1988 schools had installed 25 million computers the ibm program is based on the idea that children come to school knowing many more words than they can read or write , and many more than most textbooks teach them in the early grades by teaching children 42 phonemes , or lettersound combinations , and encouraging them to spell words any way they hear them , the program seeks to have children write down words they can say and read what they write in onehour daily sessions , children rotate through a series of computers and learning stations at the boyd school in jackson the other day , daisy carter , a kindergarten pupil , put on a headset and began to study her words and sounds for that day she saw the letters vas flash on the computer screen , along with a picture of a vase and its proper spelling as she heard a voice on the computer say each sound , she repeated it , typed it on the keyboard and then typed the whole word
erato the french label that had until last year been distributed here by rca but has now been taken up by elektra classics is back and so , too , is armin jordan mr jordan is not especially well known on this side of the atlantic , and there probably are n't a great many collectors who have been waiting in breathless anticipation for new releases from the swiss conductor but mr jordan happens to be a fine conductor who has made a valuable contribution to the erato catalogue mostly by reviving important but neglected late 19th and early 20thcentury french works by dukas , chabrier , faure and chausson and if it was the music on those releases , rather than the conductor , that attracted most of the attention , there are worse things to be said about a performer than that he selflessly serves worthy music still , mr jordan does seem to have a problem drawing the spotlight in his direction even his most ambitious project to date , a wellreceived 1982 recording of parsifal , once available on erato , is remembered primarily as the soundtrack for hansjurgen syberberg s stunning film of wagner s opera , despite mr jordan s unusual contribution , which included not only conducting the music but also acting the role of amfortas in the movie now , however , mr jordan can no longer be ignored in its first largescale release under the elektra umbrella , erato has simultaneously issued three major new recordings under his direction , all of them on cd only two of them schumann s oratorio das paradies und die peri \( 2292454562 \) and edouard lalo s opera le roi d'ys \( 245 0152 \) continue mr jordan s interest in outoftheway repertory the third is mozart s magic flute \( 2292454692 \) , and a new recording of that , one of the world s most beloved and intriguing operas , is always news and while mr jordan s parsifal has never been reissued on compact disk , the syberberg film , with the complete opera performance as soundtrack , is available on a corinth video laserdisk set \( id6420co three disks \) there is an ad hoc feeling to the new erato releases , since other than featuring mr jordan , they appear to be entirely dissimilar projects not only are the works themselves stylistically unrelated , but the recordings share no cast members and were all made with different orchestras and choruses about the only thing duplicated among the sets is the same unflattering , sunkeneyed blackandwhite photograph of mr jordan on the back of the booklets still , these are splendid performances , and the conductor s accomplishment is all the more impressive given that mr jordan is nowhere afforded a great orchestra or especially stellar casts moreover , whereas he faces little recorded competition for the schumann and lalo , his magic flute must be judged against very high standards mr jordan is a middleoftheroad mozartean , which means he does not demonstrate interest in the light textures or fleet tempos of the periodinstrument movement and avoids the other extreme of making momentously weighty statements yet if this seems one more instance of the conductor courting anonymity , mr jordan offsets that by leading a performance that can be both forceful and elegant , one alert to the opera s sharp contrasts between light and dark most significantly , though , mr jordan s performance here and in the other new recordings as well is a mystical one that builds to a particularly satisfying spiritual catharsis at the end mr jordan is also lucky in his cast , which sounds mostly fresh and heavenly of special note are gosta winbergh s wonderfully refined tamino and luba orgonasova s radiant pamina sumi jo is the spectacularly secure \( if studied \) queen of the night hakan hagegard his usual mellifluous papageno and with mr jordan also obtaining a luminous sound from the ensemble orchestral de paris , this is the kind of set that can only enhance his reputation neither das paradies und die peri and le roi d'ys are quite such unqualified successes , but then both are problematic works schumann s ambitious score , written shortly after his second symphony , begins as if it could be the great 19thcentury oratorio but ultimately thomas moore s gooey gothic poem about a hapless peri \( whatever that is \) who tries to get into heaven defeats the composer , who ca n't quite rise to the uninhibited mahlerian climax the work needs still , the good parts really are firstrate schumann , and mr jordan s refusal to dawdle makes for a intensely committed and fairly convincing performance , with perfectly acceptable playing from the orchestre de la suisse romande the mezzo soprano ann gjevang is the most attractive of the half dozen vocal soloists mr jordan is also fervent in his approach to lalo s roi d'ys , another muddled 19thcentury gothic tale with occasional memorable moments most of those moments are in the orchestra , lalo being a precursor of the impressionists , and mr jordan , who in this case leads the orchestre philharmonique de radio france , illuminates them all otherwise the opera , which concerns the jealous rivalry of two sisters in love with the same man and requires divine intervention , is a pretty silly , onedimensional drama , even by 19thcentury standards there are opportunities for the sisters to shine , however , and barbara hendricks and dolores ziegler are impressive a reacquaintance with mr jordan s parsifal performance demonstrates that none of this spiritual intensity is new for the conductor , and even his acting in the syberberg film \( actors lipsync the roles \) is one of the movie s most dramatic and convincing performances the film itself is brilliant but extremely weird and pretentious , full of inexplicable symbols and , most curious of all , a transformation of parsifal from a young boy into a girl beware , though , that while the laserdisk is visually stunning , the soundtrack for much of the first act was transferred with intrusive wow and flutter , enough to spoil the music mr jordan deserves better photo armin jordan s latest recordings include a schumann oratorio and operas by lalo and mozart \( steve j sherman

philadelphia , march 13 hank gathers has been dead for almost 10 days and as his family , close friends and teammates begin the healing process , the question that remains unanswered is how much did the loyola marymount star s determination to use basketball as a means to a better life for his family contribute to his untimely death \? those who can shed light on the question , including his doctors , are not talking and the man who knows is dead , tragically , at the age of 23 what comes across consistently and clearly , however , from close friends from grade school to college was that gathers had determined early that basketball would be his route to fame and that he worked feverishly to follow that road last year , gathers , when asked how basketball fit into his scheme of things , said i saw basketball as a way of getting out of the neighborhood i used to come home from basketball practice after my freshman year in high school at about 9 or 10 o'clock at night i 'd look up at tall buildings and i 'd say to myself 'i 've got to get out of here i'm tired of this place there s got to be more to life than this place right here' sidney green , a forward with the orlando magic , recalled meeting gathers last summer at a basketball camp at loyola marymount in los angeles he was like a hungry tiger , green recalled you could see in his eyes that he wanted to be out there with us he talked to everyone about it , and he said that he could n't wait until he got there he just wanted to show everyone up you could tell in his body and his mind that he lived a clean life and that he knew what he had to do to become a professional basketball player rob cannon , who was gathers s roommate last season when he became only the second player in national collegiate athletic association history to lead the nation in scoring and rebounding in the same season , was similarly struck by gathers s relentless commitment he had a poster in his room that said 'last year the nation s leading rebounder averaged 125 rebounds per game , ' recalled cannon 'you can average 135 if you grab every rebound , every time' he lived by that he had another sign over his bed that had what the nation s leading scorer averaged the season before and it ended with the question 'can you beat that \? yes you can' there was another sign that asked 'did you do the very best you could today \? ' hank s attitude was a blessing to me and the one thing i 'll always remember is that he had an overwhelming desire to be the best , he was positive and he worked harder than anybody showed sign of vulnerability on dec 9 , gathers collapsed at the foul line in a game against the university of californiasanta barbara it was the first time that anyone could remember that gathers , who encouraged the notion of his invincibility , had showed signs of vulnerability i was worried for about a split second , recalled bo kimble , who began playing with gathers in the eighth grade and was his teammate through high school , at the university of southern california and at loyola i saw he was talking to the trainer , i threw him a towel , he was saying , 'i'm all right i'm all right' a couple of weeks later he said he did n't even remember me throwing him the towel he was n't even conscious gathers was up within a couple of minutes , but sat out the rest of the game he was subsequently tested and diagnosed as having an irregularity in his heartbeat he missed a week of practice and two games before he was cleared to play by team doctors on the condition that he be brought back gradually he was placed on medication that would restore a regular heartbeat shortly after gathers collapsed during a game on march 4 and died shortly afterward in a hospital , however , an unidentified cardiologist was quoted as having said that gathers had been told by his doctors that he was suffering from a serious heart ailment that could endanger his life if he continued playing at the same time , the team doctors , without consulting with university officials or the head coach , purchased a defibrillation machine such machines are used to restore a normal heartbeat of a patient whose heart is beating erratically while a number of close friends said they detected a change in gathers immediately after the december fainting incident , none have said they heard him talk about any warning and the consensus among them was that his extroverted nature would not have allowed him to keep such a secret if there was something bothering hank , i have no doubt that he would have mentioned something to me , kimble said he would have mentioned it in the form of a joke , or a question or something he would n't have kept it in he 'd know i 'd give him an honest answer kimble said he did n't feel that gathers was so eager to play professionally that he would risk his life to play hank admired himself and he loved himself , kimble said i remember how he used to take out his clothes to the cleaner folded up as if they were clean then he 'd get all decked out just to go to the store he admired himself and he loved himself he would n't have played if he thought it would have killed him became more introspective whatever gathers knew or did n't know , close friends did notice that gathers became more introspective
saddam hussein , the president of iraq , bet that kuwait was vulnerable and it was so were most of the world s markets , which tumbled dramatically after iraq s invasion of the emirate last week as the outlook clouded for oil prices , inflation , economic growth and the balance of power in the middle east the markets had been under stress before the invasion interest rates around the world are high many economies are slowing or are growing more slowly than anticipated earnings reports are coming in lower than expected and the prospect is for less to come the amercan stock market was weakening and japan s was already reeling west germany s market was worried by higher interest rates and , again , the cost of german unification italy has problems with its coalition government britain is near a recession hong kong , which had been reaching new heights regularly , was stunned by the invasion , which sent the hang seng index tumbling by 11169 points or 34 percent oilrich norway , whose allshare index had been propelled to new highs four days last week by rising oil prices and the expectation that they would rise further after the invasion , fell 16 percent friday under the weight of inflationary fears we 've been skittish on these markets anyway , said madhav dhar , global strategist for morgan stanley company in new york this was not a healthy environment we expected markets to roll off anyway and this will aggravate that cliche though it is , the only certainity now is uncertainity and it alone is enough to roil stock markets the unknown what the iraqi leader might do next kept traders and analysts close to their computer screens friday and responding by buying dollars as a safe haven or dumping stocks because of inflationary and interest rate fears to bulletins like state department says iraqi troops within six miles of saudi border or shevardnadze says ussr 'has been assured' iraq to pull out soon but about as fast as the iraqi forces moved into kuwait city , economists and analysts around the world were examining the longerterm impact , pushing numbers through their black boxes and churning out estimates of the inflationary , interest rate and economic growth consequences both of the invasion and of higher oil prices these scenarios , none of them very good , will be digested by investors this week and should add to the downward pressure on markets kieth skeoch , chief economist at james capel company in london , estimates that with a 25 per barrel price for oil , inflation in the united states , japan , west germany , britain , france , italy and canada could be fivetenths of 1 percentage point higher in the next year and economic growth could be cut by as much as fourtenths of 1 percentage point from what it might have been for the united states and britain , whose economies could be near the brink of a recession already , this not comforting guy rigdon , director of strategy at ubs phillips drew in london , said he expected interest rates in europe will be pushed up about half of a percentage point and in japan , he said , the oil price rise \( he is also assuming 25 a barrel \) will insure that the bank of japan will raise the official discount rate , now 525 percent , and keep interest rates higher longer he estimates that , based on this rise in interest rates , tokyo s nikkei 225 index , which fell 44 percent last week to close at 29 , 51576 , should drop below 28 , 000 , the low it reached during the market collapse in the first quarter of the year in europe , he expects that markets could fall 10 percent to 20 percent from where they were last week , west germany was down 41 percent britain , whose decline was somewhat offset by the positive effect of higher oil prices on its north sea oil production , fell 20 percent france , 49 percent , spain , 55 percent , and italy , 47 percent merrill lynch , according to its chief international equity strategist , thomas robinson , has already changed its investment levels in several markets , cutting them in japan and the united states and raising them in the few countries that will beneift from higher oil prices , like norway , or are not as dependent on oil , like switzerland
lawmakers and regulators in trenton should alter new jersey s system of public financing for gubernatorial candidates to reflect the realities of modern political life the state s election law enforcement commission , which monitors all of new jersey s campaign laws , held a day of hearings last week to consider such changes in the wake of the recent election at the heart of the system is a gubernatorial expenditure limit , which prohibits candidates who accept public funds from spending more than 5 million during a general election the most important change to be made is to raise this limit or eliminate it entirely limiting our gubernatorial candidates to a 5 million spending ceiling ignores the basic fact that the costs of running an effective campaign continue to rise sharply irrespective of the cap on spending moreover , the price of political advertising in the new york and philadelphia media markets is higher than in any other part of the nation finally , after a candidate pays the high price of mass communications , there is little left over to finance the more traditional methods of attracting voters at the grassroots level thus , the expenditure limit has dampened involvement by average citizens within the system itself in a report published two years ago , the election commission recognized the rising costs of campaigns and reaffirmed its longheld position that the expenditure limit be abolished completely the commission also analyzed the type of expenditures from the 1985 governor s race , finding that a full 84 percent were for mass communications and political advertising it s a safe bet that a similar analysis of floriocourter expenditures would show a percentage of spending for these same purposes , as high as if not higher than the 1985 figure the current system has also given rise to the vocal \( some would say , noisy \) participation of specialinterest groups these independent groups and the political parties have become wild cards in the system because spending by them is not subject to the 5 million limit in 1989 , for example , the state democratic party raised and spent about 10 million , none of which was counted against the expenditure limit of its gubernatorial nominee add to that amount the nearly 500 , 000 spent by groups , like the national abortion rights action league and the national organization for women , and the amounts belonging to the actual gubernatorial candidates appear pale by comparison because the law prohibits the gubernatorial candidates from coordinating activities among the independent entities that expend these large amounts , the candidates themselves are being forced in some cases to bow to a political agenda not of their own doing hence , there is a real danger that unless we raise the expenditure limit , future gubernatorial candidates may become only junior players in deciding the outcome of their own election the 5 million gubernatorial limit also seems meager as compared with expenditures by candidates for the united states senate senator frank lautenberg , for instance , spent about 8 million to win reelection in 1988 , while his challenger , pete dawkins , spent a similar amount furthermore , in this year s race , senator bill bradley has amassed about 10 million to spend as needed campaigns for the governor s office are no less important than senate races and no less expensive yet our major gubernatorial candidates are forced to campaign on a significantly smaller budget the current limit also favors the incumbent or , if there is no incumbent , the candidate who is better known at the outset of the race gov jim florio s advantage as the incumbent will materially benefit his reelection in 1993 it is difficult to argue otherwise similarly , when gov thomas kean faced reelection in 1985 , republican prospects were advanced considerably by the powers of incumbency the current expenditure limit is simply too low to offset these advantages hence , the limit protects the status quo the election commission and the legislature should consider increasing the limit while there is time to discuss the issue without the pressure of an impending election when the limit was last raised in early 1989 , the gubernatorial candidates had already begun campaigning , which allowed partisan politics to govern the debate we should start now thinking about 1993 raising the gubernatorial limit will usher our program of public finance into a new decade it would vastly improve the current law by relieving the political parties and other organizations of the pressure to raise funds , and creating an even playing field for future candidates by not raising the limit , we ignore political reality and risk hampering development of what is truly a model system
san pedro jocopilas , guatemala celso milagro , who was running for mayor , died on a cobblestone street here , holding the hand of his 3yearold daughter mr milagro , the popular candidate of the national center union , was killed while walking to market several weeks ago by a lone gunman who stepped out of the milling crowd and shot him four times in the chest revenge was apparently exacted 18 days later this time sebastian morales , a regional director of the ruling christian democratic party , who was backing mr milagro s rival , was the victim he was passing the small cemetery on his way home from an independenceeve party when he was ambushed and killed the slayings in this hilltop town of 16 , 000 people 120 miles northwest of guatemala city reflect the wave of political violence that has swept over guatemala as it prepares for presidential , legislative and municipal elections in november small town , big hell , jorge skinner klee , a leading congressman from the national center union , said in an interview in his booklined guatemala city study politics are so much more bitter at the local level the confrontation is so much more immediate the coming election is to lead to a democratic watershed for guatemala the first time in the country s history that power is to be transferred from one elected civilian to another but despite new highwater mark for the democratic process , the campaign is focusing attention on what many here consider as the failures of president vinicio cerezo , guatemala s first civilian president in almost two decades , to build a foundation for democracy law enforcement is often little more than a political tool the chief of police in quiche , the departmental capital , whose responsibilities embrace jocopilas , said in an interview he had not bothered to open an investigation into the killings he said he did not see any point in driving the 10 miles to the scene of the crime we only go to pick up cadavers , said a patrolman at police headquarters the spiraling political violence and common crime has coincided with a drawnout depression , which has left 7 in 10 guatemalans struggling below the poverty line and aroused demands for political change the frontrunner , in most surveys , is the main opposition party , the national center union , an amalgamation of rightists led by jorge carpio nicolle , a guatemala city newspaper publisher spur to general s campaign increasingly , many guatemalans have begun to equate democracy with anarchy and this is seen as favoring the lawandorder campaign of gen efrain rios montt , a former dictator who ruled with an iron fist in the early 1980 s , when thousands were killed in his campaign against a leftist insurgency among his supporters are many who remember his 16month tenure not for the death toll or other violence , but for what they recall as its stability he s an order man , but not a lawman , congressman klee said in reference to general rios montt despite the polls showing mr carpio to be in the lead , there are many election anaylsts who say it is conceivable that the general could win a majority in the first round of the balloting , provided he can get around a constitutional provision that bars former dictators from coming to power , though it does not keep them from running for office the general s aides are hoping to stall the court response until after the elections on the assumption that the decision of the judges will be less meaningful than the mandate of the electorate meanwhile , the killings here and the police chief s reaction are by no means exceptional at least one congressman and several other municipal candidates have been slain as have a couple of prominent businessmen linked to president cerezo and other leading politicians most of the victims tend to be far less wellknown than the two men killed here their mutilated bodies are found in the morning by the roadside and quickly buried as xxs , a designation that after decades of political violence has become the guatemalan equivalent of john doe this society first opened up to political debate and popular organizing in the days after mr cerezo s 1986 inauguration increasingly , however , intimidation and fear spread , leading guatemalans to avoid taking public stances or calling attention to themselves although mr milagro was killed on a crowded market street in front of dozens maybe even hundreds of witnesses , not one has come forward to identify the killer with real live and thus vulnerable candidates shrinking from public view , the violence has turned the campaign into something of a battle of the billboards , which bedeck almost every vertical surface in the capital and every utility pole in the countryside traveling with protection harris whitbeck , the running mate of general rios montt , never travels without what he calls his tank a bloodred jeep its inchthick armor and bulletproof glass force him to use the airconditioning whenever he is in the car and have given him a permanent cold congressman klee , whose greatgrandfather came here as a prussian consul , notes that colleagues call him crazy for walking the couple of blocks from his law office to the legislature under current conditions , there can be no democracy for the country there can only be elections among a small privileged club , philip heymann , the director of the center for criminal justice at harvard law school , said recently in testifying before the united states congress about why he had decided to abandon a threeyearold effort to build a justice system in guatemala here in jocopilas , mr milagro s murder had led to the near collapse of the center union campaign what began as a serious challenge to the dominant christian democrats has turned into something of a beauty contest with one competitor it should have been a civic festival , acknowledged carlos lopez giron , the party s senior official in the department but we 're not ready there are lies , rumors and attacks most polls show mr cerezo s christian democrats as being widely unpopular its candidate , alfonso cabrera , handpicked as mr cerezo s successor , is trailing badly but in a largely illiterate country , the polls are considered little more than an indicator of sentiment in the capital , where about a quarter of the 33 million registered voters live many politicians and analysts predict that the governing party s organizational muscle in rural areas like jocopilas could propel it into the january runoff , provided none of the 13 candidates receives a majority in the november balloting constitutional hurdle but first , the country must overcome the looming constitutional crisis posed by general rios montt s challenge to the constitutional provision that would seem to preclude his assuming power mr whitbeck , the general s running mate , said their small army of lawyers is planning a barrage of motions to delay a court ruling until after the voting asked what would happen if the courts deny their petition to be on the ballot , he said if they say no , they 'll be saying no in february or march by then , it will be the will of the people , not part of the politicians' game many guatemalans fear that such a strategy represents a formula for political chaos in a country where the recent history is a story of coups , there is widespread speculation about how much turmoil the divided , the politically powerful army would tolerate for the moment , we 've got the devil bottled up in his barracks , congressman klee said but who can say for how long \? photo guatemala s rocky experience with democracy has advanced the lawandorder presidential campaign of gen efrain rios montt , a former dictator

as if egged on by increasing doses of sunlight , exhibitions of photography seem to have sprung up like so many rogue narcissus this month appropriately , many of the shows that are on view this weekend are fashionable blooms , in that they take their cues largely from fashion and its amiable cohort , glamour fashion obviously provides an attractive subject for photographers , since it helps define our ideas about beauty but its relationship to art remains unsettled , as shows of work as divergent as that of irving penn , lee miller and george hurrell make clear all three have created pictures that have one foot in fashion and deserve to be called art , although for quite different reasons elsewhere the focus is on thornier matters , like the current state of the art of photography in the soviet union , the depressionera documentaries of marion post wolcott , and the latest innovations from the downtown art world ethnologists know that the mere act of observing unavoidably alters what is observed a fact that could be taken as the starting premise of irving penn s portrait photographs of peoples outside the orbit of western culture originally collected in the book worlds in a small room , and now on view at both the pace macgill and pace galleries \( the ninth and third floors of 32 east 57th street \) through may 5 , these images from places like cameroon , dahomey , morocco , new guinea and peru are stamped with the photographer s delicate , sophisticated and always respectful eye one could say they reveal as much about their maker as about their subjects mr penn , who is most widely known as a fashion and stilllife photographer , began this series in 1948 , when he temporarily set up shop in a local photographer s studio in cuzco , peru the results were published in vogue and so captivated the magazine s readers that he was asked to repeat the feat on subsequent journeys , he took along a portable , tentlike studio that provided the smooth backgrounds and crisp northern light that are his stylistic trademarks the exhibition , called irving penn other ways of being , includes 100 blackandwhite prints and coincides with a retrospective of mr penn s work at the national portrait gallery in washington the reference to other ways of being may be taken in several ways most of the individuals in the new york show , from new guinean tribesmen decorated with mud to moroccan women wrapped head to toe in muslin , are clearly from cultures outside the realm of readers of vogue they are also outside the realm of western fashion , an arena to which mr penn has always maintained an ambivalent attachment this is not to say , however , that they are antifashion statements , for as mr penn s pictures demonstrate , these other cultures have their own styles of dress and makeup the young women of the cameroon have scarred their gleaming skin to make themselves more beautiful the children of peru wear suits , dresses and hats just like adults the new guinean warriors wear masks of ingenious \( and laborintensive \) complexity to drive home the point that fashion is not the exclusive province of paris and new york , the exhibition includes samples of mr penn s pictures from the hippie era of the 1960 s these surprisingly somber portraits , of longhaired nuclear families , hell s angels members and rock groups like the grateful dead and big brother and the holding company , suggest that otherness is closer to home than one might have imagined the other reference to otherness implicit in the show concerns mr penn himself , who is presented not as a commercially successful editorial and advertising photographer but as a serious artist just how serious his intentions are can be seen in most of the prints , which were made by the demanding and expensive platinumpalladium process curiously , however , the other prints on view vintage versions of his 1948 peruvian images made with conventional blackandwhite materials seem more precious and more compelling lee miller if irving penn s career has shifted over the years away from fashion and toward art , lee miller s could be said to have gone from art to journalism starting out as an apprentice to man ray in the surrealistsaturated paris of the 1920 s , miller maintained an allegiance to experimentation and disruption in both her photographs and her life but when she found herself caught up in world war ii , as the official war correspondent of vogue , her pictures and her attitudes changed drastically ninetysix of miller s images go on view today at the international center of photography midtown \( 1133 avenue of the americas , at 43d street , through june 10 \) she had such a remarkable life that her photographs can seem pale by comparison the largest and most striking images in the show are two portraits of miller in her 20 s , when she was an international model renowned for her beauty as a studio photographer , she specialized in portraits , some of which are solarized in the manner of man ray , but her forte during the 1930 s was recording mysterious sidelights of everyday life these odd images of a doll in a bell jar , man ray s face covered with shaving cream , an exploding hand are among the treasures of surrealist photography
manhattan a man shooting darts through a homemade dart pipe has struck two more women in midtown , making the total of victims 26 , the police said both attacks were on tuesday on 33d street east of seventh avenue , when the women were struck in the buttocks , at 5 30 pm and at 7 pm , a spokesman for the police , lieut raymond o 'donnell , said the attacks , which began on june 26 , follow a similar pattern the attacker blows darts at the backs or buttocks of women in the area between 32d and 54th streets and between fifth to seventh avenues , lieutenant o 'donnell said the attacker uses a homemade dart wrapped in paper and blown through a strawlike device none of the women have been hospitalized the police asked people with information on the case to call \( 212 \) 5980071 officers of the guardian angels said 50 members would patrol the areas of the attacks starting today
newark if there is any reward in architecture to staying the course , it is to be seen right here on washington street , where the newark museum has recently completed a 21 million reconstruction and expansion the architect the museum hired was michael graves not the internationally famous michael graves of today , architect of whitney museum additions and walt disney world hotels , but the young and struggling michael graves of 1967 , a faculty member at the princeton university school of architecture that was the year mr graves was recommended to the newark museum s director , samuel c miller , as a talented comer in those days mr graves was supplementing his teaching salary by designing a few modest house additions , and the invitation to design the museum represented his bid for the big time he ended up with a long wait , and the museum with an even longer one right after hiring him mr miller asked mr graves to plan a major expansion to the museum , but money problems in the wake of newark s riots made it impossible to build anything architect and client kept in touch , however , with mr graves doing a few small jobs for the museum as his career began , slowly , to take off by 1982 , when the city of newark gave the museum an abandoned ywca next door to its original building , at last making possible the expansion that had first been envisioned in the 1960 s , mr graves had grown so successful that the newark museum was no longer the big opportunity it had been in the 60 s , but a small job he set to work anyway mr graves was nothing if not loyal to his first bigtime client , a client that has remained steadfastly loyal to him as well virtually nothing of the design he and mr miller had created in the 1960 s could be of use in the 1980 s , however , since both the nature of the expansion that the museum wanted and mr graves s own architectural style had changed radically in the 15 years since the first contacts had taken place the museum , which once thought it would be building a completely new addition , now wanted to renovate and join together its two old buildings and the newly acquired ywca mr graves , an ardent modernist in the 1960 s , by the 1980 s had become an outspoken advocate of postmodern classicism , evolving a highly personal vocabulary of color and decoration but the reconstructed newark museum , which opened to the public in november , turns out to be one of mr graves s most successful efforts it is relatively restrained as mr graves s work goes surely not as flamboyant as the portland building , the brightly colored municipal building mr graves designed in oregon that , along with philip johnson and john burgee s att building in new york , forced postmodern architecture into the public eye neither is it as lavish as mr graves s skyscraper headquarters for humana inc in louisville , or as whimsical as his hotels at walt disney world in orlando , or as problematic as his still unbuilt design for an addition to the whitney museum of american art in new york a project that has been the focus of sharp public debate since it was first unveiled in 1985 and which has been radically redesigned twice \( with the forced resignation earlier this month of its major booster , the whitney s director , tom armstrong , the graves addition for the whitney now seems less likely than ever to see the light of day \) the michael graves we see in newark is calmer , less fussy , more boiled down to the essentials than the graves we see elsewhere there is none of the sense of simply too much architecture for the problem at hand , as there sometimes is in mr graves s work instead , there is a splendid rigor and clarity the redesigned newark museum is mostly a matter of interiors it has only two gravesian elements on the outside , a new entrance for school groups set into the red brick side of the former ywca building , and a new public entrance in the rear of the main museum building , facing the garden and parking area the new entrances , both of stucco , are monumental but blunt , austere pieces of strippeddown classicism that have been set in deliberate contrast to the red brick , industriallooking walls of the back and sides of the older buildings there was no attempt to make this falsely pretty , or to deny the fact that the red brick walls of these older buildings are the reality of this place from anywhere other than the original , triplearched limestone facade on washington street which remains the museum s official front , and is untouched the newark museum looks like a renovated factory although something more elaborate would have given the project more impact on the cityscape , and newark a more conspicuous symbol of renewal , the rationale for leaving the outside plain is understandable enough it was the only way to stretch a tight budget to permit 66 , 000 square feet of new and renovated gallery space \( the museum s exhibit area has nearly doubled in the expansion

mark franko is a renaissancedance scholar and a moderndance choreographer and performer he has named his fiveyearold company novantiqua and so his newest piece , characters of dance , presented on thursday at the douglas dunn studio , seemed likely to be a blending of two very different styles of dance or , as mr franko described another piece , a collage or evocation of style characters of dance , a suite of ensemble numbers and solos which takes its title from a baroque suite composed by jeanferry rebel , was none of those things instead , it was an unsimmered stew of elements set to a collage of music that ranged from rameau to pierre henry whose period references were pretty much abandoned in its second and closing section until a final reprise two sequences suggested what characters of the dance might have been and what it was the first was a sliver of a duet for women , set to intriguingly understated music with a tango beat the duet was a teasing , delicate little gloss on the tango that drew on both popular dancing and modern dance one of the problems of characters of dance was its feeling of appropriation rather than assimilation the first section makes a brief bow to semiotics and square dancing it also includes a group sequence set to music from the fourth act of swan lake , in which one dancer seemed to be impersonating von rothbart , the sorcerer , and the others behaved like dancers backstage and at rehearsal swan lake certainly lends itself to parody or borrowing , but , like evocations of antique dance , it needs a consuming as well as informed involvement characters of the dance might have looked better on a larger , more formal stage and it was a pity that mr franko s dancers were encouraged to mug so much as they assumed their characters the performers were loretta abbott , candice christakos , juliet neidish , jim eavenson , don prosch and osamu uehara the stylish costumes were designed by mr franko and susan hogan kathy kaufmann designed the lighting
dream song the life of john berryman by paul mariani illustrated 519 pages william morrow company 2995 i consider a song will be as hummingbird swift , downlight , missilemetalhard , strange as the world of antimatter where they are wondering does time run backward which the poet thought was true scarlattisupple but can henry write it \? in these lines from dream song 103 , john berryman articulated his poetic credo , and through his fictional doppelganger henry a white american in early middle age , who has suffered an irreversible loss he expressed his own ferocious ambitions and doubts as a writer as the collected dream songs incontestably demonstrate , berryman would suceed in turning the griefs and losses of his own life into strange , swift songs at once intimate and epic and wholly american and in doing so , he would stake his claim as one of the preeminent poets of his generation late in coming , the recognition berryman achieved in middle age brought him little solace from the private demons that stalked his nightmares this world is gradually becoming a place where i do not care to be any more , he wrote in dream song 149 on jan 7 , 1972 , he climbed over the railing of the washington avenue bridge that links st paul and minneapolis and jumped to his death he was 57 years old the sad , ironic selfportraits berryman set down in the dream songs and his later confessional poems remain the best spiritual biography of the poet , though in recent years , friends and family members have given us some wonderfully immediate glimpses of the man they knew and loved in a finely drawn memoir \( poets in their youth \) , berryman s first wife , eileen simpson , vividly conjured up the hectic literary world they 'd shared in the early days of their marriage with delmore schwartz , randall jarrell and robert lowell and in an essay written shortly after berryman s death , saul bellow took a couple of short paragraphs to make the reader understand what it was about his friend that he loved , what it was that made daily life for the poet such an arduous and precarious operation john s human setting was oddly thin , mr bellow wrote he had instead of a society , the ruined drunken poet s god to whom he prayed over his shoulder out of affection and goodwill he made gestures of normalcy he was a husband , a citizen , father , a householder , he went on the wagon , he fell off , he joined aa he knocked himself out to be like everybody else he liked , he loved , he cared , but he was aware that there was something peculiarly comical in all this and at last it must have seemed that he had used up all his resources for this reader at least , mr bellow s brief reminiscence provides a better sense of berryman as a man and poet than all the hundreds of pages in paul mariani s voluminous new biography a poet and scholar , mr mariani the author of an earlier biography of william carlos williams approaches his subject with diligence and respect he dutifully traces the influence of yeats and gerard manley hopkins on berryman s youthful work , and he gives the reader a fascinating account of the poet s discovery of his own voice in the dazzling poem homage to mistress bradstreet his discussion of berryman s masterwork , the dream songs , however , is oddly perfunctory , and his portrait of the poet himself feels bloodless and unreal instead of standing back and trying to give the reader an understanding of the poet s imaginative life , mr mariani simply sets down facts , thousands of facts where berryman lectured , where he taught , what he read , what he drank , whom he wrote letters to and whom he slept with the result is a numbing chronological account that documents the poet s every flirtation , every argument , every drunken spree , but that fails to illuminate the landscape of his psyche or the sources of his verse in detailing the traumatic events that shaped berryman s childhood when he was 12 his father committed suicide and his mother remarried mr mariani does little to show how these events would reverberate throughout the poet s work he drily notes that berryman s mother was alternately suffocating and accusatory , then goes on to point out that the poet s later difficulties with women may well have had roots in this volatile relationship it s the sort of obvious , simplistic observation that barely probes the surface of the obsessive and highly manipulative relationship revealed by berryman s own letters to his mother letters that were recently collected in a revealing volume edited by richard j kelly and titled we dream of honour \( w w norton company \) mr mariani s depiction of berryman s other relationships tends to be similarly opaque none of his three wives emerge as distinct individuals each is simply portrayed as a longsuffering helpmate and his famous colleagues including lowell , schwartz and jarrell appear only as poorly sketched cameos , against whose achievement berryman could measure his own in fact the berryman who emerges from this volume is an aggressively ambitious man competitive , arrogant , selfish and selfpitying he s someone who continually tries to steal his best friends' girlfriends , then asks for indulgence someone who nearly comes to blows with colleagues over differences of opinion someone who cruelly belittles his students' verse in order to reduce the size of a poetry workshop as his drinking binges increased in intensity and frequency , berryman found himself dismissed from teaching jobs and humiliated in public all three marriages collapsed , and his health deteriorated to the point where he was commuting regularly to the hospital in one of his late poems , he summarized his life as consisting of scimmages with women , laziness , liquor , bad dreams and singular moments of getting certain things absolutely right photo john berryman \( tom berthiaume \)
at the center for constitutional rights , mahlon f perkins jr is something of an oddball among its young , polyglot legal staff , he is a 71yearold patrician , who looks and speaks like robert frost his colleagues wear beards or blue jeans he favors herringbone trousers they like rock music he watches birds they come to work by subway he takes the 9 17 from greenwich but incongruity is not his chief distinction ten years ago , in a scandal that rocked the wall street bar , mr perkins , then counsel for kodak , admitted lying in a antitrust case brought against his client by berkey photo after almost 30 years at donovan , leisure , newton irvine , one of manhattan s most prominent law firms , he left in disgrace then he was sentenced to a month in prison , an extraordinary punishment for a lawyer of his stature and reputation in sentencing mr perkins , federal district judge robert ward a harvard law school classmate of his mourned a career ended and a reputation destroyed that assessment , it turns out , was premature in an ending that is not only happy but also quite unforseeable , mr perkins has come back , reincarnated as a civil liberties lawyer three days each week , mr perkins volunteers his services at the center , which handles primarily civil rights , first amendment and criminal justice cases in his former life , he represented institutions like the american association of advertising agencies and the hughes tool company , and earned 200 , 000 a year doing it now , his clients include corazon aquino , president of the philippines the white earth band of chippewa indians , and harvard alumni seeking south african divestiture and he serves them without pay , living off past earnings where once he occupied a stately office on the 34th floor of 30 rockefeller plaza , with a panoramic view of central park , mr perkins now works out of a tiny 7thfloor rectangle overlooking the discount houses of lower broadway the lacquered chinese cabinets that decorated his office , reminders of his days in china , have given way to battered battleshipgrayfile cabinets no more perquisites all of the perquisites of corporate law practice the secretaries , the tea cart , the lunch clubs are gone , but so , too , are the time sheets , the pressures and the brooks brothers suits , a change that especially pleases him i 've hated jackets and ties for years , he said i thought they were ridiculous mr perkins s stop at the center is only the most recent leg of an extraordinary journey that has taken him from shanghai , where he was born the son of a diplomat and lived until he was 13 , to phillips exeter , to harvard to the office of strategic services to corporate law to the metropolitan correctional facility , a place he 'd previously seen only on his way to court this last transition was not easy after prison , he fought off disbarment with the support of friends walter mansfield , a former federal appeals court judge , described him as the epitome , the acme , the paradigm of integrity then mr perkins found himself , a onetime editor of the harvard law review , unable to sell or even give away his services skeptics at the center wondered whether they were getting damaged goods , or if a straitlaced type could ever passionately represent clients who were black or hispanic or poor , let alone move from the hierarchy of wall street to the anarchy of publicinterest work their fears have long since been allayed in more than five years at the center , mr perkins has earned a reputation for productivity , effectiveness , dedication and modesty he has also become a treasured colleague mahlon , be sure to tell him how wonderful we all think you are , one chimed in during a recent interview blessing in disguise for a protestant wasp type coming in from the corporate world , particularly with my history , it was really something for them to let me come here in the first place , said mr perkins in some ways , he said , his ordeal was a blessing in disguise , forcing him into a career change he had considered but might never have had the courage to make intellectually , the work here is every bit as satisfying as what i did before , he said and politically , i derive a lot more satisfaction than i did at donovan , leisure i'm helping in causes i believe in very deeply this was n't a very good way to have gotten out , but at this point , i'm very happy not to be there , and very happy to be here mr perkins was on the legal team defending kodak against antitrust charges brought by berkey in 1973 at one point , he informed opposing counsel that some documents it sought had been destroyed in fact , they were in a suitcase back in his office , and he knew it he came forward in january 1978 and acknowledged his misstatement to the court quickly , he was suspended from the firm by march , he had resigned for mr perkins , a man with a heretofore unblemished record , it was a crushing blow dozens of times over the next few months , he was asked and asked himself why he had lied none of the withheld documents was crucial virtually all had been duplicated and were given to the other side anyway it was sort of an impromptu kind of thing and then i sort of got stuck with it , he once said

why the reckless survive and other secrets of human nature by melvin konner 306 pages viking 1895 consider the predicament of melvin konner , who confesses to guzzling coffee and gobbling oreo cookies as he sits writing a book that book , the paleolithic prescription , urged its readers to take better care of themselves by following a health regimen modeled on that of prehistoric man i could almost feel the fat from the cookies sinking into the arteries of my brain , the coffee laying the groundwork for future cardiac arrhythmias , he writes in why the reckless survive , a collection of dr konner s enchanting essays on the vagaries of human nature in this essay , he ponders just why we ca n't follow our own good advice , and why as a species we are so often muddled in our thinking about risks , ignoring some and exaggerating others for example , we worry over the possibility of a nuclear accident or a plane crash yet blithely ride a bicycle helmetless , an act that mortality statistics show to be far more lifethreatening likewise , those who tremble at lightning but calmly light a cigarette ignore the odds the chances of being struck by lightning are less than one in a million , while deaths linked to cigarettes amount to three jumbo jets crashing day after day and most of those troubled by the rising rate of urban homicide are among the least likely to be slain the point is that people seem largely oblivious to the actual hierarchy of dangers , substituting an emotional reading of risk for a rational one in tackling the question , dr konner brings a sensibility informed by his background as an anthropologist , with fieldwork among the ! kung san bushmen of africa , and as a psychiatrist with a keen understanding of neuroanatomy characteristically , dr konner frames the puzzle in darwinian terms how can evolution have preserved a species that makes such poor decisions about its own survival \? posing the question in these terms bespeaks a key assumption woven through these essays , whether they deal with the mystique of the noble savage , the ideal human diet , the nursing of infants or chemical clues to suicide dr konner , in the tradition of sociobiology , seeks to divine the secrets of human nature from clues to our evolutionary past his premise is that our brain and fixed behavior patterns were shaped during the roughly 98 percent of the human past when we homo sapiens scratched out a living as hunters and gatherers the most recent 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 years or so , which we think of as human history , are a mere postscript to the millions when our genetic heritage was shaped the things that have survived in our genetic program , the evolutionary argument goes , are habits and tendencies that have proved useful in fostering progeny as konner puts it , to die , in darwinian terms , is not to lose the game , so long as one s genes are passed on by these rules , even sacrificing one s life for one s kin is a winning move , so long as one s relatives live to multiply what , then , is the evolutionary advantage of poor judgment about risk \? konner proposes that our rationality evolved in a world where seatofthepants problemsolving sufficed if you made it past the sabertoothed tiger safely and found a bush of ripe berries , you had done well these goodenough decisionmaking genes have been passed on to arrive in an age in which we have far more information available than was ever needed to survive until the next dawn on the savannah beyond that , the human gene pool is peppered with the legacy of risktakers , people who would n't hesitate to snatch a child from a pack of wild dogs , and so helped along the group , even at the cost of their own lives the net result is a mental apparatus that tends to focus on immediate results , neglecting more farreaching consequences thus , dr konner knows well the dangers of oreos but surrenders to another biological imperative we overdo it on fats and sweets because our ancestors were rewarded for such excesses with that inch of insulation needed to carry them through shortages death by atherosclerosis may be a pervasive threat today , but for most of the past three million years it was a consummation devoutly to be wished these essays push beyond the data to thoughtful speculation most will be familiar to readers of dr konner s column in the sciences , the magazine of the new york academy of sciences , where all but two appeared dr konner , a professor of anthropology and of psychiatry at emory university , has also been a frequent contributor to the new york times magazine , though why the reckless survive contains none of that work a gifted essayist , dr konner weaves disarming personal anecdotes with anthropology s wide view of behavior and psychiatry s deep understanding of brain mechanisms whether pondering the evolutionary usefulness of the smile or the link between an infant s fear of strangers and social prejudice , dr konner s prose entrances as it informs photo melvin konner \( marjorie shostak viking \)
before he put on a yankee uniform for what he agreed would probably be the last time , phil rizzuto was finishing another cup of coffee i think i lead the league in days , he said i do n't know how many i 've had , but billy martin kept track he always told me , 'if steinbrenner knew how many days you had ' but when they retired my number at my day in 1985 , tom seaver upstaged me by winning his 300th game and then the cow they gave me stepped on my foot to celebrate his 50 years as a yankee shortstop and broadcaster at yesterday s oldtimers day , the scooter was given a 55second ovation , two plaques , a 25 , 000 donation to easter seals from the money store and a gunmetal blue chrysler fifth avenue but he did n't get what he wanted most a reunion with his yankee contemporaries that bothers me , he said but then i was n't even invited to oldtimers day here the last five years you like to be invited so you can say no but because the guys have to play in the game , equitable wants bodies that are young enough to play young enough to play but not really famous enough to deserve oldtimers day billing names like bernie allen , danny cater , john ellis , larry gura , joe lefebvre , mickey mcdermott , gerry moses , tom shopay and gary thomasson will never have yankee plaques out in what is known as monument park beyond left field but when i saw joe dimaggio here , that made my day , rizzuto said , nodding at where the yankee clipper was having lunch he was my security blanket whenever i turned around and saw him in center field , i knew everything was all right all right in those years when the yankees were winning the world series almost every season but not all right yesterday not when 72yearold phil rizzuto was surrounded by many yankees he knew only as a broadcaster , but not as a teammate in celebrating his continuous half a century with the yankees , it was as if he were being honored only to hype the oldtimers day ticket sale of rizzuto s teammates , only dimaggio , whitey ford , bill skowron and tommy byrne were introduced mickey mantle and yogi berra had been invited but were absent with rizzuto s blessing mantle was on display at a baseball memorabilia show berra was on the aircraft carrier enterprise off the virginia coast with john mcmullen , the owner of the houston astros and a former naval commander i had dinner with yogi about three weeks ago , rizzuto said he told me he 'll never set foot in yankee stadium as long as george steinbrenner owned the team i told him i respected how he felt but where were tommy henrich , frank crosetti , allie reynolds , ed lopat , marius russo , gil mcdougald , hank bauer , gene woodling , gerry coleman , johnny mize , enos slaughter , don larsen , bob turley , andy carey , ralph houk , charlie silvera and gus niarhos \? none had been invited because , as jim ogle of the yankee alumni association explained , most were deemed too old to play in the equitable oldtimers game but the yankees could have extended special invitations in the steinbrenner regime that is now wallowing in last place , this is what passes for yankee tradition but at least the principal owner did n't intrude on the festivities by showing up now that he s planning a litigious rebuttal to what he apparently perceives as an unfair investigation by commissioner fay vincent into the howard spira case , he was probably huddling with his attorneys but the presence of dimaggio , wearing a blue blazer instead of a yankee uniform , was enough to smooth rizzuto s feathers i was a fresh rookie trying to take crosetti s job , rizzuto said , speaking of 1941 but in spring training , some of the veterans would n't let me hit they 'd keep saying they had to get some extra swings , so i 'd go over to one of the other diamonds to take batting practice but after a few days of that , dimaggio told them 'let the kid hit how are we going to know what he can do if we do n't let him hit \? ' after that i hit every day for the 1941 season opener , rizzuto displaced crosetti as the yankee shortstop opening day in washington with president roosevelt , my first live president , rizzuto recalled but when i was at shortstop , crosetti was in the dugout moving me for the hitters two steps this way for this guy two steps that way for that guy in the yankee clubhouse yesterday , tommy byrne remembered rizzuto s most memorable moment as a player a squeeze bunt that scored dimaggio for a gamewinning run against bob lemon of the cleveland indians lemon was smart , rizzuto said when he saw dimaggio running , he threw at me , trying to hit me when i got the ball down , he threw his glove in disgust but to me , bunting was so easy in batting practice , joe gordon would bet me that i could n't bunt using the end of the bat like it was a pool cue if the ball skidded off the bat , i could 've gotten hurt , but i usually got the ball down i even practiced bunting behind my back , figuring sooner or later a pitcher would throw the ball behind me i 'd get the bat on the ball behind my back , too but i never had a chance to do it in a game for the last 35 seasons , of course , rizzuto has been a yankee broadcaster if that s the word he s really been just a yankee fan with a microphone sometimes just himself with a microphone like the time , bobby murcer said with a laugh , he did three innings of playbyplay without ever mentioning a player s name he got to talking about 'gone with the wind' and in between he 'd say , 'grounder to short strike out fly ball to left' but never the player s name that s right rizzuto said but as i remember , it did n't make much difference it was n't much of a game it was n't much of an oldtimers day for phil rizzuto either too many of his old teammates had not even been invited
every day the news about covenant house grows grimmer and every day , therefore , it becomes more urgent to reassure the conscientious citizens whose contributions support the organization the survival of covenant house requires a wholly new board of directors with the help of john cardinal o'connor , the board is trying to reshape the runaway shelter and revive its reputation but the board s dereliction was part of the problem what we do n't know is monumental , ralph a pfeiffer jr , the board chairman , admitted last week unfortunately , so is what we do know a single accusation of sexual misconduct by a former male prostitute led to a flood of other disclosures there was the 1 million charitable trust created by the organization s founder , the rev bruce ritter , to benefit runaway youths but used partly as a slush fund there were the lucrative interior design and construction contracts that father ritter awarded to relatives and there were the young men in their 20 s whom he hired at salaries of 90 , 000 and above for top management jobs while child care workers labored for peanuts all this happened without the knowledge of the prominent people father ritter recruited for his board they failed as an independent check on his judgment , which seems to have gotten worse even as his and covenant house s reputation got better true , the board has taken some wise and forceful steps in the last two weeks , enlisting cardinal o'connor to find an interim president and creating an oversight committee with illustrious names like cyrus vance , paul volcker and theodore hesburgh but with the old board still in place , the housecleaning remains incomplete wouldbe contributors may reasonably wonder whether it makes sense to put new wine into old wineskins if the opinions of childcare experts are worth anything , covenant house may need an overhaul of its methodology along with its management but none of that will matter much if the public withdraws its confidence and its money

bangkok , thailand , may 29 as results continued to trickle in today from the first multiparty elections in 30 years in myanmar , formerly burma , western diplomats said the main opposition party had already won at least 66 percent of the seats in a new national assembly but as of tonight , only 53 contests had been officially declared in the government newspaper or on state radio the main opposition group , the national league for democracy , had won 48 of those seats , and the militarybacked national unity party had won none but questions were raised about the tardiness of the official count and whether the results might yet be manipulated , despite the western diplomats' assertion that the national league for democracy had won at least 322 of the assembly s 485 seats most western diplomats interviewed by telephone today discounted the discrepancy to be official , the results must be handcarried to yangon , formerly rangoon , along a primitive transportation system , one diplomat said in any event , he continued , to try to tamper with the election at this late stage would be obvious , and would provoke an uproar , both domestically and internationally some ominous questions his confidence is not universally shared by other diplomats interviewed today and other , serious questions hang over these remarkable elections in myanmar , where overwhelming majorities voted to repudiate the last 30 years of military rule under gen ne win although gen saw maung is now the leader of the military government , general ne win , who formally gave up his power last july , is still believed to be in control individual members of the foreign ministry and the information section of the state law and order committee , the name of the junta that has run the country since prodemocracy demonstrations were brutally crushed 20 months ago , have told journalists that the military is willing to hand over power to a civilian government once the newly elected assembly writes a new constitution and forms a government but there has not been any formal , collective statement to that effect from the state law and order committee some diplomats and burmese find this silence a little ominous even optimistic diplomats say they cannot dismiss the possibility that some of the more conservative or vulnerable members of the military command may be adamant against allowing civilian politicians to take over , and are trying to prevent it mixed signals from officials nor is there any clear set of rules or even a timetable for the convening of the new assembly , the writing of a new constitution or the forming of a government some military officials have said that they will set temporary ground rules for the assembly others have said the assembly can behave as it wishes but the size of the national league for democracy s victory is likely to make ratifying a new constitution and forming a new government easier than the military might have imagined when it agreed to hold these elections the attitude of the reclusive general ne win is also a mystery in some sense , he set off these events by resigning his official post as chairman of the country s only party in july 1988 at the time , he said he was willing to foresee a public referendum on allowing a multiparty system the party the direct forerunner of the national unity party so thoroughly repudiated this week objected , the idea was scrapped , and the demonstrations for democracy began to accelerate until they were put down , with great loss of life , in september 1988 but general ne win is hardly likely to enjoy the prospect of daw aung san suu kyi , the 44yearold leader of the national league for democracy , emerging from house arrest to become myanmar s prime minister she is the daughter of u aung san , considered the founder of the nation , who was assassinated in 1947 , just before independence general ne win was one of the original 30 in mr aung san s circle and has always seen himself as the inheritor of mr aung san s mantle mrs aung san suu kyi s sweeping victory , said a senior western diplomat , must be like a finger in ne win s eye opposition leader s importance under a law protecting the state from destructive elements , mrs aung san suu kyi was sentenced last july 20 to a year of house arrest , renewable yearly the military authorities who sentenced her thus far show no inclination to let her out early without her leadership , diplomats say , her party will have a hard time handling its new responsibilities the party has been split between young people who support her and former military men who support the party chairman , a retired general , u tin oo , who is currently serving three years at hard labor on a charge of sedition the party will rally around aung san suu kyi , a diplomat said , but only if she is free to lead it as so often in burma , the personality of individuals plays a big part , and she s the only one with the requisite qualities , fame and charisma to run the party , to hold it together and provide direction she is also , he continued , one of the few able to contain the country s hatred for its military rulers the whole focus has been to stay alive and build a political movement , a diplomat said there are a lot of deep problems here , and nobody s done much thinking about them although the military has barred foreign journalists from myanmar in recent months , about 60 reporters , most of them from television and news agencies , were allowed to enter the country for the elections last week
dna fingerprinting , widely promoted by lawenforcement officials as a powerful tool for prosecutors , has increasingly come under criticism as unreliable by some molecular biologists beginning next week many leading experts on this method of analyzing genetic material to identify people will gather in a federal courthouse in toledo , ohio , for the most ambitious judicial inquiry so far into its soundness at stake may be the lives of several convicted defendants only two years old in the united states , dna fingerprinting has already been used in hundreds of homicide , rape and paternity cases it has been relied upon as the primary basis to convict defendants in florida , texas and georgia who are now on death row dna , or deoxyribonucleic acid , is the basic building code for all chromosomes and is the same in all of a person s cells , skin , bone , organs , semen and blood the characteristics of certain segments of dna , though , vary from person to person and form a detectable genetic fingerprint to produce the fingerprint , scientists use enzymes that break up dna according to the sequences of the chemical bases that make it up because these sequences are unique to each individual , the enzymes break up each person s dna into a unique arrangement of fragments called foolproof and flawed advocates of dna testing say it matches molecular material found on a crime victim or at the crime scene with that of a suspect prosecutors and some scientists say it is nearly foolproof , while defense lawyers and other scientists say it may be flawed , at least in the way some laboratories conduct the test about the only thing that prosecutors and defense lawyers agree on is that such evidence is among the most persuasive that can be presented to a jury in courts that have permitted its use , the evidence has almost always led juries to vote for convictions if a match is made , and often it has led to exoneration when there is no match pretrial hearing in slaying the proceedings to begin monday in toledo are pretrial hearings , expected to last a month , in the case of three members of the cleveland chapter of the hell s angels motorcycle club steven wayne yee , mark s verdi and john ray bonds prosecutors say that the three men conspired to kill david hartlaub in sandusky , ohio , and that he was slain as part of a turf war with another organization , the outlaws motorcycle club the prosecutors say mr hartlaub was mistaken by the defendants for someone else who is an outlaws member they have been charged in state and federal proceedings with murder , conspiracy and illegal possession of firearms the federal action is a charge of conspiracy to possess a firearm silencer and possession of a silencer the government contends that as part of the conspiracy , mr bonds fired the weapon , although that is not a separate offense under federal law the state will present the murder charge against the men after the federal case genetic match is cited a critical piece of evidence against the defendants is an analysis by a federal bureau of investigation laboratory that prosecutors say shows a genetic match between blood taken from one of the defendants , blood found in the automobile of mr yee and blood found in the van of the murder victim presiding over the hearing of the scientific experts on the issue will be magistrate james e carr , a harvard law school graduate and former professor at the university of toledo college of law who has written extensively on criminal procedure and the law governing electronic surveillance in the federal system , magistrates frequently conduct pretrial hearings in cases that are later presided over by judges the hearing will pit the government s best scientific talent against those hired by the defense about a dozen experts in all in a battle that revisits a familiar problem in the jurisprudence of evidence when is a novel science sufficiently established and accepted so that it is considered reliable in the courts \? decision with wide impact while the decision of magistrate carr will not be binding on other courts around the nation , it could have great influence as an opinion in an area that courts are only just beginning to understand the decision that magistrate carr makes will be relied upon by judges all over the united states , said ronald l kuby , a defense lawyer in the case i ca n't imagine any judges' doing this twice fbi officials and some scientists say that the genetic techniques now being employed are legally airtight and that there is only the remotest of possibilities of yielding faulty results the possibility of coming up with a false positive is virtually impossible , said john hicks , assistant director of the laboratory division of the fbi , adding that there are sufficient controls within the laboratories to assure the accuracy of the testing lab standards questioned some defense lawyers say that while the molecular theory underlying genetic matching is sound , there is no oversight of the laboratories performing the analyses and each one relies on different standards , a situation that could lead to inconsistent results other forensic laboratories that perform examinations like urine tests typically do require state supervision and licenses despite these possible problems , jurors are often told that the odds of an incorrect result are greater than a million to one the defense lawyers maintain that many courts have relied on dna evidence because the judges and lawyers are simply illequipped to question its reliability in the face of assurances from prosecutors
washington , feb 27 the suficials can treat mentally ill prisoners with antipsychotic drugs against their will without first receiving a judge s permission after a formal hearing the 6to3 decision , which overturned a ruling by the supreme court of the state of washington , addressed a question that has sharply divided mental health professionals as well as judges around the country writing for the court , justice anthony m kennedy said that under the constitution s guarantee of due process of law , prisoners have a significant liberty interest in being free of unwanted medication but he said that an inmate s constitutional rights can be protected by measures short of the fulldress judicial hearing required by the state court s 1988 opinion state s position supported justice kennedy said the due process clause permits the state to treat a prison inmate who has a serious mental illness with antipsychotic drugs against his will , if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmate s medical interest he said the procedures adopted by the state of washington in the early 1980 s were adequate to meet that standard under the state s rules , a mentally ill prisoner who objects to medication is entitled to a hearing before a panel composed of three members of the prison staff a psychiatrist , a psychologist and the associate superintendent , none of whom may be involved in the inmate s treatment or diagnosis at the time of the hearing the inmate has the right to attend , to present evidence , and to be represented by a lay adviser who understands the psychiatric issues involved , but not by a lawyer to override the inmate s objections , the panel must determine that the prisoner is either gravely disabled by his mental illness or that he poses a likelihood of serious harm to himself or others or to property in the prison as long as treatment continues , a psychiatrist must report on the inmate s condition every 14 days , with a new hearing to be held after six months challenge by state high court the state supreme court , ruling in a lawsuit brought by a schizophrenic inmate who was medicated against his will , held that these procedures were constitutionally inadequate the state court said the constitution required the state to prove that it had a compelling interest in administering the medication , and that the drugs were necessary and effective justice kennedy said the state court had set too high a standard in requiring the state to demonstrate a compelling need for the medication he said earlier supreme court decisions on the constitutional rights of prisoners had established that the proper standard for determining the validity of a prison regulation claimed to infringe on an inmate s constitutional rights is to ask whether the regulation is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests he continued there are few cases in which the state s interest in combating the danger posed by a person to both himself and others is greater than in a prison environment justice kennedy noted that psychotropic drugs can have serious , even fatal , side effects but he said that notwithstanding the risks that are involved , we conclude that an inmate s interests are adequately protected , and perhaps better served , by allowing the decision to medicate to be made by medical professionals rather than a judge in holding that washington s procedures are constitutionally adequate , the opinion , washington v harper , no 88599 , did not explicitly state whether all elements of the state rules are constitutionally required due process requirements but justice kennedy indicated that to meet due process requirements , treatment of an unwilling inmate must be medically appropriate for the prisoner s condition the prisoner must have the opportunity for a full and fair hearing before an independent decision maker who , however , need not come from outside the institution in a dissenting opinion , justice john paul stevens accused the majority of endorsing a mock trial before an institutionally biased tribunal so serving institutional convenience eviscerates the inmate s substantive liberty interest in the integrity of his body and mind , justice stevens said the dissenting opinion was also signed by justices william j brennan jr and thurgood marshall the majority opinion was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices byron r white , sandra day o'connor , antonin scalia and harry a blackmun justice blackmun also filed a separate concurring opinion noting that the difficult and controversial character of this case was underscored by the fact that two major organizations of mental health professionals had filed briefs on opposite sides the 35 , 000member american psychiatric association supported the state s appeal in a brief that said the benefits of antipsychotic drugs far outweighed the risks the brief contended that the state court had erred by enshrining the preferences of dangerous persons gravely in need of psychiatric treatment the american psychological association , with 70 , 000 psychologists as members , said in its brief that the state court was correct to guard against the use of drugs that can disfigure and disable a prisoner long after his penal debt has been paid litigation in many courts the issue has been litigated in many state and lower federal courts , with varying results new york is among several states that now provide judicial hearings for mentally ill inmates who refuse medication in one recent study , only about 25 percent of mentally ill inmates in the state s prisons now request such a hearing walter harper , the washington inmate whose case the justices decided today , was convicted of robbery in 1976 he consented to treatment with antipsychotic drugs for several years , but then refused to continue treatment in a separate ruling today , the court held that a mentally ill florida man who alleged that state officials improperly committed him to a mental hospital can sue the officials for damages under a federal civil rights law the 5to4 decision , with an opinion by justice blackmun , upheld a ruling by the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit in atlanta the man had been found wandering , bruised and disoriented , along a highway he spent five months in a state mental hospital without the hearing that he said he was entitled to under florida law in their supreme court appeal , the state officials argued that man should have sued in state court because no rights under the federal constitution were involved but justice blackmun said that the man was entitled to argue in federal court that his confinement violated his right to constitutional due process the case was zinermon v burch , no 871965
detroit , april 1 there were too many badgers from wisconsin on the ice and in the stands for colgate to overcome today the badgers on skates trounced the red raiders , 73 , and won the the national championship of college hockey the title , wisconsin s fifth since 1973 , was the proper crown for coach jeff sauer s team , which had become almost unbeatable since jan 19 in the last 20 games , wisconsin had only one loss and one tie , and along the way it swept to the western hockey association title today , the wisconsin athletes , who are especially adept at defensive hockey , stifled colgate to the delight of most of the 15 , 034 fans at joe louis arena wisconsin , which has 43 , 300 students to colgate s 2 , 700 , had by far the most rooters , plus a brass band with 18 trombones that made the players feel inspired comforts of home just like playing at home , sauer said the game was not as competitive as a championship deserves colgate , which had played with so much discipline and so much intelligence in its finest season , performed poorly and that included its goalie , dave gagnon , who had almost been flawless of wisconsin s first five shots on goal none of them cruel ones three went through gagnon , one between his legs when the first period was over wisconsin led by 41 , and colgate s chance for its first national collegiate athletic association championship would most certainly have to wait for another time and place the red raiders were also guilty of penalties , dumb penalties , coach terry slater said four of wisconsin s goals were scored in favorable powerplay situations , another when the team was shorthanded , and the last one into an empty net with 42 seconds left john byce , the center of the badgers' first line , had three goals the first one in the game , a shorthanded one and an emptynet one byce was one of seven seniors who , according to sauer , represented the heart of the wisconsin team our seniors made it easy , he said defenders are tops chris tancill , from nearby livonia , mich , was another part of that heart he scored wisconsin s third goal , a vicious 30foot slap shot that went under gagnon s glove tancill , who was named the tournament s most valuable player , scored the team s only goals in a 21 semifinal victory over boston college on friday night wisconsin s defenders were so good at blocking shots or the red raiders prone to wild shots that the badger goalie , duane derksen , made only eight saves in the first two periods they were a hard team to move , said karl clauss , the colgate captain behind by 62 as the third period began , colgate got going and managed 14 shots at derksen , who turned away all but one their goaltender was tremendous , slater said no question they were the better team and deserved what they got colgate , the champion of the ecac hockey league , beat boston university , 32 , in a semifinal that sauer witnessed we did n't know much about colgate , he said but going into today s game i felt pretty good i knew we had a lot of weapons , and thought we 'd have chances to score the first goal came quickly steve poapst of colgate went to the penalty box for two minutes for high sticking after 37 seconds had gone by a minute later byce fired wisconsin s first shot at gagnon and it lit the red light behind the cage wisconsin , which finished with a 3691 record to colgate s 3161 , won ncaa championships in 1973 , 1977 and 1981 when bob johnson was coach and in 1983 when sauer replaced the man called badger bob baker award kip miller , the michigan state senior center from lansing , mich , was awarded the hobey baker memorial award as college hockey s best player this season after the championship game miller , who led the nation in scoring with 48 goals and 53 assists in 45 games , is expected to play next for the quebec nordiques of the national hockey league
the outlook is n't brilliant for the mudville lads this day the score stands zero to zero with who knows how many innings more to play \? and when don fehr stood his ground , and o'connor did the same , a sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game a straggling few broke off talks in despair , as the rest searched for some mighty casey and hoped for the best they thought , if only the commish could but get a whack at that yet he has , and he s whiffed , in his few times at the bat the owners had put a proposal on the table , and waited with a leer the players' reps then picked it up , and returned it , leer for sneer the players said they would n't take any more of this guff , the owners said , likewise , and then both sides left in a huff so now they each return to their respective councils , to check the matter out the players to question their arbitration , and maybe their pension pout the owners gather in another town , to talk of all the loot , that they can keep from the players' grasp and none would give a hoot ! we 're making millions and paying millions , says each baseball lord do n't the players know that that s all we can afford \? well , we sweat and we strain , say the players , with their bat , ball and mitt we run and throw , and excite the crowd all that you owners do is sit for all the years until the 70 s , the owners held the players like chattel then the minions finally awoke , and their union began to rattle they wreaked one concession after another from the haughty barons of baseball and thought that this was child s play , until the barons began to pale there were labor strikes and lockouts , no cries of kill the ump and now there was a diff 'rent shout you greedy lyin' chump but at length the dust cleared at those negotiating tables , so the multitude could resume , with its longedfor baseball fables where is solomon now when we need him , and the babe , and casey , to boot \? where are the people who could step up to the plate and render the matter moot \? well , bowie is in hiding , and judge landis is far away , that leaves only don and chuck , and still , maybe , just maybe , fay the owners have kept the training camps locked up for some 14 days this has given the players a chance to golf , swim , and get some rays there is talk , though , of some getting the playing itch this is music to the owners' ears , who dream of staying rich but regardless of each player s newly lofty bank book , most appear to know how it came and all of what it took their attitude seems to be right now , yes , yes , we must stay strong , even if we are n't there to answer the opening day gong ! oh , somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright , the lawyers are working angles , and the accountants' hearts are light and somewhere men are laughing , and some where children shout , but there is no joy in mudville everyone has struck out

baseball s bickering club owners and players wo n't guarantee that spring training will start on schedule but judging by darryl strawberry s domestic dispute and george steinbrenner s reportedly imminent hiring of dick williams as his latest managerinwaiting , the mets and the yankees have rolled out their batting cages through the years , many baseball players have fibbed about their ages their baseball age is always a year or two younger than their real age but as darryl strawberry approaches what is supposed to be his 28th birthday on march 12 , he seems confused by the baseball age trick instead of lowering his age , he must have added a year or two by mistake nobody about to turn 28 could be so immature surely the mets right fielder is really 26 , or 24 or maybe he has discovered the fountain of immaturity maybe he s really still 18 , his age in 1980 when the mets signed him whatever his age , the socalled slugger known as straw more and more resembles a straw in the wind as if demanding a fouryear 12 million contract after having batted 225 last season were not shameless enough , as if blood tests confirming he had fathered a child born in 1988 in st louis were not embarrassing enough , he was arrested and briefly jailed last week after his wife , lisa , accused him of threatening her with a pistol officially , the mets tried to defuse this domestic dispute , saying that darryl and lisa are back living together what goes on between darryl and his wife , said al harazin , a mets' vice president , is none of our business wrong as long as strawberry is on the mets' roster , it is the mets' business but maybe the mets' front office no longer really cares if he s on their roster maybe that s why frank cashen , the executive vice president , bluntly and publicly stated that strawberry is not worth 12 million over four years maybe that s why the mets really obtained mike marshall from the los angeles dodgers to play right field if a strawberry trade develops in either scenario , neither strawberry nor the mets is dealing from strength with only 29 homers and 77 runs batted in last season , he is hardly a 3 million man he s not even worth the 18 million he s assured of this season , much less the threeyear 75 million contract the mets are offering and with his being eligible for free agency after the upcoming season , the mets ca n't expect to get much for a player who could walk away if he s not signed if he s still an unsigned met this season , strawberry might be inspired to put together the big numbers he has often promised but never produced as a free agent , he would need big numbers to assure a big contract but the mets must be wondering if anything will inspire him bucky dent , meanwhile , knows better than to wonder why dick williams is reportedly about to be hired as george steinbrenner s toplevel consultant , a euphemism for yankee managerinwaiting only last week the principal owner vowed that dent will be my manager all year that could happen wonders never cease but history warns that the principal owner has broken similar vows in recent years , billy martin and lou piniella were always available as dugout standins when the principal owner s impatience erupted but piniella has now escaped he has succeeded pete rose as the cincinnati reds' manager martin was killed when a pickup truck skidded on an icy road with the principal owner needing a new standin on standby , dick williams is perfect for the part steinbrenner was once thwarted from signing williams as the yankee manager after guiding the oakland athletics to their 1973 world series victory , williams was introduced as the yankee manager at a lavish news conference at the topfloor terrace on the park restaurant in flushing meadows but the a s owner , charles o finley , protested that williams was bound to oakland through 1974 when the yankees declined to meet finley s request for compensation in players , joe cronin , then the american league president , ruled that williams could not manage elsewhere until his oakland contract expired after the 1974 season in his travels , williams went on to manage the california angels , the montreal expos , the san diego padres \( to the 1984 national league pennant \) , the seattle mariners and currently , the west palm beach tropics of the florida senior league despite the principal owner s vow that bucky dent will survive the season , sooner or later dick williams will be the yankee manager and if darryl strawberry emerges as a free agent , he might accept 12 million to go to yankee stadium where his home run swing would be ideal but also where his fountain of immaturity would overflow photo darryl strawberry \( nyt \)
washington , may 1 secretary of state james a baker 3d leaves for europe on wednesday for the first sixnation talks about the future of a united germany , carrying a briefcase full of ideas that he hopes will help the soviets accept what the united states sees as inevitable a unified germany in nato the two plus four negotiations , which were agreed upon last february at an eastwest conference in ottawa , call for west and east germany to sit down with the four world war ii allies the united states , soviet union , britain and france to resolve all of the external security issues raised by german reunification , and to dissolve the four powers' legal rights and responsibilities in berlin and germany as a whole whatever the formal agenda , administration officials and analysts predict the talks will quickly come down to the soviets asking the germans what economic and security incentives they will grant moscow in return for the soviets' expeditiously withdrawing their 380 , 000 troops from east germany , allowing a united germany to become a member of nato and terminating their legal rights in berlin along with the other allies package of initiatives it is not that the kremlin is expected to try to prevent german unification , say officials it is far too late for that but the soviets can drag their feet with bluff , bluster , blandishments and by endless haggling over the arcane legal issues involved in berlin until they are satisfied that arrangements for a united germany will be militarily and politically acceptable the question for the west , said an administration official , is how we make it digestible for the soviets so they will accept this inevitable outcome sooner rather than later administration officials say they have in mind a package of initiatives that would not only make the establishment of a united germany in nato something palatable for the soviets , but also acceptable to the other europeans , many of whom are also nervous about german unification informal discussions most of the initiatives the administration has in mind will be discussed only informally in the twoplusfour talks , which begin saturday , and then parceled out to the relevant negotiating forums , where they will actually be addressed the package includes these ideas the western allies will suggest to the soviets that if they are concerned about the size of the west german army , now 500 , 000 men , then moscow and bonn should work out a troop reduction arrangment as part of the ongoing vienna talks limiting conventional forces in europe the soviets will also be invited to station a limited number of troops in east germany for a fixed transition period , as will the allies in berlin the united germany is expected to reaffirm west germany s promise never to obtain nuclear , chemical or biological weapons , and formally confirm the oderneisse line as its eastern border with poland in order to make a united germany in nato a lessthreatening , more politically acceptable entity to the soviets , negotiations are expected to begin soon that would result in the elimination of all , or most , united statescontrolled , shortrange nuclear missiles , and perhaps artillery shells , in germany in exchange for the removal of the soviet s shortrange missiles and nuclear artillery from europe that would leave nato with only airdelivered nuclear bombs in germany west germany is expected to reassure the soviets that all of the contracts that they have with east german industries will be assumed by a united germany , and , say german officials , bonn will strongly hint to moscow that if it plays along on twoplusfour , generous economic aid will follow suit the west germans are also expected to offer to help subsidize the cost as the east german government used to do of maintaining soviet troops in east german territory for the transitional period the 35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe will be given a new , expanded and formalized role for conflict resolution and intraeuropean dialogue for its member states , say administration officials , so that after a united germany joins nato and the warsaw pact inevitably fades away the soviets , poles , czechs , hungarians , romanians and bulgarians wo n't feel left out in the cold 'in the same club' with csce everyone can feel that they are in the same club , said a senior administration official it wo n't really provide military or economic security , but psychological security , a place where everyone can feel at home talking about any european issues they want this could prove to be the most difficult part of the package to sell , both to the allies and the soviets the french would prefer to see the americandominated nato downgraded and the conference on security and cooperation in europe given a more formal security role that might eventually make it more of an alternative to nato than a complement the same goes for the soviets , who will find it hard to accept the notion of nato emerging as the sole , dominating security structure in europe this could create the politically dangerous impression back in moscow that while stalin won world war ii , mikhail s gorbachev lost the peace there is a word that american officials say they have been hearing constantly of late from the soviet foreign minister , eduard a shevardnadze synchronization what we think he means is that until they have a sense that all of their concerns and interests have been addressed from the conventional forces negotiations to german unification they will behave as though none of them have been addressed , a senior administration official said i think the soviets are just now waking up to the monumental consequences of everything that has happened in europe in the last year and this has introduced a kind of tentative and confused quality to their decision making
the city fathers of pasadena , calif , sent up their police helicopter last thursday night its task was to ticket some helicopters engaged by the state to spray the dreaded mediterranean fruit fly the bust was observed , of course , by a fleet of television helicopters it s hard not to wonder if the fight between the fly and its foes has n't lost touch with the ground the medfly infests 250 kinds of produce , putting at risk some 5 billion of california s annual harvest the state s food and agriculture department has successfully eradicated the pest several times , as has florida in principle , the battle against the medfly seems well worth fighting but suburban homeowners do n't like having their backyards sprayed with a mildly toxic sticky goo , even at night california is particularly sensitive to pesticides , with laws more stringent than other states the growing impatience with the malathion spraying may be understandable but there is no clear alternative the public already accepts tiny residual doses of pesticide in its daily diet as the price of a cheaper , maggotfree food supply it s not very convincing when california s suburbanites protest malathion spraying that probably adds little or nothing to this everyday exposure usually the state agriculture department sprays infected areas just once with malathion , then keeps the insect under control by releasing millions of sterilized male flies the present outbreak was unusually large , with several different infestations , and there were not enough sterile males to go around hence in some areas repeated malathion sprayings are needed opponents warn that malathion may be dangerous , and that the war against the fly is either unwinnable or should be prosecuted with selective ground spraying none of these arguments are sustainable all pesticides are poisons but malathion appears to be among the most benign the medfly certainly can be eradicated and aerial spraying is known to be more effective than ground spraying , and spreads the pesticide more dilutely only 2 ounces per acre pesticides are often overused many are iniquitous poisons that derange local ecologies and contaminate groundwater one day this crude chemical technology will be superseded by genetic methods but meanwhile , pesticides have an essential role , especially in welldesigned strategies , like that against the medfly , which combines minimum pesticide use with other techniques pesticides make for dangerous politics in california gov jerry brown delayed too long in fighting the medfly infestation of 1980 , an error that cost the growers 100 million and may have cost him a senate seat in 1982 gov george deukmejian is now trying to avoid irate suburbanites on the other side but to stop the spraying in the meantime , as the natural resources defense council and the city of los angeles demand in court , might let the fly become established since the multiple sprayings will be needed only until a new crop of sterile flies is produced , the governor s best bet is to stick with the campaign california s suburbanites are being too selfish in trying to avoid the harmless inconvenience of a malathion shower on their backyards they , too , stand to gain from saving the state s harvest

washington two israeli researchers this week patented a method for producing an intense red dye for foods and cosmetics from carrot cells grown in petri dishes in such cell cultures , plant cells are bred without growing the entire plant the technique is being viewed by many scientists as a more efficient alternative to conventional methods of agriculture the new colorant is a chemical called anthocyanin , produced by cultures of carrot cells according to the patent , it has several advantages over existing food dyes it has an intense color , remains stable under a wide variety of conditions and has none of the carcinogenic risks associated with some artificial red dyes the colorant is produced by isolating anthocyanin from the cell culture and then freezedrying it into a powder by adjusting the acid levels of the cell culture , the coloring can be varied from dark red to purple to blue ron vunsh and michael b matilsky obtained patent 4 , 939 , 086
to the editor in the angry debate about gun ownership the national rifle association is entirely right , and those of us who would like to see tight restrictions and some outright bans are also entirely right we 're just right about different things the second amendment to the constitution prohibits infringement of the right of citizens to keep and bear arms but the framers wrote in the late 18th century to them , arms were smoothbore muzzle loaders , sabers , halberds , hauberks , bows and arrows , and cannons of the kind we see at old battlefields powderhorns and cast balls these are the sorts of arms of which the right of the citizens to keep and bear shall not be infringed would the framers have left the wording unqualified as it is , knowing that arms today would include semiautomatic assault rifles , highpowered cartridge rifles , flamethrowers , m1 tanks , surfacetowhatever missiles , sarin and semtex \? that s not plausible as for the wellregulated militia of the second amendment , it seems that the same 18thcentury context must be assumed since the civil war , the defense of the nation has been largely absorbed by the federal government , and drilling on the village green now implies drilling for oil the whole concept is as quaint as the reenactments at lexington and concord with no wellregulated militia in the 18thcentury sense , why does n't the uninfringeability of the right predicated upon it vanish \? actually , the right of the citizenry to keep and bear arms is considerably infringed every day yet none of the mailings i get from the national rifle association raise alarms about the infringement of my constitutional right to keep and bear sam7 s , bazookas or an f18 just firearms , and generally those below about a halfinch caliber maybe we need a national missile association , national heavy artillery association and others to lobby for those categories of arms whose clearly equivalent right of citizens to keep and bear the nra wo n't or ca n't defend is only one breach in the wall of second amendment protection worthy of ferocious support \? why do n't we adapt an idea of the late senator george aiken , and declare that both sides' premises are entirely correct let s further agree to let anyone own as much 18th or earliercentury arms as he or she wants , because the framers clearly said we could but that no individual has a constitutional right to own modern weapons of mass murder , and the framers never said we could anyway anyone want an epee \? alan silverman pittsburgh , may 24 , 1990
some 1 , 500 columbia university students , joined by faculty members and administrators , gathered last night to protest a campus speech by richard griffin , who appears with the rap group public enemy as professor griff the protest was sponsored by jewish campus organizations , primarily because of remarks mr griffin made last year that were offensive to many jews here on the columbia campus we must rededicate ourselves to fighting racism , jack greenberg , dean of columbia college , said at the rally none of the protesting groups had publicly demanded the cancellation of mr griffin s talk last night , nor did they try to disrupt his appearance , which was sponsored by the black students organization the group said it had asked mr griffin to talk about education in the year 2000 as part of its observance of black history month , not to discuss his comments on jews mr griffin spoke without incident for about 30 minutes before 400 people at the end of the program , rebecca grant , a spokeswoman for the bso , said , the views expressed by richard griffin are not necessarily those of the black students organization the opposition to mr griffin began in may when he told the washington times that jews were responsible for the majority of wickedness that goes on across the globe mr griffin last night offered his views on black selfeducation and selfreliance and aids mr griffin also told the largely black audience that the us government gives us education that keeps your nature in check when asked by one student about his views on integration , he said , it wo n't work we have to be separated , as long as you 're connected with your slave master , it wo n't do you no good , he said
rome , july 8 after a month as hosts of the world cup soccer finals , italians were ready for a spectacle of a different order , and they got it by the earful on saturday night at the baths of caracalla tenors , anyone \? under a full moon , there were three of the world s greatest on the outdoor stage of the thirdcentury roman baths jose carreras , placido domingo and luciano pavarotti appearing together for the first time through two and a half hours of operatic arias and popular tunes some might argue that the event smacked more of caesars palace than caesar s city , longer on the splashy than the artful the program tended toward wellknown selections from operas like tosca and turandot , a medley of songs that included maria , cielito lindo and three times o sole mio a 198member orchestra but no amount of grousing on this score could diminish the obvious enthusiam of the performers as they ran through the regular program and three encores , accompanied by an outsize , 198member orchestra led by zubin mehta if professional egos were on the line for this spectacular , none of the tenors showed it they smiled endlessly at one another and mugged unabashedly , especially mr pavarotti , the sole italian in the group and the one who seemed to be unofficially in charge at one point , he exchanged high fives with mr carreras as they passed each other in the wings the 6 , 000 welldressed members of the caracalla audience took it all in adoringly , as well they might have just being there was an accomplishment , given the fact that 100 , 000 people sought tickets despite prices that went as high as 360 apiece rome s mayor , franco carraro , said he was under greater pressure from friends to come up with concert tickets than with passes to the climactic world cup match tonight in which west germany defeated argentina at the olympic stadium here during the second encore , the audience could not resist joining in as the three tenors belted out a spirited rendition of nessun dorma from puccini s turandot reprise of a world cup anthem nessun dorma , or no one sleeps , had been something of an anthem for this world cup tournament mr pavarotti sang it in an oftrepeated television commercial the british broadcasting corporation made it the theme song for its soccer coverage and it is safe to say that few people in rome got much sleep on nights of italian team victories because of the din of traffic and hornhonking by celebratory youths soccer is so dominant here that the singers had to wait until 10 30 pm to begin first , everyone wanted to see if italy would beat england in a consolation match for third place it did , but the victory was slender comfort for italians still stunned by their team s elimination earlier in the week mr pavarotti , an avid soccer fan , was among them my heart , he said before the concert , is bleeding at a news conference on friday , he said that he and his two spanish colleagues had been asked at least 50 times to appear together but they had always refused this time they said yes , he explained , because of the concert s tiein to the soccer competition and , both he and mr domingo added , they also wanted to welcome mr carreras back to the stage after an apparently successful battle with leukemia the generosity of tenors all three tenors agreed to give to charity their share of concertrelated revenues , including the estimated 1 million in caracalla box office receipts commercially , their performance is expected to be powerful , with recordings on record , video and compact disk planned to go on sale in september in addition , the concert was broadcast live to a worldwide satellite audience estimated at 800 million , including abc viewers in the united states there were reports here that abc had hoped to inject a note of competition into the evening , sort of a ted mack approach that would have subjected these great tenors to ratings by a panel of judges that idea went nowhere , however , and all three made clear that they would check egos at the door we are united , mr pavarotti told reporters if you look at our rehearsals you would see that we are here with one another , not against one another mr domingo added , the rivalry is more in your minds than ours authorities do their part so special was this evening that the authorities went to unusual lengths to make sure that all was right as a security measure , they issued tickets in the form of magnetically coded cards to guarantee quiet , they allowed no traffic near the caracalla ruins , and rerouted flight paths to keep airplanes away but art , like life , does not always go as planned a jet passed noisily overhead just as mr carreras designed alphabetically to go first stepped to sing the lamento di federico from l'arlesiana by francesco cilea what could a tenor do but blow the plane a kiss \?

in a gracious program note for this year s dance chance performances at dance theater workshop , patsy tarr , the producer and curator of the series for eight years , cautions future audiences not to underestimate the value of the experimental none of the three dances on the program by stephanie skura , yoshiko chuma and tere o'connor could readily be described as experimentalist , since the predominant style of the evening is now a familiar one and the work yielded no particular revelations about that style dance chance , now to be directed by dance theater workshop , has typically offered opportunities to choreographers in the large midground between upstart kids and modern dance institutions and for a decade or so ms skura and ms chuma have been working a vein of dance distinctive for its discontinuity and the arbitrary or randomseeming nature of their choreographic choices over those years , their dances have gained a kind of dramatic continuity that characterized the works presented on wednesday in this opening dance chance program , the first of two to be presented through jan 14 at the workshop s bessie schonberg theater , 219 west 19th street ms skura s big wave , which she describes as a muchrevised dance created in collaboration with her company , courses vigorously as if spun along , often with foreboding and desperation , by some unseen but powerful force it is also a dance crammed with brief incidents , punchy and sometimes funny the dancers spin almost desultorily into plunging leaps and blunted jumps , slides and grapples , backward travels and upendings and topplings one dancer , barbara mahler , shoots through it all as a sometime catalyst another , debra wanner , stretches up and back into the light , alone on stage in a moment ends the dance always balanced between darkness and humor on a poetic note big wave , set to an atmospheric score by aural fixation , is as disorderly looking as its costumes , which seem to have been chosen randomly from the back of some longneglected closet but it has a compelling energy , as well as fine performing by a cast that also included karl anderson , eric diamond , karen langevin and ms skura the darkly dramatic lighting was by mary louise geiger , with costumes by elizabeth prince ms chuma s recent da costakada da da , 'a letter to van gogh , ' set to music by mark bennett , is a witty tour through an art gallery in which the true objects of interest are the visitors they spin off with companionable energy into dance that is as discontinuous as anything on the program but that has a sense of purpose and context a good part of the dance s wit comes from the stylish performers , who were gonnie heggen , eve mills , gilles monnart , maxi hill , fajo jansen , thomas lehman , tim feldmann and harry whittaker sheppard tere o'connor s new unlocked memory drawing with humans , danced to music by james baker , is a lulling ritual whose abstraction is a good deal more compelling than previous excursions into mystic storytelling by the choreographer but it badly needs to be pared the dance received a strong performance from christopher batenhorst , nancy coenen , sarah perron , chrysa parkinson and mr o'connor
washington , march 7 the bush administration announced plans today for mandatory nutritional labeling on virtually all packaged foods in a speech before a food policy conference , the secretary of health and human services , dr louis w sullivan , said the grocery store has become a tower of babel , and consumers need to be linguists , scientists and mind readers to understand the many labels they see vital information is missing , and frankly some unfounded health claims are being made he outlined what he called a comprehensive reform of the nation s food labeling , the first substantial change in nutritional labeling in 17 years , when the current requirements went into effect period of public comment the plan , which would take effect next year after a period of public comment , would require labels with nutritional information on nearly all foods that are meaningful sources of nutrition and make it mandatory to provide more information , including the amounts of saturated fat , fiber and cholesterol , and the calories that come from fat the food and drug administration regulates about 350 billion worth of food sold each year , and about 30 percent of that has mandatory nutritional labeling , which covers the amounts of protein , fat , vitamins and other components another 30 percent has been labeled voluntarily the remaining 40 percent is not labeled the changes would affect virtually all of the 20 , 000 different labels found in the average grocery store fruit and produce covered dr sullivan s plan would also give formal definitions for such phrases as low fat and high fiber at present , manufacturers can decide for themselves what is low or high under the administration s proposal , products may be labeled no fat if they have none , low fat if they contain less than a certain number of grams of fat , an amount that is being decided , and reduced fat if they contain substantially less than the fat in similar products the proposal would extend the required nutritional information to fresh fruit and produce this information would not be on the food but on shelves or in booklets available at the store , said dr frank e scarbrough , acting director of the fda s office of nutrition government and industry officials said that the agency , which regulates food labeling , has the authority to carry out the proposal without action by congress but officials for the center for science in the public interest , an advocacy group for consumers , said legal challenges were possible but they said none were foreseen the plan came only weeks after dr sullivan proposed changes in the rule governing health claims made on packages the earlier proposal would limit health claims to the few that were scientifically supported this proposal has been published in the federal register for public comment the foods that already have mandatory labels are those that have vitamins or other nutrients added to them , as well as products that make some nutritional claims , like a tomato juice cocktail that claims to be high in vitamin c among the products now commonly without any nutritional labeling are desserts , ketchup , steak sauce and other condiments and crackers , candy , cookies , salad dressing , olives and pickles the proposal was greeted with a variety of cheers and boos from the industry and consumer groups the national food processors association said it cannot support the proposal because it would not prevent states from making their own tougher rules john r cady , president of the group , said , why ca n't this country have a single , uniform food labeling system instead of a hodgepodge of conflicting requirements \? industry in basic accord he said the association is in basic agreement with most parts of dr sullivan s proposal , including mandatory nutritional labels industry has , in recent years , moved from opposing more labeling rules to supporting them or going along with new rules one of the reasons for the switch is the discovery by industry that labeling is widely read and heeded by consumers and can become a marketing tool if the product has some nutritional feature , as with adult breakfast cereals the companies that now carry nutritional labeling have pressed for mandatory labels we 'd love mandatory labeling , said david j mcdonald , chief executive officer of the curticeburns food company , which is affiliated with agway inc it s a level playing field congressional aides who follow the industry also said the companies now recognize that consumer demands for labeling are strong and more regulation is inevitable c manly molpus , president of the grocery manufacturers of america , put his group s position this way dr sullivan s strong and speedy nutrition labeling program is on the right track , but it is wrong to permit 50 food and drug administrations to label food we agree that today s consumers deserve a modernized nutrition label , and manufacturers are ready to undertake the enormous task of revising the almost 20 , 000 food labels found in the average grocery store little extra cost seen

some of the biggest blackowned advertising agencies and media companies have formed a trade organization , the african american marketing and media association , hoping to increase advertising to black audiences , alter what it sees as stereotyping and find more work for its members the group plans to get in touch with advertisers that it thinks could use black representation on the account and creative sides we know instinctively what will offend our audience , because we are our audience , said ken smikle , president of the organization and publisher of target market news , a national trade publication about black marketing what works creatively for whites wo n't necessarily work for blacks it s time to say we are the experts and will no longer be ignored the members of the chicagobased organization include new york and chicago advertising and public relations firms , as well as publishing houses and black radio networks through its research , the organization hopes to encourage advertisers to place more advertising in media intended for black audiences our media has always been underutilized , said the association s chairman , clarence o smith , president and cofounder of essence communications there probably is no media more persuasive with its audience than black media the group will soon begin substantial research about black consumers that it plans to disseminate widely the data on black consumers has been no more than an asterisk , mr smikle said you cannot go to a mall and interview a thousand consumers and have the 10 percent who happen to be black reflect accurate information about the group black americans spend an estimated 63 billion annually the need for this organization was exacerbated by the growing number of socalled experts who have no track record in this area of marketing , mr smikle observed he mentioned bbdo , which released a report last year entitled black readers of consumer publications that drew what he thinks were inaccurate conclusions the bbdo study concludes that advertisers can reach black consumers just as effectively with white publications such as parade as they could with such publications as ebony , mr smikle said as in most studies of the black consumer , their methodology is inadequate there s no psychographic data that gets to the heart of why black consumers make certain purchasing decisions doug alligood , vice president of special markets for bbdo , new york , who was in charge of the analysis for the study , denied it undermined the importance of black media what we found was that parade reaches as many black readers as ebony , but that it would n't make economic sense to use just parade if you want to reach black consumers exclusively , he said we freely acknowledge that it was an analysis of numbers only another goal of the new organization is to find ways to combat sterotypical portrayals of blacks in advertising or what some executives at blackowned media companies see as insidious racism in advertising for example , there is a nike public service antidrug ad that features basketball player david robinson , mr smikle said , in which words like stupid and garbage are used to describe people in the target audience we would never speak to ourselves like that liz dolan , a spokeswoman for nike , denied the ads were patronizing or the language even accidentally inappropriate we were trying to be very strong and we wanted the ad to be strong , she said the ad is powerful because it s clear how david robinson personally feels about how dangerous drugs are the ad is addressed to anyone who watches television none of our ads are targeted at a specific racial group the appeal of athletes is universal photo clarence o smith is the chairman of the chicagobased african american marketing and media association \( essence communications \)

a new treatment regimen for the bone disease osteoporosis can significantly reduce the incidence of bone fractures , researchers have found in a paper being published today in the new england journal of medicine , dr tommy storm , of sundby hospital in copenhagen , and his colleagues reported that women who were treated with etidronate disodium and calcium for three years had far fewer fractures of the spine than women who took a dummy drug and calcium for comparison i think it is an important study , said dr b lawrence riggs , an osteoporosis researcher at the mayo clinic in rochester , minn although two other treatments , estrogen and the bonemodeling hormone calcitonin , also significantly decrease the fracture rate , the new study gives another option , dr riggs said fda approval to be sought etidronate , made by norwich eaton pharmaceuticals , a division of procter gamble , prevents calcium from being lost from bone susan dietrich , a spokeswoman for norwich eaton , said the company would soon apply to the food and drug administration for approval to market the drug to treat osteoporosis its effectiveness is being examined in a study involving more than 400 patients at a number of medical centers in the united states osteoporosis , the most common bone disease , strikes many elderly men and women in women , bone loss accelerates after menopause , often leading to a severe decline in bone mass weakened bones in the spine may collapse , causing back pain and a loss of height brittle bones in the hip may fracture , often requiring nursing home care the new study involved 66 women 56 to 75 years of age who were randomly assigned to receive etidronate or a dummy pill when etidronate was used previously , it prevented new bone from being formed to the same degree as it had stopped bone from being lost , leading to no net effect 13week rest periods to avoid this difficulty , the danish researchers instructed the women to take the medication in twoweek cycles , followed each time by 13week periods when they took no drugs the rest period was intended to allow bone to build up again the researchers report that the women who used etidronate had an average of six fractures per 100 patient years , while those taking the dummy pills had 54 fractures per 100 patient years but neither group gained enough bone to make their bone mass normal none of the three treatments for osteoporosis restores bone mass to normal , dr riggs said and the only way to know which is most effective would be to compare them in a clinical trial
the dismissal of three northwest airlines pilots for allegedly flying under the influence of alcohol has focused renewed attention on federal rules that govern flying and drinking some members of congress and others are calling for mandatory alcohol testing of airline pilots current rules require that pilots be tested only for drugs , not alcohol , even after an accident at the same time , some health officials say that the blood alcohol limits set by the federal aviation administration should be lower and that pilots should be required to wait longer between their last drink and when they take the controls of a jet although alcohol has been traced to very few commercial aviation accidents , there is evidence that drinking among pilots is more widespread than the accident statistics indicate roger horn , president of safe travel america , a lobby group , said the incident shows clearly that the traveling public needs the same kind of protection for alcohol use as it has for drug use why is it that airline passengers have less protection than cattle in a freight car \? mr horn asked only railroad employees are currently tested for alcohol alcohol in captain s blood the three northwest pilots were stripped of their licenses on march 8 after flying a boeing 727 with 91 passengers from fargo , nd , to st paul an anonymous caller had tipped off faa inspectors that the crew had been seen drinking the night before federal officials disclosed friday that the captain , norman l prouse , 51 years old , of conyers , ga , had a blood alcohol level of more than 01 percent , high enough that in most states he would have been too drunk to drive a car legally the first officer , robert j kirchner , 35 , of highland ranch , colo , and second officer , joseph w balzer , 34 , of antioch , tex , had blood alcohol levels exceeding the 004 percent federal limit northwest announced friday that it had dismissed the three pilots , who are appealing the government s revocation of their licenses the incident has lent momentum to a bill sponsored by senators john c danforth , republican of missouri , and ernest f hollings , democrat of south carolina , that would require alcohol testing of airline pilots and other transportation workers on a random basis as well as before they are hired the bill has passed the senate and is before the house public works committee the air line pilots association , the pilots' union , strongly opposes the measure a spokesman , john mazor , argued the number of commercial aviation accidents traced to alcohol use was too small to justify testing extent of pilots' drinking indeed , since 1983 , there have been only 16 accidents involving airline pilots in which drugs or alcohol were found to be a factor , said michael benson , a spokesman for the national transportation safety board , an independent federal agency none of the accidents involved a major airline but about 6 percent of all accidents in private aviation are traced to drug or alcohol use some evidence indicates , however , that drinking among professional pilots may be more widespread since 1984 , 61 professional pilots have had their licenses suspended or revoked for flying under the influence of alcohol , said joann sloan , an faa spokeswoman the northwest incident is believed to be the first involving a major airline a 1987 crosscheck of the national driver registry and pilot records found that 10 , 300 pilots had their drivers' licenses suspended or revoked for driving while under the influence of alcohol more than 7 , 000 of them failed to report the information to the government , as required by law while most of those pilots flew only small , private planes , more than 1 , 000 flew commercial passenger planes the aviation agency has since proposed rules that would allow it to regularly search state driver records and automatically revoke the pilot s license of anyone who has had two or more convictions for drunken driving federal rules prohibit pilots from drinking less than eight hours before they fly , but some airlines , like usair , united and northwest , prohibit drinking 12 hours before flying and many pilots interviewed said they were even more cautious i wo n't get drunk 24 hours before a flight because i know it will affect me , said a united pilot but , he added , there are pilots out there who will drink heavily right up to the limit alcohol s impact on flying a 1986 study of navy pilots by stanford university researchers found that even 14 hours after their last drink , and with no trace of alcohol in their system , pilots' reaction time was slowed the study led some critics to question the federal eighthour limit i think the whole policy needs to be reexamined , said jay winsten , director of the alcohol project at the harvard school of public health i'm not sure that 8 or 10 hours is enough if a pilot has had a case of beer or a bottle of whisky the northwest pilots were reported to have been drinking less than eight hours before their flight the aviation agency considers a pilot legally impaired if he has a blood alcohol level of at least 004 percent , while in most states a driver is not considered legally impaired unless the level is 01 percent but some critics said not even a trace of alcohol should be tolerated for pilots , because so much is at stake and the effects of alcohol are greater in the thin air of an airplane cockpit virtually every major airline has an employee assistance program where pilots and other workers can seek confidential help for alcoholism hundreds of airline pilots have completed such rehabilitation programs and are now flying again the government requires that the pilots be monitored for several months after completing the program
east berlin , july 24 east germany s threemonthold coalition government lost its smallest partner today over the question of how to conduct the dec 2 allgerman elections that will be the country s last official act the free democratic alliance withdrew its support from prime minister lothar de maiziere s coalition after he refused to budge from his position that east germany should vote as a separate entity , formally becoming part of a united germany only the day after the elections his government did not fall because the other main coalition partner , the social democratic party , decided to stay in until the outcome of a joint session of the east and west german parliamentary committees on unity that will discuss the voting procedure in bonn on thursday what we are doing here is much more important , said the west german interior minister , wolfgang schauble , who heads the bonn cabinet s working group on german unity , alluding to the treaty between the two germanys that will decide the details of how they merge after the december election a doordie last stand but for the fragile east german political parties that barely had time to emerge after the berlin wall was finally opened last november after 40 years of communist dictatorship , the dec 2 election is a doordie last stand the three major parties in the coalition will merge with their west german counterparts before then , and many politicians will be out of jobs so the argument about one national election or two separate ones before unification is really a fight for political advantage , however petty the issues may seem to voters more worried about rising unemployment and high prices that came with the merging of the two countries' economies on july 1 both social democrats and free democrats in east germany argue that the allgerman vote should be counted by the same rules in both west and east germany , with the east declaring its annexation to the west no later than the day before the election the alliance of christian democratic parties won 47 percent of the votes in the march 18 election in east germany and holds 188 of the 400 seats in the parliament with the social democrats , mr de maiziere can still count on a healthy majority of 282 because the farmers party , with 12 seats , plans to merge with his party , the prime minister could probably govern even without the social democrats if they decide to leave behind the dispute none of the politicians , east or west , have openly explained the electoral arithmetic that underlies the dispute , but the suddeutsche zeitung of munich summed it up this morning the east german christian democrats are for separate election rules in east and west , the newspaper pointed out , because in east germany the former communists , now called the party of democratic socialism , take votes away from the social democrats on the left if west german rules applied in an allgerman election , as they would perhaps if east germany were annexed by dec 1 the way the free democrats and the social democrats want , any party that did not win 5 percent of the national vote would win no seats in the parliament knowing this , the theory goes , leftist voters would not waste their ballots on communists but would give them to social democrats instead and the free democratic alliance , divided and contentious in east germany , would benefit in an allgerman vote by close association with their wellestablished west german counterparts , the newspaper said
housebuster has taken a slight lead in the weekly opinion polls for the horse of the year title , and he might also be voted the champion sprinter and champion 3yearold if the ballots were cast today if he loses the vosburgh stakes at belmont tomorrow , though , he will lose the lead for all three titles housebuster s past performances this year are sparkling , and tomorrow he will try to become the first horse since spectacular bid in 1980 to win 10 stakes races in a season housebuster s record , though , is longer on dazzle than substance only one of his nine stakes triumphs has been in a grade i event , and none has been at more than a mile the vosburgh will by far be his toughest race since may 28 , when he was beaten by a neck by criminal type in the metropolitan handicap , his lone defeat this year the vosburgh yesterday drew a solid field of nine houebuster will have to beat the older sprinters once wild , sewickley , quick call , glitterman and jeweler s choice , and his fellow 3yearolds carson city , sunshine jimmy and gervazy the vosburgh and the breeders' cup sprint on oct 27 are the year s only grade i races for older sprinters , and housebuster s performance tomorrow will determine whether he tries the latter race if he wins the vosburgh , his handlers say , he might pass the sprint , since he would have the sprinting title locked up he might instead run in the meadowlands cup on oct 12 and then the nyra mile on nov 3 regardless of what course he takes , his horse of the year chances are entirely dependent on what criminal type does in the jockey club gold cup on oct 6 and the breeders' cup classic on oct 7 criminal type is still the most logical choice for the sport s top award , off his four grade i victories in major handicaps this spring and summer and victories over easy goer and sunday silence when it comes time to vote , it also will be hard to forget that criminal type beat housebuster the only time they met automatic betting accounts on oct 3 belmont will introduce what it is calling tiny tims , individual notebooksized betting machines that will allow customers to open betting accounts and wager throughout the card without fussing with tickets or cash the machines operate much like automatic tellers at banks , with bettors touching a screen to install an account number and password to get access to their accounts the machines do not issue money or paper , but bettors can make withdrawals or deposits from their accounts with regular mutuel clerks there will be 125 such machines installed by the end of next month at first , only oneday accounts will be offered , but the idea eventually is for regulars to have permanent accounts the immediate use for the machines will be at diningroom tables at the track , but the technology offers interesting longterm possibilities bettors could be issued their own machines and plug them into telephone lines anywhere , to place bets and get current odds and other information a breeders' cup of sorts if there were no such thing as the breeders' cup , next weekend s racing at belmont park would be its closest equivalent there will be five grade i races in two days , all of them corresponding to cup races that will be run oct 27 the jockey club gold cup on oct 6 is at the same mileandaquarter distance as the classic this year and is likely to draw criminal type , izvestia and flying continental other possible starters include the filly go for wand , rhythm , mi selecto and lay down the champagne for 2yearolds and the frizette for 2yearold fillies are on the gold cup undercard and will feature the respective divisional leaders , eastern echo among the colts and meadow star among the fillies the two races are at a mile , a sixteenth of a mile shorter than the breeders' cup juvenile and the breeders' cup juvenile fillies three weeks later the turf classic at a mile and a half on the grass oct 7 is run under the same conditions as the breeders' cup turf , and might feature a match between two of last year s cup winners prized , who took the turf , and steinlen , who won the mile and the nation s grass championship el senor and alwuhush are also likely to start the beldame the same day is the equivalent of the breeders' cup distaff , a mile and an eighth for fillies on the dirt if go for wand runs in the beldame , she will enjoy a virtual walkover if she passes it , the beldame will be a weak race because bayakoa and gorgeous , the nation s top older fillies , are scheduled to run instead in the spinster at keeneland a day earlier

mr nooteboom s narrators the writers who speak to us in such novels as in the dutch mountains and a song of truth and semblance worry over their role as creators of fictions they urge readers to remember that the book itself is an odd object , floating in the complicated context of a writer s thoughts and feelings a book reflects idiosyncratic decisions what to exclude , how to interpret and translate reality these questions affect not only the writer of fiction but of nonfiction as well this is particularly true of biography , in which the writer must use all his wiles and strategies to apprehend his subject s life , to locate the boundaries between that life and his own the knight has died , mr nooteboom s second novel , written in the early 1960 s , investigates the complexities of both the novelist s and the biographer s craft within a simple but contrived plot andre steenkamp has died , leaving incomplete a novel about a writer who takes on the task of completing a novel left by a writer who has died an acquaintance of steenkamp s , in turn , decides to complete this unfinished novel , assembling the fictional plot from notes and scraps and also assembling the plot of steenkamp s life steenkamp was tortured by the double consciousness that condemns a writer to observe and mine his own life , even as he tries to live it he was unable to find the language to express his thoughts and feelings kicking with his feet for words like a drowning person kicks for firm ground , he acknowledged his failure and retreated to the anecdote of his life anecdotes , of course , are not literature but the images and metaphors to which steenkamp aspired eluded him instead of living , he intellectualized life instead of writing , he left behind merely endless repetitions , the contradictions , pathetic cries , documents of impotence evidence of a writer s defeat both steenkamp and his successor are frustrated , even desperate , as they engage in the task of writing this misery distinguishes the knight has died from mr nooteboom s other novels , in which writers also face the challenge of creating fictions in a song of truth and semblance , for example , a writer , laboring to reinvent a conventional tale of adultery , is visited by a laconic colleague who tries to demystify the writing life i always pretend i am a twentiethcentury village storyteller , the visitor admits , and of course that is nonsense too , but i have decided that it is a craft and that i exercise this craft without supernatural speculations instead of giving in to selfdoubt and depression , a writer should get on with his work , satisfied with fame or money or simply because writing is fun those idiots , he adds , who say they suffer so have made it into a masochistic ritual so for them it s still fun the writer who seems to have the most fun is tiburon , the wry narrator of in the dutch mountains , a road inspector who writes fiction in an empty schoolhouse each august and reflects on his peculiar hobby thinking of plato , milan kundera and hans christian andersen , he speculates on the distinction among myths , novels and fairy tales how , he asks , does form affect the way a writer chooses to tell lies \? in the dutch mountains contains tiburon s effort at a fairy tale an improbable plot featuring two of the most beautiful and naive characters since candide and cunegonde but modest , selfeffacing tiburon is the real hero of mr nooteboom s wise and charming book the knight has died has none of that charm where mr nooteboom s other novels lightly satirize literary conventions , this one with its handful of downandout artistic types languishing on a spanish island , complete with one mysterious , promiscuous woman takes these conventions seriously the knight has died is earnest and , for mr nooteboom , uncharacteristically humorless , a dark and dismal tale of a writer s anguish but for all of its shortcomings , the book does not diminish his reputation much more than a 20thcentury village storyteller , cees nooteboom stands as an impressive and inimitable voice among contemporary writers photo cees nooteboom \( louisiana state university press \)
exes by dan greenburg 384 pp boston a marc jaffe book houghton mifflin company 1995 dan greenburg , the author of what do women want \? and other books , returns to familiar ground in this murder mystery as he examines again the battle between the sexes while exploring the concept that love is the selfdelusion we manufacture to justify the trouble we take to have sex , exes would more appropriately be titled the revenge of the onenight stand alternately adored and abused by her father , judy wells is distraught when she sees this pattern repeat itself in her romantic relationships men want her as long as she does not want them as soon as she returns the interest , they bolt soon , wells , a nonetoostable character with an unhealthy penchant for absolut vodka , decides to take matters into her own hands literally wielding a pocket razor , she tracks down , seduces and then slashes to death the men who have rejected her over the years when bodies start turning up around manhattan , the homicide detective max segal is assigned to the case segal , however , has his own problems with women he is trying to keep his marriage of seven years from falling apart when that seems impossible , he pursues a new relationship with a sexy reporter covering the murders his conflicting feelings about the two women in his life are further complicated by his devotion to his 3yearold son , sam \( mr greenburg has obviously been spending time around toddlers sam is just right funny and endearing one minute , embarrassing , stubborn and obtuse the next \) will segal ever understand sexual relationships \? will he catch wells before her revenge extends all the way back to sandbox rejections \? will sam stop sticking hamburgers in his ear \? mr greenburg writes an engrossing tale filled with black humor and psychologically interesting characters judy wells , for example , is monstrous and yet not entirely unlikable since it is hard to mourn her sleazy victims , one does not wholeheartedly root for her capture until she becomes truly menacing toward the end there are flaws , however the true identity of the killer is so transparent that mr greenburg detracts from the overall effect with his attempts to conceal it and although the author goes to great lengths to explain police procedures , none of those have any bearing on the solution to the crimes instead , for no discernible reason , one character simply has a wildly remote and improbable hunch it reads as if , despite all the technology he has apparently researched so thoroughly , mr greenburg still could not figure out how to make his plot lines come together if you can forgive these lapses , the rest is great grisly fun drawing
the head of the soviet military said yesterday that the economic sanctions against iraq were working and that no force should be used in the persian gulf unless it was approved by the united nations the remarks by the soviet general , mikhail a moiseyev , chief of the soviet general staff , were the most explicit comments made so far by a soviet official on the need to have united nations approval for the use of force by the united states and other nations that have opposed the iraqi invasion of kuwait the soviet general s comments in an unusual joint interview with gen colin l powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff signaled a basic disagreement with washington about the circumstances under which military force could be used in the persian gulf we cannot view the resolution of any crisis like this by means of using arms , said general moiseyev , who is on a tour of the united states as a guest of general powell but general powell pointedly said president bush had not ruled out any options the two generals were interviewed by writers and editors of the new york times suggesting that military force was not needed to force iraqi troops out of kuwait , general moiseyev said the economic embargo was beginning to hurt iraq saddam hussein has really understood now finally how far he has gone , general moiseyev said he is finding himself in economic and political isolation , and he ca n't survive very long that way general moiseyev asserted that protests , uprisings and desertions in iraqi were sapping the strength of the iraqi military and impelling president hussein to seek a diplomatic solution you ca n't keep an army together just by using fear and intimidation against your own troops , general moiseyev said also there are rumors beginning to abound about people who are going to make attempts against saddan hussein s life , forcing hussein to begin to look for ways out of this crisis he said that if military force was used by the united states and its allies , such action should be approved by the united nations trust between generals i do n't see really any other way , general moiseyev said his position also underscored the reluctance of the soviet military to be drawn into a conflict in the region the bush administration , in contrast , has pointedly kept open the possibility of using military force to drive the iraqis out of kuwait and of doing so without united nations sanction , a point general powell reaffirmed today they see any use of military force being within the context of the united nations actions , general powell said the united states hopes the situation can be resolved peacefully we are not eliminating any of the options that are available to the president flanked by military aides , general moiseyev sat beside his american counterpart and spoke forcefully on an array of issues the two men spoke warmly of each other and general moiseyev said there was complete trust between them it was a throwback to the days during world war ii when the two countries became allies general moiseyev was named chief of staff and first deputy defense minister in december 1988 at 49 he was the youngest soviet chief of staff to be chosen since 1952 his promotion from commander of the far eastern military district to the ministry post over many senior defense officials was taken as a sign that the soviet leadership wanted to infuse the military with fresh ideas the soviet general assailed the dwindling prestige of the military in soviet society and likened it to the fallen stature of the american military after the war in vietnam he spoke with evident disdain about the recommendations by georgi a arbatov and other specialists at the usacanada institute in moscow and others seeking to overhaul the soviet military israeli attack on reactor in an unusual admission , the soviet general said that israel s bombing of the iraqi nuclear reactor at osirak in 1981 was understandable the united states , the soviet union and other nations criticized the action at the time but general moiseyev said yesterday , there was some sort of foundation or reason for taking the action that israel undertook but many of the soviet general s remarks centered on the persian gulf , a subject he discussed with president bush at a white house meeting yesterday before he and general powell came to new york pentagon officials said last week that there appeared to be a split between top soviet foreign ministry officials who had called for tough action against iraq and their counterparts in the military who wanted to maintain some measure of influence with baghdad by maintaining advisers there whatever the merits of that pentagon analysis , general moiseyev repeatedly counseled against the use of force against iraq and defended the continuing presence of soviet advisers , whom he called technicians , insisting that they were making no contribution to the iraqi military and saying that their presence represented legitimate economic relations between moscow and baghdad plan for un panel general moiseyev said that the united nations military staff committee should be activated and that foreign ministry officials from all the nations opposing iraq should meet as part of the commission to analyze the situation the general , who said he had proposed the activation of the committee to president bush yesterday , said the committee could prepare an additional resolution setting a timetable for resolving the crisis i do not think hussein is going to go for fighting the whole world , the soviet general said general powell said the united states would consider the soviet suggestion to activate the committee but expressed caution about whether it would contribute to a solution of the crisis in the gulf the soviet general insisted that moscow had only 206 advisers , including 42 interpreters , in iraq , and that none were linked to the soviet military he said that iraq had posed no barriers to the withdrawal of the technicians , who he said were involved in trade relations and that 77 were close to fulfilling their contract and would return to the soviet union soon but he dismissed the suggestion that moscow immediately withdraw the rest , saying normal , healthy contacts with all countries were justified general powell said general moiseyev had presented a breakdown of the 206 technicians , which the pentagon would examine the pentagon has said moscow has from 500 to 1 , 000 military and civilian advisers in iraq and that some of them are maintaining

florence , june 7 the leading clairvoyants in yaounde , the capital of cameroon , were recently polled by a local newspaper to determine the fortune of the national team in the 1990 world cup finals none offered an opinion one , however , expressed his chagrin that the cameroon soccer federation had not taken up his offer to create charms for the 11 starters , at a cost of 4 , 000 each as a result , the sorcerer decided , the only thing to do to assure success against argentina , which cameroon plays in the opening match of the tournament friday in milan , was for each cameroon player to take a ritual bath before the game neither magic charms , ritual baths nor anything else is likely to help cameroon against argentina , the 1986 champion , even if diego maradona , the world s highestpaid player , is still bothered by a sore toe nor is it likely that the 10 camels the united arab emirates delegation brought for superstitious reasons will greatly affect play enthusiasm abounds but it s the sentiment that counts , and if enthusiasm alone was fueling the 1990 tournament , it could be the best ever fifa , the world governing body for soccer , predicts that 15 billion television viewers will watch the tournament , which consists of 24 nations competing through four rounds of 51 games , leading to the final july 8 in rome since 1930 , the first year a world cup was held , a long shot has never won the championship the 13 previous tournaments have been won by only six countries , three from south america \( uruguay , brazil and argentina \) and three from europe \( italy , england , west germany \) that hardly bodes well for the outsiders this year , including costa rica , the emirates and the united states , which are 5001 to win , according to one prominent

newspaper gazetta dello sport , and the citizenry of italy is the home team , known because of their blue shirts as the azzuri italy plays in a firstround group with the united states , austria and czechoslovakia the choice is partly emotional , based on the premise that playing at home before wildly adoring fans can overcome any athletic shortcoming in fact , it cannot be clearly demonstrated that the italians are significantly better than the west germans , the dutch or the brazilians the italians and most other teams have other incentives to win , chiefly financial rewards from their governments , federations or industrial leaders as much as 400 , 000 each for the italians if they win the championship even the soviet players have been promised a bonus , 30 , 000 each , if they win

the appointment last week of jane hermann and oliver smith as codirectors of american ballet theater obviously heralds a new phase in the troupe s history but through its importance , this decision by the board of an internationally ranked company also symbolizes the implicit closing of a strange era it is one that saw an unprecedented number of ballet companies headed by male stars , some of whom continued their dancing careers mikhail baryshnikov s tenure as ballet theater s artistic director from 1980 through last september was the embodiment of this trend or aberration , depending upon one s point of view ballet theater s decision to appoint administrators as his successors and even to forgo a search for a ballet personality to direct the company is a significant departure or rather , it is a return to ballet theater s organizational beginnings mr smith , in fact , is being recalled to the same post he held from 1945 to '80 as codirector with lucia chase miss chase became ballet theater s longtime patron in 1939 when the company was established by its founder and first director , richard pleasant , with additional backing from a businessman , rudolf orthwine miss chase did dance in the company , but mr pleasant and then sol hurok who ran ballet theater before mr smith , a scenic designer , and miss chase were certainly nondancers ms hermann has been ballet theater s executive director since april and was formerly director of presentations at the metropolitan opera house the indisputable authority now granted her places another nondancer firmly at the helm within this context it is easy to see mr baryshnikov s decade as artistic director as a haphazard experiment engendered by the dazzle of his name and artistry yet , his imprint will long be felt through his own example as a dancer and through his critical eye , ballet theater acquired a genuine classical style classicism today is second nature even to ballet theater s youngest dancers very possibly , it was ballet theater s appointment of mr baryshnikov that set the swift pace for the exceptional number of male dancers who suddenly became artistic directors in companies once headed by founders , administrators or choreographers abroad these included erik bruhn at the national ballet of canada , rudolf nureyev at the paris opera ballet , anthony dowell at the royal ballet in britain and peter schaufuss at london festival ballet at home , the names included among others peter martins , who became the new york city ballet s artistic codirector with jerome robbins bruce marks , first with ballet west in salt lake city and now the boston ballet helgi tomasson at the san francisco ballet , succeeding michael smuin robert weiss at the pennsylvania ballet , and edward villella at miami city ballet but within the last six months , mr baryshnikov has resigned and mr nureyev , mr schaufuss and mr weiss have also left , although for highly different reasons mr bruhn died in 1986 , and mr dowell s fate at the royal ballet has until recently been deemed uncertain none of this means that male dancers will not serve as directors but unlike the 1980 s , the 1990 s may suggest that boards of directors are no longer automatically in love with bigname stars for purposes of prestige or fundraising it is true that the paris opera ballet has replaced a superstar , mr nureyev , with a younger french star , patrick dupond but one reason for mr nureyev s departure was his clash with new highpowered administrators pierre berge , the socalled czar of the entire paris opera organization , which includes the new bastille opera house and the old house , the palais garnier , and jeanalbert cartier , the garnier s administrator , to whom mr dupond will probably have to bow the growing worldwide disenchantment with dancing directors has also coincided with the financial realities of running a ballet company the ballet world today cannot afford a baryshnikov or a nureyev who performs in plays , acts in movies or dances mostly with companies other than his own while retaining the title of artistic director in ballet theater s situation , significantly , it was easy to list many ballet theater alumni as prospective artistic directors but there was no single obvious choice in the way mr baryshnikov was in 1980 ms hermann may owe her new title of codirector to ballet theater s board but ballet theater s board was also saved by her energetic costcutting and administrative firmness in a financial crisis this fall there is a quid pro quo here that should be kept in mind , especially when a new board chairman succeeds melville strauss , who announced over a year ago that he would leave by next summer although she has , in effect , run ballet theater since mr baryshnikov s departure , ms hermann now has the freedom of artistic choice she did not have while her future was in limbo it is too early to predict a full artistic profile for the hermannsmith regime but one can venture that the company will be smaller and that a greater emphasis will be placed on the dancers' individual personalities presumably , mr smith , who was initially invited by ms hermann to advise her on ballet theater s 50thanniversary year and who is also a symbol of continuity , will not attempt to turn the clock back to the 1940 s or even the 1970 s miss hermann presumably will not adopt a policy that she once followed at the met , under which she frequently featured a star , namely mr nureyev , as a boxoffice draw for ballet companies that became a backdrop on the other hand , her openness to guestartistswithinreason may generate welcome excitement soviet stars already rumored to be appearing in new york with the company this spring are faruk ruzimatov of the kirov and the bolshoi team , yekaterina maksimova and vladimir vasiliev the best sign for the future is ms hermann s relationship with the dancers , who are reportedly dancing very well on tour conscious that she is not a regisseur , ms hermann has engaged irina kolpakova , of the kirov , as coach for the spring , and margot fonteyn has already coached this winter anyone who knows where the choreographers are knows there are no great surprises in store the hermannsmith appointment did not generate the excitement that the naming of a ballet superstar once could that was its very justification call this move a return to business as usual or to reality , it was very much what ballet theater needed photo jane hermann and oliver smith \( front row , second and fourth from right \) were among the troupe s

budapest , oct 27 angry taxi drivers and truck drivers blockaded the streets and bridges of hungary s capital today to protest the government s decision to raise gasoline prices by 65 percent protesters also snarled traffic in dozens of other cities and towns , closed border crossings and brought much of the nation s economy to a standstill the protests began on friday morning when the new gasoline prices took effect , but the government has vowed not to bow to the protesters' demands to roll back the increases the government has reached a decision , and it is irrevocable , said interior minister balazs horvath it remained unclear today when the barricades would be removed because government officials said they would not forcibly end the roadblocks the blockades usually took the form of taxis and trucks parked to shut bridge and highway entrances , railroad crossings and key intersections in dozens of towns and cities army ordered not to interfere in his capacity as commander in chief , president arpad goncz ordered that the army and its vehicles not be used to settle the dispute according to mti , the hungarian press agency , budapest s police chief , sandor barna , said he would resign if he were ordered to use force against the taxi drivers and truckers political commentators said that after decades of repression under communism , the government was loathe to be seen as heavyhanded and stifling democratic expression to try to end the crisis , the centerright government was negotiating with representatives of budapest s 40 , 000 private taxi drivers the public seemed displeased with both sides in the dispute many hungarians criticized the government for raising gas prices to about 380 a gallon , from 230 a gallon that is equal to western european prices and far higher than american prices , even though the average hungarian earns less than 50 a week at current exchange rates at the same time , many hungarians condemned the taxi drivers and truckers for causing chaos many people could not get to work , many food deliveries could not be made , and there was a rush of panic buying for essentials like break and milk hundreds slept in cars hundreds of people had to sleep in their cars because the blockades prevented them from reaching home army trucks helped bring them food and drink this morning for much of friday and today , five and sometimes all six of budapest s bridges across the danube were blocked the highway to budapest s main airport was also blockaded much of friday but was reopened sporadically today hundreds of passengers missed their flights , and a charter helicopter service was begun between downtown hotels and the airport government officials said they were forced to raise gasoline prices because the government has had to start buying large supplies of oil at world prices after the soviet union cut its heavily subsidized oil shipments to hungary by 30 percent this summer officials also said hungary was down to just four days of gasoline reserves , and prices had to be increased to reduce consumption but the taxi drivers contended that the 65 percent increase was more than they could afford and more than was justified by the higher price the government pays for crude oil some economists said much of the price increase was designed to balance the nation s budget and reduce consumption to help keep the nation s oil bill from ballooning and its trade balance from worsening protests reflect impatience many hungarians said the protests reflected a growing impatience with the government of prime minister jozsef antall for failing to make tangible improvements in economic conditions there was also frustration that the price increase could add one or two percentage points to inflation , which has hovered near 30 percent for the past year the main opposition party , the free democrats , lashed out at the price rise we condemn the way the price increase has been implemented as well as its size , said miklos haraszti , a leader of the free democrats we fully understand the reaction this price increase does not fit into any kind of economic strategy and will increase inflation in parliamentary debates , gabor fodor , a member of the young democrats , said the government would have a hard time wriggling out of the trap it had stepped into poland , czechoslovakia and romania have also raised gasoline prices , partly as a result of the cutbacks in soviet oil shipments but none of those countries had huge protests like those in hungary photo taxi and truck drivers blocked roads and bridges in budapest yesterday to protest a 65 percent increase in gasoline prices ordered by the government a driver served donated food to colleagues at a roadblock \( reuters \)
london london seems fascinated these days with fakery , pastiche , and imitation the city s largest redevelopment schemes are latterday venetian piazzas and roman squares a night at the opera may feature macbeth warbling verdi with a chorus of nazi storm troopers the historical novelist peter ackroyd fills bookstores with simulations of oscar wilde s diaries , hawksmoor s dark plottings , and thomas chatterton s frauds and for an april fool s joke , the independent reported that after the mona lisa had been cleaned , her enigmatic smile was unmasked as 17thcentury overpainting hiding a grumpy frown now the british museum has entered the fray with a demanding exhibition , fake \? the art of deception on display through sept 2 are more than 600 artifacts from egyptian times to the present , most of which have been acquired under false assumptions , often on the part of the british museum itself is this an act of curatorial selfabasement , a desperate attempt to wipe egg off the museum s face by public confession , or a subversion of the entire arthistorical enterprise \? none of these , blandly replies mark jones , an assistant keeper in the coins and medals department and the organizer of the exhibition the british museum ran an exhibition on the same theme in 1961 , and the trustees thought the idea was good for another go mr jones concedes that a certain amount of paranoia is inevitable in acquisition amid the clutter of his office , he sits in earnest tweeds , a scholar who has learned to live with uncertainty but if fake \? is a catalogue of blunders , he argues , the rest of the museum is a catalogue of success the main thing is not to sentence fakes to the fate of their makers because they are products of deceit and sometimes criminality , museums and collectors have treated them as objects of shame , deaccessioning them like guilty secrets in fact , mr jones insists , they are historical documents of great value the best indexes to the state of the art market at a given moment , clues to what an age considered signs of authenticity , marks of cultural desire nineteenthcentury fakes , for example , are beautifully preserved and exquisitely executed , mr jones says in his catalogue essay , whereas 20thcentury ones are more concerned to convince by display of plausible damage than by the quality of their workmanship it is no wonder that mr jones is fascinated by fakes they are designed as a direct challenge to the expert the exhibition defines a fake as anything made or altered with an intention to deceive , but the motives for deception are as various as human psychology on display are the mockedup mermen , furry fish , unicorn horns and griffin claws produced by greedy entrepreneurs for the credulous folk of bygone days for collectors of the last century fascinated with lurid gothic tales , the same entrepreneurial energy came up with chastity belts and torture devices of doubtful origin the contemporary world shows a bankruptcy of imagination in its fakes imitation chanel and yarley perfumes , louis vuitton suitcases , reebok sneakers , and children s legos inferior products made desirable by forged prestige labels now gathered under the glass of museum cases and the glow of exhibition lighting , these frauds are reclassified as authentic wonders the history of science is replete with deceptions and hoaxes fake \?

in lawmaking , as in any field , work expands to fill the time available so it was n't surprising that , with a deadline of october 1990 , the new york legislature last year failed to pass legislation putting the new federal welfare reform law into effect it was n't surprising and it was n't responsible that failure cost new york money , at least 45 million so far , and counting new yorkers have a right to wonder what s going on in albany more important , they have a right to see welfare reform done right new york s delinquency is particularly dismaying because the principal sponsors of the reform bill , the family support act , are senator daniel patrick moynihan and congressman tom downey , both of new york the main reason for the delinquency is a clash of interests and ideologies between the democratic assembly and the republican senate the new family support act merely established a new welfare superstructure , including higher federal reimbursements for approved employment and training programs but most details were left to the states , including the precise shape of their programs and the rules that govern them in new york , those have been matters of fierce contention for example , college education obviously enhances employability , and the state wisely uses community colleges to train welfare recipients for some occupations but should the welfare system support people to earn baccalaureate degrees becoming , in effect , a college scholarship program \? that is n't what either congress or the public understands by welfare reform nevertheless , the issue is a stumbling block in albany among other unresolved issues are what kind of childcare arrangements ought to be eligible for reimbursement what ought to be required of adult recipients with children under age 3 , and what is the right mix of voluntary and mandatory in training program rules none of these issues transcends intelligent compromise what seems to be missing is the urgency of a deadline maybe it would help if legislators used as their clock a meter for how much the state loses by each day s delay the meter has been running for more than a year with losses mounting daily and new york still does n't have welfare reform
rome the project by a team of vatican restorers to clean michelangelo s frescoes on the ceiling of the sistine chapel , and in the lunettes just below , has finally concluded , triumphantly , after a decade of sometimes angry debate and widespread concern over the fate of this great work the newly revealed ceiling looks overwhelmingly beautiful early in april , several dozen art historians , conservators and scientists from around the world were invited to rome by the vatican to celebrate the results and to discuss strategy for the next , and in several ways more complex , phase of the restoration the cleaning of michelangelo s last judgment on the altar wall of the chapel that effort , which has already begun , is expected to last four years and to produce results at least as dramatic as the cleaned ceiling it seems that the predominant color underneath the now blackened surface of the last judgment is a brilliant blue the public scrutiny that has accompanied the restoration so far is heartening testimony to the enduring significance of monuments like the sistine but the nature of the scrutiny has at times been alarming a handful of critics of the project have managed to keep debate alive by focusing on technical matters that have been easily misinterpreted questions have been raised about the characteristics of the solvent , called ab57 , used to wipe away grime , and whether glazes and small details were mistakenly removed by the restorers repeatedly over the last 10 years , these questions have been addressed not only by the vatican but also by independent experts far from the controversial project that the news media have led the public to believe it is , the restoration of the ceiling has met with extraordinary and international approval among scholars and conservators but this is not to say the project has been without problems considerably further reaching than discussions about ab57 the pity is that these problems have so far been overshadowed by smaller debates far and away the most significant issue to have been ignored is the quality of the environment within the chapel as many as 19 , 000 people a day trudge through the sistine , bringing in dirt and humidity that can harm the frescoes and eventually undermine the painstaking restoration years ago , the vatican accommodated visitors by installing heating in the floor of the sistine , further altering the precarious atmosphere in the 132footlong chapel the heating is no longer used , but the chapel has apparently become even more of a tourist attraction and thus a financial boon to the vatican since the restoration began the overriding question raised by the restoration , one that relates to the care of all monuments , is whether the monetary interests of the church and the public s freedom to visit the chapel will be tempered so the paintings can be preserved for future generations the vatican has talked about climate controls but it has yet to take any serious action another troubling issue involves the commercial sponsorship of the sistine project other restoration campaigns in italy , like the work on leonardo da vinci s last supper in milan , have been helped by flexible and accommodating corporate and government sponsors the vatican accepted an offer from nippon television to pay for the project , in return for which the japanese company was granted temporary control over sistine photographs one of the benefits has been that absolutely every aspect of the restoration is now on film nippon , however , has made access to photographs difficult and expensive critics of the project have had reason to complain about this moreover , the only volume yet published by the vatican concerning the restoration did not contain the pictures necessary to address critics' concerns the vatican may wonder why debate over the ceiling continues , but it has itself , and nippon , partly to blame these problems should not obscure , however , the accomplishments of the restorers the sistine is no longer illuminated by the artificial lights that distorted the colors and modeling of the painted figures on the ceiling and lunettes , but by natural light , as michelangelo assumed it would be the colors are not garish , as they appeared to some observers when the restoration was halfcompleted and floodlamps accentuated the shocking difference between clean and unclean , making the cleaned section appear flat and cartoonlike , as if shadows had been wiped away the shadows are still there and the highkey colors now make perfect sense michelangelo used them so that the complicated painted scenes on the ceiling could be more easily deciphered without artificial light from the floor , some 60 feet below the importance of the restoration can hardly be overstated if it is too much to say that there was a history of renaissance art before the project and another history that must now be written , it is true that michelangelo will no longer be perceived as he has been since the third quarter of the 16th century , when the recently completed frescoes began to deteriorate the michelangelo whose seemingly somber palette inspired generations of painters and historians has emerged as a different artist the new michelangelo may inspire future painters and historians in different ways from the old one , and it is no surprise that many people , who grew up with a powerful sense of the ceiling as it was , have had difficulty accepting the restoration
fort lauderdale , fla , april 12 from day one , the odds that the soviet yacht fazisi would make it round the world were slim the 82foot singlemast sloop , one of 22 vessels competing in the whitbread round the world race , lost her chief sponsor , pepsico , just before the race began on sept 2 near southampton , england the yacht , the first of its kind built in the soviet union , was barely completed in time for the first leg of the 32 , 932nauticalmile race it was built by fazis , a soviet conglomerate that builds tankers and runs a brewery the soviet government was not involved in the effort the fazisi raced for punta del este , uruguay , without a sea trial in which to iron out equipment imperfections and staffed by a crew with little experience in largescale yacht racing once there , the skipper , aleksei grishenko , snapped under the pressure of representing the soviet union in a risky , resourceless venture , his colleagues said , and hanged himself from a tree despite the crisis , the 18 crew members decided to continue the race , but the publicity surrounding grishenko s death made it even more difficult to raise the money they needed the crew , unaccustomed to the freemarket world , made erratic fundraising efforts and the race remained , for them , a handtomouth affair decent showing but , confounding the skeptics , fazisi arrived in fort lauderdale on wednesday , in 13th position a respectable showing to the cheers of hundreds of observers the race will resume on may 5 , when the last leg about 3 , 000 nautical miles will be run to southampton that the fazisi made it here at all may be attributed not only to the determination of the crew but also to skip novak , a 37yearold chicago native and veteran of three previous whitbread races who took over the helm after grishenko s death for the crew , this was something much more than a yacht race , novak said wednesday they were under a lot of pressure to succeed , to go into the west and operate as a private entity aleksei felt personally responsible for the whole thing sergei stanetsky , a 31yearold electronics engineer from odessa who is the watch captain , said grishenko did not sleep for a week before arriving in uruguay he was worried about our hull he was worried about everything , stanetsky said he kept checking the hull with a flashlight pepsico drops out pepsico s decision not to extend its sponsorship option dealt a hard blow to a crew unaccustomed to the vagaries of corporate decisionmaking pepsico fulfilled its contractual obligation , to help pay for some of the fazisi s startup costs , novak said , but withdrew from the race itself when criticized in middle america for sponsoring a soviet vessel at a time two american boats dropped plans to compete because they lacked sponsors as a result , we were depending on people s charity to get us around the world , novak said but here , on the final layover of the sixleg race , the fazisi and her small band of supporters have caught on to the fundraising game , helped by rae glasgow , a marketing expert from new zealand who took pity on the fazisi during its stopover in auckland and volunteered to raise money in the united states the crew members' hotel here is putting them up for no charge plans for the next three weeks include a benefit art auction on may 3 in palm beach , 40 miles north of here , featuring several pieces of contemporary soviet works of art provided by the ministry of culture in moscow new sails pledged a tampa , fla , sail manufacturer has pledged 80 , 000 worth of new sails for the yacht s trip to southampton , money that the company plans to recoup by staging a fourrace series off fort lauderdale on april 20 , 22 , 28 and 29 between the fazisi and the card , a 79foot swedish ketch while other yachts in the race basked in the comfort of sponsorship from major corporations , the fazisi had to make do with free airplane tickets from aeroflot , a raffle organized by an auckland radio station and some extra cash from a uruguayan wool exporter the sloop was forced to sail the first five legs of the race using the same set of sails while the race s leader , the new zealand ketch steinlager 2 , went through more than 100 competing crews , none of which were as beset with problems as the fazisi , nicknamed it the submarine because it is so low in the water the boat s 440pound boom snapped north of the kerguelen islands in the indian ocean , the keel had to be replaced a spinnaker pole broke the generator and gas stove were out of commission , and the yacht was the only one in the race not equipped with a computer to study weather patterns we made it around the world , novak said it s amazing it really is a miracle photo fazisi , the soviet entry in the whitbread round the world race , sailing into fort lauderdale wednesday \( the new york times james kamp \)

riga , latvia , may 16 the soviet lieutenant stood apart from his fellow officers in the angry crowd that gathered last tuesday outside the latvian parliament he was not demonstrating against latvian independence he did not shout or push he had come during his lunch hour to see what was going on , and stayed on to get doused in latvian hostility the lieutenant , vladimir maksimovich , identified himself only by his name and patronymic , in the russian style , without giving his last name he tried to explain his point of view about the latvian move to independence , but it was not easy he is a russian , in his late 40 s , born in lithuania after serving in five other soviet republics and in afghanistan , he came to latvia he commands a construction team here , and he wants to settle here his daughter , he said proudly , is studying latvian and getting straight a s none of this won him any sympathy with his listeners outside parliament , where tension was high on a day when crowds of antiindependence protesters tried to force their way into the building to protest latvia s moves to sovereignty where is home \? why do n't you go home where you belong \? hissed an older woman where is home , the lieutenant asked , if i was born in the baltics \? you are just saying that , the woman said you are a lying communist , just like all the rest the lieutenant , smiling painfully , said , please , let us try to stay polite a middleaged man started up it is all based on lies like that forest outside smolensk all those years , we were told the fascists killed those people at katyn , and now we learn it was the red army what other lies are there \? like other russians , the lieutenant seemed caught off guard by the vehemence of popular feelings elsewhere in the crowd , latvians were calling russians occupiers to which russians responded by calling latvians fascists remembering the money the lieutenant tried a more reasonable approach you have to remember that in all the baltics the soviet union has invested six billion rubles , he began but he was quickly hooted down one woman , laughing , said keep your six billion we 'll work day and night , if that s what it takes to make it up the lieutenant , trying another tack , asked where will it all end \? so the baltics want to get out of the soviet union do you think this will make things better \? and what if russia breaks out of the union \? he went on , analogizing to the situation of the chukchis , an eskimo tribe in northeastern siberia then the chukchis will want their own territory they have all the gold they could live like arab princes but the latvians wanted to return to their grievances what about 1940 \? one man said , giving the year that the soviet union annexed latvia you do n't want to talk about that you probably do n't even know the real history 'privileges' resented an angry young man , sweeping away history to bring up a more personal issue , said and why do you have a nice apartment , with all the privileges and furnishings , while i , who was born here , i have to live in a basement communal apartment \? sooner or later , most of the arguments that took place between russians and latvians in front of the parliament building came down to the question of living space in a country where people wait 10 years to get an apartment , no one can look on the prospect of moving with anything less than dread and rightly or wrongly , many people of russian heritage living in the three baltic republics think that if latvia , lithuania and estonia leave the soviet union , the russians will be forced to leave , with nowhere to go this fear about their personal future has given the antiindependence demonstrations a desperate edge who is there in russia waiting for me \? asked konstantin makarov , a russian who is a senior researcher at technical university in rigano one where would i go \? moscow already has too many refugees new curbs on nonlatvians the anxiety is particularly high among the military officers , who said that in the last year even before latvia started moving toward independence the local authorities had started to limit the number of new , nonlatvian residents who have been formally registration to live in riga my wife cannot get registered , said lieut pyotr ivanov , as he joined his fellow officers in shouting soviet union ! and elbowing through an opposing crowd of latvians i consider that unfair and undemocratic for many latvians , the question is simply not an issue let them stand in line , just like we stood in line , said rita lapinska , a fervent supporter of the popular front , the proindependence party that now controls latvian politics in latvia , where almost half the population is nonlatvian , many people of russian stock support the movement toward independence in elections last spring , such voters helped give the popular front a majority in the republic s new parliament link to fascism charged but there are many other russians particularly among the military and the more recent immigrants to the republic who hold the view , long propounded by soviet propaganda dating to world war ii , that baltic nationalism is linked to fascism today , antiindependence forces in latvia are dredging up the same themes , and using them to incite opposition to the declaration of independence made may 4 in leaflets dropped around riga on monday , interfront , the main group of people opposing independence , referred darkly to a counterrevolution and called on soviet citizens to defend themselves and their wives , mothers and children the crudest scare tactics appeared in the interfront newspaper , unity , which ran a cartoon this week showing two men in nazi armbands , watching demonstrators on television shout slogans like latvia for latvians ! hang the communists ! and russians out of latvia ! in the caption , one nazi says to the other , look , hans , they have the same slogans we have the other replies , well , after all , they came out of our school map of lativa showing location of riga

the group known as the guerrilla girls turned five a few weeks ago , but if they held an anniversary celebration , it was typically secret since 1985 , this mysterious band of artworld women , who boldly some would say presumptuously call themselves the conscience of the art world , has regularly papered sections of lower manhattan with smartly designed blackandwhite posters these communiques , bristling with sarcasm , statistics and bold graphics , level charges of sexism and racism at various quarters of the art world , including galleries , museums , collectors , critics and white male artists waging a largely singleissue campaign that shunts aside the complexities of esthetic style and quality and that has drawn some negative criticism of its own , the guerrilla girls have helped fuel an increasingly noisy debate about elitism in the art world , part of a larger debate , spilling out from universities , about whether racial and sexual biases have narrowed the understanding of history and culture the first poster , which went up in april 1985 , simply listed 42 prominent male artists , from arman to peter voulkos it was bracketed by the question what do these artists have in common \? and the answer , they all allow their work to be shown in galleries that show no more than 10 percent women or none at all since then , the group has produced 30 posters their four most recent efforts , printed as usual in batches of about 500 , appeared in march individual identities are another matter the guerrilla girls work in a carefully maintained anonymity , postering in the dead of night and wearing big , toothy gorilla masks during public appearances thus attired , they have appeared on television , spoken at museums and colleges around the country , and accepted an award from the manhattan borough presidenttwo of them appeared on a panel when the college art assocation met in new york city earlier this year , answering questions in somewhat muffled voices the guerrilla girls were galvanized into action in early 1985 by the international survey of contemporary painting and sculpture , an enormous exhibiton at the museum of modern art in which women constituted less than 10 percent of the 169 artists represented the figure suggested that the gains made by female artists during the 1970 s had eroded with the heatedup , europeoriented market of the early 1980 s , the art world had become once more focused on white male artists aiming to make feminism fashionable again , the guerrilla girls initiated their hitandrun poster campaign in effect , they took feminist theory , gave it a populist twist and some madison avenue pizazz and set it loose in the streets their posters are confrontational without prescribing behavior despite their statistical approach , the guerrilla girls always stop short of announcing a quota system , because , one explains , we want to get to people s imaginations whether they have sparked imaginations or embarrassment , the group has undeniably helped change the artworld climate , admitedly in a time when society as a whole has been changing their posters have illuminated the gap between action and principle in an art world that thinks of itself as unusually liberal and enlightened i think they 've raised people s consciousness , says linda shearer , director of the williams college museum of art and previously a curator at the museum of modern art in the last 10 years , but especially the last 5 , there have been many , many more women artists visible on the scene it s partly a chickenegg thing it s in the air , but the guerrilla girls have been partly responsible for putting it in the air robert buck , director of the brooklyn museum , thinks the guerrilla girls are right in terms of making everyone aware of who comes out on the short end in the art world but he dislikes both their anonymity i want to know who i'm talking to and what he sees as their negativity we were mentioned on one poster for an exhibition that they felt did n't include enough women , he said , but they 've never mentioned our overall record of exhibitions and acquisitions , which i think are exemplary the art critic jed perl , who writes for the neoconservative monthly the new criterion , regards the posters as a positive force , but has reservations about their overriding emphasis on numbers i do n't think that social truth and esthetic truth necessarily intermesh , he says with women s art that goes all the way to the top these days , its subject is in some way feminism i would hope that the guerrilla girls are out for all women the guerrilla girls campaign has other components besides consciousnessraising the posters have accumulated into an impressive body of work that fuses aspects of conceptual art with 80 s graphic design while never intended as art , the posters are sometimes peeled off building walls by admirers , saved and even framed they also occasionally make their way into museums one poster was included in the whitney museum s recent image world exhibition , and complete sets of the posters have been acquired by the new york public library and the spencer museum of art at the university of kansas in lawrence
washington , feb 12 federal safety inspectors are overwhelmed by the job of monitoring the nation s airplanes , airports , mechanics and pilots and crash investigators say lapses in these inspections have contributed to several recent fatal accidents despite a hiring surge intended to keep pace with rapid growth in the industry and to make up for cuts in the early reagan years , senior officials of the federal aviation administration , which is in charge of inspections , say there is still a shortage of inspectors training falls short the problems have led to some airlines' not being inspected at all for long periods , and to poor inspections that failed to detect safety violations discovered later in special checks or after accidents some airports have inadequate rescue equipment , and some airlines have poorly trained pilots or mechanics who qualified for licenses without completing training a comprehensive account of such failures comes from an examination of reports by the national transportation safety board , the general accounting office , the transportation department s inspector general and the faa itself senior officials of the aviation agency , in interviews , said that despite the agency s problems , air travel today remains fundamentally safe and that given their resources they are doing everything they can to insure safety the transportation safety board , an independent agency that investigates accidents , is often at odds with the aviation agency but agrees with this point still , the board has cited faa inspection lapses in reports on a number of accidents last year , in which united states airlines compiled one of their worst safety records in some time the roots of the problem lie in the early 1980 s , aviation agency officials said , when air travel growth brought on by federal deregulation collided with budget cuts imposed by president ronald reagan s administration the number of inspectors bottomed out in 1983 , and the agency has hired steadily since then , increasing the number by about twothirds to a record high of almost 2 , 500 but officials say they are still 20 percent short of the number needed and even with plans to hire that number , they say , the training is very involved and it will take years before all the inspectors are fully trained officials involved in monitoring the faa s performance said the situation could get worse in the years ahead , as the growth in the number of airplanes and the fleet s increasing age force the agency to perform even more inspections each year budget problems and rapid growth in air traffic similarly overwhelmed the faa s air traffic control function , a factor in the increase in delays , which has captured much public attention besides air traffic control , the faa is responsible for monitoring aviation safety , keeping track of airline performance records in everything from the simplest refueling and lube job to the training of pilots in some cases the agency s inspectors perform inperson checks the evidence suggests that just as the air traffic control system is clogged , the agency s surveillance and inspection system , collectively known as the flight standards program , has been overwhelmed for years a shortage of money and time it will take us several more years to rebuild the flight standards system , said anthony j broderick , the agency official in charge of efforts to correct the problems we are still not up to our required inspector strength , he added , citing both a shortage of money and the time needed to train new inspectors another major problem , he said , is the need to replace a computer system that he and other senior officials view as inadequate a new system for keeping inspection records is being devised , but he said , i would be kidding you if i were to say it is going to be here tomorrow , or even next year the problems are expected to get congressional attention this month , as committees consider legislation to establish and extend national aviation programs the bush administration s latest budget request to congress would add 300 inspectors , bringing the work force to 3 , 058 by the end of 1991 case study usair is pilot training monitored enough \? the adequacy of the aviation agency s surveillance is also on the agenda for the hearings by the national transportation safety board on the crash of usair flight 5050 , in which two people died in an aborted takeoff at la guardia airport last september the hearings are to begin tuesday in new york a number of possible causes are being investigated , including mechanical failure but evidence collected so far has raised concerns about the crew s performance as they read through checklists in the minutes before takeoff and about how they handled the controls during acceleration down the runway in those moments , equipment problems may have combined with crew errors to complicate the takeoff one question is whether shortcomings in usair s training program may have allowed confusion in the cockpit that day and whether the shortcomings should have been detected beforehand by faa inspectors both pilots on flight 5050 were new to usair one was newly hired and the other had worked for piedmont airlines before the two companies merged
louisville , ky rrthere will be two kentucky derbies saturday the one that will be run at churchill downs , and the one that can only be run in the imagination the derby that might have been by post time saturday , everyone who follows racing will have whipped himself into excited anticipation , convinced that the 17 colts who go to the post are an outstanding group all derbies look fascinating before they are run , and there indeed is a rational case to be made that several of this year s contenders might be special mister frisky has a better record than any colt has brought to this race in 116 years summer squall has as much heart as a horse can but you can quickly draw up another full field composed of 3yearolds who could have been in this race but are not that field might be better than the real one , and just contemplating a race involving the top eight colts in each group makes saturday s race seem dull and disappointing by comparison the likely derby field consists of mister frisky , summer squall , thirty six red , silver ending , land rush , unbridled , burnt hills , real cash , shot gun scott , video ranger , pendleton ridge , killer diller , dr bobby a , pleasant tap , power lunch , country day and fighting fantasy those missing from action include rhythm , grand canyon , red ransom , champagneforashley , housebuster , slavic , adjudicating , senor pete , secret hello , roanoke , yonder , magical mile and home at last almost any racing fan would prefer the second race to the first , both for quality and competitiveness the most disappointing part of this year s derby field is its lack of depth the two favorites tower above the others on accomplishment , the next three or four colts are legitimate contenders , but then the bottom drops out what happened this year forms no trend or pattern it is simply the luck of the race track , and this was an unlucky season most of the missing were felled by illness or injury grand canyon strained knee muscles red ransom tore a tendon sheath adjudicating got a virus secret hello broke a bone roanoke got a kidney infection others did not pan out , possibly because of physical ailments but possibly because some promising 2yearolds simply fail to improve the following spring rhythm , last year s champion 2yearold , came down with a breathing problem but ran just as poorly after undergoing surgery to correct it slavic came up with an ankle problem two weeks ago , but he had been running dull races all spring senor pete ran one good race and two bad ones and will get a break until someone can figure out why then there are three who are ready to run but wo n't champagneforashley s handlers insist that their colt is sound and think he is the best one around , but they have decided to wait for the preakness housebuster s camp knows it has an extraordinary sprinter and does not want to risk ruining him by asking to run farther than he really wants to when the division s best 3yearolds run in the belmont stakes on june 9 , housebuster will make his next start on that same card , in the sevenfurlong riva ridge stakes as for home at last , an easy winner of the preview and the lexington in his last two starts , his owners simply did n't think much of him as of march 17 , and thereby neglected to nominate him for the triple crown races none of the absentees have been retired yet , and there is reason to hope that some of them will be back grand canyon is supposed to start training again next month , and red ransom could be back in august rhythm , adjudicating , senor pete and slavic are all at belmont park and might makes races like the dwyer , the jim dandy and the travers secret hello and home at last will race in chicago this summer the last two derbies that lacked so many prominent colts were the 1984 and 1982 editions in 1984 , devil s bag had dominated the previous year s 2yearold action , then was joined at the top of the class by time for a change and dr carter by derby day , all were sidelined with injuries , and only dr carter ever raced with success again swale , hidden in stablemate devil s bag s shadow all winter , emerged to win the derby and the belmont , beating such entirely forgettable colts as coax me chad and pine circle swale died eight days after the belmont , and older horses dominated the rest of the season the 1982 derby , probably the worst of the last 20 years , was run without deputy minister , timely writer and almost all of the previous year s best 2yearolds gato del sol won it , with laser light second , and neither was heard from again the remainder of 1982 s important races were won by colts who had not been in that derby aloma s ruler in the preakness , conquistador cielo in the belmont and runaway groom in the travers could the same thing happen this year \? until this derby is run , there is nothing to say that mister frisky is not the genuine article or that summer squall has not been the best colt in this crop all along thirty six red and silver ending have become very good very quickly , and maybe they will keep improving beyond those four , though , gato del sol could be in the thick of this derby by saturday evening , we should have a pretty good idea whether this derby will be the first jewel in the crown of this year s best 3yearold or just a timekiller until that best colt comes back out of the running many of the best prospects in the triple crown class of 1990 will miss the kentucky derby saturday , most because of injury or illness rhythm 1989 champion 2yearold and breeders' cup juvenile winner grand canyon won hollywood futurity , fastest mile ever by 2yearold red ransom set saratoga track record in debut champagneforashley five victories in six career starts housebuster winner of six straight stakes races slavic won breeders' futurity , third in cup juvenile adjudicating won champagne and cowdin senor pete won belmont futurity secret hello won arlingtonwashington futurity roanoke won young america yonder won remsen home at last won preview , lexington in last two starts

the lowvisibility fourway contest for the democratic nomination for manhattan surrogate has turned into a race for money the candidate with the most is likely to be the strongest contender in the sept 11 democratic primary \( the nomination virtually assures election \) the feverish quest for campaign money tends to reinforce the court s already questionable image that of an institution that oversees billions of dollars in estates while dispensing millions of dollars in fees to favorite lawyers to serve as guardians in estates and trusts it s an image that all four candidates like candidates before them promise to change the retiring surrogate , marie m lambert , was criticized by the appellate division of state supreme court in june for awarding excessive fees to lawyers the federal prosecutors in manhattan are investigating some fee awards i think the whole process is awful , justice eve m preminger of state supreme court said of the campaign fundraising scramble yet she is the candidate largely responsible for a major escalation of the money chase the latest financial reports filed last week with the board of elections disclosed that she had added 200 , 000 in personal loans to the 50 , 000 she had earlier given to her campaign , making justice preminger s actions louder and more to the point than her words in what is obviously a contest in oneupmanship between wealthy candidates , a competitor , judge lewis friedman of manhattan civil court , added 30 , 000 in personal loans to the 140 , 000 he and his father had contributed earlier the judges declined to say how much more they would give to their campaigns before the primary all this for a 95 , 000ayear job that is one of the most influential in the state because of the size of the estates being handled and the lucrative appointments for lawyers that can be made it is also the only court that many lawabiding people deal with in their lifetime judge friedman tried to take some of the sting out of the big spending by announcing last week that he would not accept contributions from lawyers so he would not be perceived as beholden to any special interests he added , i have no intention of paying myself or my father back up until last week , he had received only 5 , 872 in donations from lawyers , a pittance compared with his competitors , although he insisted that lawyers have sought to press contributions on him even in the courthouse the only nonjurist in the race , arlene harris , who has been the chief law assistant in the surrogate s court for the last 12 years and is well known to lawyers practicing there , has received by far the most in contributions , 231 , 717 the fourth candidate , judge jacqueline w silbermann , the citywide administrative judge of the civil court , has received 116 , 986 in contributions for both , the donations have been mostly from lawyers both judge silbermann and mrs harris said they did not have the resources to make major contributions to their campaigns justice preminger leads in total campaign income , including her loans , with 322 , 840 she is also the biggest spender so far 166 , 496 , including at least 50 , 000 in radio advertising that began last week m l henry , executive director of the fund for modern courts , which advocates the appointment rather than the election of judges , said that contributions from lawyers clearly creates an appearance of impropriety of the candidates subsidizing their own campaigns , he said it s wrong that somebody can buy an election if there is a small voter turnout , he predicted , political clubhouse support would be the critical element , with the winner probably garnering only 30 , 000 votes out of a potential 510 , 776 the three judges just about evenly divide the clubhouse support , while mrs harris has none three candidates insist that they were keeping arm s length from their fundraising but judge friedman is dubious anybody who says judges do n't know who contributes to their candidacies , give me a break , he said mr henry said that the fund for modern courts had sponsored studies that show correlations between lawyer contributions and appointments to administer estates he also said that he had n't detected any issues they 're asking the voters to make a decision on the basis of name identification , slogans and promises of dutiful performance that assessment was backed up by the first preminger radio commercial it begins with a child crying and an announcer saying solemnly a child cries , parents gone a widow weeps who will look after them \? some way to select one of the most important judges in the state
the borderless world power and strategy in the interlinked economy by kenichi ohmae 223 pp new york harper business harpercollins publishers 2195 kenichi ohmae arguably japan s most influential writer on public policy is unfazed by what george bush calls the vision thing if he harbors any doubts about his formula for achieving greater wealth and personal freedom , none surface in the borderless world his certitude is rhetorically effective , but it ignores some of the obstacles to moving from the here and now to the there and then europe , japan and the united states the triad that mr ohmae calls the interlinked economy , or ile are home to the richest fifth of the world s population , about a billion people who produce and consume nearly fourfifths of the global output of goods and services within the ile the significance of national borders is being eclipsed by everincreasing flows of international trade and investment despite protectionist barriers \( or perhaps because of them \) , transplanted american and european companies account for some 109 percent of japan s gross national product japanese auto makers have about 30 percent of the united states market and american companies constitute roughly onefifth of the total corporate capitalization of europe mr ohmae s compelling argument is that the further integration of the ile is in everyone s interest absent import restrictions and xenophobic policies , the optimal location of production , both within and outside the ile , would lower costs , increase output and raise living standards development of new technologies and products , such as integrated microchips , would be accelerated poorer countries with gross national products of less than 10 , 000 per head could hitch onto the ile engine by abandoning protectionism and opening their doors to imports and foreign investment were he a minimalist painter , mr ohmae \( who is the managing director of the mckinsey consulting firm in japan \) would draw nothing but praise but in the untidy arena of international relations the kind of broad brushstrokes found in the borderless world must be supplemented by blueprints mr ohmae focuses on the japaneseamerican nexus while ignoring save for a cryptic reference to the gaullist french government new protectionist barriers that will almost certainly be erected by the european community when it moves toward greater integration in 1992 he fails to provide an argument for his assertion that speculation in foreign exchange is a cushion against inflation and his hostility toward takeovers , leveraged buyouts and corporate restructurings he misreads them as signs of the internal decay of capitalism is neither supported nor shared by his more sophisticated mckinsey colleagues but mr ohmae s virtues clearly outweigh his shortcomings having been accused of being an agent of the japanese government s ministry of international trade and industry , he is unsparing in his criticisms of tokyo japan , he writes , is a bureaucratic country , not a political one the diet the japanese parliament plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system nor does he stop with the japanese bureaucracy no country represents a single value system , and no effort to pretend that it does or to act as if it does is both credible and effective in japan , for example , hokkaido may want to become the switzerland of asia and a hub for international air travel tokyo may want to go its own way osaka s interests may lie in becoming the capital of east asia and not competing with tokyo the rest of the population has legitimate doubts about just how far the health of these cities has any spillover benefits for them regions pull in different directions what is implied is that conflicts between the interests of governments and those of evolving marketplaces will ultimately be resolved by devolution the breaking up of countries and the drastic reduction of state power it s this sort of insight that makes mr ohmae well worth reading
q our den has a cement slab floor that is covered with squares of wood parquet flooring this floor has no insulation and is cold in the winter i would like to cover it with ceramic tiles the wood squares are still firm and sticking solidly would it be possible to leave the wood flooring in place as insulation and then lay the tiles directly over this \? a you can lay the ceramic tiles directly over the wood if the wood is solid and still sticking firmly it would be best to remove the wood flooring first for real insulating value , the cement slab should have had insulation installed under it you can still add insulation now by placing thick strips of mastic insulation around the edges of the slab you can add even more insulation by laying 2x4 s in mastic over the top of the slab , spacing them about 24 inches apart then put down sheets of insulating board between the 2x4 s cover all this with 3 4inch plywood or particle board , then lay the tiles on top q vanity counters in our bathroom are made of wood treated to make it waterproof but we have found that spills from nail polish remover and liquid soap seem to have taken off part of the finish the color looks faded in spots and has a waxy look a every wood finish is subject to wear and must be renewed periodically , and none is completely waterproof forever also , nail polish remover is a strong solvent that will remove or soften most wood finishes , so it is not surprising that it attacked the finish your best bet is to remove the old finish entirely , either by sanding or using an industrialgrade chemical remover then refinish with several coats of a clear twopart epoxy , the kind sold for resurfacing table and counter tops
london , july 5 president bush and other western leaders opened a crucial summit conference today with calls for a reshaped nato alliance that would both reassure the soviet union of the west s peaceful intentions and guard against a possible revival of soviet expansionism meeting at a moment of triumph for democratic values that has nonetheless created strategic problems for the 40yearold alliance , the nato leaders held two sessions at lancaster house , an imposing 19thcentury mansion in central london the second ended two hours early , with the leaders instructing their foreign ministers to work late on a communique melding mr bush s views with those of his colleagues mr bush formally presented his plan to redefine nato nuclear doctrine , envisaging the use of nuclear weapons in europe not as part of a flexible response , as before , but only as a last resort gorbachev address urged the president also proposed that president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union be asked to address a future alliance summit meeting , and his aides continued to speak of sending a special nato envoy to moscow this weekend to deliver a copy of the communique to mr gorbachev georgi k shakhnazarov , adviser to the soviet president , said in an interview on the macneil lehrer newshour that mr gorbachev would address the members of nato if invited while the ministers toiled on the communique under the chairmanship of the dutch foreign minister , hans van den broek , the 16 national leaders attended a dinner given by queen elizabeth ii at buckingham palace there appeared to be no rifts so severe within the alliance they could not be bridged , and a german official said the day s meetings went smoothly , but both the british and the french were arguing for language somewhat more hawkish than that proposed by the united states thatcher s strategy prime minister margaret thatcher of britain implictly criticized mr bush s proposal about weapons of last resort , remarking that we must not replace flexible response with inflexible response her spokesman later disclosed that britain was trying to make mr bush s proposed language more ambiguous , in the belief that only imprecise language would leave the soviet union in sufficient doubt as to when and where nuclear weapons would be used and thus constitute an effective deterrent the president , on the other hand , proposed the phrase last resort precisely because it might allay some of mr gorbachev s strategic concerns 'generally positive response' marlin fitzwater , the white house spokesman , said the allies had given a generally positive response to mr bush s opening presentation but as of yet , we do n't have agreement on all the points , he added at a briefing tonight the debate is real the discussion is real trying to sum up the purpose of the meeting , prime minister giulio andreotti , a key figure in arranging it , said , if we admit that there is a real risk that the soviet union and the other warsaw pact countries might feel left out of things , then our role is to reassure them and to integrate them in a system of stability although this conference has often been described as the one at which nato s new mission will be defined , its purpose is in fact more limited , allied diplomats said the goal is to promise such a redefinition to help persuade moscow that the cold war is really over , but it is also to prod the soviet union into action of its own on arms control , economic change and , above all , acquiescence in nato membership for a reunited germany later this year bush presents ideas we want to reassure them and bring pressure on them at the same time , a senior american official said we want to say , 'we are prepared to go down this new road , but we 'll do it only if you 're ready to join us' to that end , mr bush offered his ideas on altering the nato nuclear doctrine the participants in the meeting here were intensely conscious of the fact that it coincided with the potentially pivotal communist party congress in moscow mrs thatcher said she had received messages in the last 24 hours from both mr gorbachev and president vaclav havel of czechoslovakia they are just as interested in this summit as we are here who attend it , the prime minister said in her speech this century has been marked by war and suffering on an unparalleled scale nevertheless in its closing decade we are seeing new hope and new aspirations about the world mitterrand has reservations endorsing what he called the spirit of united states proposals for redirecting nato , president francois mitterrand of france also expressed some reservations about language nato s nuclear policy , he said , should have the unambiguous aim of nipping war in the bud , of preventing it breaking out , not simply of attempting to win , which sounded like a veiled criticism of the last resort formulation none of the senior national leaders explicitly proposed a no first use nuclear policy for the alliance , but the nato secretary general , manfred worner , a german , insisted in a radio interview in west germany that nato had always been a purely defensive alliance and would never be the first to use weapons of any sort chancellor helmut kohl of west germany , who has set the pace over the last year in building a new europe in the wake of communism s collapse , said publicly for the first time today that he would be prepared to negotiate at the conventional arms talks in vienna the level of forces to be maintained by a united germany the soviet union has expressed concern about the size of german forces now that the warsaw pact buffer zone has all but vanished germans ready to talk previously , the plan had been to address that issue later but mr kohl s spokesman , hans klein , said west germany was ready to talk now , even though the government in bonn has not yet agreed upon a force level mr kohl also expressed willingness to sign a nonagression agreement along with other nato and warsaw pact nations , as did mr mitterrand but though the french president said he would prefer to act through the conference on security and cooperation in europe , france s favored vehicle as a paneuropean organization to eventually supersede nato and the warsaw pact mrs thatcher appeared somewhat less enthusiastic president bush s package of confidencebuilding measures , which had been sent in a letter to nato leaders several days ago , included withdrawal of nuclear artillery shells from europe in addition to the nonaggression declaration and the proposal for the use of new language in stating nato s policy on the use of nuclear weapons new institutions weighed mr bush s timetable for artillery shells , most of which are based in east germany , would require moscow to complete troop withdrawals from eastern europe before the last of the 1 , 400 shells were pulled out but mr kohl , whose country has a large antinuclear lobby , said he favored acting after the conclusion of a treaty cutting conventional forces , before actual withdrawals photos nato leaders called for a reshaped alliance to reassure the soviet union

enforcement officials of the national marine fisheries service are waiting to see if the longstanding highseas harvest of salmon of united states origin in the north pacific by driftnet vessels from other nations has been brought under control the united states is concerned because salmon spawned in its rivers are being intercepted on the high seas , in a zone reserved for legal squid fishery , before they can return home to produce a new generation of their species and provide sport and income for united states fishermen virtually all of the united states' commercial west coast salmon fishing takes place within 25 miles from shore , and none of it is in international waters this business includes boats that troll lures for salmon , fish weirs , beach seines , purse seines and gill nets , but no driftnet vessels the purse seines might be as long as 600 feet , the gill nets 300 feet by contrast , many of the vessels involved in the highseas squid fishery they are from japan , taiwan and south korea use nets 30 miles long according to the fisheries service , some 800 such vessels may be involved in the legal squid fishery boats from the three asian countries , said steve springer , special agent in charge of all law enforcement for the fisheries service , have long been fishing for squid in the area only one from south korea has been observed retaining salmon , and none from japan but several salmonfishing taiwanese vessels have been documented , he said , adding that over the last 10 years , the taiwanese have been the biggest problem in terms of renegade , pirate vessels fishing blatantly and directly for salmon with drift nets since 1989 , any salmon taken in the squid fishery have been in violation of the domestic laws of the three asian nations before 1989 , when those nations signed agreements with the united states , only japan and taiwan had such laws both japan and taiwan have informed the fisheries service that they are prosecuting violators when they return home skippers have been fined and vessels have lost their licenses an april 16 , 1990 report on highseas salmon interception issued by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , of which the fisheries service is a component , says that during the past three and onehalf years , special agents have seized 1 , 296 , 709 pounds of salmon illegally imported into the united states from singapore , hong kong and other far eastern ports that would have been laundered and exported to japan as an american product conclusive evidence , the report goes on , has been established that those fish were intercepted on the high seas by taiwanese driftnet vessels the complicated illegal arrangement for getting taiwanesecaught salmon to japan was devised because japan has laws against purchasing salmon from taiwan , or any other nation , that has no legal salmon fishery , south korea included the oceanic administration report adds that it has documented that nearly 10 , 000 , 000 pounds of the illegally smuggled salmon have been shipped through the united states for sale in japan japan has a small highseas pacific salmon fishery under a mid1960 s treaty it entered into with the united states and canada that treaty , said jim coe , who coordinates the united states driftnet monitoring and research program for the fisheries service in the north pacific , is responsible for the remnant of what was once a major , major directed japanese salmon fishery in the north pacific it has been greatly reduced , he added , as a result of the united states and canada insisting that their nationals should be harvesting those fish in home waters japan has also had to negotiate with the soviet union to keep its shrinking legal salmon fishery alive , and the soviets , said coe , have been racheting them down also most nations now have fisheries zones over which they exercise complete control extending 200 miles off shore the north pacific squid fishery is in international waters , beyond this or any other country s 200mile limit the united states is acting under the premise that anadromous fish like salmon and steelhead spawned in any country s rivers are the property of that country even when they venture into international waters that premise , said coe , is a longstanding tenet of international law section 101 b of this country s magnuson fishery conservation act of 1976 says the united states will exercise exclusive fishery management authority over anadromous species those that go up rivers to spawn throughout their migrations beyond this country s 200mile limit and until they enter the territorial sea of another nation the driftnet squid fishery gets under way in late spring and runs through september it was pioneered in the late 1970 s by japan , said wayne c lewis , special agent in charge of law enforcement for the fisheries service s northwest office in the 1989 agreements with the united states , the three asian nations agreed to hold their squid driftnetters south of an eastwest boundary that would keep them away from concentrations of salmon boats from all three nations have violated that boundary in previous years the squid boundary , between the longitudes of 145 degrees west and 170 degrees east , is more than 2 , 000 miles long it shifts north as the season progresses , but never extends above the latitude of 46 degrees north , which is about 500 miles south of the southernmost of the aleutian islands in alaska even when the boats do stay south of the squid line , some salmon are caught the agreement calls for throwing those fish and steelheads as well back overboard lewis said that in 1989 , united states air and water patrols resulted in 75 driftnetters being sighted north of the squid boundary 37 taiwanese , 26 japanese and 12 south korean keep in mind , he added , that you are dealing with two separate fisheries there are the vessels that remain within the squid zone , or nearly so , and take some we do n't know how many salmon as incidental catch then there is the pirate fleet that goes several hundred miles north of the boundary and conducts a directed driftnet fishery on salmon an accurate count of boats that went north of the boundary was difficult because of the huge area involved all three asian nations have agreed to put transmitters on all their squid boats in the north pacific this year , springer said , so their positions can be pinpointed by satellite american observers will be on more boats this year , he added among other things , the observer arrangement is aimed at finding out how many salmon of what kind and their countries of origin are being killed in the legal squid fishery the 1989 agreements will not be able to deal with a new development , however between april 22 and midmay , five driftnet vessels carrying north korean markings were sighted by the united states far north of the squid boundary lewis believes they were probably focussing on salmon from the soviet union we have an agreement to share enforcement information with the soviets , and we certainly passed on that information to them , he added tass , the official soviet press agency , reported on may 22 that the soviet union had seized 10 north korean fishing vessels in international waters in the north pacific the reason given for the seizure was that the vessels were fishing illegally for salmon spawned in the soviet union the tass report also said that in early may six japanese ships were detained for similar activities map north pacific ocean indicating area

north lttle rock , ark , may 18 the antique conventions of arkansas politics seemed durable enough at a recent chamber of commerce dinner here catfish and fiddle music were devoured in the warm twilight , and a state legislator handed out yardsticks emblazoned with his campaign slogans children played tag and adults sat at picnic tables as nearly 40 candidates for all types of offices delivered short speeches to the crowd gathered in a city park but then , after nightfall , came signs that the old ways may be changing here when some of the candidates for governor in the may 29 primary took their turn , there were two republicans among them , and they drew their share of applause and encouraging shouts for the first time in a century , there is a hardfought republican primary for a statewide office in arkansas , and it features two wellknown , wellfinanced contenders representative tommy f robinson from little rock and sheffield nelson , a prominent little rock lawyer and businessman the hot competition on the republican side for the nomination for governor has upset political calculations in this state where the democratic party dominates local politics so thoroughly that it holds 120 of the 135 seats in the arkansas legislature 'accelerate the evolution' in the long run , this primary has got to accelerate the evolution of the republican party in what is still more of a oneparty state than any other in the nation , said betsey wright , the former chief of staff to gov bill clinton , who is widely expected to win the democratic primary but in the short term , who knows how the voters will react to the weirdness of this campaign \? mr robinson has labeled mr nelson an aristocrat and a technocrat , and mr nelson has frequently accused mr robinson of being irresponsible with his personal finances the republicans have gained the governor s mansion here twice in recent decades , but never after a fully contested primary to whet interest public opinion polls indicate that the total republican vote on primary day will probably exceed the 66 , 000 who voted in the last presidential primary and could go as high as 100 , 000 , nearly three times the total in any recent republican gubernatorial primary aside from sheer novelty , the republican race is generating curiosity and consternation for a variety of reasons , starting with the fact that both candidates were prominent democrats until they switched parties last year primary is like family feud moreover , they have engaged in a bitter campaign full of allegations and innuendo that has taken on the appearance of a family feud each candidate has accused the other of making unscrupulous business deals with the same man , jerry jones , an oil and gas millionaire , who has been a friend to both politicians at different times mr jones , who became a folk hero in arkansas when he bought the dallas cowboys professional football team last year , was the major financial backer of mr robinson s political career as he went from county sheriff to congressman their ties were so close that in the mid1980 s mr jones lent the politician more than 300 , 000 for what they called living expenses and mr jones s 22 yearold daughter , charlotte , started a career in civic affairs with a 60 , 000ayear job on the congressman s staff this friendship , which dated to childhood , came apart last fall when mr robinson accused mr jones and mr nelson of ripping off the public in complex transactions between mr jones s gas company and a public utility that mr nelson headed for many years 'issues are the individuals' now , mr jones is backing the nelson campaign , which has assailed mr robinson for his dealings with none other than mr jones there are no issues in this campaign because the issues are the individuals , said john brummett , political columnist for the arkansas gazette mr robinson , who proudly proclaims himself a redneck , has promised to take the republican party away from the country club elitists and give it to the working people mr nelson has said that only mr robinson s friendship with mr jones has saved the congressman from bankruptcy the nelson campaign is also distributing flyers with the headline nelson s past revealed truth told ! ! ! they proclaim that sheffield nelson was born into poverty race seen as a dead heat the winner of this battle , which is a dead heat , according to recent popularity polls , will probably face governor clinton in the general election many republicans here and in washington say mr clinton is vulnerable governor clinton , 43 years old , was first elected to the state s top office in 1978 , serving one term before losing to a republican , frank white but mr clinton defeated mr white in 1982 , and if he is reelected and finishes another term he will have served as governor of arkansas longer than anyone else the other recent republican governor was winthrop rockefeller , who served from 1967 to 1971 this year mr clinton admitted he lacked enthusiasm for the race he has frequently been mentioned as a potential candidate for national office and now even some of his supporters concede he is fighting a perception that he is biding his time in little rock 'he s got to move quickly' ms wright , his campaign manager in three previous races , said , he s got to move quickly to present himself as a fresh , compelling leader for the future and not just an accomplished leader of the past democratic politicians barely disguise the fact that they fear mr robinson more than his rival because of the congressman s tough and unpredictable campaign style he frequently tells audiences that mr nelson will give away the assets of this state to his buddies in an interview , mr robinson said bill clinton wants to be president of the united states , and my job is to stop him i 've worked with him i know him like the back of my hand , and i am going after him it s that simple mr robinson s switch to the republican party was announced at a white house news conference last july by president bush , who said , tommy robinson is a man of the people , a man who believes in straight talk , hard work and getting the job done but mr bush has not endorsed a candidate in the primary although mr robinson said the president had offered him all the help he would need against governor clinton if he wins the primary , the candidate insisted there is no link between his gubernatorial race and his decision to join the republicans photos sheffield nelson , a lawyer and businessman , is facing representative robinson in the republican gubernatorial primary representative tommy f robinson of little rock , ark , who calls himself a redneck , is a republican candidate for governor \( associated press \)
the united states is malled , so we have had to look at alternative ways of expanding our business , said stephen riggio , the company s vice president i think the company will place more emphasis on these stores in the next few years than on our traditional bookstores 20 superstores' possible he predicted that there might be as many as 20 superstores by the end of next year the company s move reflects several factors after a rapid period of expansion , there are few attractive malls in which b dalton or its main rival , waldenbooks , does not already have a store at the same time , the chains have discovered that the bestseller market is fickle and you have to try to appeal to the solid , regular reader , said constance sayre , a publishing consultant at market partners international in addition , new computer software has made it easier to cope with huge inventories but although the diversification appears to be a logical step , b dalton could face problems simply because the new business will be radically different from the one it knows best huge stores require highly trained workers , whereas the staff at b dalton s current stores generally need little knowledge of books moreover , the selection of inventory is complex and the overhead is much higher than in smaller stores sounds ambitious to me' it is very tough to operate stores like this , said robert diromualdo , the chief executive of book inventory systems , an ann arbor , mich , company that owns the 13 borders bookstores , each of which stocks more than 100 , 000 titles you have to manage an inventory that is not only huge but also everchanging we 're specialized in this , and we find it difficult he added , twenty stores sounds ambitious to me borders has expanded rapidly in recent years the crown chain has also recently opened some larger stores , although none as big as the barnes noble in st paul at the same time , large independent stores like the tattered cover in denver have grown increasingly sophisticated to meet the challenge of the chains thus , b dalton will face severe competition still , mr riggio said he saw tremendous opportunities in stores with a vast selection he emphasized that the company had some experience with big stores through its large barnes noble outlet on lower fifth avenue in new york city 'designed to lure the browser' the st paul store , a model for those to come , will have wooden shelves , antique furniture , comfortable seating and a knowledgeable staff it s designed to lure the browser , and it s a statement that attracting readers of sidney sheldon is no longer enough , ms sayre said apart from the 850 b dalton and barnes noble stores , the company also owns four scribners book shops and 40 doubleday stores

a cross from the far left wing the ball sailed across the penalty area and over the heads of the soviet defenders , to the far right side of the goal van basten moved toward the ball , and the defenders conceded it to him , preferring instead to cut off the anticipated centering pass no one expected him to shoot like an outfielder setting up beneath a fly ball , van basten took a line on the falling ball all other action seemed to freeze as he made his deliberate threestep approach , cocked his leg , and swung , catching the ball just below waist level the shot rocketed off his foot and caught the upper lefthand corner of the net like a comet the soviet goaltender could only shake his head as the ball rebounded off the net strings behind him in a career full of trophies and glory , that goal was the high point for van basten , who is regarded as perhaps the world s best striker no team from the netherlands had ever won a major international tournament , not even the legendary dutch 11 of the 1970 s , led by van basten s boyhood idol johann cruyff indelible memory van basten remembers watching cruyff s team lose , 21 , to franz beckenbauer s west german squad in the 1974 world cup final i was 8 years old and saw the game on television in my hometown of utrecht , van basten said recently it was a black day for holland ours was the best team in the world we did n't deserve to lose and yet we did all i can say is that sport is like that in the 1988 european tournament , van basten worked a measure of revenge in the netherlands' semifinal match against west germany he outraced a defender for a loose ball in the penalty area and punched a sliding shot past the sliding german goaltender to make the score 21 with a minute left to play most of us had the 1974 loss on our minds when we took the field against west germany , van basten said and most of us left the field with a sense of relief it was the legendary cruyff who launched van basten s major league career transfer of power i was 17 years old and had just made the ajax amsterdam team , van basten recalled johann was 36 and at the end of his career in my first game , during the second half , he trotted off the field and told our coach that i should take his place not long after the symbolic passing of the torch , van basten became ajax s starting striker at the age of 23 , the athlete from utrecht had already won three league titles , four holland cups , and the 1987 european cup winners' cup with cruyff as coach in 198387 , he averaged 295 goals per season and in 1987 , with 31 goals , he won the golden boot trophy as europe s leading scorer many players would have been content with these achievements , particularly at such an early age but van basten was burdened with the cruyff legacy , and with it the responsibility to become as great a player as his mentor for a long time i wanted to be like him , he said of cruyff to play all over the field , to set up plays , to run the fast break , to defend i tried to emulate him but i could n't do it johann was one of the greatest players in the history of the game he could do everything i'm not at that level i'm more of a classic attacker , a penaltyarea player and after a while , i realized that this was how i could best help my team honor from the french since 1987 , his team has been milan , one of italy s preeminent teams after missing most of his first italian season with an ankle injury , van basten returned to score 19 goals in the 198889 regular season , along with 10 more as milan took the coveted european champions' cup the respected magazine france football named him europe s outstanding player next month , he will try to help win the world cup for the netherlands this year , van basten led the italian league in scoring with another 19 goals van basten is blessed with a combination of skills that suit his striker s role perfectly although quite tall for a soccer player he is not quite 6 feet 2 inches he is also uncannily quick in the goal area , and agile enough to joust for an opening against smaller , rapid defenders he is rarely denied a shot on goal when isolated oneonone with an opponent and his aerial game , faulted by several italian scouts when van basten was still playing for ajax , has improved markedly one need only cite the spectacular diving header at madrid s bernabeu stadium in last april s 11 champion s cup semifinal against real madrid , a goal van basten scored while diving between the knees of two defenders artful dodger when critics search for a flaw in his game , they usually fault him for supposed selfishness i try my best to do what s best for the team , van basten replied by rote and in fairness , it is difficult to imagine how van basten could better serve milan and his dutch national teammates than by scoring goals that win matches naturally , van basten receives special and often very rough treatment from defenders who are otherwise unable to stop him he has learned to avoid most of the elbows , fists and boots aimed his way and when necessary , he has given proof of his ability to defend himself i tend not to pay too much attention to the person marking me , he said the defenders , they get all psyched up to play against me i know it means a lot to them if they can keep me from scoring photo marco van basten i try my best to do what s best for the team \( reuters \)
bucharest , rumania , jan 6 on sunday , dec 17 , president nicolae ceausescu summoned top party officials across the country and , on closedcircuit television , issued orders to kill the night before , demonstrators had taken to the streets in a western city , timisoara it was rumania s most serious antigovernment protest in two years , with crowds breaking windows , denouncing their national leader and feeding bonfires with his books and portraits elsewhere in eastern europe , one communist leader after another had been forced to bow before popular demands for democratic change but mr ceausescu was autocratic and unyielding , and when the crowds in timisoara defied him , he issued a succinct command comply or die anyone who does not obey orders should be shot , he told regional leaders on the television hookup that decision proved to be the first and perhaps most critical of several pivotal moments that over nine days brought mr ceausescu from the pinnacle of national power to desperate flight , then ignominious execution in the ragged courtyard of an army post in the end , the longruling communist leader may have been brought down by his own arrogance as much as by the bullets and the jeering crowds but his downfall was sealed when he decided to send in troops to suppress timisoara s demonstrators the protesters' immediate goal was to stop the forcible transfer of a popular lutheran minister , the rev laszlo tokes , a thorn in the repressive government s side but their ranks quickly swelled to include students and workers , men and women who came out that sunday onto downtown streets near the old city s opera square to vent their anger and frustration at the worsening hardships of life under mr ceausescu s 24year rule to supervise the taming of timisoara , mr ceausescu had dispatched several senior officials , including constantin dascalescu , his prime minister emil bobu , his ideology chief , and ion coman , an army general and secretary of the communist party central committee a transcript of their conversations on the closedcircuit system , preserved by leaders of the new provisional government , shows that there were no second thoughts about firing on rumanian citizens relay my order to all officers , mr ceausescu told general coman before the killings in timisoara began i want that calm should be restored in timisoara in one hour call everybody give orders , and execute them understood \? yes , comrade secretary general , general coman said , i can inform you that right now three columns of soldiers are entering timisoara i report to you that i have ordered them to shoot those orders to shoot applied to the entire country , mr ceausescu reminded his underlings in the country s 40 provinces who were accustomed to gathering immediately in front of their television sets for instructions from bucharest there was unmistakable concern that the disorders could spread starting today , all units of the interior ministry , the militia , security troops and border guards will have fighting weapons on them including bullets , he said anyone who tries to enter a state institution or party headquarters , or who breaks a shop window must be immediately shot from the transcript it is clear that mr ceausescu was in close contact with timisoara , demanding reports from general coman every 15 minutes that afternoon , security forces and army troops opened fire on the protesters , killing them by the hundreds and perhaps by the thousands in a massacre , the dimensions of which are still not fully known the ruler resists ceausescu defies a rising tide the next day , in a businessasusual gesture , mr ceausescu left for a state visit to iran , apparently confident that with his grim orders carried out , his authority had been reinforced but by the time he returned on wednesday , dec 20 , to give a televised speech to the nation , the bloodshed at timisoara had shocked and revolted the world , and jolted rumanians from their long torpor the wednesday night speech showed the old ceausescu belligerent and unrepentant , railing against foreign agents and fascist hooligans for having created the turmoil standing rigidly by his side were his wife , elena , who was his secondincommand , plus other ranking government officials mr ceausescu s performance that night set the stage for the next pivotal moment in the collapse of his leadership for reasons that are still baffling though the decision appeared to show how little he understood how much rumanians hated him mr ceausescu called a mass rally on thursday , dec 21 it proved to be an enormous miscalculation in effect , he himself summoned the crowds that were to create the revolution it began like so many other rallies in the communist era party leaders in local factories were ordered to herd their workers , supplied with old placards hailing the leader , to the large palace square the square lies in the heart of bucharest , flanked by the stolid headquarters of the party central committee and by the former palace of the rumanian monarchy from the secondfloor balcony of the headquarters and with the nation watching on television , mr ceausescu again referred to the slain protesters in timisoara as hooligans
united nations , aug 2 the united nations security council voted overwhelmingly early this morning to condemn iraq s invasion of kuwait , demanding the immediate , unconditional withdrawal of all of baghdad s forces from the tiny persian gulf nation , and threatening to invoke mandatory sanctions if it does not promptly comply the council called on iraq and kuwait to begin immediate intensive negotiations to resolve their differences and gave its backing to arab league efforts to mediate in the crisis citing articles 39 and 40 of the united nations charter , which gives the council the authority to impose such sanctions on aggressor nations and to intervene against them with military force , the council resolved to meet again as necessary to consider further steps to insure compliance with this resolution a seldomissued threat this is the language the security council traditionally uses when it threatens charter violators with punitive action today s move is believed to be only the fifth time in the organization s 45year history that the security council has issued such a threat the four previous occasions were the imposition of arms embargos against south africa and rhodesia , the threat of sanctions to obtain a cease fire ending the first israeliarab war in 1948 , and and the council s action ordering a ceasefire in the iraniraq war in 1987 the 1948 and 1987 actions preceded ceasefires , and the rhodesian arms embargo lapsed after that country became zimbabwe under majority rule in 1980 the south african embargo remains in effect several council members emphasized that they are deadly serious about the sanctions threat , arguing that at a moment when a more peaceful and cooperative world order is evolving , the united nations must show itself ready to compel compliance with the principles of its charter 'the world is watching' it is a time for peace and diplomacy , not for war and aggression , the united states chief delegate , thomas r pickering , told the council the world is watching what we do and will not be satisfied with vacillation and procrastination kuwait s united nations representative , mohammed a abulhassan , called the resolution a test of the council and its ability to preserve the peace and security of all small nations after the vote , the delegate of one third world nation said , we have threatened sanctions and we mean it our credibility is at stake the 15member security council consists of five permanent members britain , china , france , the soviet union and the united states and 10 rotating seats , currently held by canada , finland , colombia , ethiopia , malaysia , ivory coast , zaire , romania , cuba and yemen western members of the council said they will probably delay the next meeting until monday to give iraq time to comply and allow the arab league to pursue its mediation efforts but if , as they anticipate , iraqi forces are still occupying kuwait , they expect to reconvene and start planning a worldwide program of mandatory economic sanctions against baghdad earlymorning vote after a night of frenzied negotiations , the security council voted just before 6 00 this morning to condemn iraq s invasion fourteen of the council s 15 members voted in favor of the resolution and none against yemen , the only arab country on the council , did not participate in the vote because its delegate said he had no instructions from his government photo the united nations security council voting yesterday , during an emergency session , to condemn iraq s invasion of kuwait \( milton b grant united nations \)

leningrad this is the soviet union s second city and none too pleased about it people claim that leningrad , with a population of some five million , sends 80 billion rubles a year to moscow , and gets 20 billion back the center deliberately puts leningrad down and holds it back , they say , and they are just as aggrieved as people in minority soviet republics for two centuries this city was russia s capital , founded on baltic marshland by peter the great to open his country to europe and force reforms and modernization lined with canals and lavish old palaces , it used to be called the venice of the north , and it has a lively , defiant spirit but the mood is bleak now everything gets worse and worse , people tell you on the street , and they see no better prospects they do n't believe perestroika will work they are angry and frustrated still , there are current heroes , three of them first is the new mayor , anatoly sobchak then boris yeltsin , the new president of the russian republic , and gavriil popov , the new mayor of moscow all three recently quit the communist party the only good words i heard about mikhail gorbachev in a week here were from delegates to the dartmouth conference , a sovietamerican discussion group founded 30 years ago and sponsored by the kettering foundation like the neighboring baltic republics , leningrad wants to make its own plans there are to be negotiations with estonia , where food supplies are considerably better , and there is a fuzzy project for a free economic zone to attract foreign investment mayor sobchak talks about rivaling some of spain s tourist income , and indeed , the old parts of the city and the birchgroved countryside are superb but the city also contains a disproportionate share of what s wrong with the country eighty percent of its industry produces for the military , and one in every four workers is employed by these industries even in the cold war we did n't need all that , said aleksandr fursenko , vice chairman of the local branch of the academy of sciences local demand is trying to block further construction of a huge dam in the gulf of finland across the mouth of the neva it was a flood control measure , but it has already built up pollution to the point where swimming is forbidden as happened in budapest with protests against a danube dam , ecology is channeling a whole spectrum of grassroots disgust into a political force there are already several hundred citizens' associations , not coalesced into any effective parties but providing a base for ferment leningrad is a prime example of momentum for fundamental change in the soviet union coming no longer from the top and the center but from the bottom up , from the regions and the provinces asked who s to blame for what he called the intolerable , hopeless state of affairs , a young man who works in the port said it was the communists and the jews well , i do n't know , maybe it s not the jews' fault , but they make the good deals he was lounging on the street at midday , reading one of the new independent papers , clearly well informed there are three things i like in life , he volunteered my exwife , whom i divorced , beer and cigarettes he asked for a cigarette , and said , i 'd be willing to work 12 or 14 hours a day for a normal living , but it s impossible it humiliates me to beg for a cigarette he was n't like the idle , disaffected young on american streets he spoke with contempt of dishonest people and his own lack of direction , and he was articulate but he saw nothing he could do to make things better mayor sobchak is one of the scarce optimists he is a blueeyed , 51yearold law professor , brimming with energy and convictions about changing the system unknown until he ran for the supreme soviet , he is a product of tv , through which his bold and forceful oratory made a huge impact he only joined the communist party in 1988 , because then the only possibility for change was from the inside he said he had quit because it was the way to speed the development of a multiparty system he plans to appeal abroad for a fund for the revival of petersburgleningrad \( the city was formerly st petersburg \) , which he assures will again be as sparkling as a fresh american city he represents the new alternatives opening up to president gorbachev s leadership dispersed but very popular , finished with the ideas of gradual change and of clinging to the center despite the power game in moscow , legitimacy is shifting ground
the power of the financial press journalism and economic opinion in britain and america by wayne parsons 266 pp new brunswick , nj rutgers university press 2495 take any potentially significant piece of economic policy , like president bush s proposal to reduce the rate at which capital gains are taxed what questions would a reasonable citizen or a reasonable senator want to ask before deciding whether to favor or oppose the legislation \? and where could they hope to find the answers \? a rational decision would have to rest on \( a \) an estimate of the pattern of losses and gains to the treasury in the years after the tax reduction takes effect and \( b \) some notion of the characteristics \( young , old , married , single , rich , poor \) of those who would gain a lot or lose a lot from the change in addition , since the stated purpose of the tax reduction is to stimulate investment in plant and equipment as well as research and development , and to encourage the startup of innovative new firms , one would want to know \( c \) how effective the proposal would be in achieving these goals providing answers to such questions is exactly the stuff of academic research papers and phd theses i do not mean the word academic literally the staff of the brookings institution , say , does exactly the same sort of work so do many economists employed by the federal reserve board , the congressional budget office and some other government agencies i mean to emphasize that this sort of work is done by , and read by , professional economists since they are communicating almost entirely with one another , it is efficient for research workers to use the shorthand jargon of technical economics and statistics it also has to be said that different researchers , using different methods and different bodies of data , will sometimes come up with contradictory results , especially if the effects being measured are fairly small that is hardly surprising the same is true of research aimed at measuring the health effects of diets containing various amounts of oat bran this professional writing is not much use to the reasonable citizen or the reasonable senator , who will find the jargon impenetrable and will have no basis for judging the relevance or utility of alternative approaches one might expect that a body of interpretive economic journalism would fill the gap and mediate between policyoriented research and policyinterested citizens there is indeed some of that given the importance of the issues , however , the inescapable conclusion is that there is not nearly enough serious economic journalism , and the average quality is pretty poor the senator can sometimes hold hearings and listen to the testimony of academic economists who may , repeat may , try to communicate the results of their research i have to record the impression that even these exercises are usually unsatisfactory , though there have been exceptions the power of the financial press by wayne parsons , who teaches government , not economics at the university of london , is about the evolution of economic and financial journalism in britain and america , but it does not offer any cogent explanation of the unsatisfactory state of affairs i have been describing he does not even focus on the problem of the translation of academic research into civil discourse , perhaps because he does not even see that there is such a problem when he mentions the body of academic research , it is usually to dismiss it for having retreated into selfindulgent and irrelevant mathematical technicality i think there is some justice in that charge but mr parsons does not seem to realize either that there remains a body of academic research aimed at exactly the questions that must be answered if economic policy is to have a rational basis , or that without some analytical complexity it may be impossible to avoid destructive oversimplification some of the issues treated , even superficially , by the author may provide clues to the failure of communication i think i see he points out , for example , that serious but nonacademic discussion of economics in england has been dominated by a group of important journalists andrew shonfield , samuel brittan , michael shanks , barbara ward , peter jay , among others who have no real counterparts in the united states , at least none who have been able to write at such length in contrast , popular discussion of economics in america has been dominated by a handful of leading academics , of whom milton friedman , john kenneth galbraith and paul samuelson have been the most prominent \( i think this observation is essentially right , though mr parsons overlooks the role of thomas balogh and nicholas kaldor in britain \) my own guess is that the explanation for this difference has something to do with the capacities of the respective audiences it is noteworthy that the vehicle for the american academic is usually the newspaper oped piece or newsweek column of 900 words or less , whereas the british journalists , even when they are writing in the sunday papers , are able to go on for much longer the american unwillingness to attend to more than a sound bite is destructive of both economic intelligence and political discourse mr parsons notes , correctly , that economic and financial journalism has been connected historically with the dissemination of price and market information those who are interested enough to read one will generally want to read the other i am not sure that anything follows from this connection mr parsons seems to think that the expansion of electronic media has some deep responsibility for the fact that the 10second commentary on the television news on today s economic events is more likely to come from a brokerage house employee than from either a serious journalist or an academic but it is probably no more than a matter of convenient availability anyway , since the content of what is said is negligible , it hardly matters who says it good interpretive economic journalism has to be able to distinguish between serious research and pseudoeconomics serious economics needs a bridge to the world of policy discussion because the people who do the research either cannot or will not build the bridge themselves schlock economics is all bridge it is not certain that mr parsons is clear about the distinction himself his chapter on the selling of reaganomics takes too seriously writers who are neither doers nor purveyors of hard research the editorial page of the wall street journal is as much part of the problem as it is part of the solution maybe we get the economic journalism we deserve drawing
los angeles , jan 27 bernie nicholls s life is defined more by his mastercard than any master plan nicholls does not have an agent he retains no financial consultant by his own frank admission and rough estimation , he has spent as much as 10 , 000 a month on dress suits there is , as well , the home worth 1 million , the cars worth a quarter of that , and the pricelessly mischievous smile that hints rather indiscreetly at profligate spending to come i live for today , said nicholls , the scoring center acquired by the rangers from the kings last weekend i do n't know where i'm going to be when i'm 50 and i do n't know what i 'd do with money if i was 50 the prospect of advancing age scares nicholls he talks in jest of being unable to so much as sit in a wheelchair even his mere explanation of such distress , which began casually and with a laugh , ended with nicholls upright and uptight i ca n't believe that one day i wo n't be able to play , nicholls said in an interview here , where the rangers were scheduled to play his former team tonight at the forum contemplating the future it 'll be a difficult day of reckoning and it could well be a doubly disappointing day if nicholls , with no future in the national hockey league to look forward to , also has to look back at a past with no glory after a career of overshadowed accomplishment , nicholls now stands ready to find out whether the play he can produce is up to the role he has always envisioned madison square garden , historically underpopulated by players of nicholls s reported caliber , is a stage awaiting a bravura performer and the rangers are arguably only a player or two away from being a convincing contender , a star vehicle awaiting a driver nicholls s credentials 70 goals and 150 points last season , 329 career goals in roughly eight seasons suggest he just might possess the license to operate such a thing tonight , nicholls met with supportive posters and enthusiastic applause in his first return to the forum in a foreign uniform he did n't disappoint either his local loyalists or the rangers , as he scored the crucial third goal in a 31 triumph over the kings i do n't know what i'm getting myself into , nicholls said i mean , there s a lot of pressure involved in this i have to produce and i might get nervous like crazy if it does n't come for me but i think i can handle anything that s thrown at me the rangers' big gamble he expects that will be more than a whole bunch of pucks the rangers gambled big when they traded tomas sandstrom and tony granato , two admired , and explosive 25yearold right wings and the 28yearold nicholls has talked big since the exchange was made official in addition to his boast of being the bestdressed player in the nhl , nicholls has proclaimed himself one of its authentic gamebreakers as well as one of its underrated defensive stalwarts he entered play tonight with two goals in two games with the rangers he 'll be the no 1 guy for them , said glen sather , the general manager of the edmonton oilers and an admirer of nicholls for years he s not smooth , but he can skate and he s not anything if he s not a scorer he wo n't , either , disappear when everyone s looking for him on the ice or afterward the boys in the garden s gallery will like him nicholls , an outgoing , often outlandish son of a truck driver , played his first professional hockey amid the dim lights and lonely nights of a tiny waystation outside of haliburton , ontario he always dressed to the nines and usually scored in double figures through his career in juniors before being taken 73d over all by the kings in 1980 called up in 1982 after scoring 41 goals in 55 games for new haven of the american hockey league , he was called up to the nhl in 1982 and promptly scored hat tricks in three consecutive games at the forum they still had some hats left to throw out on the ice after the last one , said nicholls , smiling none , though , were likely to have gone with the hot pink suit that soon became nicholls s staple sartorial statement at the forum there were silly pranks , too , as well as questionable behavior on the ice \( talking to opponents before and during games \) to go with at least one controversial choice of roommates off it \( nicholls was eventually forced to move out of the apartment he shared with a troubled jockey from the local racetrack \) i got labeled for being flamboyant and cocky , said nicholls , who scored 28 , 41 and 46 goals in his first three full seasons in the nhl but i 've never wanted to be like anyone else , never wanted anybody to know much about me or what makes me tick the players around the league misunderstood me , but i think my players knew where i was coming from invariably , though , he and his teammates were headed home in early spring year in and year out , the kings were rarely in and almost always out of the playoffs the losing , if it did n't destroy nicholls s taste for the game , ate at his desire the kings would be out of the running quickly and nicholls would retreat to the golf course or the racetrack losing is embarrassing i was out of the playoffs by february one year , said nicholls there are 21 teams and 16 make the playoffs you do n't make it , and it s an embarrassment we lost , and we lost a lot you lose so much , you hate the game nicholls rediscovered his passion for the game when its greatest player came to the kings before last season wayne gretzky , in nicholls s words , opened up the game of hockey to him and in the process got

johannesburg , jan 29 for the last week , audiences packing a popular dinner theater in a grimy industrial quarter of johannesburg have reserved one of their biggest laughs for a line offered by the country s bestknown political satirist , pieterdirk uys who would have thought , mr uys has said each night , strictly deadpan , that a faceless man with a fax machine could run the country from a prison \? the predominantly white audiences have needed no help identifying the reference to nelson mandela , who is the country s and perhaps the world s most famous political prisoner lately , mr mandela has added to his renown as the symbolic leader of millions of blacks a curiosity value of a highly unusual kind , since he has been negotiating , with the aid of a fax machine and a group of white prison officers who appear to act as much as assistants as captors , not only the terms of his own release but the outlines of what could be the future of south africa with quickening intensity , south africans everywhere from the plush northern suburbs of johannesburg to the dusty back alleys of soweto have been snapping up the final editions of newspapers at streetcorner stands , silencing gatherings to listen to the television news , and collectively sitting on the edge of their seats for news of what everybody seems to regard as one of the most momentous events in south african history the release of mr mandela , who has been continuously in south african jails since aug 5 , 1962 midnight vigil on saturday night , editors of the country s biggest newspaper , the sunday times , sat edgily in their offices until after midnight they were waiting for a call from reporters with mobile telephones stationed outside victor verster prison 40 miles northeast of cape town , and at other spots along the route that mr mandela is expected to take back to his home in soweto , the black satellite city outside johannesburg , when the country s white rulers finally decide to let him go when the editors finally let the reporters go home , it was because of a further twist in what had already become an enticingly improbable saga according to officials close to president f w de klerk , a move to release mr mandela immediately , two weeks before the most widely predicted date in midfebruary , was halted when mr de klerk and other top officials decided that conditions they had set for the release of the 71yearold black leader had not been met primarily , these involve a commitment to peace from mr mandela s exiled associates in the african national congress , a pledge that they will halt , or at least suspend , the sporadic guerrilla attacks against government and other targets that they have conducted since mr mandela went underground to lead an armed struggle against domination by the country s white minority in 1961 but winnie mandela , the black leader s wife , implied after visiting mr mandela on saturday that the delay came at her husband s behest , after the government failed to meet his terms these include the ending of the ban on the african national congress and dozens of other proscribed black groups , the lifting of a state of emergency declared by the government during antigovernment turmoil in 1986 , the release of about 300 political detainees and an end to all political executions , by which mr mandela means the hanging of blacks found guilty of murder and other capital crimes while engaged in antiapartheid protests whether mr de klerk is ready to meet some or all of mr mandela s terms , and to announce a firm date for the black leader s freedom , is expected to be known on friday , when the president addresses the opening session of parliament in cape town in the meantime , the suggestion advanced by mrs mandela that her husband might yet refuse to take his freedom , after more than a quarter century in jail that included years spent working in a lime quarry , picking seaweed and building roads has added intrigue to a situation that has no obvious parallel in the annals of political detention a shadow government \? as mr uys s remark at the market theater in johannesburg suggested , many south africans are bemused by the idea that a man long presented to them as a communist and a terrorist has emerged , while still in prison , as a sort of oneman shadow government but perhaps the most striking thing of all is that many whites appear as excited by the situation as blacks , and that the feeling is detectable in some improbable places a visitor who met last week with a highranking officer who was previously head of the widely feared security police reported that the officer , until recently charged with hunting down and prosecuting members of the african national congress , compared the situation with the boer war , the most traumatic event in the history of south africa s ruling ethnic group , the afrikaners he seemed absolutely fascinated , the visitor said for the moment , many whites and blacks have their attention fixed on the unusual details of mr mandela s continuing incarceration
johannesburg if there is a general amnesty and it brings democracy and peace to our country , albie sachs said , i would be thrilled even if the amnesty extends to the people who tried to kill me mr sachs is a lawyer long associated with the african national congress two years ago in mozambique a bomb planted in his car , almost certainly by agents of the south african government , blew off his right arm he lives in london now , and i spoke with him there i certainly do n't believe in an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , an arm for an arm , he said what is important is to expose the crimes that is very healing , whereas endless trials might simply keep the wounds open his views were personal , mr sachs said but over the last three weeks in south africa and namibia i have heard similar themes from many people , white and black , left and right reconciliation , not retribution do not punish , but do not forget human rights organizations generally oppose amnesty for state officials who murder or torture punishment is necessary to prevent future abuses , they argue but in south africa i found a very different view amnesty is politically essential , a leading johannesburg lawyer said without it there can be no solution the question is acutely important for south africa now talks between the government and the anc have been rescheduled for early may they will deal with obstacles to negotiation on a constitutional settlement , and one obstacle is anc insistence that all political prisoners be freed president f w de klerk has freed nelson mandela and other wellknown antiapartheid leaders but he has not released hundreds of others who committed common crimes , such as murder , for political ends it is a highly emotional issue for decades until mr de klerk changed course two months ago the national party government demonized the anc as terrorists some anc bombs took the lives of random civilians a decision to let the bombers go would be hard for many whites to accept amnesty would be at least as painful on the other side over the last 30 years government agents have killed and maimed many antiapartheid leaders steve biko was murdered while in detention anc representatives have been murdered as far away as paris right now a judicial commission appointed by mr de klerk is hearing evidence , in public , about a death squad operation run by the military there were schemes to kill many opponents of apartheid , including an unsuccessful plan to poison mr mandela s lawyer by switching his heart pills not everyone will be as philosophical as albie sachs about letting the conspirators go free but even some victims of cruelty whom i met are prepared to put retribution aside there was a striking example in namibia , which became independent on march 21 bience gawanas is a young woman , black , who supported swapo s struggle against south africa in 1977 , at the age of 21 , she left the country for zambia she ended up at warwick university in england , got a degree in law and was called to the bar at lincoln s inn , london in august 1988 she went back to zambia for a holiday there swapo detained her as a spy she was taken to angola and tortured until she confessed i'm definitely not for punishment , ms gawanas said i 've experienced it from both sides my brother was killed by whites in this country but people were committed to their ideologies they did what they did as part of the arrangement for independence , ms gawanas and other swapo detainees \( though not yet all \) were returned to namibia since then , on the streets of windhoek , she has met the men who tortured her they do n't expect me to be nice to them , she said but i greet them ms gawanas made the same point as albie sachs about people knowing what happened we need to know to prevent it happening again , she said people here did not vote to wipe history off when they approved the constitution they voted to give peace a chance there was another thing ms gawanas wanted , but has not had that is an expression of regret from the swapo leadership for the detentions and torture of herself and others truth , even without apology , is strong medicine in a society whose power elite has been as given to selfdeception as has south africa s we 're going to have to talk about things people usually do n't talk about , the johannesburg lawyer said if we avoid them , if we do n't come to terms with history , it will be a cancer in the society president de klerk appears to agree with that view in appointing the commission to investigate state death squads , he broke with an ingrained practice of secrecy the idea of formal amnesty for political prisoners has support in both mr de klerk s camp and the anc leadership the president s closest adviser on constitutional negotiations , dr gerrit viljoen , said a healing device will have to be considered on a very broad basis defining political prisoners is tricky but here president de klerk has taken a significant step

washington , aug 30 asserting that the shape of the postcoldwar world was at issue in the persian gulf crisis , president bush said today that he was asking other countries to help pay the multibilliondollar cost of military operations and economic sanctions in the region as the emergency entered its fifth week and secretary general javier perez de cuellar of the united nations arrived in jordan for a mediation effort , mr bush again said he was pessimistic about the search for a diplomatic solution mr perez de cuellar , who is to meet on friday with iraq s foreign minister , tariq aziz , described the situation in the middle east as explosive hostage release delayed in iraq and kuwait , american and other western women and children , whom president saddam hussein had promised on tuesday to release at once , encountered further delays but late tonight , the foreign office in london said iraq was arranging to fly some british women and children directly to london , and virgin atlantic airways said it had been given permission to fly to baghdad to pick up others soviet officials , after three weeks of quietly tolerating the buildup of united states military forces in the persian gulf , sharply challenged the american presence and questioned whether it might be intended as a permanent foothold in the region page a13 at a news conference before returning to his vacation home at kennebunkport , me , mr bush said , the united states has large interests in the balance and has undertaken commitments commensurate with them , and we 're more than willing to bear our fair share of the burden he added , but we also expect others to bear their fair share excerpts , page a11 brady and baker to 'twist arms' american delegations led by treasury secretary nicholas f brady and secretary of state james a baker 3d are to be sent soon to west germany , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , japan , south korea and the kuwaiti exile government to twist their arms a bit , a ranking official said , for contributions of as much as 25 billion the money would defray some of the costs of american troop deployment and naval patrols and help middle eastern nations that are suffering hardships because of the united nations trade embargo against iraq turkey , egypt and jordan are the principal nations that will benefit from the aid program , american officials said the plan to solicit contributions was put together rapidly , under strong congressional pressure to set up some form of burdensharing , and it remains somewhat nebulous at a dinner at the white house on wednesday night for a group of 11 senators and representatives , all old friends of the president , several pressed him to adopt a more aggressive policy , including the removal of president hussein as the leader of iraq , several guests said representative john d dingell , democrat of michigan , said there was a clear appreciation that further goals have to be established senator william v roth , republican of delaware , commented there were some who spoke quite strongly that we ought to go beyond the goals we have set , that the aggressor ought to be removed senator richard g lugar , republican of indiana , who attended the dinner , has recently expressed that view in public and in private but mr bush said today that he had stopped short of adding the removal of the iraqi leader to the list of aims of the united states new conditions for release the roughly 1 , 000 american women and children in iraq and kuwait have been told that they must submit letters requesting permission to leave , accompanied by arabic translations and bearing official stamps attesting that all local taxes have been paid , according to margaret d tutwiler , the state department spokeswoman once again , iraqi promises have been followed by new restrictions on foreigners and burdensome procedures , miss tutwiler said this emotional roller coaster is inhumane and disgraceful the foreign office in london said that even as mr hussein was talking about letting people go , he was detaining others a spokesman said iraqi troops took 32 britons from their homes in kuwait on wednesday , grouped them with seven others and transported all 39 to baghdad under armed guard at his news conference , mr bush said he was worried about the hostages but declined to say that their vulnerability would deter him from launching any attack on iraq we cannot permit hostage taking to shape the foreign policy of this country , he declared i will not change the policy of the united states to pay homage or to give credibility to this brutal move of staking out citizens and a brutal move of holding people against their will perez de cuellar meeting delayed mr perez de cuellar had been expected to begin his meeting with mr aziz this evening , but the session was postponed until friday morning he said he thought the iraqi government was as eager as we all are to find a just and lasting solution of the problem but he also emphasized that he had no choice but to push baghdad to accept security council resolutions demanding iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and release of all hostages these are not my resolutions , the united nations leader said they are security council resolutions i cannot make any concessions on these i am not a merchant to negotiate
saddam hussein s plunder of kuwait only dramatizes something americans have long known from the bottom of their gas tanks oil dependency breeds vulnerability one way or another , the iraq crisis will end but the vulnerability wo n't unless america creates a national energy policy that s no sanctimonious abstraction it s a practical need a sound energy policy would encourage domestic suppliers , insulate the economy against foreign manipulation , protect the environment and raise revenue congress could do it all in a stroke , by increasing energy taxes president bush has followed the reagan energy policy reliance on deregulated markets to guide consumers and producers , and the strategic petroleum reserve to offset supply disruptions these are sensible principles deregulation has raised energy prices and cut use and the reserve has warded off panic buying yet the reaganbush handsoff approach is not enough americans account for 2 percent of the world s population but consume an astounding 25 percent of the world s oil much of this consumption is wasted because low market prices take insufficient account of real costs one is national security every extra barrel consumed makes the us that much more vulnerable to oil cartel cutbacks the price americans pay for imported oil covers none of the likely costs of future supply interruptions brought on by such dependence likewise , energy use fouls air and water and contributes to global warming yet consumers pay for none of this damage the best way to pay for all these reasons , consumers are n't paying the full costs of energy the most effective way to do that is higher energy taxes they would right the balance and also avoid the need for a lot of micromanaging by congress americans would switch to fuelefficient cars without elaborate regulations alternative fuels could become competitive without massive subsidies congress would still have to decide which energy taxes to raise , and by how much each tax has a different regional and environmental consequence though there are few studies to guide the decisions , a tax that would add between 25 and 50 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline would make a good start debate over the pros and cons of various options must not overshadow the underlying principle americans are paying too little for energy fill the reserve the strategic petroleum reserve provides another pillar of energy policy large buffer stocks can offset temporary supply disruptions and radically change oil exporters' calculations these goals would be better served by expanding the reserve to 1 billion barrels from 600 million its operating procedures also need revision the reserve can be opened only by a presidential declaration of an emergency there are promising proposals to open it on an ongoing basis , subject to a fee that would allow government to replace withdrawn supply at a profit these proposals deserve serious review , before the next crisis revive nuclear energy it s a federal responsibility also to promote new sources of energy there is a relatively lowcost , nonpolluting form of it , which gives france 70 percent of its electricity , japan 30 percent but the us only 18 percent nuclear one attractive option would be to join with our allies in designing a nuclear reactor so safe that all reasonable unease would be allayed the iraq crisis has generated new oratory about energy independence a tax that would take national security and the environment into account would mean only a moderate increase in the price of energy but to achieve energy independence would require a draconian leap that would stifle the economy and cost millions of americans their jobs to press for energy independence for its own sake would be economically suicidal a wise energy policy must strike a balance between reduced dependence and an induced depression the starting point is this proposition energy taxes must rise
rome , july 9 praise flowed like italian wine today , as officials of the world governing body for soccer and the organizing committee of the 1990 world cup expressed unconditional joy over the monthlong tournament that ended sunday night in the same vein , they offered nothing but optimism that the united states would stage an equally successful tournament in 1994 , maybe even a better one yet beneath the kind words and congratulations for a job well done remained an undercurrent of concern that a country of soccer agnostics like the united state can attain the proper frame of mind and disposition to equal the passion and spirit surrounding the tournament that just ended rightly or not , fifa , the world governing body , can point to disappointing television ratings in the united states as exhibit a that few americans feel inclined to expand their sporting interests low ratings scare off potential sponsors , as well as other networks imagine 60 billion eyes in italy , where soccer is worshiped , there were no such problems through a cooperative effort of the national government , which spent billions for capital improvements , and the private sector , the 1990 tournament broke all sorts of records that could be used to measure interest the most compelling among them organizing committee officials said today that preliminary reports indicated that the 52 games attracted more than 30 billion viewers throughout the world no doubt even more would watch games of the 1994 tournament but fifa , whose prime directive is to spread the good word of soccer to every city and hamlet on earth , is worried that americans simply do n't care , or worse , wo n't care despite four years of trying to make them the united states has everything , a fifa official said the italians had to build stadiums , improve airports and make roads better the united states has everything in place all they have to do is stage the tournament and develop a representative team the selling job was not helped to any great degree by what happened in italy over the last four weeks for starters , the american team failed to achieve even a draw in three games before its unceremonious departure for closers , west germany and argentina played a dreadful final , won by the germans , 10 , on a penalty kick from start to finish , the tournament became a grand testament to defense , as the 52 games produced the lowest goalproduction rate in the six decades of the tournament , an average of 221 goals a game to continue a decline that began four years ago in mexico the final was perfectly symbolic in that none of the previous 13 championship games had ever ended in a shutout or with both teams scoring fewer than three goals combined poorly schooled americans while experts attribute the decreasing scores to the growing sophistication of defenses , americans poorly schooled in the nuances of the game may have difficulty warming to a match decided after 30 minutes of extra time by a single goal , as england s victory over belgium was in the round of 16 in fact , it was an engrossing match the question then arises , how can the 1994 organizers sell the game in their own country \? senior fifa officials openly predict that attendance figures will fall somewhere between italy s 93 percent of capacity and 52 sellouts no doubt that is possible , with reasonable ticket prices , at least for the early round games the united states is a bigevent country even if those attending do n't always understand what they 're watching television is a different issue the way american networks operate is simply not compatible with soccer unlike american sports , which provide natural breaks and can fit in others created by network demands , soccer is a game of flow and progression so long as networks interrupt viewing to accommodate commercials of 30 seconds and 60 seconds , the medium and the message will never get along officials from the united states soccer federation virtually wave a flag of surrender to the television dilemma we got a 2 rating this time , one said today , referring to the success of the world cup on tnt , a cable network owned by the turner broadcasting system if we get a 4 in 1994 , i 'll be thrilled more important to the federation and to fifa is the development of a credible united states team the host country gets an automatic berth in the tournament , and since the first , in 1930 , none has failed to advance beyond the first round ideas roll in the federation has all sorts of ideas to help develop a better team for 1994 a professional league , tournaments at home , tournaments abroad , a series of annual exhibition matches so far , little has been done one development that would surely help would be the hiring of franz beckenbauer , west germany s coach , to oversee the united states' national development programs the negotiations are continuing , even though beckenbauer and senior federation officials deny it for all the wellintended plans and solid efforts of the 1994 organizers and for all the success they might achieve , it is still unlikely that soccer in the united states can ever generate the kind of passion that leads other countries to a virtual spiritual myopia during the world cup photo franz beckenbauer hoisting the world cup above the crowd yesterday at roemerberg square in frankfurt 9agence francepresse \)
innocence and experience by stuart hampshire 195 pp cambridge , mass harvard university press 20 folly is an endless maze , tangled roots perplex her ways , how many have fallen there ! they stumble all night over bones of the dead and feel they know not what but care and wish to lead others when they should be ledwilliam blake , songs of innocence and of experience in his recent book quiddities the harvard philosopher w v quine wrote that he knows gratuitous killing is wrong but beyond that salient marker there are only uncharted moral wastes mr quine is celebrated for the preciseness of his thought his statement reads like a declaration of bankruptcy on the part of british and american academic philosophers , who seem to talk mostly to one another but most people who are not academic philosophers assume that moral principles do exist , and they often act on that assumption there being such a gap between mr quine s bleak assessment of the profession and common practice , one turns to what sir stuart hampshire , a veteran moralist and now the bonsall professor of philosophy at stanford university , has to say in innocence and experience , a book expressly directed to defending and exemplifying moral reasoning to take up first the virtues of the book it teaches that the experience of the philosopher determines his themes , that it is his own points of stress and conflict that are reflected in them also , the collective experience that is history must have a major role in shaping any moral philosophy the mere rationalist abstract of humanity is not enough the imagination , broadly understood as the faculty that permits human beings to imitate , to intuit , to empathize and to create , is as important as reason in moral thought sir stuart says , further , that when we describe our moral decision making we possess only metaphors to indicate our mental operations and that the oldest and best of these metaphors is the council of a ruler determining a public policy , in which argument and consideration of alternatives precede decision \( i also like his metaphor for the imagination as a compost heap , enriched by each new load of material intermingling with the pile \) in forming moral philosophy today , he says , we can and should draw on the work of great predecessors such as aristotle , whose account of the ways in which good is predicated is fundamental we should not accept the distinction made by the 18thcentury british philosopher david hume between fact and value , nor be bemused by hume s trick of making a statement doubtful by examining it abstractly , removed from the conditions that are normally assumed when the statement is made finally , sir stuart says there is evil done by human beings that no moral philosopher can relativize or rationalize and no moral philosophy should ignore these are contributions to the charting of the moral landscape , even though none of these points lead to specific moral prescriptions there are further beauties not least of them the author s tone of civilized conversation to be acknowledged , if my list were to be exhaustive and i must concede that i have picked what pleases me with the same subjectivity i shall enumerate what in a work of moral philosophy may be called vices , aware though i am that the author is not vicious and that only the moral duty of candor requires such stern evaluation he gives almost no biographical information we are told at the start that at the age of 16 or 17 he was distressed by the sight of the unemployed in england at the university of oxford he was attracted by communism as preferable to a conservatism toadying to the nazis and fascists , but he underwent an intellectual conversion to the logical positivism of the vienna circle and won a fellowship at all souls' college as an intelligence officer during world war ii he studied the central command of the german ss , including the gestapo later he worked for the labor government and was involved in the european response to the marshall plan before returning to university life in 1947 he has always been a socialist he has always been attracted by the deception and intrigue of wartime secret intelligence and he is now 75 years old these biographical notes , or most of them , would fit many english academics who were undergraduates in the 1930 s they tell us almost nothing about the social or sexual or spiritual life of the man , none of those intimate facts that beyond doubt have a great deal to do with how a moral philosopher has framed his questions and his answers it is no accident that the most influential of all moralists of the west , st augustine , was the most generous provider of such information , and no accident that rousseau , seeing the connection , imitated st augustine s confessions in comparison with these masters of selfrevelation , sir stuart hampshire remains a reticent englishman his bow to history does not lead him to

seven nuclear bombs' worth of plutonium escaped into air ducts at the rocky flats weapons plant near denver over the 38 years of the plant s operation , federal officials said yesterday officials of the federal department of energy said workers had detected 28 kilograms , or about 62 pounds , in the ducts , more than twice the amount of plutonium they had been expected to find plutonium is so toxic that it is usually accounted for in quantities expressed in grams or thousandths of a kilogram the search was undertaken after an independent study found last october that enough plutonium had accumulated in the ducts to raise the possibility of an accidental nuclear reaction the experts who undertook the study said that the plutonium would not escape from the buildings but that about 12 kilograms would be found in the ducts energy department officials said the plutonium was contained in exhaust ducts and therefore was not in a position to harm workers within the buildings and they said filters kept it from escaping into the air outside critics of the government s weapons complex said the discovery indicated worse mechanical and managerial troubles at the plant than had previously come to light rocky flats has been closed since december to correct the problems the plant makes nuclear triggers for hydrogen bombs 'a very substantial quantity' this is a very substantial quantity of plutonium that was simply not accounted for , said dan w reicher of the natural resources defense council , a washingtonbased group that has repeatedly sued the government to force safety and environmental improvements they should have been keeping track of this plutonium for both security and health reasons critics of the department say the fact that such a quantity could be found without the government s knowing that it was missing casts doubt on its system of keeping track of the the material they say that what they view as lax accounting leaves open the possibility that some plutonium may have been diverted by terrorists or foreign agents the government says there is no evidence that that has happened it is not clear if more plutonium is unaccounted for and waiting to be discovered within the plant the federal government says such information is classified leo p duffy , director of waste management and environmental restoration at the department of energy in washington , said the material in the ducts at rocky flats represented the residues of 38 years of operation and was a very small fraction of the amount of plutonium that the plant has handled the material , mr duffy said , was found spread over 6 , 000 feet of pipe and was not in a concentration sufficient to allow an inadvertent nuclear reaction the department has taken steps to prevent more plutonium from leaking , he said but he acknowledged , none of this is a satisfactory way of running an operation the disclosure of the quantity of plutonium was first made yesterday by a plant official to melinda kassen , a lawyer with the environmental defense fund in boulder , colo , near the plant ms kassen , a member of the rocky flats monitoring council , a quasigovernmental organization established by representative david e skaggs and governor roy romer , had asked plant officials at a meeting the previous day if they had completed the study they promised last october she said that she was told that the survey had been completed but that the number was being withheld a figure is given yesterday , she said , she was told that the quantity was 28 kilograms , a figure the energy department later confirmed ms kassen said it was evident that the plutonium had escaped into the ducts because for years , as filters became clogged and automatically closed operations , workers had punched holes in them so the air , although contaminated , could pass through the plutonium in the air , the energy department says , attached itself to the exhaust ducts or was captured by subsequent filters the ducts and filters are connected to glove boxes , enclosed spaces into which operators can insert their hands in gloves built into the wall the glove boxes are kept at a slight vacuum , so any leaks draw air in rather than allow plutonium particles out members of the monitoring council have asked whether egg inc , the wellesley , massbased contractor that took over the rocky flats operation in january from the rockwell international corp , will modify the boxes before operations resume , she said , and were told that no decision had been made mr duffy , in washington , said that the department had established training procedures to assure that workers would not bypass the filters and that it had programs to test the filters and determine when they are clogging up effect on arms deployment washington , march 28 \( ap \) energy secretary james d watkins strongly hinted today that deployment of trident 2 ballistic missiles could be delayed next year by problems at the rocky flats plant has been closed since mr watkins said he hoped the plant could resume operation by this summer in an appearance before a house armed services subcommitee on nuclear weapons production , mr watkins said he could not discuss details , but said , i can guarantee if we do n't move aggressively to get the weapons production complex back in full operation soon , there will be severe ramifications
a caravaggio rediscovered the lute player , at the metropolitan museum of art , is an exhibition modest only in size it includes paintings of the first rank , paintings that have not been on view in years and paintings that have been unjustly ignored it juxtaposes these works with related prints , musical scores and instruments to give a vivid sense of the cultural milieu of the late 16th century , in which caravaggio was fortunate enough to find himself in the 1590 s , no less than in the 1990 s , having talent was one thing but having a patron was something else altogether , and while michelangelo da caravaggio certainly did not lack the former when he moved to rome from lombardy in 1592 , he languished for more than two years before encountering someone who could set his career on track cardinal francesco maria del monte , an amateur painter and musician , not only acquired caravaggio s cardsharps from a dealer , but also provided the artist with a stipend and a studio in his palazzo madama in return , caravaggio painted one winner after another for del monte , including the lute player that is in the title of this exhibition giovan pietro bellori , caravaggio s 17thcentury biographer , claimed that the artist had fled lombardy after an altercation in milan caravaggio was in any case no stranger to the underside of life when he arrived at the palace in 1595 , as must have been evident to anyone who saw the cardsharps who else could have rendered such a convincing depiction of the young scoundrel with the four of clubs in his back pocket and a dagger at his hip \? yet as a member of del monte s entourage , caravaggio found himself surrounded by poets and musicians and in the middle of a society that was not at all like the one he had known it was his most profound accomplishment while at the palazzo madama to combine in his paintings the life of the street with the aspirations of the court the people in these works are almost frighteningly real , but they are also endowed with a metaphorical significance the lute player and the musicians may depict specific singers in del monte s employ , but the paintings transcend portraiture to achieve allegory they are about the transience of love the cardsharps and the fortune teller may represent commedia dell'arte characters whom caravaggio encountered at the theater , but they are moralizing tales about deception and innocence all four works have been brought together for the first time in centuries as recently as five years ago , this would have been impossible the cardsharps , long thought to be lost , suddenly reappeared in 1987 , when it was bought by the kimbell art museum in fort worth from a european private collection the fortune teller , which has been in the collection of the pinacoteca capitolina in rome since 1750 , was until very lately considered by some to be a copy the lute player , which is owned by wildenstein , the new york dealer , and is now on longterm loan to the metropolitan , was misattributed to an artist named carlo saraceni documents that trace the work irrefutably to caravaggio have been uncovered in the last few years and backed up by xrays of the canvas none of these paintings were in the age of caravaggio exhibition that the metropolitan presented in 1985 the show that opens today , in other words , celebrates major advances in caravaggio scholarship while providing fresh perspectives on the artist it has been ably put together by keith christiansen , a curator of european paintings at the metropolitan , with the assistance of andrea bayer and laurence libin from the museum caravaggio reveals himself as someone who was not above repetition generations of scholars took it for granted that a great painter would never tackle the same subject twice , but that is precisely what caravaggio did in the case of the lute player the del monte painting turns out to be a variation of a work done for a different patron the original lute player has been lent to the exhibition by the hermitage in leningrad del monte s lute player is the subject of the show , but the leningrad painting , by far the most beautiful work of caravaggio s early career , is its star the exhibition also makes clear that the paintings caravaggio did for del monte were seen by many artists during the early 17th century , and that their influence can be discerned far and wide more than 30 copies of the cardsharps are known to exist without caravaggio s example , george de la tour s fortune tellers in the metropolitan s collection would not have been conceivable nor would pietro paolini s concert from the getty museum in malibu , calif , nor paolini s bacchic concert from dallas , both of which borrow directly from caravaggio s musicians orazio gentileschi s beatific lute player at the national gallery in washington could only have been painted with caravaggio in mind , and the same applies to theodoor rombouts s comedic version of the subject in the collection of the philadelphia museum of art

what jane austen did for marriage in the 19th century , film makers are doing for adultery today in the past few weeks alone , eight films from seven countries have offered a view of infidelity around the world it is an unmistakable sign of a turbulent social era ju dou , set in china in the 1920 s , and tilai , set in a contemporary african village , are radically different films that share this single plot an arranged marriage between a young woman and an older man leads her to an adulterous affair that results in murder the sting of death , from japan , and a woman s revenge , from france , both depict a woman who discovers her husband s adultery and goes mad these films , shown at the 28th new york film festival \( with ju dou and tilai to open commercially later this season \) echo the adulterous motifs in two current american films henry and june , which glorifies the menage a trois among anais nin , henry miller and his wife , june , elevates marital infidelity to an artistic ambition and texasville is a slice of pure , commercial americana whose adulterous tangles make peyton place seem like mother goose this overload of international adultery also includes films in which infidelity is significant but not central , such as the australian director paul cox s golden braid and the taviani brothers' night sun , from italy , both of which were also shown at the recently completed festival in all these films , adultery is more than a matter of love or passion in fact , with the exceptions of henry and june and golden braid , there is surprisingly little eroticism in these films but even passionate films such as dangerous liaisons and sex , lies and videotape function like austen s novels they use an individual s tale of marriage and adultery to expose social hypocrisy , to analyze and criticize one of the most crucial standards by which any culture lives most often , infidelity becomes a symbolic act of rebellion against the traditional social order in those rarefied subcultures where adultery is acceptable , fidelity becomes the rebellious idea and from the elegant , understated manner of tilai to the soap opera commercialism of texasville , the common motif is handled in a way characteristic of each country s cinematic style , offering a revealing crosscultural view in films such as ju dou and tilai , adultery is explicitly presented as heroic resistance to outmoded traditions these films tell stories of passion and violence , but they are more concerned with social comment than with remaking the postman always rings twice the first fact we learn about ju dou , the heroine who gives the film its title , is that she was a very expensive bride to buy every subsequent action she takes defies the tradition that binds her to an abusive husband the affair and the illegitimate son she has with tian qing , her husband s middleaged adopted son , are both symbolic and personal the old husband , so vile that he tries to murder the child , embodies the evil traditions \( and by extension the government control \) that have held china back and when the husband dies , a bearded family elder invokes the ancient teachings and banishes tian qing from the house because he is not a true son challenging such rigid social patterns is both heroic and tragic , eventually leading to the murder of tian qing by his own son in this context , the persistent love between ju dou and tian qing is as much a failed social rebellion as it is a private passion in fact , when the lovers begin to writhe on the floor of the family s dye factory , the film cuts to a bolt of red cloth in a vat it is the equivalent of old hollywood movies that discreetly shift to the fireplace to suggest sex but the director , zhang yimou , is not only working in a slow , symbolic chinese tradition he is circumspect in the way of film makers who must dance around censorship the film was made after the government repression that began with tiananmen square though it is based on a novel that moves from the 30 s to the 70 s , the film is situated safely in the precommmunist past idrissa ouedraogo of burkina faso is much more direct in his criticism of the old order in tilai , a film whose crisp photography , spare dialogue and gently flowing narrative are typical of african cinema but here , too , adultery is a form of social heroism nogma is in love with saga , but is married off to his father when the villagers discover the lovers' adulterous affair , saga is condemned to death , with his own brother chosen as the sanctioned murderer as in ju dou , the film maker sympathizes with the rebellious lovers , whose passionate resistance to tradition carries symbolic weight nogma s adolescent sister and saga s brother are also strong figures who question the arranged marriage and the punishment for adultery but as in ju dou , this rebellion fails , leading to a death that functions as virulent criticism of tradition for its own sake
key lois , fla , aug 20 more than a decade ago bausch lomb in a business venture put thousands of rhesus monkeys on two small deserted islands to breed for the state of florida and residents of nearby keys , however , the breeding has been far too successful while the visioncare company s venture was designed to offer a steady supply of laboratory animals to biomedical researchers , people who live near the two islands where the monkeys have been allowed to run free object to what they call needless environmental destruction it looks like a war zone right now , just like vietnam , said james mcelroy , who is part of a grassroots antimonkey campaign the rhesus monkeys have been good business since they were first brought from india 18 years ago handlers regularly dispense monkey chow and capture more than a thousand each year , generating more than 15 million in annual sales the breeding colonies became more important to american researchers after india , pakistan and bangladesh banned monkey exports in the late 1970 s , said dr joseph held , vice president for primate research at charles river laboratories , the division of bausch lomb that runs the islands and because they are untainted by infections from the outside world , they are much more valuable than other primates destined for the nation s laboratories , dr held said used in neurological research bausch lomb , based in rochester , said that most of the animals were sold to laboratories doing advanced neurological research and that none are used for eyecare tests more than 1 , 900 breeding animals and several thousand offspring roam on 300 acres of partly submerged wetlands on key lois and raccoon key even the company , which has consented to replace damaged trees and reduce the monkey population , agrees that the monkeys have made a mess of things the monkeys stripped the leaves from thousands of red mangroves , a protected species , and now struggle to find shade their waste has fouled the waters , leaving a band of yellowishbrown algae that chokes out marine life they were n't too noticeable until the vegetation began disappearing , mr mcelroy said that s when people became alarmed the state owns everything below the highwater line , and environmental officials ordered bausch lomb to clean up those grounds years ago charles river laboratories fenced in and replanted some trees , but disputed the boundary and sued the state in 1986 little changed until the two sides quietly agreed to a settlement in may that would allow the company to phase out the monkeys over 20 to 30 years when opponents complained , gov bob martinez scuttled the agreement and decided to go after charles river instead they just stripped all the state land and left it bare , governor martinez said at the cabinet meeting on june 26 i 'd like to see if we can prosecute ken plante , general counsel for the florida department of environmental resources , said the title dispute must be resolved first a hearing has been scheduled for aug 30 the department is trying to find surveyors willing to brave the monkeys and measure the property , mr plante said
with their state nominating convention starting next week , republican leaders are still searching for a candidate to oppose gov mario m cuomo the republicans , who had hoped to use a recordbreaking tax increase and a chaotic budgetmaking process to undermine the governor s popularity , are still cajoling wouldbe candidates they have been using partisan poll data , questionable fundraising hopes and implied promises of future rewards in the event of defeat fundraising problems in the past , candidates have been willing to run almost impossible races as a means of becoming better known , with an eye toward future races but that has not been the case this year because of mr cuomo s large war chest , his popularity and republican fundraising problems in addition , the party has few appointments to offer a candidate within the state and few prospects in washington the white house has not cooperated at all , new york republican leaders say , in fielding a candidate for what the republicans concede is at best an uphill battle the chaotic state of the republican party in new york sharply contrasts with the national party s success in capturing the white house in the last three elections and with the new york victories of gov nelson a rockefeller , whose personality , money and record overcame the democratic enrollment edge in the state for 16 years in the 1960 s and 70 s the party s state chairman , j patrick barrett , is to meet tonight in albany with five top republican leaders in yet another effort to break a stalemate that republicans concede has left the state party in its weakest position since the new deal a political and governmental unknown , herbert london , a dean at new york university , is emerging as the fallback candidate for governor his rise has occurred despite reservations by some party leaders , notably his homecounty leader , state senator roy m goodman of manhattan the conservative party is promoting mr london , a conservative republican with no visible fundraising ability , who briefly ran for mayor last year at least a dozen republicans , including mr barrett , have ruled themselves out as candidates for governor an impoverished party echoing each other , they cite mr cuomo s 8 million to 10 million campaign fund , an impoverished republican party and mr cuomo s favorable standing in the latest nonpartisan polls if anyone told me five years ago that i 'd be turning down a nomination for governor , i 'd laugh , said the nassau county comptroller , peter t king , who was sounded out on sunday for the second time by joseph n mondello , the nassau republican chairman mr king lost the state attorney general race in 1986 two other nassau republicans , thomas s gulotta , the county executive , and denis e dillon , the district attorney who recently converted from the democratic to the republican party , have also declined to run the 1986 republican candidate for lieutenant governor , michael kavanagh , the ulster county district attorney , said , i 'd love to run for governor , but you ca n't do it without money and i do n't want to be a laughingstock seemingly strong prospect in most cases , potential candidates were approached by mr barrett or their republican county leaders but as the situation became more desperate , mr barrett turned to five county leaders who met two weeks ago they came up with one seemingly strong prospect , george d gould mr gould is a manhattan investment manager , a former under secretary of the treasury and former chairman of the municipal assistance corporation mr gould was told about not shown a wirthlin group poll that the party commissioned in march it showed mr cuomo with a favorable rating of about 60 percent but a slightly unfavorable rating when those surveyed were asked whether mr cuomo deserved a new term or whether it was time for a change clutching for optimistic numbers , republicans have seized on the latter result that straw was buttressed by a penn schoen associates poll in march for the business council that showed very strong opposition to the governor s budget proposal and tax package but the poll did not try to translate that into election projections in the same month , a nonpartisan marist institute poll showed mr cuomo with a favorable rating of about 64 percent , and yesterday lee m miringoff , director of the institute , expressed doubt that the state budget chaos would substantially change that rating at the same time , continuing republican state senate polls in marginal senate districts showed a weakening of mr cuomo , said a republican familiar with the results but even that was not a reason for optimism instead of winning with 60 percent , he wins with 55 , the republican said a golden opportunity has passed us none of the polls addressed mr cuomo s campaign fund and the usual advantage incumbents have in countering any unpopularity among voters a tarnished forecast in contrast , the republican state committee is in debt despite that , mr gould and other potential candidates for governor have been told that the party could raise 4 million to 5 million an optimistic forecast that has been tarnished by republican state committee fundraising problems in the last year in january , rudolph w giuliani , the original republican favorite for governor , was told by mr barrett , the state chairman , that the party could raise 6 million , a figure mr barrett mentioned often at a february meeting , the figure dropped to 3 million , said friends of mr giuliani who were already wary of the state chairman because of what they said were broken promises of financial support for him in last year s new york city mayoral campaign the chaos in the republican party in the state has reached the point that even as mr barrett struggles to come up with a candidate for governor , many new york republicans are speculating that he will step aside from the party post after the convention at the rye town hilton in westchester , which begins next tuesday robert r mcmillan , the unsuccessful new york republican candidate for the united states senate in 1988 , is telling politicians that he is interested in the state chairmanship he too has declined to run against mr cuomo mr mcmillan has said he is willing to run for state attorney general on a ticket headed by the assembly republican minority leader , clarence d rappleyea over the weekend , mr rappleyea declined the nomination for governor for the second time

tune in tomorrow is a dervish of a film , its maddest doings designed by a radio writer who baits albanians , impersonates a hasid and stirs soap operas within soap operas with his roman a clef brand of audio theater but at the core of the movie , which opens friday , resides the eternal topic of illogical love martin loader , an aspiring author with a summer job on the aforementioned radio station , falls for a woman named julia he is 21 and defensive on the subject of virginity she is 35 , twice divorced and his aunt by marriage they court , clash and finally consummate to the luxurious tones of a wynton marsalis ballad in its broad outline , the story may sound familiar to readers of mario vargas llosa , for tune in tomorrow is based on his 1977 novel , aunt julia and the scriptwriter and the novel , in turn , essentially mirrored mr vargas llosa s own youthful marriage to his auntinlaw , julia urquidi it fell to the screenwriter william boyd and the director jon amiel to transport mr vargas llosa s work from the author s native peru to new orleans peter falk captured the plum role of pedro carmichael , the soap opera author and eccentricinresidence that left barbara hershey and keanu reeves , as julia and martin , to generate a magnetism strong enough , artistically speaking , to make cosmos out of chaos as the matchmaker of a screen relationship , one is always very nervous about the chemistry , said mr amiel , who is best known for the bbc series the singing detective , first seen in the united states in 1988 and i have never been so nervous as in this case because if the relationship between julia and martin fails , you have no film the tricky thing about the romance between a 21yearold man and a 36yearold woman is that it must be extremely unlikely but not inappropriate if you cast them too close in age , it seems like standard boy meets girl you must look for the mature man in the young boy and the young girl in the mature woman that search led mr amiel to a pairing almost as curious as that of martin and julia during the 1980 s , ms hershey had established herself as a character actress of surpassing range , equally capable of conveying the bullied , workingclass wife of tin men as the astringent activist of a world apart mr reeves , in contrast , had built his young career essaying the sundry burnouts of river s edge , parenthood and bill and ted s excellent adventure yet it took mr amiel only one brief interview to cast mr reeves as an articulate and wellgroomed suitor the moment he won the role was the moment he answered the director s question about his family life talking about his sister , mr reeves dropped his distracted manner and began , mr amiel recalled , to express an intensity of feeling and a warmth of feeling i had n't seen anywhere else in his work it was my sense , he went on , that there was in keanu a vulnerability , a kind of earnestness , what i would call an awkward grace that reminded me of a young jimmy stewart mr amiel needed even less convincing in the case of ms hershey whoever would play julia would need to bury the character s romantic nature beneath a coarser surface , and the director had long regarded ms hershey as that rare actress not consumed with the need on screen to be liked as if to underscore his judgment , she recently won an emmy for her performance as a murderess in the television movie killing in a small town from his background in theater , mr amiel retains a belief in the importance of rehearsal for two weeks before filming began , the cast practiced in a former church in wilmington , nc , where most of the interiors were shot and for the central couple , the discovery of character started even earlier ms hershey , for instance , developed an entire biography for julia fleeing new orleans at 16 , waiting tables in greenwich village , marrying first a politician and then a poet before returning home in divorced disgrace that none of this history appears in the film and little of it even is mentioned , did not trouble the actress hemingway once said , 'if you know something very well , you can leave it out and it 'll still be there , and if you do n't know something well you 'll probably overdescribe it , ' ms hershey said so you use details as the fuel for your instincts there s a life that begins to live through you in rehearsing a role you start speaking differently , sitting differently , having ideas in the middle of the night julia fools herself a lot she someone who thinks she s a new york sophisticate but who s actually a deep romantic trying to protect herself her gum chewing , her smoking , her dark glasses are ways to cover up her failings she has n't admitted it , but she s coming back home with her tail between her legs mr reeves s routes into the character of martin included the vargas llosa novel itself , a week of intensive work with a dialogue coach and the study of an oral history tape made by a lifelong resident of new orleans on most nights during the rehearsal period , mr reeves said , he fell asleep listening to the tape on his walkman yet for all that , when he tried out his accent on a new orleans taxi driver while exteriors were being shot there , the man asked , where you from , new hampshire \? the main element working with keanu , mr amiel said , was to give him the confidence to play a kid who was articulate and was himself emotionally and sexually quite confident i think keanu found that process quite daunting most young actors are accustomed to using only the aggressive part of their nature they 're cast as rebels i constantly encouraged keanu to work with the outgoing , almost breezy elements of his personality , to trust those elements in himself that were appropriate for martin perhaps the most significant process for both mr reeves and ms hershey was learning to dance together for an hour or more each day of rehearsal , the choreographer quinny sacks instructed the pair in the intricacies of the jitterbug gradually they progressed from stumbling neophytes to an undeniably erotic twosome it s an intimate thing , and you have to trust , mr reeves said of the dance lessons that was how we started to meet each other , being thrust together 'ok , onetwothree , onetwothree' barbara helped me a lot because of her strength , her concentration when i was having trouble , she just threw me a line to save me i do n't know what jon whispered to keanu , ms hershey said , but we just got on personally i had thought of him as a natural talent with a beautiful , arabian prince kind of face , but i did n't know much about his range and it takes a certain bravery for a modern young man to play someone so innocent , so naive martin does have a worldliness , but it comes from ingenuousness when the night arrived to shoot the jitterbug scene , which leads without break into martin and julia s first kiss , mr amiel rewarded the couple with a bottle of cristal champagne then he got his own gift the sequence was perfected in one take and for the director , that incident amounted to confirmation of two casting decisions made on instinct if not outright impulse it was clear right from the first time we read through the script , mr amiel recalled , that we had something between barbara and keanu there s a moment in a readthrough when , if the actors feel good , they 'll take their eyes off the script and play lines at each other and when barbara and keanu did , i felt i was watching the beginning of a very fine sword fight photos keanu reeves and barbara hershey as the lovers in the film , adapted from a mario vargas llosa novel \( cinecom \) \( pg 15 \) in the film , barbara hershey and keanu reeves are

as the owners' lockout entered its third week , commissioner fay vincent portrayed a bleak picture for baseball yesterday he said he saw no reason for negotiations in the labor dispute to resume because the union has indicated no willingness to negotiate and compromise we are in a very bad situation , vincent said in a telephone interview , emphasizing bad there s a major risk of serious confrontation here it looks to me like it is approaching the unavoidable no bargaining sessions have taken place since monday none are scheduled the two sides agree that the earliest they would meet would be next monday whenever talks resume , vincent might not participate , at least not immediately i have spent my life negotiating deals , said vincent , former head of columbia pictures i know how to do it when the other side does n't want to negotiate , i know you 're wasting your time there s no point in meeting without a willingness to negotiate when there s a willingness to negotiate , i will meet donald fehr , the union chief , met with a group of players in los angeles yesterday to brief them on the status of the negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement the commissioner said that he was not using the unwilling to negotiate term in a legal sense i'm using that in the terms of no willingness to compromise , he explained without compromise , obviously from very firmly held positions , there s no point in having a meeting you ca n't just sit and talk about the same things there should be a basis for progress there is at the moment , in my judgment , no reasonable likelihood of progress in any future nearterm meetings eugene orza , the union s associate general counsel , took exception to vincent s portrayal of the union s position we have been waiting to negotiate for 18 months , orza said they spent 17 of them on rotisserie baseball for lawyers finally , they make a meaningful proposal in the last 10 days we stand ready to negotiate they are the ones who closed the camps , not us he really means that what the players association is unwilling to do is memorialize three years' salary arbitration eligibility if that s what he means by not being willing to negotiate , he s right the union wants to return the eligibility level for arbitration from three years to two 136 exhibition games canceled with camps still closed , 136 exhibition games , or 33 percent of the total , have been canceled some cities in florida have raised the possibility of having minor league teams play their exhibition games in major league spring parks vincent said the possibility had been discussed but without a decision he stressed that if such games were played , they would be minor league games and not an attempt to pass them off as major league games furthermore , he said , the proceeds would go to worthy local organizations , not to club owners
washington , jan 17 george f kennan said today the economic and political problems boiling over in the soviet union have put president mikhail s gorbachev in danger , but he is not likely to be replaced in the near future because his troubles are so acute that even his rivals may not want his job mr kennan s remarks were made in an appearance before the senate foreign relations committee , which amounted actually to a conversation with sen joseph r biden , democrat of delaware , the only member who had returned from the holiday recess that ends next week during his 90minute testimony , mr kennan , the intellectual father of the policy of containment of the soviet union and for many years the dean of american government experts on the soviet union , also argued that the bush administration should offer a much more drastic reduction in conventional forces in europe than the proposals now on the table because the prospect of a warsaw pact invasion today is absolute nonsense warning on east germany he also contended that east germany was on the verge of imminent disintegration , and that this very , very delicate , dicey and dangerous situation , must be dealt with or it will throw all europe into turmoil mr kennan , who is 85 years old , is a professor emeritus at the institute for advanced study in princeton , nj , began his testimony by reading a statement in which he observed that the situation in the soviet union , is , at this moment , unstable in high degree and has created a situation of great difficulty and danger for gorbachev so great are the political burdens he has now come to bear that it is doubtful in my opinion that he could have remained in office as long as he has were it not for his high international prestige , constituting as it does an important asset for the soviet state , and for the fact that none of his senior colleagues has any program to offer as an alternative to the one he has created and carried forward , mr kennan said so heavy is the burden of troubles mr gorbachev must now carry , added mr kennan , that it is questionable whether there is any among his potential rivals who would like , at the present time , to assume this burden in his place urges deeper arms cuts in arms control , mr kennan called on the bush administration to offer much deeper conventional arms cuts in europe than those now being negotiated with the warsaw pact at the vienna talks we could take a much more forthcoming attitude in the negotiations for mutual reductions of conventional arms in europe , mr kennan said the relief that a drastic reduction of the soviet forces in this region would bring to the soviet government , and , incidentally , to ourselves as well , would be of greater significance , financially and otherwise , than any direct help we could conveivably extend mr kennan s most alarming statements were about east germany , where he said the government was on the verge of disintegration , which could create a sort of de facto unification with west germany before the rest of the continent is prepared for such a situation saying that this dangerous situation which is developing has to be stopped in some way or other , mr kennan suggested that the allied powers the united states , britain , france and the soviet union possibly establish a unified government of some sort in the city of berlin , and then perhaps expand that into an emergency grouping which could try to stablize the position in eastern germany without prejudicing the future problems of unification and of european unity photo george f kennan said mikhail s gorbachev is in danger over economic and political problems \( nyt paul hosefros \)
cleveland on the morning after signing a 19 million contract , somebody else might have awakened with a champagne hangover or fluffed the pillow and slept until noon but if you 're wondering why don mattingly deserves to be baseball s highest paid player and why all that money is n't likely to change him , consider the guest book near the weight machines and stationary bicycles in the health club of stouffer tower city plaza hotel where the yankees are lodged just as the yankees' opener last night with the indians was postponed because of rain , 10 names were in the guest book nine were unfamiliar , probably those of traveling businessman on the second line , in black ink , was mattingly if any of the other yankees had worked out , none had signed the guest book but after the announcement of his fiveyear , 193 million deal that begins in 1991 and averages 38 million a season , the yankee first baseman had dutifully perspired you 'd think he was down to his last 25 million his salary this season in the only yankee tradition that george steinbrenner has been able to maintain , mattingly joined babe ruth , joe dimaggio , mickey mantle , jim \( catfish \) hunter , reggie jackson and dave winfield as baseball s highest paid player at least until jose canseco or bo jackson gets a better deal with a 323 career average after having batted over 300 in each of his six full seasons , with 164 homers and 717 runs batted in , although he wo n't turn 29 years old until april 20 , and with a threat to test the freeagent market , mattingly had backed george steinbrenner against the vault and the principal owner opened it don mattingly , the principal owner said humbly , will attract people to come and see my ball club play for now it s still steinbrenner s ball club , pending the outcome of commissioner fay vincent s investigation of the principal owner s dealings with howard spira , an indicted extortionist and selfdescribed gambler , in obtaining information to discredit winfield s foundation too bad the babe and joe d and mickey were n't in pinstripes when george had the key to the vault then again , maybe they were better off imagine if george operated in the takeitorpumpgas era before free agency and notsofree inflation when cynics questioned the babe in 1930 for signing an 80 , 000 contract when president hoover was making 75 , 000 , he replied why not \? i had a better year than he did but that was the babe s highest salary he had to argue with ed barrow , the steelfisted general manager , for 75 , 000 in 1932 , for 52 , 000 in 1933 , and for 35 , 000 in 1934 before being traded to the boston braves when dimaggio demanded 40 , 000 for 1938 , his third season , barrow reminded him that lou gehrig was making 43 , 000 after 13 years in that case , mr barrrow , dimaggio said in those years long before agents , mr gehrig is a very underpaid ballplayer dimaggio accepted 25 , 000 that year , but by 1949 he emerged as baseball s first 100 , 000 player , thanks to toots shor , then new york s most celebrated saloon keeper dimaggio was offered 85 , 000 plus an attendance bonus , but shor advised him to go for 100 , 000 without a bonus be the first to make 100 , 000 , shor said dan topping , then a coowner with del webb , agreed to the 100 , 000 salary , but webb demurred i'm not going higher than 90 , 000 with the attendance bonus , webb told shor del , said shor , ai n't it worth another 10 , 000 to get your picture in all the papers with baseball s first 100 , 000 player \? webb s picture soon was in all the papers at a time when there were few television sets mantle , who was rewarded with only 35 , 000 for his triple crown in 1956 , finally made 100 , 000 in 1963 , but baseball salaries did n't soar until catfish hunter suddenly became a free agent because of a missed 1974 bonus payment by charles o finley , then the oakland athletics' owner hunter took steinbrenner s offer of a fiveyear , 335 million contract that included insurance policies and attorney fees then reggie jackson joined the yankees in 1977 for 266 million over five years and when dave winfield arrived for 1981 he signed a 10year 23 million deal that outsmarted steinbrenner who had not considered its compoundinterest clause steinbrenner s annoyance at winfield s contract eventually inspired the prinicipal owner s 40 , 000 payment to howard spira that has inspired the commissioner s investigation and now steinbrenner s involvement with spira has inspired the principal owner , desperate with what might be a desperate team , to open the vault for don mattingly if money is the root of most investigations , it s also the root of the last yankee tradition photo don mattingly \( the new york times \)
perversely yet predictably , the numbing sense of routine that has at times crept into the mostly mozart festival over the years has particularly affected the most familiar works of mozart himself , pieces like the serenata notturna \( k 239 \) and the symphony no 39 , which opened and closed the concerts on friday and saturday evenings at avery fisher hall perhaps to forestall just such an eventuality , the dutch conductor hans vonk , making his mostly mozart debut , gave highly inflected , occasionally angular accounts on friday , pointing accents and harmonic changes , punching staccatos in the symphony s slow movement \( which he actually took at a quick pace \) but the concertino soloists in the serenade failed to rise to the occasion with really distinguished playing and the symphony sounded a bit weary , with many minor slips in voicing and tuning all of this stood in marked contrast to the excellent playing mr vonk drew from the festival orchestra in the other two works beethoven s piano concerto no 1 , with misha dichter as soloist , and haydn s cello concerto in c , with matt haimovitz in the beethoven especially , mr vonk set a rousing tone at the outset and managed to maintain an edge of assertiveness even while yielding , but only to the degree necessary , to mr dichter the haydn , too , showed mr vonk to be an expert collaborator , far more than a mere deferential accompanist mr dichter s playing was deft for the most part , though a bit small scale in relation with the orchestra s fullblown sonority \( and this from fewer than 40 players \) the pianist set a fast pace for the finale , which at several points threatened to run out of control but amid the orchestral clamor , mr dichter proved most eloquent in quiet passages he displayed a lovely limpid touch in the pianissimo scales and arpeggios near the end of the firstmovement development and even more affecting was a series of hushed 16th notes , paired and marked espressivo , in the middle of the slow movement , to which the pianist gave a wonderfully pensive rhapsodic twist transcendent moments like this have given mr dichter s playing a new level of interest lately orchestrally , the haydn picked up where the beethoven left off , with fine though obviously less robust playing mr haimovitz , too , got off to a promising start , gracefully skating through the first movement , and even adding a few discreet ornaments , perhaps suggested by another performer or an editor but in the concerto s more searching slow movement , the cellist suddenly seemed out of his depth , merely following lines where they led and beginning to lose his intonational grip the movement cries out for at least occasional embellishment , but none came and even in the playful finale , mr haimovitz seemed unable to pull himself back to the level of the opening he is clearly a talented young man but he is not yet a mature performer , and the festival presenters do him no favors by encouraging the sort of thing that went on in friday s preconcert recital with the estimable pianist samuel sanders , mr haimovitz performed beethoven s cello sonata no 3 , a substantial work that demands close partnership yet there the cellist was , selfabsorbed with his back to the pianist , holding forth like some grizzled veteran of the concert stage mr haimovitz has much to learn from artists of the stature of mr sanders , and he would do well not to squander opportunities for meaningful partnership the two also played paganini s variations on a theme from rossini s moses in egypt since this work , originally for violin , is little more than a cute trick of virtuosic display on a single string , partnership was hardly an issue here interestingly , the program notes in effect declared the performance of the work on cello rather than violin memorable even before it had taken place now there s a cute trick photo hans vonk made his mostly mozart debut on friday night at avery fisher hall at lincoln center \( ben spiegel shuman associates \)
to the editor the article a bluechip name is not enough \( jan 14 \) contains some inaccurate information which i believe unjustly reflects on the integrity and compliance record of blunt ellis loewi the facts upon which the conclusions were based were purportedly drawn from state and national disciplinary cases in the central registration depository jointly operated by the national association of securities dealers and the north american securities administrators association in fact , the statistics involving our firm included not only the four instances in which we were involved in disciplinary proceedings since 1980 , but also every situation in which any civil action was filed against us the nasd will confirm that many firms have reported only disciplinary actions based upon a narrower definition of the word proceedings over the past year , the nasd has been standardizing this data and only in december did it contact our firm to advise us that it was not necessary to include the reporting of all civil actions the comparison of firms reporting on the broader basis with those reporting only disciplinary actions is very misleading and inaccurate none of the disciplinary actions by federal or state regulators involving our firm since 1980 involved a serious problem or a situation in which any customer funds were in jeopardy if the facts had been uniformly and accurately reported , disciplinary actions against our firm would rank among the lowest by any standard of measure thomas s franke president chief executive blunt ellis loewi milwaukee , jan 15
trenton , june 5 following are excerpts from the unanimous new jersey supreme court decision today ordering the state to insure that the poorest cities spend as much on education as wealthy suburbs chief justice robert n wilentz wrote the opinion from the opinion we find that under the present system the evidence compels but one conclusion the poorer the district and the greater its need , the less the money available , and the worse the education we hold that the act must be amended to assure funding of education in poorer urban districts at the level of propertyrich districts that such funding cannot be allowed to depend on the ability of local school districts to tax that such funding must be guaranteed and mandated by the state we reject the argument , however , that funding should not be supplied because it may be mismanaged and wasted money can make a difference if effectively used , it can provide the students with an equal educational opportunity , a chance to succeed they are entitled to that chance , constitutionally entitled they have the right to the same educational opportunity that money buys for others our decision deals not with optimum educational policy but with constitutional compliance these state constitutional claims , the underlying contentions and facts , although presenting great variety of detail , are remarkably similar to those facing us an educational funding system that depends on a combination of state and local taxes producing disparity of expenditures in the face of inverse disparity of need fourteen of the states have rejected both constitutional claims six , including new jersey , have held the state system of financing education invalid under the state education article , while rejecting or declining to reach equal protection claims four determined that the existing system violated state equal protection clauses very few of the cases have a factual record that even begins to approach that before us none has the unique attribute of this case an educational funding system specifically designed to conform to a prior court decision , having been declared constitutional by the court but now attacked as having failed to achieve the constitutional goal in short , we are the only state involved in a second round on this issue the constitutional command does not require relief every time the slightest deviation from a thorough and efficient education is found , or any time that deviation , though proven , is likely to be corrected soon nevertheless , we reject the state s claim that in these poorer urban districts a thorough and efficient education has been or will be achieved the extent of failure is so deep , its causes so embedded in the present system , as to persuade us that there is no likelihood of achieving a decent education tomorrow , in the reasonable future , or ever the state s argument is strong on paper districts can raise all the money they want , districts must raise all the money they need to provide a thorough and efficient education but for 10 years and more there has been no thorough and efficient education in these districts the factors that lead to this failure are described later , but the simplest is that these districts are just too poor to raise the money they theoretically are empowered to they can , and as we view it , constitutionally they must , be treated differently judicial deference can go just so far 4 , 029 a pupil vs 2 , 861 the impact of this disparity , solely in dollar terms , is that on the average , in 198485 , a group of richer districts with 189 , 484 students spent 40 percent more per pupil than a group of poorer districts with 355 , 612 students one provides an education worth 4 , 029 per pupil , the other , 2 , 861 for instance , a 3 , 000pupil district in a poorer area has a budget of 86 million , while a relatively wealthy suburban district with 3 , 000 pupils has a budget of 121 million the disparity is not as pronounced in the middle , which covers 339 districts and 575 , 181 students we have decided this case on the premise that the children of poorer urban districts are as capable as all others that their deficiences stem from their socioeconomic status and that through effective education and changes in that socioeconomic status , they can perform as well as others our constitutional mandate does not allow us to consign poorer children permanently to an inferior education on the theory that they cannot afford a better one or that they would not benefit from it the 28 poorer urban districts \( excluding atlantic city \) have an average per pupil expenditure in 198485 of 2 , 880 and an average equalized valuation per pupil in 198485 of 63 , 066 no sophisticated analysis can destroy the conclusion the richer districts spend more than the poorer , and their ability to do so is strongly correlated to their wealth however , the level of education offered to students in some of the poorer urban districts is tragically inadequate many opportunities offered to students in richer suburban districts are denied to them for instance , exposure to computers is necessary to acquire skills to compete in the workplace in south orangemaplewood school district , kindergarteners are introduced to computers children learn word processing in elementary school computers from other funds
jerusalem , june 25 a disagreement appeared to break out today among the leaders of israel s new government over whether soviet jewish immigrants would be settled in the occupied territories the dispute adds further confusion to housing minister ariel sharon s statement on sunday night that the migrants would not be settled in occupied land immigration officials said they had been notified of no policy change they said soviet immigrants who chose to live in the west bank or gaza strip would still be permitted to move there and would be given government money to subsidize living expenses , just as if the immigrant had chosen to live inside israel on sunday night , mr sharon , a longtime and ardent proponent of increased jewish settlement , said that due to the problems we have , immigrants would not be settled in the occupied west bank and gaza strip we will not send any jew who comes from russia to judea , samaria or to gaza because we understand the seriousness of the situation , he said , using the biblical names for the west bank ministerial divisions his statement took the nation by surprise still , mr sharon , who is chairman of the interministerial committee on immigrant absorption , has declined to elaborate because israeli ministries are essentially individual fiefs , officials from other offices would not speculate on what mr sharon s statement meant today , however , finance minister yitzhak modai , a longtime political ally of mr sharon , told reporters , if the russians make it a condition that they do n't want russian jewry to settle because of their political considerations and interests , we will abide by it because we want russian jewry here at any cost and under any circumstances but prime minister yitzhak shamir , who has spent much of the last year fending off political challenges from mr sharon and mr modai , said mr sharon s remarks were nothing new that was my opinion even before sharon s statement , he was quoted as telling the parliament s foreign affairs and defense committee on monday it s the same policy as if to underscore that , the prime minister s office disclosed that mr shamir had sent a cable to president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union weeks ago , making a similar pledge sharonshamir dispute this afternoon the prime minister told the israeli radio of course he said that nobody will be sent by us to certain territories and to certain locations but everybody in a democratic society has the right to settle wherever he wishes the apparent conflict suggests that even before mr shamir s new government has finished its first month , the wary alliance between political enemies , mr sharon and mr shamir , may already be wearing thin mr sharon has made no secret that he wants mr shamir s job as for the soviet immigrants , at the absorption ministry , jewish agency , prime minister s office , finance ministry and other agencies holding some responsibility for settling soviet jewish immigrants , officials said they had received no new directives i do n't know of any change , said ida benshitrit , an absorption ministry official if a soviet immigrant wants to go to a kibbutz , he will get money to go to a kibbutz if he wants to go to ariel , a west bank settlement , he will go to ariel he will not be stopped , she added , but we will not send him for several months , israeli officials , trying to assuage soviet and american concerns , have been saying that it is not israeli policy to direct soviet immigrants to the west bank and gaza strip and in fact only a tiny number have chosen to move there about 4 , 000 soviet jewish immigrants have moved to east jerusalem , which was part of the west bank until israel annexed it in 1967 and which israelis consider part of israel 'modest but significant' senior immigration officials explained that behind all the debate and dispute was what one called a modest but significant policy change they explained it this way before , israel made no attempt to direct immigrants to any particular place but under mr sharon s new policy , israel will actively encourage soviet immigrants to move to the negev , galilee , jerusalem , tel aviv or other points inside israel all new immigrant housing will be built inside israel none will be built in the west bank or gaza but if an immigrant chooses to move to the west bank , the government will not stand in his way and will give him the subsidies and other benefits given to those who live inside israel once an immigrant or anyone else chooses to make a permanent home in the territories , the immigrant receives government benefits that exceed any given to other israelis , with the possible exception of those who live in the most remote villages and small towns
washington , jan 29 the bush administration has decided to keep a certain distance from the revolutionary government in rumania , as well as from other new regimes in eastern europe , because of doubts that they have committed themselves to democratic freemarket reforms , administration officials said today now that the euphoria over the revolutions in czechoslovakia , rumania , bulgaria and east germany has passed , administration officials say , they are beginning to see more clearly where real change has taken place and where much work needs to be done before the united states can commit its resources toward assistance the administration feels confident that the new government in prague is probably on an irreversible path toward democratic change , and is therefore preparing a package of economic assistance for czechoslovakia it is more guarded when it comes to bulgaria , east germany and especially rumania , where many communists or recently proclaimed excommunists still hold senior positions commenting on president ion iliescu and his ruling council of national salvation , one administration policymaker observed it is kind of hard to call this an infant democracy we know they got rid of a stalinist , but we do n't know yet what will replace him it is just not clear who these guys are baker undecided on itinerary for several months , secretary of state james a baker 3d has been scheduled to travel to moscow for a meeting on feb 7 and 8 with the soviet foreign minister , eduard a shevardnadze the state department planned for mr baker to stop at least two eastern european capitals along the way after weeks of debate , it was finally decided that prague would be one of the stops but six days before mr baker s departure , it still has not been decided where else , if anywhere , he will go in eastern europe the interim government in rumania has made numerous appeals , some of them almost desperate , for mr baker to stop in bucharest but administration officials , while not ruling it out , are deeply divided about such a visit on the one hand if we do n't go there , we ca n't affect an unfinished revolution , one senior administration official said on the other hand , we do n't want to lend legitimacy to the wrong people while administration officials say they are pleased with the general liberalization program announced by rumania s council of national salvation , they fear that there is still a strong instinct among its members to return the country to a preceausescu communist model one more liberal and open , but still largely based on a single , unified party at the regular state department briefing today , the spokesman , richard a boucher , took the unusual step of warning , there should be no backsliding on the part of transitional officials as rumania moves from revolution to democracy no rush to aid rumania to date the administration has provided rumania with 775 , 000 in emergency relief and red cross assistance , but nothing beyond that because rumania already has a trade agreement with the united states , it would be easy for the administration to waive the jacksonvanik trade restrictions applied to rumania in 1988 , and thereby restore bucharest s mostfavorednation trading status administration officials say that such an action is being studied , but that it is nothing to rush into as one state department expert explained , the administration now views a jacksonvanik waiver as something to be granted not simply to a communist country that allows free emigration , but to one that adopts a more general western approach toward human rights while the new government in rumania has committed itself to free emigration and the right of every rumanian to a passport , its broader commitment to honoring human rights and free elections remains untested , officials said on the opposite end of the spectrum is czechoslovakia , which administration officials view as the ideal case all of the revolutionary changes there have been made through a constitutional process administration officials have decided to grant prague a jacksonvanik waiver as soon as a trade agreement can be negotiated such an accord is likely to be announced by mr baker on his trip mr baker is also expected to announce the reopening of the american consulate in the slovakian city of bratislava , which was closed during the 1950 s , and support for czechoslovakia s application to rejoin the international monetary fund and the world bank mr baker is likely to mention these measures in an address in prague that will detail how washington can help eastern european countries translate their revolutions into freemarket democracies in bulgaria , a 'party coup' in its budget proposal today , the bush administration asked congress for 300 million in special assistance for unnamed eastern european countries that are moving toward democracy and attempting to develop free market economies as for bulgaria , administration officials feel that what happened there was less a revolution than a party coup ousting the dictator todor zhivkov and replacing him with communists nevertheless , the new government has committed itself to change in the three areas that mean the most to washington an end to the forced assimilation of bulgaria s turkish minority , the scheduling of free elections for june , and freedom of expression for the political opposition , which was recently allowed to open its own newspaper they have come a long way , said one state department official , but they are still just a reformed communist regime the new government led by petar mladenov has told the administration it wants a jacksonvanik waiver , access to united states government lending and support from washington for bulgaria s application to become an observer in the general agreement on tariffs and trade waiting for progress at this stage we are looking at the different steps through which we might help bulgaria , but none of them are live policy options yet , the state department official said we want to be sure first that the turkish issue is resolved and that the election process is on track regarding east germany , administration officials say they will not even begin to consider the question of economic aid until democratic elections are held there and a legitimate government takes power the administration s doubts about some of the changes in eastern europe were not reflected in a speech today by president bush to the national association of religious broadcasters saying that religious faith was one of the factors that moved the people of eastern europe to fight for democracy , he spoke of the christmas carols heard for the first time in four decades in czechoslovakia and rumania after communist leaders there were ousted mr bush praised the heroism of eastern europeans who showed that you ca n't lock people behind walls forever when moral conviction uplifts their hearts
to say that terry bradshaw talks with his hands is not to suggest that the cbs commentator does n't have a clear , strong and sometimes booming voice or that he is not articulate to the point of occasional eloquence indeed , in bradshaw s case , his sweeping , expansive gestures may not even be unconscious efforts to provide visual shape or punctuation to his patter , but rather a sign of reflexive muscle memory in which the big hands seem forever agrope , searching for something familiar to grasp and hold on to , just long enough to fling into some distant end zone that at least seemed to be the case last week when bradshaw , the former pittsburgh steeler quarterback , appeared as a sort of walking , talking , handwaving relic among the static memorabilia at the official sendoff of the super bowl silver anniversary tour the tour is a romannumeralladen multimedia exhibition that will visit xii cities before reaching tampa , fla , the site of super bowl xxv in january bradshaw , who played xiv seasons and appeared in iv super bowls before his retirement in mcmlxxxiv , was an obvious choice to help open the exhibition the show includes jerseys of super bowl stars , super bowl game balls , tickets and coins from the pregame flips , the vince lombardi super bowl trophy , video highlights from each super bowl game , a complete collection of the grenadesize super bowl rings and enough copies of the new 50 simon schuster book , the super bowl , to stock a small library even so , for bradshaw , who brought along one of his no 12 super bowl jerseys , the visit to the exhibit at the citicorp center in new york was an unaccustomed trip down lockerroom lane if you walked into my house in fort worth , he said , you would n't know i ever played football there are no footballs , no football pictures , no football souvenirs or memorabilia or anything bradshaw wears none of his four super bowl rings \( ix , x , xiii and xiv \) he said that he keeps two in a bank vault in shreveport , la , and that he gave one to his father , bill , who still has it , and one to his brother , gary , who lost it as for nostalgia , talking over the old days and reliving the old glories , bradshaw suggests that was for those who sat in the stands if you 've done it , he said , extending his arm through a long arc , you do n't have to talk about it drawing
each year the outdoor sculpture season seems to have more to say about the art and life of new york city with some artists seeking exposure , others trying to define for themselves the meanings of public art , still others trying to leave their stamp on a street or square , and with all the artists now trying to wrestle with urban dramas for which it seems no author or director exists , the outdoor sculpture season has become a way of gauging not only the state of the art world but also the state of the city no one familiar with the pressing conflicts in new york should be surprised that a number of the sculptures are about political and social issues there are sculptures about vandalism , the holocaust , the fragility of nature and the bill of rights gran fury , the artists' collective associated with actup , the aids protest group , has installed a series of street signs around a small soho park asking hard questions about the politics of homelessness and aids karen finley , the blunt , freewheeling performance artist who has become a regular in the news because the national endowment for the arts recently decided not to award her a recommended grant , has a poem in bronze on the lower east side about social injustice , in particular , the fate of the people she defines as society s black sheep most of the strong new talents this season are at the snug harbor cultural center on staten island , where olivia georgia , its visual arts director , has put together the season s best exhibition if there is one artistic influence behind it , it is that of giuseppe penone , an italian artist not in the exhibition , whose gentle , refined yet startling meditations on nature were shown at the marian goodman gallery in new york this season jeff spaulding s walk back is a magical installation in which small pine branches rising out of a horizontal limb suggest the vertebrae of a dinosaur , and two small pine trees attached stumptostump hang from a tall limb like a yoyo or a plumb line shaped and wielded by nature the biggest surprise of this outdoor season is the reemergence of the human figure no one walking or driving along the avenue of the americas at 52d street during the last few months could have failed to notice jim dine s three huge , fragmented , classically inspired female figures raymond mason s nearby , more discreetly placed crowd , with its throngs of people coming and going with purpose and panic , is a welcome addition to midtown the white bronze female nude by manuel neri adds a delicate and ghostly touch to the raw field of sculptures , many of them big , abstract and steel , at the socrates sculpture park , on the east river in queens one of the large questions this season is the future of this park , whose fiveyear lease with the new york city department of ports and trade expires in october the sculptor mark di suvero , who dreamed up the park and , with his assistants , keeps it going , is hoping for a renewal with luck , he will get it the importance of the park cannot begin to be measured by its helterskelter , always uneven exhibitions there is no other site in new york city that has a comparable informality , openness and love of the entire process of conceiving , making and installing sculpture this is a sculpture park , but it is also a sculpture yard , or a sculpture workshop , in which artists can work in challenging conditions and test themselves on a grand scale there is no place else in new york where you can encounter sculptures that seem to exist on their own and carry on relationships with one another that are independent of anyone in their presence the park is irreplaceable karen finley makes a plea for those whom society treats as all too replaceable at first avenue between first and houston streets , in a busy intersection in the part of manhattan that helped give the united states its reputation as a melting pot , ms finley has installed \( through october \) the black sheep , a poem she has used in a number of her performances cast in a slab of bronze laid over a rough , blackish , lavalike concrete block , it is very much a finley performance , shifting back and forth between resignation and determination , vulnerability and defiance , confusion and accusation the poem is a hymn to sexual preference and cultural difference and to those who have suffered for their preference or difference it lumps together and idealizes the loners and outcasts of society , suggesting that they are prophetic and even angelic , in part because of the knowledge and suffering that comes with their isolation it makes a plea for healing and for the kind of community in which that isolation will mercifully end the question of whether the prophetic , angelic power of the victims will end with the unconditional love the artist calls for is not answered the meaning and even the desirability of unconditional love is not explored there is real ambivalence in ms finley s work between the child s need for unqualified acceptance and the artist s insistence upon the value of being an outsider to sense the force of this ambivalence is to understand better the passion of ms finley s performances and why she has become a lightning rod in the storm over government financing of provocative work gran fury lieut joseph petrosino park kenmare and lafayette

bremen , west germany , feb 27 last fall , the first waves of east german refugees were greeted with tears and champagne now they are increasingly met with resentment and disdain nowhere is that more evident than in bremen , which recently became the first city in west germany to shut its doors to the east german immigrants who have continued flooding into west germany despite the political changes in their land the reason , mayor klaus wedemeier declared , was that we simply had no more room with 7 , 000 of its own residents waiting for housing and 145 percent unemployed , he said , the city simply could not cope with any more east germans something had to be done' five gymnasiums had already been converted to emergency barracks for the east germans and when city officials went to the suburb of vegesack this month to take over yet another gym , they found that the local sports club had occupied the building to keep them out our action was not aimed at the east germans , said heinz kording , president of the club but something had to happen we had to give a signal to the government that something had to be done to stop this the local government did on feb 20 , the city council , known as the senate , declared a freeze on accepting resettlers if any east germans were sent over , the mayor said , they would go homeless or be shipped back under existing procedures , arriving east germans first go to a federal processing center and are then distributed among states bremen , despite a population of just 600 , 000 , shares with hamburg the distinction of ranking as a separate state , the legacy of their history as independent hanseatic cities the formula for distributing resettlers is based on the population of the 11 west german states bremen , with about 1 percent of the west german population , is expected to take 1 percent of all new arrivals , though in fact it accepted 17 percent , or about 7 , 700 east germans so far , and a somewhat larger number of germans from eastern europe euphoria turns to resentment by comparison , north rhinewestphalia , the largest state , took 170 , 000 east german resettlers last year and 5 , 400 so far this year hamburg , the other citystate , has accepted about 10 , 000 east germans only two months ago , when the euphoria over the reunion of the two germanys was still ablaze , bremen would have been denounced as unpatriotic and inhumane for closing its doors but in the sober mood that has settled over the land in the last two months , bremen echoed a growing resentment across west germany last fall , when the first waves of east germans arrived through hungary or czechoslovakia , they were escaping from tangible repression and breaching a barrier that had cooped them up for 40 years now , with the gates wide open and changes imminent , they are increasingly perceived to be fleeing only for the money , and in the process to be undermining the east german economy and straining west german social services that , in turn , has made the exodus the dominant argument for rapid reunification many resettlers remain jobless rare is the west german city that has not felt the weight of the flood of immigrants , whether from east germany or eastern europe youth hostels , gyms , even prisons and ships in the hamburg harbor , have been converted into emergency housing , and still there is not enough hamburg took a new step today when it commandeered several vacant apartments for the resettlers last year , 344 , 000 east germans crossed into west germany , along with 377 , 000 ethnic germans from eastern europe and 121 , 000 asylum seekers from the third world as of today , 114 , 635 east germans had arrived this year , at a rate that has steadily crept up from an average of about 1 , 800 per day in january to 2 , 250 per day this month about 60 , 000 other resettlers have arrived from elsewhere in europe so far this year a large number are unemployed , and no end to the flow is in sight the german institute for economic research predicted this week that the rate will begin decreasing in 1991 , and that 18 million more east germans will move west in the next decade low regard for latest arrivals bremen has not been alone in its resistance hamburg has cut back the numbers of resettlers it accepts to a trickle in the neighboring state of north rhinewestphalia , 64 communities have declared themselves saturated , and the premier of the state of lower saxony , ernst albrecht , has called for a halt to resettlers after the march 18 elections in east germany unless they have housing and a job oskar lafontaine , the premier of saarland state and the likely challenger to chancellor helmut kohl from the social democratic party in december s election , has campaigned strongly on a platform of ending all special treatment for east german resettlers added to such arguments is a growing sense that those east germans who are fleeing now are increasingly the dregs of their society criminals , alcoholics , prostitutes , divorced men fleeing alimony , shirkers outside the sports club in the suburb of blumenthal , two of whose gyms have been taken over for the resettlers , joachim mitera , a customs officer and parttime yoga teacher , sounded an increasingly common plaint 'if it s full , it s full'
it took only a brief stint as a juror in manhattan to convince andy wolk that when it came to criminal justice in new york , reality is the best story of all but as mr wolk or any other writer can attest , reality is never easy to simulate , particularly the reality of a system under siege , and particularly in a madefortv drama first , you have to strive to capture the ambiguities , the chaos , the tensions , the pressures and the pathos of a process unimaginable to those who are n't in the middle of it to do that , you need someone who knows it intimately , to lead you through the stygian world of police stations , holding pens and arraignment rooms , to help you sidestep oversimplification , sensationalism or sentimentality then you need someone to finance the project and present the results , however raw or disturbing they may be mr wolk found his backer in home box office , which pumped 23 million into the project he found a stage in pittsburgh , which opened up its courtrooms , police stations and prisons for him and allowed him to foul them all up temporarily so as to better resemble brooklyn and he found his virgil in his brother peter , who learned the legal terrain during a decade as a lawyer in brooklyn at bedfordstuyvesant legal services and the legal aid society this saturday evening at 9 , hbo will offer criminal justice , a 90minute drama starring forest whitaker , anthony lapaglia , jennifer grey and rosie perez the script , produced by michael apted and robert o'connor , was written by andy wolk and marks his film directorial debut it tells the story of a 19yearold prostitute named denise moore \( ms perez \) who is brutally robbed as she leaves a brooklyn crack den in addition to stealing her night s earnings , her assailant leaves a marla hansonlike slash across her cheek from a pile of mug shots and a lineup , denise identifies her attacker as jesse williams \( mr whitaker \) , an unemployed man in his early 20 s who lives only a couple of blocks from the crime scene in east new york he is quickly arrested , and the plot proceeds to follow jesse through every stage of his prosecution , from the time a detective throws him down on a desk and sarcastically snarls his miranda rights at him , through his incarceration , to the resolution of the case six months later it is a profane and ugly trip from which many of the usual thematic signposts , like good and evil , guilt and innocence , are conspicuously absent i wanted to create a story where you would go back and forth , where your preconceptions would be challenged , andy wolk said recently in a upper west side coffee house hollywood has a perception that people want things romanticized , that they want the witness getting up there and saying , 'i did it ! ' but there s nothing romantic about this this is tough and hard and gritty this is the way things are and that , mr wolk said , is what hbo wanted michael apted told us there is one word we should keep in mind verisimilitude , he said we repeated the term so often that it came to be known around the set simply as 'the v word' and la law this is n't indeed , criminal justice takes the process of deglitzing the bigcity practice of law , already begun by abc s equal justice , one step further mr wolk , 39 , comes from a miniline of lawyers his father , sidney , was a lawyer and regional inspector for the internal revenue service his brother , four years his junior and a graduate of northeastern university law school , is now serving as law secretary to judge leonard rienzi of the state supreme court in brooklyn mealtime discussions in the wolk home in west orange , nj , often involved legal themes thanksgiving dinners and seders were sometimes followed by mock crossexaminations or jury selections like many new yorkers , andy wolk instinctively resisted jury duty until , in october 1986 , he ran out of acceptable excuses he ended up sitting on a crackrelated murder case from harlem , one requiring two weeks of testimony and three days of deliberations the defendant was acquitted , and mr wolk vowed to recreate the world he had just experienced , if only from afar i wanted to put the viewer in the position of the jurors , to let the deliberations happen in people s living rooms , he said from the outset , he tried to avoid some idealized portrayal , the kind of process depicted in sidney lumet s 1957 film 12 angry men and in fact , what mr wolk has captured is more henry ford than henry fonda the bewildering world jesse and denise enter is one in which everybody involved judges , defense lawyers , prosecutors are drowning the object in that world is not to dispense justice but to dispose of cases defendants do n't so much defend themselves as hedge their bets , trading away the only thing they have their ability to tie up the system even longer for a better break there may still be lip service to old ideals the words of the 17thcentury english jurist sir edward coke , the welfare of the people is the supreme law , are blazoned on the fictitious courtroom wall
a doorman raced up the narrow back stairs of the happy land social club , a light wave of smoke trailing him fire ! fire ! he shouted as he burst onto the dance floor , but the scores of revelers hesitated in fear the eyewitness account of how so many perished when the illegal club was set ablaze early sunday was given yesterday in an interview by felipe figueroa , one of two people who were on the club s crowded second floor and survived despite the smoke , mr figueroa , who calls himself phillip , said he managed to rush down a second staircase and find his way to safety , essentially unharmed lieut james malvey , a principal detective on the case , said he and others who questioned mr figueroa believed his story mr figueroa s presence was also corroborated by a friend of his , ruben valladares , who was the club s disk jockey and the only other survivor , the detectives said mr valladares remains in critical but stable condition at jacobi hospital in the bronx with burns over about 40 percent of his body doctors have given him slightly better than an even chance of survival 'my mind ca n't stop' mr figueroa , a parttime disk jockey who was dropping in at the club to help mr valladares , described his own , less visible wounds i ca n't sleep here anymore , he said , slapping the boiler outside his cramped , 60aweek room in the basement of a south bronx tenement the boiler s muffled roar , he said , reminds him too much of the screams he heard my mind ca n't stop , he said all the screams , all the noise , and the moment when my friend came out of there screaming i ca n't forget that fire department officials estimate that 68 of the club s 87 victims were trapped and asphyxiated on the crowded second floor of happy land the police and fire officials believe that four , and possibly six , people on the ground floor of the club also escaped none of the survivors have explained in detail how so many were killed mr figueroa said he came to new york in may 1986 from the honduran coastal city of trujillo he has worked mostly as a 200aweek delivery man for a washington heights furniture company , saving what he can for the records and sound equipment that he hopes will allow him to earn a living as a disk jockey back home for more than a year before the fire , he said , he spun records at happy land or stopped by the club to help his friend mr valladares , who grew up in the same cristales neighborhood of trujillo scattered around his tiny apartment , old fliers recalled parties he entertained at the happy land and other clubs and dance halls in the bronx last saturday night he stopped by happy land , on southern boulevard just off east tremont avenue , with thoughts only of a good time , he said around midnight he was ushered in free of charge , as usual , but stayed only a short while before heading for another club in the east tremont section mr figueroa said he returned to happy land at about 2 am on sunday he remembered passing the new coatcheck woman , lydia feliciano she was talking to a man who mr figueroa now believes was julio gonzalez , the unemployed cuban immigrant who the police say set the fire in a fit of jealousy the atmosphere on the second floor was pretty good , mr figueroa said , but some people were already starting to leave mr valladares reached for a favorite jamaican reggae song , young lover , by coco tea the floor got so full that a lot of people could n't dance , he said then you heard it coming up the stairs 'people went crazy' the shouts were those of one of the club s two doormen the other doorman , mr figueroa said , was on the dance floor with a girlfriend he was yelling , 'fire ! fire ! , mr figueroa said , his voice rising he came onto the floor and yelled , 'fire ! fire ! ' right away , people went crazy some ran this way and that way some people did n't make a big deal out of it i could see a little smoke coming upstairs the doorman waded onto the dance floor , he said , apparently sifting the crowd for his own girlfriend he was yelling in english , mr figueroa said , so i started yelling , 'fuego ! fuego ! ' ruben turned off the music and turned on the lights and yelled 'fuego ! ' into the microphone people were already desperate everybody was running around i think that since so many came from families , they were all looking for their relatives oxygen supply at risk it might already have been too late a fire department spokesman , efrain padilla , said that under the club s low ceiling so low that the 5foot6inch mr figueroa , standing flatfooted , could touch the mirrored globe revolving above the dance floor the fire could have sucked out all oxygen in minutes a spokeswoman for the medical examiner s office , ellen borakove , said the secondfloor victims were believed to have died of smoke inhalation but mr padilla said the lack of oxygen could have caused them to lose consciousness in seconds i looked downstairs , and all you could see was smoke , mr figueroa said of his vantage point at the disk jockey s booth , just next to an alternate staircase at the front of the club he rushed down the steep stairs anyway 'down , let s go ! ' everyone saw me go for it , he said i yelled , 'down , let s go ! ' there were a lot of people around those stairs , but nobody followed me i could hear all the cries , lots of people saying , 'mama ! ' i heard something explode , like a light downstairs , mr figueroa said , he could barely see by mistake , he burst into a storage room filled with coats but knowing the club well , he quickly found the northern exit door , through which elena colon , the wife of the club owner , ms feliciano and at least two young patrons had already scurried mr figueroa hit the crash bar on the door and suddenly found himself on the street perhaps a minute later , mr valladares stumbled through the other door , wrapped in flames he let out some screams that i remember too much , mr figueroa said i did n't even know who he was he was so burned , all deformed but he wears a lot of chains , and i recognized him by the chainsi ripped off his shirt , which was still on fire his whole body was shaking 'i could n't let go' in what seemed like seconds , mr figueroa said , his friend was gone in an ambulance i could n't let go of his clothing , he said when i got to the house of his sister , to tell her , i was still holding it mr figueroa ran a thumb and forefinger along the border of a prized snapshot taken during a party at the sister s house last summer it shows mr figueroa on one knee , toasting the camera , with mr valladares flashing a broad smile over his shoulder he s never going to have that smile again , mr figueroa said photo all the screams , all the noise , remembered phillip figueroa , one of the survivors of the happy land fire , as he told how hesitation and fear cost 87 revelers their lives \( nyt alan zale \) \( pg b1 \) felipe figueroa , right , posed for a snapshot with his friend ruben valladares at a party last summer mr valladares , who was the disk jockey the night of the fire at the happy land social club , remains in critical condition with burns over 40 percent of his body \( pg b3 \)
bucharest , romania , march 10 romania s interim parliament has had one thing in common with the united states congress in recent days delays it had set itself the task of voting on two new laws instead , it debated politely , then postponed the vote until the following week otherwise , the 253member provisional council of national unity bore scant resemblance to the american legislative branch it has representatives of 37 parties instead of two the parliament is trying to address the most pressing problems of a country that was devastated by the repressive communist dictatorship overthrown in december a new electoral law and a measure governing joint ventures now face a vote on tuesday it is halftime in the politics of romania 10 weeks until national elections are held on may 20 , and 11 weeks since a popular uprising ousted president nicolae ceausescu coalition seems likely the only clear prospect for the elections , the first free voting here since 1937 , is that it could produce a coalition government more than 60 parties have registered to run candidates , a reflection , many romanians say , of the chaos and distrust that have prevailed since the overthrow of mr ceausescu only three of the parties appear to have significant strength the national liberal party , the national peasants party and the national salvation front the front , formed on dec 22 to replace the ceausescu government , consists of former communists who opposed the dictator , as well as intellectuals and professionals it has received relatively strong support from factory workers and miners , who lost their political home when the communist party dissolved but it is disdained by young people , including students who were in the forefront of the uprising conversations with citizens in the capital suggest that the national liberal party enjoys the most support among the opposition that is , the parties opposed to the national salvation front once a bankers' party the liberals , a traditional party that was dominated by bankers and businessmen before the war , says it has 200 , 000 members nationwide , although it was only revived in january after more than four decades its articulate leader , radu campeanu , has managed to develop a working relationship with ion iliescu , the president of the provisional government , who was an upandcoming communist party functionary when president ceausescu ousted him in 1972 the dialogue between the two men has given romanian political observers the idea that the may elections could result in a coalition , with mr iliescu as president and mr campeanu as prime minister heading a government in which the national salvation front and other parties would play prominent roles there is talk in bucharest that petre roman , the prime minister in the interim government and a protege of mr iliescu , would take another cabinet post the campaign will be tough , said ion sandulescu , the chief of the liberals' bucharest organization he noted that a liberal party office in the northern city of bistrita had been set afire one night recently and that another party office , in the southern town of tandarei , had been vandalized during the day on wednesday 'goodneighborly' relations mr sandulescu , at 68 a veteran of romania s early political struggles after the war , said of mr iliescu we do n't agree with the way he is leading the country but we do n't think of change until the elections , which could amplify chaos and uncertainty we are trying to maintain goodneighborly relations with him he listens to us a government coalition of the liberals and the national salvation front is out of the question , mr sandulescu asserted but he said he could envision mr iliescu serving as an independent president and mr campeanu running the government as prime minister the people who win the elections will not be too happy , mr sandulescu cautioned the problems of romania are such that the next government will fall apart in a year virtually untouched by the political debate is the future of the second and third tiers of the securitate , the secret police apparatus used to stifle dissent under mr ceausescu mircea raceanu , a diplomat who was condemned to death for treason by the ceausescu government last year and freed on dec 23 , estimated that 85 percent of the foreign ministry s staff worked for the securitate in 1989 he said that none of them had been removed it is the underground army , he said

reports that the federal cleanup of the savings and loan disaster will result in connecticut residents paying 1 , 237 a person more to rescue the failed thrifts than they will receive in bailout benefits has angered state lawmakers and banking officials , and last week several were looking for ways to offset the situation we seem to be getting a double whammy , said the state banking commissioner , howard b brown federal regulators have already put severe restrictions on stillsolvent connecticut institutions , he said , resulting in a credit crunch , and now the federal bailout program will require connecticut residents to rescue savings and loans in other states there must be a more equitable manner of dealing with this , mr brown said he said he had already contacted federal officials about the situation and planned to talk with the governor s staff to determine what steps the state could take to offset it united states senators joseph i lieberman , democrat of new haven , and christopher j dodd , democrat of east haddam , said they would press for investigations of the savings and loan industry the only way to ameliorate the anger and frustration people in states like connecticut are feeling , said mr dodd , is to go after hammer and tongs the people who are responsible both senators said they might seek to use the fact that connecticut will be a big loser under the bailout program as leverage in getting other federal aid for connecticut , for housing or transportation or a program to save defense jobs after this , i think they owe us a big one , mr lieberman said there s the matter of equity here , he continued there s a transfer of money going on here that is enormous , and one that we cannot afford , because our own economy is vulnerable right now all taxpayers will pay the same amount under the government s 203 billion bailout of the savings and loan industry , but many economists and politicians have concluded that it will result in a significant transfer of wealth from the northeast and middle west to texas and other states in the southwest , where the savings and loan failures are concentrated this shift , they say , will result in a stronger economy in the southwest in the years ahead and a weaker economy for most other states but one financial expert said connecticut should not complain too loudly , because the financial troubles being faced by the state s own savings institutions could result in a number of bailouts here we may end up very happy there is this kind of a rule on the books , said lewis mandell , a professor of finance at the university of connecticut who is a consultant for the united states comptroller of the currency and is writing an article for grolier s encyclopedia on the savings and loan problems all the bailouts are n't over yet , and connecticut may be in for its share he noted that the statechartered savings bank of brooklyn is in serious trouble , and the community federal savings bank of bridgeport is on the list of vulnerable institutions compiled by the resolution trust corporation , the federal agency that is trying to develop plans for troubled savings and loans the savings and loan failures were stupid and are going to be very costly , dr mandell said but what is the alternative \? if the federal government does not bail out the banks , the depositors lose their savings , he said , and the real estate speculators would be no worse off than they are now the money to keep the banks solvent will come out of income taxes , and because connecticut residents earn more , they will pay more also , because so few banks have failed in connecticut one federally chartered bank closed last november in meriden but reopened within a week after it was purchased by another bank few of the dollars paid into the bailout fund will flow back to connecticut loss of 1 , 237 a person an analysis of the plan to save ailing savings and loans around the country , compiled by prof edward w hill of cleveland state university , showed that the net cost per person in connecticut will be 1 , 237 in only three other states and the district of columbia , will the cost exceed 1 , 000 a person in all , 37 states will lose money under the bailout plan , and 13 , most of them in the southwest , will gain the biggest winner will be texas , where the net cash inflow will be 4 , 775 per person , according to professor hill s analysis he estimated a total bailout cost of 203 billion , but dr mandell said it could approach 300 billion , and some say it could go higher than that the problem is particularly troubling , mr brown said , because while federal regulators are seeking massive amounts of money from connecticut s economy to pay for the bailout , they are taking steps that will slow the state s economy down mr brown said federal examiners left the failed savings and loans of texas and came to connecticut earlier this year and began imposing strict limits on bad loans even statechartered savings institutions have to comply with some federal regulations , including requirements about reserves an institution must put some of its surplus or capital into a reserve to cover loans that are not being paid on time and might go into default mr brown said that before this year , federal regulators required 35 or 40 percent in reserves , but they have boosted that to about 66 percent fresh in the minds
at a crowded news conference in manhattan last november , bill cosby announced that he was lending his support to the raynor indycar team to help willy ribbs realize his dream of driving in the indianapolis 500 the gathering set off a media feeding frenzy for two reasons \( besides the buffet breakfast being served \) the newly renamed raynorcosby racing team had one of america s most popular entertainers behind it , and ribbs would become the first black driver to compete at indy but when the indy 500 starts next sunday , ribbs wo n't be among the 33 drivers even with the extensive publicity the team could guarantee any sponsor , none have yet been found trouble with adapters without sponsorship , said ray neisewander 3d , the team s general manager , raynorcosby could not afford a 1990 lola , which it believed was essential to make a safe and competitive run at indy new rules , meant to reduce speeds , require indy cars built before 1990 to use an aerodynamic adapter kit several drivers have crashed at indy in cars modified this way , and the kits have been criticized as unsafe we felt that the cars were unstable , neisewander said recently experience has proven us absolutely correct instead , he said , the team plans to run the 11 roadcourse events on this year s indycar schedule , where the lower speeds and ribbs s roadracing talent will give the team a better chance their next race will be at detroit on june 17 in his indycar debut at long beach , calif , april 22 , ribbs drove a steady , uneventful race and finished 20th after the car s suspension broke timing hurt search about the time that cosby joined the team , raynor decided to switch marketing companies in its search for a sponsor it chose the championship group , an atlanta company that has long represented ribbs ardy arani , the company president , said last week that the announcement with cosby had come too late in the corporate budgeting cycle to find a sponsor for 1990 i have never been involved in a program like this one where we have started in february and have implemented a program by april , arani said the raynorcosby program requires plenty of budgeting lead time , arani said , because it will cost more than the typical sevenfigure indycar sponsorship cosby s main support for the team more than a financial contribution is an offer to do a 30second television commercial for whomever sponsors his driver and that , arani said , requires extra money to produce the commercial and buy air time for it so now you 're talking about a 10 million program , he said , using an approximate figure and at this date , you are not going to find that kind of money for 1990 retailer was approached from november 1988 to november 1989 , raynor paid a retainer to henry rischitelli , the director of motorsports for international management group rischitelli , who was representing raynor when derek daly was its driver and before cosby and ribbs arrived , was unable to find a sponsor rischitelli said that img had tried to get target , a retail chain , to sponsor raynor , but that target eventually refused because the company believed the team was not competitive enough and its asking price was too high raynor has never won an indycar race , and since 1987 , its best finish is a third place as for cosby s addition to the raynor team , rischitelli said target was n't swayed , because it thought that the entertainer had been used in too many commercials and that he simply was n't right for them target has since entered indycar racing as a sponsor of chip ganassi s team the difference , rischitelli said , was that ganassi offered target a sponsorship program that would eventually allow it to pass on much of the cost to manufacturers who sell their goods in its stores and want to be a part of the racing sponsorship
east berlin , feb 3 a single building , a solid fivestory structure from the days of the last kaiser , houses more political groupings today than this capital has known since hitler came to power 57 years ago a modest handwritten cardboard sign at the entrance names it the house of democracy it is the headquarters for most of the new parties and movements that will take part in elections on march 18 , striving to seal the demise of the communists , who ruled east germany without opposition until last fall s peaceful popular rising until last month , the house was the headquarters of the communist party for the center of east berlin the party vacated the building in response to opposition demands for equality of chances in the voting for east germany s first freely elected parliament now , democratic reawakening , which describes itself as a conservative party , shares the house at 165 friedrichstrasse with the initiative for peace and human rights , whose leaders do not bridle at the label of anarchists \( although they say they would n't choose it for themselves \) and the united left , which puts itself left of the communists green party and green league the green party keeps house next to the green league , which refuses to become a party , and the citizens movement democracy now , which fuses christian and socialist ideas another group , the independent association of women , unites women of many political tendencies who have put their differenes temporarily aside to unite for the defense of women s rights a day inside shows the joys and growing pains of an infant democracy and its parents the corridors swarm with people , mainly young , who want to join the movement , or at least pick up some of their mimeographed literature or ask them to send speakers to speak about the ideas they represent any door a visitor opens leads to men and women in deep discussion sometimes the subject is organization , because all the parties and movements are still in gestation sometimes the conversation cuts across party lines , as representatives of different groups talk about election coalitions but all doors appear to be open , and none seems to lead to the smokefilled rooms of older democracies two parties stand aside only two of the new movements stand aside from this marketplace of the new politics at separate headquarters are the social democrats , who in the consensus of the other parties have received so much assistance from their west german patrons that they feel sure they will emerge as the strongest party , and the new forum , which was the most prominent organization in bringing about the downfall of the communists but plans not to present candidates despite the multiplicity of views , most of the organizations in 165 friedrichstrasse are on speaking terms they agree on one issue none seem to want to speak to democratic reawakening , which is said to be receiving almost as much help from the west german christian democrats as the social democrats get from their western partners they have climbed on kohl s lap and got their candy for it , says vera wollenberger , a leader of the green party , speaking of the group s links to chancellor helmut kohl s party 'they are swallowing us' throughout the building , a feeling prevails that the social democrats and democratic reawakening , are not only like their west german counterparts but also the principal mechanisms for rapid reunification of the two states leaders speaking for the other groups unanimously expressed concern over what they consider the greatly quickening pace toward formation of a single germany , entirely on west german terms they are swallowing us , is a phrase that sooner or later turns up in conversations throughout the day s chats in offices and corridors it may be going too fast , conceded erhard neubert , a theologian , sociologist and former evangelical pastor , who is deputy chairman of democratic reawakening unity will come de facto by public pressure mr neubert said he and others had hopes before the public pressure grew for reunification that the first three parliamentary votings would be contested by a coalition of all noncommunist forces against the ruling party he said such a parliament would have been best able to deal with issues specific to a country that developed separately from the other germany interest from west germany it has become impossible because of the massive west german intervention , he said now we have to orient ourselves along the west german political spectrum our own problems will receive short shrift we cannot put the brakes on this process , but we must try to steer and shape it above all , mr neubert said , the first noncommunist east german government must control the influx of west german capital and see to it that the bulk goes to smaller enterprises and leads to the creation of a middle class in this largely egalitarian country but mr neubert said that not only was his party accepting material help from its west german sympathizers as other groups do also in varying degrees but also the services of 15 to 20 west germans who cross daily we do n't have organizational experience to build a party structure , he said but we try to do all we can ourselves of course , somebody from the east could do what i do , said sven leistikow , a west berlin student volunteer but somehow they are not here
washington , march 2 the kgb had two sources in the state department during the 1970 s who supplied details of american armscontrol strategies and other policies , a former kgb officer who has lived secretly in the united states since 1980 alleged today the defector , victor i sheymov , who spent a decade in hiding , spoke at a news conference during which he asserted among other claims that soviet spies had thoroughly penetrated the french government , failed to coopt many israelis and hatched a plot that culminated in the 1981 attempt to kill pope john paul ii none of the claims by mr sheymov , who said he was seeking to publish a book about his experiences , could be independently verified the central intelligence agency declined to comment on his statements about the pope and the state department in the past , however , american intelligence officials have cast doubt on claims of hard evidence that the soviet union engineered the attempt on the pope s life mr sheymov s assertions about the assassination plot were reported today in the washington post us acknowledges kgb role bush adminstration officials acknowledged today that mr sheymov had worked in several kgb positions and defected to the united states in may 1980 mr sheymov , who reached the rank of kgb major before he defected to the united states in may 1980 , said today that he had decided to abandon his secret identity in part to educate the public about the soviet spy services and about communism for the last 10 years , he said , he has lived under an assumed name in the united states , working at times as a consultant to the united states government on matters he did not disclose mr sheymov , 43 years old , said he joined the kgb in 1971 in a vast division that intercepted radio and telephone communications and was probably the most secret part of the agency he moved in 1974 to the foreign intelligence division to handle messages between headquarters and agents , and in 1976 to an important job that involved protecting the kgb against hostile wiretaps and codebreakers 'get physically close' to pope he said that he first seriously considered defecting in 1979 when , on a visit to poland , he saw a message from the former head of the kgb , yuri v andropov , demanding information on how to get physically close to john paul ii , who had just been named pope in the kgb slang , it was clearly understood that when you say physically close , there was only one reason to get close , he said , to assassinate him words like murder or assassinations are never used they have substituted gentler terms he said he believes it is absolutely clear that the soviet union was responsible for the attempt on the pope s life , but that he could not bolster his belief with further facts pope john paul ii was shot in 1981 by a turkish man who implicated bulgaria , then a soviet client state , in a plot on the pope s life three bulgarian government officials were charged , but the charges were dismissed for lack of proof , an italian term that means that evidence of wrongdoing exists but is contradicted by other evidence two state department sources mr sheymov also said today that during his time at the kgb , the spy service maintained two sources in the state department who supplied huge state department documents , outlines of positions on arms control and other matters he did not describe them further today the department refused to comment on mr sheymov s assertion at his news conference , mr sheymov frequently refused to answer questions , saying they involved intelligence matters too sensitive to discuss in public some of his statements , nevertheless , seem certain to make headlines elsewhere in the west he said that kgb illegals russian agents with double identities were well placed in the french government , in quite comfortable positions emigre plan fails mr sheymov also said that the kgb once hoped to make israel its platform for middle east espionage by recruiting soviet jewish emigres to work undercover the results were disappointing , he said , because emigres uniformly refused to work for the soviets once they reached israel the account in the washington post said that mr sheymov , his wife and child were spirited from their moscow home in 1981 , leaving all their personal effects behind asked today how he escaped the soviet union , he chuckled and replied , very carefully photo victor i sheymov , a former soviet agent who defected , asserted yesterday that soviet spies had penetrated the american and french governments \( the new york times jose r lopez \)
rrthis is the prime month for those who fish in the hudson river for striped bass , the adult populations of which are making their annual spawning runs for several years , production of stripers in the hudson has been booming , a situation that this spring has resulted in the river s shad fishermen complaining that they are spending too much time releasing bass from their nets the stripers cannot be sold because their flesh contains concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl \( pcb \) above the level deemed fit for human consumption by the food and drug administration the shad and their young , which spend a relatively short time in the river , are not dangerously contaminated new york state allows rodandreel anglers in the hudson to keep one bass a day of 18 or more inches , but issues health warnings about consumption of those fish hudson striper fishing is not a simple endeavor there have been years when every time i fished the lower part of the croton river or off the reef that extends downstream from croton point in the hudson , i caught at least two or three stripers on every sortie and there was one may afternoon in the croton itself when for at least an hour every third cast resulted in a strike or a hooked fish on the lastnamed adventure we were fishing from a canoe in the first pool below croton gorge , using small , lightweight swimming plugs , rebels and rapalas none of the fish were over six pounds , but the action was furious on the other hand , i have spent hours on the big river with tom lake of wappingers falls and taken only a few tiny stripers on bucktails and lake has been intimate with the hudson for decades lake , who for the last four years has been netting shad commercially with his son before that he worked as a crew member on other netting operations said he had caught quite a few 21 to 24inch stripers in his net , but he added that such fish appeared to be showing up more in fixed nets rather than the drift nets that he and several other upriver commercial fishermen use lake , who is also a dedicated sport fisherman , said that rodandreel fishing for stripers was slow earlier this spring it has been a crazy spring , windy , wet and rather cold , he said we had forsythia blooming when snow was coming down but about a week and a half ago , one fellow caught a couple of dozen stripers between 6 and 18 pounds in haverstraw bay on one trip , and there was one over 30 pounds taken from catskill creek where would he recommend fishing for stripers this week \? if you had called me a couple of days ago , i would have suggested haverstraw bay , he said , but the water temperature is now in the mid50 s when that happens , it s as if someone turned on a switch and the stripers begin to swim upriver to spawn right now i would be looking for them in the hudson highlands between west point and poughkeepsie , and in the week ahead , there should be good fishing even farther upstream to kingston and beyond lake says that some of the best may fishing for larger stripers can be had in the tributaries or their mouths using large rebels or rapalas at night such tributaries include the croton annsville creek in peekskill popolopen creek , which enters the hudson on the west side just above bear mountain bridge fishkill creek in beacon wappingers creek in hamburg roundout creek in kingston esopus creek in saugerties and catskill creek in catskill rrrichie ferriss , whose croton bait and tackle shop has been on riverside avenue \( route 9a \) in croton for 26 years , said they 've been catching an awful lot of stripers if you have a boat , haverstraw bay and the area around croton point have been hot spots ferriss said anglers using bloodworms fished right on the bottom were accounting for many of the bass in the croton point area there are locations on croton point where one may angle from shore one spot is adjacent to the ball field and in recent years those shorebased bottom fishermen have been doing very well lures seem to work best , he said , where bait fish congregate and there is a heavy flow of water , as at the outlet of the croton river ferris said years of angling on the hudson and talking with other anglers had not enabled him to devise any formula for choosing the best tide phase one day the fish are there the next day , under the same conditions , they are not , he said a lot of it is hitormiss he added that the biggest striper taken in his area this year thus far weighed a little over 27 pounds new york state s season for stripers in the hudson opens in midmarch and by the end of may the best fishing is over
mexico city as theaters go , it is humble indeed a clearing in the forest , some planks nailed together , a sound and light booth halfway up a tree , a few rudimentary props fashioned from wood and cloth making a virtue of necessity , the peasant and indigenous people s theater laboratory of tabasco has become one of latin america s most acclaimed and influential dramatic troupes by stripping away artifice and returning to theater s roots in storytelling founded less than a decade ago by maria alicia martinez medrano , the company is made up of more than 100 peasants and chontal indians from seven villages in the southeastern mexican state of tabasco most of them had never even seen a theatrical performance until miss martinez recruited them to be actors , technicians and stagehands sustained by only a modest government subsidy and the passion its members have developed for their art , the laboratory has made its mark by training scores of peasants and staging stark but powerful performances in neighboring villages and world capitals negotiations are under way to bring the company to new york in connection with the exhibition mexico splendors of 30 centuries , opening at the metropolitan museum of art on oct 10 i have never seen life and art drawn so closely together , interacting side by side , said joseph papp , head of the new york shakespeare festival and an admirer of the company , which has performed at his theater s annual festival latino i 've traveled to countries all over the world , but i 've never seen any troupe anywhere work in quite this way this is n't theater in the conventional sense these people are both actors and not actors , put into a situation where they begin to create works related to their lives they recreate a whole experience while being themselves , and the results are just amazing the key figure in the process is miss martinez , a 52yearold director and teacher whom the members of the company respectfully call la maestra , or the master before entering the theater , miss martinez was a psychology major at the national autonomous university of mexico and organized a network of daycare centers for children of government employees she has , she said , been struggling for decades to establish a truly popular theater that would rescue the indigenous culture of mexico , which was overwhelmed first by spanish colonialism and then by the popular culture of the united states convinced that we latin americans must recover our roots and origins , as she put it , miss martinez has proved to be tenacious and singleminded in pursuit of that vision , more than willing to tangle with the bureaucrats , politicians and doubters who stand in her path i do n't usually like gurus , but she s one of a kind , a person madly in love with the theater and what it can do for a society , mr papp said she uses art not just for its own sake , but to set standards of relationships and behavior based in the town of oxolotan , the laboratory offers 56 courses ranging from analysis of texts and lighting to improvisation and costuming students are introduced to stanislavsky s theories of acting , as well as to classic works of dramaturgy every six months there are examinations in the form of improvisations or stagings of the plays being studied i do n't know why it is said these people do n't understand shakespeare and sophocles and garcia lorca , miss martinez said during a rehearsal break prior to a series of performances in the mexican capital they understand better than we do , because they live closer to the grand passions of power , death , love and fear that are the fount of inspiration for all theater miss martinez first came to the indian villages of tabasco in the early 1980 s with 35 drama teachers she had trained in the nearby state of yucatan initially she moved slowly , meeting with the elders of each village to explain what she had in mind and always showing deference to the values and traditions of the chontal people only by acting as a supplicant , she said , could she hope to win the confidence of the villagers one of those who was immediately enthralled was juan de la cruz gonzalez morales when miss martinez s band of players first appeared in his small village , he was attracted not by abstract notions of great art but simply by the spectacle of it all they came into town on carts , dressed as minstrels , and invited us to come to the town square , he recalled oh , it was a ruckus , what with all the flowers and horses and carts and clowns i was 15 years old , i had never seen the theater before , and i was fascinated today , at age 22 , mr gonzalez morales is the manager of the touring company of 120 people and 16 horses that played to great critical acclaim in mexico city in may miss martinez knew from the start she was working with a sort of tabula rasa none of these communities had a theatrical tradition , she said their only tradition was 500 years of silence and marginalization
boston , aug 31 there is only a month or so left , but there is no race for the yankees in fenway park not this summer they are in last place , the boston red sox are in first and the drama that is typical of their lateseason meetings does not exist now the yankees are mere pawns , just one more small obstacle separating the red sox from their third american league east title in five years this weekend means more to the red sox than it does to the yanks , who fell tonight , 73 , as boston won its eighth straight game more good times the good times for the red sox keep coming they got an eighthinning grand slam from luis rivera , but the bulk of the workload was carried by greg harris , who pitched into the ninth and permitted just four hits , although two of them were home runs by randy velarde and roberto kelly harris \( 125 \) left the game to a standing ovation in two starts this season against the yankees he has given up just 5 hits and 3 runs in 16 innings not all was happy in the yankee clubhouse chuck cary , the starter , was upset that he was removed in the fourth with the score tied , 22 it s not like i was getting belted around , he said i'm the type of pitcher who can get out of those jams but i did n't get the chance , and instead i get the loss manager stump merrill s response they can say anything they want it s their prerogative i'm doing what i have to do to win ball games and if i hurt anybody s feelings along the way , that s the breaks i'm sorry the red sox , meanwhile , are winning much as they did in 1988 and in 1986 , when they lost to the mets in a sevengame world series but they seem to be having fun from the old school that old stuff about 24 cabs for 24 players is so far from the truth now , said the left fielder , mike greenwell if we could all climb into one cab now , we probably would that team was from the old school , where you just went out and did your job there was no rahrah stuff , but we 're like a college team now secrets \? the red sox offer none to their success in some ways , they still bow to the secondplace toronto blue jays , who were picked to win the american league east but who have flopped horribly if you were to put their team and our team on paper , said the venerable dwight evans , i 'd probably pick them things are just going right for us they 're down now because they lost three of four to us , but all of those were great ball games they 're still heavy on our minds the threegame series with the lowly yanks wo n't be as intriguing as it has in the past the yankees have been in last place for more than three months the red sox have been no lower than second since june 1 they have now won 11 of their last 13 games and 22 of 31 if they maintain their lead , it would send them to another likely american league playoff against the oakland athletics , who swept them in four games two years ago but unlike the past , when the red sox seemed surly , they are clearly more united now we 're definitely having more fun , greenwell said i ca n't say we 're a better team than in the past , but i can say we 're enjoying ourselves more some blamed jim rice , whose moodiness created a dark atmosphere in every corner of the red sox clubhouse , for the occasional turbulence but rice is gone happiness reigns but for the yankees , these are tough times cary was unhappy , jeff robinson gave up the slam to rivera after steve sax was late covering first base on a ground ball by tony pena with two on , and the night ended as it usually does we played with fire for too long , merrill said , and we ended up getting burned frightening reflections andy hawkins , the yankees' starting pitcher saturday against boston , surely has some frightening memories about fenway the last time he pitched here , june 5 , hawkins gave up five runs in onethird of an inning the next day , bucky dent was dismissed as manager in two career starts at fenway , hawkins has allowed 13 earned runs in twothirds of an inning , a 17568 earned run average photo rick cerone of the yankees tagging out boston s ellis burks who tried to score on dwight evan s hit in the fourth inning last night at boston \( associated press \)
boston , june 17 the 200 million burglary at the isabella stewart gardner museum last march stripped the tranquil , beloved museum of masterpieces by rembrandt and vermeer but even as the fbi continues to pursue what a bureau spokesman says are some active leads , the theft has sparked an embarrassing fight between the museum and the boston globe , two of the city s leading institutions the dispute has festered since the globe published a fivepage article on april 22 in which the newspaper charged the gardner with serious mismanagement and allowing its paintings to badly deteriorate through neglect both officials of the gardner and a number of respected art specialists around the country say the accusations are inaccurate or exaggerated and have hurt the museum as it tries to recover from the robbery , the largest art theft in history supporters of the gardner said the article came after an editor of the globe used crude language to describe the museum s director , anne hawley , and then said i'm going to get her i will rip her to shreds 'a very destructive atmosphere' ms hawley now says , first we were robbed , and then we were mugged what is troubling , she said , is that we were about to embark on a major fundraising drive and this creates a very destructive atmosphere benjamin b taylor , the executive editor of the globe , said he remained convinced that the article was tough but fair lincoln millstein , the assistant managing editor for the globe s living arts pages , who has been accused of making the threat in a telephone call to a museum aide , acknowledged he had said some pretty angry things mr millstein said he had been upset because on the day after the robbery , a globe photographer had not been allowed to take pictures in the room where the vermeer had hung the museum said the room had been closed by the federal bureau of investigation to search for evidence later , mr millstein said , he had been made even angrier when a security guard said he would have to search the paper s arts critic before admitting her i called the museum s pr person and yelled at him , mr millstein said , referring to the aide , corey cronin but mr millstein said i made no threat whatsoever that s absurd instead , mr millstein said of the publication of the article , i personally believe we did a tremendous public service in pointing out troubles at the museum debates and correspondence the article has led to debates in boston s exclusive old eating clubs and has provoked numerous letters to the paper on both sides it also prompted a delegation of the gardner s trustees , representing some of the city s most distinguished families , to meet with the globe s editors last week to lodge a complaint the fbi has remained guarded about describing its search for the two thieves , who gained entrance to the museum in the early morning hours of sunday , march 18 , by posing as boston policemen so far the fbi has a number of active leads , said paul cavanagh , a bureau spokesman but we 're not sold on any individual or group as a suspect one theory about the thieves , that they might be connected to a drug lord in latin america , appeared to receive some possible confirmation in april when the fbi announced it had recovered four 17thcentury dutch paintings stolen from the detroit institute of arts eight years ago the fbi said the paintings had been found in miami after being used as collateral in a cocaine deal we 've been told this may be a clue , ms hawley said paintings were uninsured in reconstructing the breakin at the gardner , ms hawley and others have contributed new details about the way in which the thieves were able to make off with 13 objects , including the concert by vermeer , and rembrandt s storm on the sea of galilee and a lady and a gentleman in black , as well as works by manet and degas none of the paintings was insured against theft ms hawley said the thieves' disguise as policemen had been made more plausible by a sharp increase in crime in the neighborhood , near the edge of roxbury , a poor section of the city , in the preceeding few months ms hawley said that in one incident a museum guard had been mugged in a parking lot across the street , while in another two girls on their way to the nearby boston latin school sought shelter in the museum after being assaulted in addition , last january , in a case that became nationally famous , carol stuart , who was pregnant , was shot to death only a few blocks away and her husband , charles , was seriously wounded in the stomach by what at the time the police thought was a black gunman the case caused severe racial tensions and heightened concern about crime in boston mr stuart later apparently leaped to his death from a bridge over boston harbor after a younger brother implicated him in the shootings as a result of the increase in crime in the neighborhood , ms hawley said , i had insisted on working more closely with the police

at the marian goodman gallery , 24 west 57th street , in manhattan , there is an exhibition of very large paintings and an equally large construction in which spectacular and unexpected events are continually to the fore in one of the paintings we seem to be hanggliding toward an immense and limitless space in the far downward distance is a long narrow lake , but the general tone is that of a universe newly created and as yet unformed in another painting , the waves of the red sea come rolling in not yet broken on the shore , they are tall , smooth and silvered , like the armored flanks of a battleship in yet another image , a gigantic figure of a woman stands before us in midair in a billowing floorlength dress , much in disarray , that turns out to have three separate pairs of sleeves the better , perhaps , to scatter the many little children whom she seems to be spawning in adelaide the title is an ironical reference to beethoven s song of that name the figure of lilith is seen to have given birth to military aircraft as a part of her demonic activity she herself is not there , and the children are not there it is their clothes \( designed by the artist , as it happens , and made not far from the studio \) that stand in for them threedimensional objects in a twodimensional world , they have an exceptional presence and then there is a most remarkable and enigmatic object a set of monumental iron bookshelves , 150 inches high and 135 inches wide , in which books made of lead \( and folio in format \) are on display some of them are neatly arranged others have been half wrenched from the shelves as if in the course of some violent intrusion handwritten annotations in a language not known to every visitor accompany them , and a semicircle of broken glass lies on the floor in front of the shelves we are entitled to interpret these images in any way we please if we wish to place upon them any one specific meaning , that is our privilege but they are the work of anselm kiefer , who does not deal in literal , let alone in unamendable , meanings in 1973 , when he was just 28 years old , kiefer established himself as the most original , ambitious and provocative artist of his generation in europe his status in that respect was confirmed in 1984 when jurgen harten organized a retrospective exhibition that began at the kunsthalle in dusseldorf and was later seen both in paris and at the israel museum in jerusalem it was further confirmed in 1988 in the american retrospective of his work that was seen in chicago , philadelphia , los angeles and new york if his status was occasionally questioned in this country , it was in part because of pure \( and sometimes not so pure \) incomprehension it was in part because there was just too much of kiefer to get a hold on and it was in part because of mixed emotions well defined in 1988 by the critic peter schjeldahl in art in america magazine the emotions in question were joy at being the contemporary of an extraordinary artist it s a lucky feeling , a sort of vicarious redemption shadowed by suspicions of eventual disappointment people want kiefer to succeed in his high and complicated ambitions , but they also want to drag him down to their own level the convenient thing , meanwhile , was to see the work in terms primarily of the prolegomena to kiefer s birth as far as germany was concerned 1945 was year zero the time at which all inequities were made known , retribution was exacted \( none too soon \) , and a oncegreat nation touched bottom in that gruesome arena and in that gruesome time , the infant kiefer had somehow to make sense of his surroundings he did it in terms peculiar to himself one of the earliest paintings that he has preserved dates from 1970 it is a watercolor called every human being stands under his own dome of heaven and it shows a tiny human figure quite possibly a little boy standing in a landscape both bleached and blackened it could be a scene of desolation like the ones on which kiefer s first gaze had been fastened but not at all irrespective of what has happened around him , the tiny figure stands , beyond the reach of evil , in a clear blue bell of glass that doubles as the sky of heaven kiefer felt his way toward a germany made up among much else of old nursery rhymes , the magic potion that makes wagner s siegfried lose the memory of brunnhilde , and a private and miscellaneous pantheon of what in the late 1940 s were called good germans from the past \( more than one of these came from the part of south germany in which he was born \) germany appeared in his paintings as a wasteland , a wilderness of flame and ash , with place names written out where there would otherwise have been no way of knowing what had once been there it also appeared in terms of the crazy authoritarian noalternative architecture that the nazis would have liked to make mandatory \( his work was not about nostalgia it was not about futurology it was not a matter of sermonizing it looked at germany with eyes that had first opened in year zero , with all that that implied in the way of his elders' grief , remorse , fear , and repression of thoughts too terrible to acknowledge
dan rather and peter jennings went to moscow this week , but tom brokaw stayed home hearing the news , mikhail gorbachev flinched , then said to his colleagues , i 'll give it to you straight from the shoulder , gentlemen tom brokaw is not coming to moscow men who had staked lives , fortunes and sacred honor on the success of perestroikapromoter gorbachev smacked their foreheads with the heels of their hands , some crying sacre bleu ! and others moaning , the jig is up maybe brokaw is stuck in a midtown tunnel traffic jam and missed his flight at kennedy airport , gerasimov said he 'll probably catch the morning plane and be here in time for us to create the new system of government as planned you 're whistling in the dark , said gorbachev gerasimov , who was proud of his english , said , it would be a refreshing variation on that old cliche , mr president , if you said 'whistling in the tunnel' then was gorbachev sore wroth if you did that in american english , chief , gerasimov suggested , you could forget the wroth and just be sore gorbachev groaned i need network anchors , and all you give me is an english lesson do n't knock it , mr president , said gerasimov those network anchors would probably give their last can of hairstyling mousse for a good english lesson you ca n't believe the solecisms they commit every night right in the american living room gorbachev said the plan for getting the great lenin off the nation s back was facing catastrophe , yet all gerasimov could talk about was network anchorhair chief , said gerasimov , you 've just coined a terrific new word 'anchorhair' ! it s a neologism that americans have needed for years imagine the typical american youth pining for fame at present all he says to the barber is something like , scissors on the side , ' or 'give me a sort of reagan pompadour' but now , thanks to the father of perestroika , that lad can tell the barber precisely what he wants by saying , 'make mine anchorhair' gorbachev did n't want to improve communication between glamourcrazed american youth and its barbers he wanted to end the communist party s monopoly on power ca n't we do that without american network anchors \? asked itchinov , who came from a backward region where there was nothing but tundra , not even television , much less hairstyling mousse itchinov s question filled gorbachev with sorrow how sad that the country still had regions where soviet citizens did n't know how to tell the difference between earthshaking history and events that did n't amount to a hill of beans was there any citizen of any other country on earth who did n't know that the way to measure the importance of events was to count the number of network news anchors who left their desks to stand at the scene \? is it certain brokaw wo n't show up \? asked yakovlev is it confirmed by our kgb agents in new york \? by better sources than that , said gorbachev the tass bureau in washington heard it on 'entertainment tonight' ok , it s a blow , said gerasimov it means that getting the great lenin off our backs is n't the tremendous deal we thought it would be , but still it s something it s a flopperoo , said gorbachev it s a bomb that was the chief for you , gerasimov said to himself always overstating things like this perestroika business of his , which was all perest \( overstatement \) and no roika \( groceries in the supermarket \) aloud he said , mr president , you forget that dan rather and peter jennings are both in moscow that means it s still a pretty darn big deal , if you 'll excuse an old buffoon of a wordsmith for getting all choked up , sir cut the ollie north imitation , gerasimov , said the chief , who knew from experience that it was likely to be followed by gerasimov s lyndon johnson imitation \( down on the purd'nalis we always say half a loaf is better than none \) and do n't tell us twothirds of an anchorage is better than none all three showed up for the berlin wall i think we 've got a big story here so long , grandfather lenin' and i 'd like it to be just as historic as the wall fall that s why the moscow party meeting ran three days instead of the scheduled two still , it did no good for gerasimov to tell brokaw , we 've extended it just so you can get here , tom , baby gorbachev let things go ahead anyhow he did n't want dan rather and peter jennings to think he did n't appreciate their coming
the only american master who interests me is ryder , said jackson pollock in 1944 , and he was hardly the first artist to express that sentiment a legend among professional artists was the phrase that marsden hartley used in 1917 there s only ryder in american painting , said arthur b davies , and when davies and the other organizers of the 1913 armory show put together their display of the masters who had paved the way for the development of modernism , they selected ryder as the only american in a group that included ingres , delacroix , goya , manet , puvis de chavannes , corot , van gogh and cezanne albert pinkham ryder s popularity has been fueled by stories of his eccentric and reclusive personality , which have made him seem all the more like the american original that art critics said he was here , they claimed , was a painter not indebted to the french or to anyone else for that matter , a naif , a visionary imbued with the pioneering spirit ryder came to embody the image of the outsider that was so fundamental to the notion of an avantgarde none of which did harm to the market for ryder s paintings , which grew over the years , assisted by a flood of fakes that began as early as 1912 , five years before the artist s death at the age of 70 , and that continued through the unscrupulous machinations of the art critic frederic fairchild sherman during the 1920 s and the ferargil gallery of new york during the 1930 s scholars and conservators have spent the last several decades trying to separate the wheat from the chaff , and in the process , to draw a more accurate picture of this most extraordinary of american painters some of the results of their inquiries are magnificently on view in albert pinkham ryder , an exhibition at the brooklyn museum , through jan 8 this may be the last show to put such a wide range of his accomplishments before the public ryder s singular technique , which involved the use of dubious materials like the dirt from his shoes , has caused many of his paintings to crackle and , in some cases , disintegrate beyond recognition others are well on their way to selfdestruction still , even in a decrepit state , the paintings can make a viewer swoon , so perfectly pitched is their mood of introspection , so seductive their mixture of exquisite color and muscular form ryder was master of the simplified , abstracted shape the billowing sail against voluminous clouds , the single rider on an empty race track and it was this quality that appealed greatly to the early modernists he put down one layer after the next of pigment and then added coats of varnish to create the old masterly glow that was so popular at the time the other effect was to create objects that seem nearly as much sculptures as paintings , with their thick surfaces and tactile shapes in works like moonlight marine , the moon literally stands in relief , creating what roger fry called an impression of some uneven enamel the paintings have lost none of their appeal fortunately , this exhibition of some 60 works , in its breadth and attention to detail , does him justice it has been organized by elizabeth broun of the national museum of american art in washington , where it was first shown sections on the conservation of ryder s paintings and on fakes round out a judicious selection of paintings , including the pastoral landscapes , decorative objects , images of chaste women , marine scenes and grand narratives a catalogue with a booklength essay by ms broun accompanies the exhibition it follows another largescale scholarly look at the artist , albert pinkham ryder painter of dreams , recently published by abrams , which combines the research of william innes homer with more than a halfcentury of study into issues of authenticity and style by lloyd goodrich , the former director of the whitney museum of american art , who died in 1987 the two works differ over the dates of certain paintings \( ryder did n't date , and rarely signed , anything \) but they set out a fundamentally similar portrait and who is the ryder that emerges \? he is not the man that popular opinion often held him to be early in this century perhaps most significantly , his work can be seen to have intricate connections with various kinds of european paintings , including some of the more politically revolutionary art ryder had gained a knowledge of european painting partly through his association with the dealer cottier company , for whom he did several major decorative projects and who exhibited his work alongside the paintings of many contemporary europeans he traveled through europe and north africa with daniel cottier in 1882 , and presumably on that trip his interests in the works of 19thcentury artists like delacroix and earlier masters like titian were fortified ryder s orientalist images , like the arab horseman in the lone scout , suggests his affinity for delacroix , while the richly textured and intensely felt narrative works , like flying dutchman , can bring to mind such late titians as the annunciation and the pieta , which ryder may have admired on his tours around venice
naples , july 2 some fans in naples may suffer from conflicting twitches tuesday when diego maradona of argentina takes the field against italy in the semifinals of the world cup almost all neapolitan fans are expected to root against maradona and the defending champions , and to root for italy and its goalkeeper , walter zenga , who is closing in on a world cup record for scoreless minutes but since coming to the naples club of the italian league in 1984 , maradona has helped napoli win two championships , including one this past season for a while he was asking to be traded , but in recent months , he has said he wants to finish out his career here , where he lives in a hilltop villa during the season after argentina s quarterfinal victory over yugoslavia on saturday , maradona tried to lobby for a little divided loyalty , reminding neapolitans that they are often regarded as southerners or even foreigners by the northern industrial and political power in italy the neapolitans must remember one thing , maradona said italy makes it feel important one day of the year , but forgets about it the other 364 'no need' this theory about prejudice against naples was rejected by mayor pietro lezzi and salvatore schillaci , who comes from palermo , sicily schillaci , who has four goals for italy in this world cup tournament , said it is not true that maradona s city is discriminated against by the rest of italy the fans have no need to support him schillaci , who in the italian league plays for juventus of turin , added in the last month , i have become a bit of a symbol of the antiracist reunification of the country , and this is the part of the world cup which i like best maradona , who has four fewer goals than schillaci in this world cup , and who missed a penalty kick in the shootout victory over yugoslavia on saturday , added that the victory is a gift that i do for naples despite maradona s maneuvering , argentina will be merely the latest obstacle for the italian national team , the azzurri , or the blues , who have won all five of their games in this world cup , scoring seven goals and giving up none zenga downplays records zenga , the italian goalkeeper , has played all 450 minutes , and is closing in on two records the record for consecutive minutes in one world cup , 457 , was set in 1978 by leao of brazil , and the record for scoreless minutes in all world cup games is 474 , set by sepp maier of west germany in 1974 and matched by him in 1978 i tell you that i'm happy to be on a semifinal team in the world cup , said the 30yearold zenga , who plays for inter of milan i 'd be lying if i said i was not pleased with the chance for a record , but i would trade a few goals if i knew that italy would be in the finals zenga has had to work hard only a few times in the five games , oddly enough in the closing minutes of a 10 victory against the united states and in the second half of the 10 quarterfinal victory over ireland on saturday our defense is made up of a blend of inter and milan players who know each other very well , zenga said , referring to the two italian league teams in milan the italian league teams play each other at least twice during the season and often four or five times including league cup competitions also , the top players are often called to the national team , so there are few secrets and surprises the four players from the city of milan who line up in front of zenga are giuseppe bergomi , 26 , the quiet captain from inter franco baresi , 30 , the sweeper from milan riccardo ferri , 26 , from inter , and paolo maldini , 21 , from milan bergomi and ferri have been with me for 10 years , zenga added , and maldini and baresi are unique defense excels the italian defense has been at least as disciplined and dashing as the offense , clearing the ball to the sides , rarely making a mistake , and rarely dishing the ball back to zenga all of the defenders have taken an occasional run up the field , to keep enemy defenses honest and to open things up for the new ace scorer , schillaci , lurking downfield zenga , who is the host of a sports television show , was smoothly diplomatic about the matchup with the wintertime king of naples we respect argentina a lot , zenga said , a lot of it because it has diego armando maradona but argentina also has other good players i think it will be a good match , worthy of naples when asked what team worried him most in the tournament , zenga said argentina is our next match the ball is my number one enemy argentina has been its own enemy for most of this tournament , scoring only four goals in five games but managing to survive into the semifinals the hero of the 1986 world cup , maradona , has yet to score in this one he has been fouled more than any other player , and went into the tournament with a painful ingrown toenail and other aches and pains , after a season in which his fitness was often suspect now maradona must play the italian team on a hot streak , and it may not matter that the game is being played in diego armando s other hometown

hauppauge , li , march 7 a report released today by a special prosecutor investigating accusations of illegal wiretaps by the suffolk county police said there was no basis for criminal charges , although the incidents did occur the report said that eight tape recordings supplied by one of three former county police officers who made the allegations showed that the wiretapping had occurred in a narcotics unit in the early 1980 s but it said there was no evidence linking the wiretaps to specific people it also said there was little proof that the wiretaps had been a common practiceor had been condoned by prosecutors the deputy state attorney general , john m ryan , who was named the special prosecutor by gov mario m cuomo , said none of the more than 100 former and current county police and prosecutors interviewed in a 10month investigation corroborated the wiretap charges everybody denied it , mr ryan said , adding that the report drew no conclusions about the credibility of those interviewed or the former officers who made the allegations mr cuomo named a special prosecutor after a report issued in april by the state commission of investigation , a state watchdog agency , found that suffolk police officers engaged in illegal wiretapping with the approval of their supervising sergeant and of raymond g perini , the former chief of the narcotics bureau at the suffolk county district attorney s office mr perini , who retired last year and is now in private practice , said today that he felt vindicated i have been exonerated , he said
gary , ind the usx corporation s sprawling plant along the shore of lake michigan here is the foundation of what many consider to be among the most efficient steel operations in the united states yet some analysts say the nation s largest steel producer would have difficulty continuing to outperform the industry as an independent company , spun off from usx as proposed by carl c icahn , its largest shareholder they also doubt that a spinoff would make each existing usx share worth 48 40 percent more than the current price as mr icahn stated in proxy material sent to shareholders early in april if the value of the company were 48 with a spinoff of steel , the stock price would reflect a value closer to that , said jeffrey miller , an analyst with duff phelps inc in chicago shareholder vote set shareholders will vote at the company s annual meeting on may 7 whether to spin off at least 80 percent of the steel business into a separate company called the us steel corporation , the name used by usx for 85 years until 1986 under mr icahn s plan , each existing usx share would be replaced with two types of shares one representing the steel company and the other an energy company composed of usx s large oil and gas holdings management would be under no obligation to carry out the plan if it was approved mr icahn , who urged management to put his proposal to a vote in lieu of his waging a proxy fight , is eager to rid usx of the steel business , which accounts for onethird of the company s sales and earnings during a down cycle , he argues , the lagging steel unit could weaken the earnings of the energy subsidiary he believes the market would value a pure energy and a pure steel stock higher than it now does a hybrid usx , which he contends is trading at less than its fair value because few analysts understand the intricacies of both businesses mr icahn has valued a separate steel company at 9 a share and the energy company at 39 a share shares of usx closed on the new york stock exchange monday at 3450 each , up 375 cents but some analysts believe the stock is already overvalued , run up by the presence of mr icahn , who owns 133 percent of usx and most say the value and virtue of spinning off the steel group depend on how certain issues regarding taxes and retiree benefits are resolved other analysts agree that steel should be sold , but question the timing of a sale they say the unit would bring a higher price if the steel market were healthier some believe that charles a corry , chairman and chief executive of pittsburghbased usx , opposes mr icahn s proposal because he would rather sell steel when the market improves while shareholders are expected to defeat the spinoff proposal by voting with management , as they usually do in these situations , mr icahn could get support from some institutional investors like mr icahn , some of these investors are irritated that usx s stock has risen only 84 percent in the last 15 years , lagging behind the 308 percent increase in the standard poor s 500 stock index during the same period they contend that a restructuring undertaken by usx in 1987 , after mr icahn proposed taking over the company , was not radical enough , and welcome his latest threat as a muchneeded catalyst for change under the restructuring , which management promised would raise the value of the stock , the company repurchased shares and placed its faltering texas oil and gas unit up for sale that unit is still unsold earnings improve but management argues that the company is healthier than it has been in years it earned 965 million last year on sales of 187 billion , up from net income of 756 million on sales of 168 billion in 1988 also , since mr icahn began to invest in usx three years ago , the company s stock price has increased 66 percent , compared with the 37 percent rise in the standard poor s 500 during that period and the oil and gas business , entered into in 1982 with the purchase of the marathon oil company to protect against the cyclicality of the steel sector , now accounts for nearly twothirds of usx s sales and earnings , up from 58 percent in 1988 operating earnings of marathon , the centerpiece of usx s energy holdings , have climbed significantly since 1987 , to 862 million last year they should continue to grow with the anticipated improvement in oil production and demand , analysts said marathon is a valuable energy company with significant growth potential , said rolf wagner , an analyst at scott stringfellow in richmond if the steel business were separated , none of that would change the steel business has also staged a turnaround after losing more than 2 billion during the fouryear industry slump that began in 1983 , the company became profitable in 1987 helped by widespread layoffs , new equipment , improved demand and federal restrictions on imported steel it earned 432 million in 1989 evidence of revival here in gary , it now takes only 35 hours of labor to produce a ton of steel , down from 10 hours 10 years ago and significantly less than the domestic industry average of 66 hours usx has pruned its work force to about 20 , 000 people , from 75 , 000 a decade ago and by next year , gary s output will be produced entirely by continuous casters , the equipment that casts steel far more efficiently than the old method , in which ingots were used now , more than 60 percent is continuously casted
washington , feb 1 albert a hakim , who was oliver l north s financial adviser on the arms sales and other secret missions of the irancontra affair , was fined 5 , 000 today and placed on two years' probation for his actions but he also gained a share of 17 million in proceeds from those operations , which are now frozen in swiss banks the unusual agreement , disclosed at a hearing before federal district judge gerhard a gesell , resolved all criminal charges against mr hakim and appeared to insure that the government would be allowed to seize 73 million in profits from the arms deals , funds that are also frozen in swiss accounts mr hakim and two swiss men had claimed portions of the swiss accounts , which were set up in the mid1980 s to disguise the finances of mr north s labyrinthine secret operations the accounts hold a total of 9 million , much of it profits from the sale of defense department weapons to iran the united states contends that the money belongs to the government but in deciding to settle the case , the justice department concluded that its claim to only 73 million could have been proved beyond question , and that the cost of a long and uncertain legal battle over the remainder was outweighed by the benefits of a settlement mr hakim , of san jose , calif , abandoned his claim for the rest of the 9 million and agreed to split the remaining 17 million with the two swiss men , willard zucker and philippe neyroud mr zucker was the fiduciary for the swiss bank accounts and mr neyroud is mr hakim s lawyer mr hakim s punishment is among the least onerous given any of the seven irancontra defendants in lawrence e walsh s twoandahalfyear pursuit of the case as the independent prosecutor in sentencing him , judge gesell said mr hakim deserved leniency because of his exceptional and effective cooperation with prosecutors and his willingness to abandon his claim to most of the irancontra proceeds you 're also the only one who at some stage of this matter was not an officer or former officer of the united states government , the judge added indeed , you were brought into the situation you find yourself in by the united states government after his sentencing , mr hakim lashed out sarcastically at mr walsh and the government i have been abused by two presidents , he told the associated press i'm talking about president reagan and president walsh our judicial system has been used as a tool by the politicians for their own gain central figure in plot mr hakim , richard v secord , who was mr hakim s business partner , and mr north were the central figures of the irancontra affair , in which they sold weapons to iran at inflated prices and used the profits to supply anticommunist nicaraguan rebels and finance other secret operations all three were originally charged with conspiracy , fraud , theft and other crimes mr north , formerly a national security council aide and lieutenant colonel of the marine corps , was convicted on lesser charges and ordered to perform community service and pay a fine last month , a federal judge placed mr secord , a retired air force major general , on probation , saying he had suffered enough the sentencing of mr hakim followed an agreement with mr walsh in november the prosecutor allowed the 53yearold mr hakim to plead guilty to one charge of helping to supplement mr north s income by arranging for him to receive a 13 , 800 security fence in return , mr hakim has agreed to testify in the criminal trial of john m poindexter , mr north s superior at the national security council , and is cooperating in an undisclosed federal grand jury investigation , court papers say by dropping his claim to most irancontra proceeds in swiss accounts , mr hakim also simplifies things considerably for the government , said a spokeswoman for mr walsh about 78 million was in the accounts when they were frozen in late 1986 , and 12 million in interest has accumulated since none of the proceeds can be allotted to the united states or the three men until the swiss government , as expected , releases the funds , which were originally frozen at washington s request the 73 million that the government receives in its settlement with mr hakim roughly equals those profits from the iran arms sales that investigators were able to trace from records government lawyers were not sure they could have proved ownership of any funds they could not trace directly to the arms deals suffered substantially' judge gesell said today that mr hakim had suffered substantially from the irancontra disclosures , losing some of his private business interests the judge also cited a letter written on mr hakim s behalf by david p jacobsen , the last of three american hostages in lebanon who were freed during the reagan administration s sales of arms to iran mr hakim negotiated with iranians for his release i would be in my fifth year of captivity had it not been for his extraordinary efforts in negotiating with the iranian representatives , mr jacobsen wrote on jan 24 in a letter made public today other american negotiators had given up , but mr hakim continued mr hakim s lawyer , richard janis , went further in court papers , he likened mr hakim s actions to france s secret assistance to the american colonies in the revolution france channeled its military aid through a private company to disguise its origin , mr janis said mr hakim s duties running dummy companies that hid mr north s arms deals were virtually an exact replica of this arrangement today judge gesell also ordered lawyers to dissolve lake resources inc , the panamanian dummy company most used by mr hakim earlier the company pleaded guilty to disposing of proceeds from the iran arms sales without government permission photo albert hakim , the iranianamerican businessman who helped lieut col oliver l north direct the irancontra arms deal , leaving federal court in washington yesterday with his lawyer , richard janis mr hakim was sentenced to two years' probation and fined 5 , 000 \( ap \) \( pg a18 \)
the jets came to terms yesterday with their first plan b free agent of the new regime , a passrushing defensive tackle whom dick steinberg drafted last year for the new england patriots the player , emanuel mcneil , is only the second plan b free agent signed this year in the national football league he produced 13 sacks as a senior at tennesseemartin in 1988 that showing led steinberg , who ran the patriots' draft , to take him as a 10throunder last year but mcneil suffered a trainingcamp hamstring injury and did n't play until new england s final game soon after , steinberg left to become the jets' general manager 'an interesting player' he s an interesting player , steinberg said yesterday of the 6foot3inch tackle he was n't activated because the defensive line stayed healthy he s a 280pounder with great athletic ability and toughness he could make a strong run for an inside defensiveline position the jets have highly regarded young players on the line in dennis byrd , marvin washington and ron stallworth , so mcneil s acquisition indicates how impressed steinberg is with him mcneil , known as big mac , personally brought the contract to new york monday night rather than send it through the mails steinberg has said he plans to sign about a dozen plan b players , and probably wind up with about six this is the second year of plan b , in which each nfl club is allowed to protect 37 players on feb 1 from then until april 1 , all the other players become unrestricted free agents , allowed to move to another club with no compensation required the jets took five plan b players last year , but by the end of the season , none was playing the only one still on the roster was mark konecny , a running backkick returner who was injured in training camp and sidelined for the year the first player signed this season in the nfl was the bears' george streeter , a defensive back , who was picked up by the raiders the jets , coming off a 412 season , are making other radical changes at 43 years old , bruce coslet is the secondyoungest coach in the nfl , and he is surrounding himself with such a young group of assistants that three of them have only college experience the two newest coaches hired this week are both in their 30 s greg robinson of ucla , who will direct the jets' longsuffering defensive line , and bob wiley of colorado state , who will be an offensive assistant specializing in tight ends and the running game , as well as assisting the line coach , jim beightol
washington there is no tidy way for president bush and congressional leaders to recover from the stunning bipartisan defeat of the budget package thursday night like people in a smalltown that has just been wiped off the map by a tornado , they just have to dig themselves out and start thinking about the first step unfortunately , there are no good first steps none that carry any assurances of success as far as i can see and this is a measure of the desperate straits we now find ourselves in the best the leadership can do is to keep offering the same budget resolution that failed thursday just keep offering it , day after day , until it passes none of the other commonly suggested strategies seems feasible one option , which some democrats have talked about bravely since the budget agreement was announced last sunday , is to write a genuinely democratic budget it would be more progressive \( a 35 percent top marginal rate on income taxes \) it would cut medicare by only 30 billion , compared with 60 billion in the original package it would not , as the summit agreement would , increase to two weeks the waiting period for unemployment compensation it would make smaller cuts in farm programs and larger cuts in the military this approach would be healthy for our political system the majority in congress would act like a majority for once , and americans would have a clear choice of philosophies and policies the people might see congress as a more effective institution and the democrats as less feckless but this approach is also the most unrealistic if the democrats in the house and senate were effective , cohesive majorities , the cumbersome budget summit process would not have been needed in the first place in truth , chances of passing a genuine democratic budget were slim in the house and near zero in the senate as a somewhat more realistic option , some have suggested that the president reconvene the budget summit to approve limited , specific changes that address the most common objections to the original agreement regressive taxes and too large a hit on medicare but reconvening the summit group would bring together the same crew that wrangled fruitlessly for the last four months quick action would be unlikely a third option would be to convene a new budget summit without the administration s participation by many accounts , the hardline positions of the white house chief of staff , john sununu , were an impediment in the original negotiations the congressional participants have known and negotiated with each other for years they know the art of compromise they know the hot buttons of their colleagues they all put ideology second to practicality the problem with this approach is simple it would take weeks to achieve , even if president bush were willing to deal himself out of the picture , which is highly unlikely the best , fastest , most feasible approach is to bring up the same budget agreement that was rejected so resoundingly thursday night and keep bringing it up until it passes president bush can do two things to enhance his chances for success first , he can create a crisis situation by refusing to sign a shortterm appropriations bill this would either threaten to close down the federal government or trigger acrosstheboard , grammrudman budget cuts a government shut down would get the attention of congress and the nation for once , congress would have some immediate consequences to weigh against inaction on the budget second , mr bush should define how much flexibility congress would have to adjust the budget resolution after it had passed he has to assure nervous members that their worries about medicare cutbacks and regressive taxes could be addressed even after passage alternatively , president bush and congressional leaders could reach informal understandings about ameliorating medicare cuts , balancing tax burdens and other steps to take the worst pain out of the budget package for example , raising or eliminating the medicare insurance wage base would make the whole package more progressive while providing money to temper medicare cuts moreover , to get the wealthy to share more equally in the tax burden , congress could enhance the pease plan for limiting itemized deductions for those with more than 100 , 000 in taxable income many of us who voted for the budget agreement thursday night did so in the belief that there were no realistic , achievable alternatives there were none and there are none opponents were listening either to the ideologists or the special interests now , president bush needs to underline the crisis we are in , insist on budget votes day after day , and let congressmen and senators hear from those americans who are neither ideologues nor special pleaders just ordinary citizens who expect their elected officials to govern
unions , in recent years , have initiated strikes that have been costly to them , but owners of baseball s 26 teams appear to be losing their own lockout now in its 11th day , the lockout of players from spring training camps has put absolutely no pressure on the players , despite the oftstated view of the owners' labor representatives that a deadline , such as the lockout , places pressure on both sides the owners are the ones who are reacting to the closed camps , trying to find ways to satisfy the players , and they are the ones who have kept them closed to have a meaningless lockout to support regressive proposals is to shoot yourself in the foot , said marvin miller , the players' former labor leader taking the batters box the owners , without question , have been hobbling around in recent weeks , offering a series of proposals that has given rise to the belief on the union side that management is in disarray the players have this image of everyone on management s side getting a turn at bat the players have simply reacted negatively to most of the proposals , held their ground and awaited the next set how did the players get to the position where they appear to be forcing this succession of moves by the owners \? the answer lies perhaps as much in the owners' strategic planning as in the players' firm stand the owners' strategy was to push for their revenueparticipation plan , a radical change for baseball , while supporting their effort with the threat of a lockout first , they did a poor job of trying to sell the players on the revenue plan , producing answers to none of the relevant questions the players raised and offering no convincing evidence that they needed the plan now then they implemented their lockout when the players had nothing to lose checks out of sight and mind if they had locked out the players toward the end of spring training , when the players' first paychecks were in sight , the players would have faced the loss of something real but the players receive no pay during spring training the owners , however , did n't want to take that approach because they then would have faced the possible loss of significant income if the season did not start on time so the owners began their lockout feb 15 , two days after they had scrapped , for these negotiations , the revenue sharing plan for which they had campaigned for seven months if there has been any oasis of reason among management , it is the commissioner , fay vincent vincent has been an activist commissioner , and one reason he seems to be having some success at guiding the owners at least in the direction of a settlement is that he has leaped into the leadership void not since walter o'malley , owner of the dodgers , died in 1979 has any owner assumed a leadership role not only did no one step into o'malley s brainy shoes , but when peter ueberroth became commissioner , he had virtually no use for advice from owners ueberroth completely abandoned the executive council , the body of owners that is supposed to serve in an advisory capacity to the commissioner up steps vincent vincent has apparently used the void to his advantage in the current labor dispute seeing that the owners' revenuesharing effort was failing to elicit even a hint of interest , he stepped in with his own set of proposals the players viewed them as too restrictive and regressive , but at least the two sides had returned to a more conventional negotiation how was vincent able to seize the labor reins suddenly from the six owners who comprise the board of the player relations committee \? management sources indicated that he talked with more moderate owners outside the committee and had them speak to at least some of the committee owners , convincing them that revenue sharing was going nowhere and that they faced the prospect of an unwanted extended shutdown but last wednesday , a major glitch struck the talks the owners presented yet another set of proposals , and these outraged the players effort by hardliners largely the product of two general managers , frank cashen of the mets and harry dalton of the milwaukee brewers , the proposals represented an effort by the committee hardliners to make a deal their way vincent , one source said , was not at all surprised by the players' reaction and used it to regain the reins the next day at a committee meeting it was obvious that if the owners continued along the wednesday track , baseball could be derailed for a major part of the season interestingly , at that meeting , the source said , carl pohlad , owner of the minnesota twins , who is viewed on the union side as a hardliner , was instrumental in getting the committee to sidetrack the wednesday initiative and in devising the latest set of proposals what is not clear is whether vincent spoke with pohlad before the meeting and persuaded him to act as he did or if their views just happened to converge the source said that vincent and pohlad have talked often about the labor dilemma forget about yesterday after the committee meeting thursday morning , steve greenberg , the deputy commissioner , called donald fehr , the union chief , and said , forget about what happened yesterday he indicated that vincent had his engineer s cap back on and that they could get down to serious bargaining the next critical step must be made in the next couple of days the players' executive board is scheduled to meet in phoenix on tuesday , and if the owners hope to have a quick settlement , they will have to give fehr something substantial to take to phoenix with him the owners ca n't let that go by , miller said if the players come out of that meeting mad , forget it photo donald fehr arriving at the commissioner s office yesterday \( associated press \)
chicago , march 1 the decentralization of chicago s school system , the nation s third largest , hit its first serious snag this week as several communities were divided over the dismissal of principals by parentled councils protests have disrupted classes at half a dozen schools students have pulled fire alarms and walked out of classes , and teachers have joined picket lines hundreds of angry parents and teachers packed a board of education meeting wednesday to protest dismissals they say were based on race or ethnicity today , hundreds of students were involved in a melee at the racially mixed morgan park high school on the southwest side during a protest over the removal of the white principal six students and two police officers were injured , none seriously ten students were arrested , and classes were suspended for the day the recent unrest is the first serious trouble since the transfer of power last fall from the central board of education to parentled councils at each of the city s 541 public schools in at least six areas , outraged parents and community residents say they want to recall their school council members only a few schools affected this is becoming very destructive , said rev dante plata , who heads a hispanic group in a community where several schools are in turmoil we 're going to march on city hall and close the schools down advocates of decentralization say only a fraction of the schools are being disrupted what looks like a chaotic situation that s democracy , said ellis levin , a democratic state representative from chicago who heads the house committee that oversees decentralization school reform is not guaranteed to work 100 percent in every school , but it ca n't be any worse than it was before , he said in 1987 , education secretary william j bennett called chicago public schools the nation s worst the decentralization , the most ambitious ever tried in this country , was put into place without incident last october when 5 , 400 parents , teachers and community representatives serving on local councils were given the authority to approve budgets , determine curriculums and hire and fire principals each council has six parents , two teachers and two community representatives the parent members are elected by parents , teachers by teachers and the representatives by area residents first major decision there have been complaints that the central board has been slow to train the local councils and answer their questions , tasks that are among the main functions retained by the central board under decentralization but few people had criticized the councils themselves until this week the controversy erupted when half the local school councils faced the first major decision whether to retain their current principals or to seek replacements chicago s 541 principals have been working under temporary contracts until the school councils were in place by wednesday , the target date set by the school board , decisions to keep or dismiss the principals were due at 270 schools where principals' contracts expire this june contracts of principals at the remaining schools expire in 1991 tensions have run especially high at three predominantly hispanic schools , where white principals say they are being forced out because they are not hispanic although many of those protesting the dismissal of the principals have been hispanic , hispanic council members say that the nonhispanic white principals and staffs have tried to thwart the councils , and in some cases have used ethnic slurs in addressing them in an ethnically polarized vote on friday , the hispanic majority of the parent council at burns elementary school voted , 6 to 3 , against renewing the contract of donald kriz , who has been principal for 10 years nearly all the school s 950 students walked out of classes on monday in support of mr kriz , who is white defending the ouster , william velez , president of the local school council at burns elementary , said from the very first moment , the principal and staff demonstrated that they do n't want the council there they have used our limited experience as a weapon against us we want someone who respects the council ousted after 12 years the population of chicago is about 40 percent white , 40 percent black and 20 percent hispanic many problems stem from cultural and language barriers between principals who speak no spanish and councils in which few or no members speak english that was the case at spry elementary school , where ben natzke , a nonhispanic white , was ousted last week after 12 years as principal of the predominantly hispanic school on the southwest side to this day , i have n't been told why i was voted out , said mr natzke it s as if they 're saying , 'if you 're not hispanic , then get out' under the state law providing for the decentralization , neither the school superintendent nor the central board has the authority to intervene , except in rare instances , as when a council is completely nonfunctional while some school councils are considering whether to call another vote on their principals , advocates of change are hoping the councils will not give in to public pressure 'the essence of reform' what s at stake here is the essence of school reform , said dan solis , executive director of united neighborhood organization , a hispanic community group that ran hispanic slates in the council elections last fall principals and their supporters say mr solis s group planted on these councils dissidents who do not represent community sentiment mr solis has dismissed the allegations as attempts to undercut the councils what has become apparent is the central role that politics plays on the councils just because you reduce it to the grassroots level does n't mean you 're going to eliminate politics , even of the most virulent kind , said j s fuerst , a professor of social welfare policy at loyola university , who has been critical of decentralization photo the decentralization of chicago s school system is dividing communities as some parentled councils have been ousting principals students at robert burns school walked out of their classrooms and rallied around their principal , donald kriz , after renewal of his contract was denied \( associated press \)

of their parties , while the spanish communist party has joined a united left coalition including nonmarxists even the italian communist party , which broke with moscow in the 1970 s , recognizes that its position as italy s second political force has been threatened by recent events in eastern europe it is now thinking of changing its name and dropping its hammerandsickle symbol at the heart of the debate is the question of how communist parties in industrial democracies can disassociate themselves from the failure of their soviet bloc counterparts and retain some political relevance without totally betraying their principles communism has not yet existed anywhere , argued anicet le pors , who is campaigning for change in the french communist party in my view , it remains a high ideal what s being condemned today is the perversion of socialism in the form of stalinism , and not socialism itself yet while trying to emphasize communist theory over stalinist practice , most western marxists admit they cannot ignore events in eastern europe the context in which our exceptional originality existed has changed , achille occheto , head of the italian communist party , said last week today , even the small , politically insignificant communist parties of northern europe are engaged in what is known in leftist circles as selfcriticism in western europe , though , it is perhaps only in france , spain , portugal , italy and greece that the outcome is considered important in those countries , communist parties have all played major political roles at different times since world war ii they took part briefly in coalition governments in italy in the late 1940 s and in france in the early 1980 s communists belong to an interim national unity coalition in greece today in spain and portugal , the parties were banned by rightwing dictatorships that lasted until the mid1970 s , but they survived underground in spain , communists never lost their influence over the labor movement , while in portugal they came close to seizing power after the dictatorship was overthrown in 1974 in all five countries , however , communist parties are far weaker today than they were , say , 15 years ago , losing ground to more moderate socialists and social democrats as the growing prosperity of western europe has weakened their traditional support base among industrial workers moving to the center further , with the exception of the maverick italians , western european communist parties have remained burdened by their lack of internal democracy , by their subjugation to oldtime bosses and outmoded rhetoric in the 1970 s , the italian communist party took up the concept of eurocommunism in the hope of demonstrating that a democratic form of communism was viable but the idea was never fully embraced by other communist parties in the region more recently , under mr occhetto s leadership , the italian communist party has moved even further toward the center , seeking to identify itself with social democratic rather than communist parties elsewhere in western europe and dropping calls for class struggle in favor of defense of the environment and women s rights yet eastern europe s upheaval has apparently convinced mr occhetto that more changes are necessary , including perhaps adoption of a new name that omits the word communist last week , he announced that a party congress would be held in march to elect a commission to prepare the party s new path while italy s communists are now mainly concerned with changing their public image , most other major western european parties have still to work out their internal differences , with the crisis of sovietbloc communism feeding tension by stimulating doctrinal debates and personality squabbles in spain , the longtime communist leader , santiago carrillo , was elbowed out of power several years ago , but it was not until last october s general elections that the party showed flexibility by joining the socialists in a coalition running alone in 1986 , it won 44 percent of the vote , but as part of the united left , its share of the vote rose to 89 percent last year the party s new leader , julio anguita , has nonetheless found himself struggling to explain the changes in eastern europe for those who need catechisms , perhaps there are indeed none left , he said recently but i reaffirm all my marxist ideas i have never believed in paradise we do n't have one here nor did they have one over there socialism has still to be built in contrast , moves to modernize the communist parties in france and portugal are still being blocked by their aging , orthodox bosses , georges marchais and alvaro cunhal , respectively
sampras , a firsttime semifinalist , next faces mcenroe , who commandeered the stadium court last night and operated 44thranked david wheaton like a marionette to achieve a 61 , 64 , 64 victory and earn his eighth trip to an open semifinal aggressiveness pays off mcenroe volleyed with a vengeance , and a redfaced wheaton later confessed he had been frightened away from his serveandvolley game by mcenroe s ferocious playmaking from all points of the court he hit some good shots to begin with and it kind of scared me off the net obviously that s the worst scenario for me , said wheaton , who learned firsthand that mcenroe still retains his ability to conjure worstcase scenarios for his opponents everyone kind of thought this was the beginning of the end for him this summer , but maybe he was ready to peak here mcenroe said his rehabilitation is continuing to produce rewards he 'd hoped for but not expected if i keep playing the way i'm playing , there 'll be plenty of guys scared to play me , he said praise for sampras lendl s inability to subdue sampras came as no surprise to mcenroe he s primed to be in the top ten now , said mcenroe , who was defeated by sampras at the canadian open sampras is probably , along with agassi , the one with most the potential of all and everyone knew lendl did n't seem to be on the top of his game this was the first time since 1981 that lendl , ranked third in the world and seeded third at the open , failed to drill a path to the final round instead it was sampras , a player who already volleys more decisively and insightfully than lendl , and has a youthful insouciance that overrides his inexperience , who moved into his first grand slam semifinal this is the biggest win of my career , nothing tops this , said sampras , who defeated the defending champion , mats wilander , in a fiveset second round match here in 1989 i think if i can handle lendl , i can handle mcenroe the 19yearold sampras galloped into the first grand slam quarterfinal of his career , threatened to run away with it , and ultimately delivered on his early threat when he put lendl at bay with a deep forehand approach , barged his way to the net , and snapped a high backhand volley off the sideline as lendl looked on helplessly from the baseline feeling the pressure my nerves were really pumping , my heart was really beating , sampras said of his composure as he attempted to convert his second match point after lendl used an ace to save the first as it became clear that sampras had no qualms about outgunning him , lendl , a threetime united states open champion , merely clenched his jaw and mutely appraised his opponent s progress since he served as the teenager s host in a weeklong training marathon before the 1988 masters tournament sampras said he could n't remember being so exhausted as he was the week that lendl roasted him on the practice court and in the training room and then took him aside to give him advice on the ingredients required to make it to no 1 yesterday , lendl was not so dominant a player as he had been a teacher , but sampras showed himself to be an eager student , so eager , in fact , that he could n't keep from flashing a small , private smile each time one of his 24 aces flew past lendl lendl , on the other hand , played the match as if in a personal conundrum nothing in his own game seemed to satisfy him , and even after he evened the match at two sets each , he derived no comfort from his 2817 record in fiveset epics when i was down two sets , i was telling myself , 'i'm the favored player , obviously , ' he said but i was n't hitting well enough to take full advantage i knew he would play better in the fifth set than he had in the third and fourth sometimes he gave sampras a wan smile of recognition when the teenager pounded home a perfect preface of a first serve and then , just as he 'd been drilled to do , followed it up with a pointending volley sometimes lendl exploited the newcomer s haste to reach the net and tripped him up with a service return to his sneakers sometimes the 30yearold resident of greenwich , conn , slashed his racquet through the air and glared skyward after sampras powered a ball past him but whatever lendl s mood when the match began , it grew increasingly irritable as sampras , who went into semihibernation after taking a twosetstonone lead , bounced back in the fifth set and treated his former mentor like a stranger photos john mcenroe lunging to return a shot to david wheaton in their match last night at the us open this is the biggest win of my career nothing tops this , said 19yearold pete sampras after his upset of ivan lendl yesterday at the us open \( photographs by g paul burnett new york times \)
albany , march 12 comptroller edward v regan warned today that he would not approve a new state budget unless gov mario m cuomo and legislative leaders found a way to close a budget gap he estimated at 15 billion mr regan issued the warning three weeks before a new spending plan is supposed to be in place his estimate of the gap was almost three times the figure that mr cuomo predicted last month although mr regan has no direct control over budget making , he can block access to muchneeded credit if he does not certify that the budget is balanced , the state will not be able to borrow money it needs to meet its expenses in the spring the state s fiscal reputation is clearly at stake , mr regan said in years when the state was flush , the comptroller s warnings were often ignored but this year , mr regan s estimates are expected to form the basis of negotiations last week , mr cuomo and legislative leaders said that they agreed to suspend their wrangling over revenue forecasts until the comptroller s report had been released 'i'm not the governor' the report leaves the governor and the legislature scrambling to find hundreds of millions of dollars in spending cuts or tax increases to balance the budget although mr cuomo and the legislative leaders have acknowledged a substantial gap in the 51 billion plan mr cuomo proposed in january , none of the leaders has come up with a detailed plan for the problem mr cuomo has often chided mr regan for not presenting his proposals today mr regan offered no plan on fill the 15 billion budget gap , saying , i'm not the governor he did , however , release a study by a consultant that suggested that the state could save up to 800 million a year through productivity enhancement mr cuomo said he would not comment on the report until he had read it more thoroughly , but added that he was pleased with mr regan s willingness to join with us constructively in seeking to address the budget problem 750 , 000 for consultant s study legislative officials , however , said they were unimpressed by the productivity study , by arthur andersen comapny , and cost 750 , 000 i think it s a little silly , the secretary to the assembly ways and means committee , carl carlucci , said you pay 750 , 000 for a study that says you can save money , but does n't say exactly how or where it s amazing the suggestions for productivity enhancement include reducing the time high school students walk to and from class and moving office equipment to where it is needed mr regan s forecast is the latest in a series of studies showing that tax collections would be substantially lower than mr cuomo projected it is also the most dismal last month , mr cuomo acknowledged a gap in his proposed budget of more than 500 million later , the democraticled assembly said that the gap had grown 600 million parting with senate leaders today , mr regan said the gap had ballooned to 15 billion that represents the combined shortfall for the current fiscal year , which ends on march 31 , and the next fiscal year most of the current shortfall would be carried over to next year mr regan attributed the increase in the gap to a continuing slump in incometax collections in making such a pessimistic forecast , the comptroller , a republican , parted ways with the republican leaders of the state senate , who said last week that the governor s forecast was too gloomy in an unusual move , senate leaders said they would ignore mr cuomo s proposal and work from last year s budget instead ed martin , a spokesman for the senate majority leader , ralph j marino of oyster bay , said mr regan s report affirmed the approach we are taking the main thrust of his report is we need to do something about spending , mr martin said we agree photo state comptroller edward v regan , who warned that state revenues would be lower than estimates by gov mario cuomo \( associated press \)
vladimir kvint , professor of political economy of the ussr and a former professor at the communist higher party school in moscow , is a member of the siberian school of marketoriented economists professor kvint , who is currently a distinguished lecturer at fordham university , spoke with joel kurtzman of the new york times through an interpreter q in june the communist party congress met in moscow and president gorbachev emerged as the party s undisputed leader what did mr gorbachev win \? professor kvint gorbachev s victory was a pyrrhic one heated discussions took place at the congress , but they were of no interest to anyone in the country why do i say this \? because it was very clear that the congress was attended only by people who are not really interested in the democratization of soviet society and of the economy q but did n't the congress reaffirm perestroika and give mr gorbachev support for moving ahead more rapidly with the economic reforms \? professor kvint in mid1989 , later than all the rest of the people , gorbachev understood that he failed with his first economic reforms he then moved immediately to protect himself from these failures by creating the institution of the presidency from that point on he became a dictator in the sense that as president he is not responsible to the parliament or the party let me give you an example three weeks ago , gorbachev issued a decree taking away the rank , medals and awards of general oleg d kalugin , a general in the kgb general kalugin did not hamper perestroika s progress in any way but he made disclosures against the kgb during the congress it was the first time in the history of the soviet union that a kgb general spoke out against the kgb kalugin said the kgb still exerted total control over the soviet people he charged that the kgb still listens to everyone s telephone conversations and that it still follows foreigners , and so on it was a brave step on the part of the general , but now he is not a general anymore gorbachev deprived him of everything he had gained during his life for criticizing the kgb q does mr gorbachev have the power to bring about true economic reform \? professor kvint soon , i think , boris yeltsin will take power away from gorbachev on june 12 , russia , under president yeltsin , declared the sovereignty of russian laws over soviet laws the baltic republics did it earlier the ukraine did it two weeks ago gorbachev will remain president of the soviet union , but his power will largely resemble the power of a president in a country where the prime minister is the main figure that is why gorbachev decided to join with yeltsin last week to create a commission for economic reform he is simply acknowledging that yeltsin is now emerging as the country s most powerful leader the united states should recognize the role of yeltsin as the real leader of the nation after all , who stopped the blockade of lithuania \? it was yeltsin the day after he was elected president of the russian republic , he declared that russia would establish direct ties with lithuania even if the soviet union would n't that ended the blockade of lithuania because russia has 92 percent of the soviet union s oil although oil production is down , russia could supply the united states with 2 to 25 times the amount of oil iraq now sells it q how will we see mr yeltsin s power emerge \? professor kvint yeltsin has said openly his way is the way to the market economy when he left the communist party at the congress in june , it was not just a gesture mr yeltsin already abolished more than half of the ministries in the russian republic he also created something unheard of before out of 28 ministers in russia , he created 8 that are without ministries each has only 20 people working for him the purpose of these eight ministers is to cut the central soviet bureaucracy for example , although the oil resources are in russia , they are governed by two central government ministries these two ministries in moscow deprive the oil industry of its independence yeltsin wants to abolish the power of these ministries and make the enterprises totally independent q and after that \? professor kvint the next step then is to make russia totally independent of the soviet union in hard currency the soviet union has always had a monopoly on foreign trade yeltsin has already established a new bank for foreign economic relations for the russian republic this bank will reallocate to russia all of the hardcurrency profits that now go to the soviet union from russia s exports now all of the profits from siberia s oil and gas exports go to the ussr yeltsin will keep those profits in russia q president mitterrand of france and chancellor kohl of west germany have been talking about helping the soviet union by extending credits and aid president bush has been reluctant to join in which course is correct \? professor kvint bush s course is so correct i am amazed the europeans have proposed giving about 12 billion in aid to the soviet union but the real issue is not how much aid to give , but to whom aid given to the central government not only will be misused , it will be harmful today , if you give the central government 12 billion , it means that they wo n't have to cut 12 billion from the military budget it means that the soviet union can continue to give money to castro and libya and to other negative regimes do n't forget , the soviet union , based on the size of its economy , gives proportionately six times more aid than the united states but even if all of the 12 billion in aid were to be used correctly with none of it going to the military , i have calculated that it would at best add only 05 percent to the soviet union s rate of economic growth in 1977 , when exports of western industrial goods to the soviet union were at their highest , they also contributed only about 05 percent to its rate of growth president bush s approach is right first send in the specialists to look at the country , then give aid to specific projects , not the central government q do you see the climate improving for foreign investment in the soviet union \? professor kvint each region is different siberia has the best situation azerbaijan , on the other hand , is a very dangerous territory but next to it , there is dagestan , also a muslim republic , but it is a republic that is stable in the near future , political risk will be reduced in the baltic republics as they acquire real economic independence but the key fact to remember is that the soviet union should not be thought of as a single unit in fact , it will very soon cease to be a single state photo vladimir kvint \( neil boenzi the new york times \) drawing
as secretary of state baker departs for moscow to try to wrap up a strategic arms accord , state department officials raise doubts about mikhail gorbachev s ability to deliver they may believe what they say , but the lastminute doubtsowing has a selfserving quality the state department s message seems to be that if the two sides do n't resolve the few remaining issues , a startless summit meeting can be blamed on mr gorbachev s domestic problems , not on president bush s reluctance to compromise or , if the two sides do agree , that will reflect the great diplomatic and bargaining prowess of the bush administration whatever games are being played , none of the remaining strategic arms issues are sufficiently troublesome to be treaty blockers and whether or not mr gorbachev is in deep trouble at home , washington has an overriding interest in nailing down arms reductions both sides' longterm interests call for wrapping up a start treaty by the may 30 summit meeting , as they pledged to do months ago at malta washington and moscow were well on their way to finishing start when mr baker and foreign minister shevardnadze met in early april but then hitches developed the united states proposed banning mobile missiles armed with multiple warheads moscow urged postponing the issue , which is reasonable in principle , both sides would be better off without multiplewarhead missiles missiles with one warhead could destroy no more than a single opposing missile , leaving either side little to gain from shooting first but washington s proposal was onesided because only moscow has multiwarhead missiles that are mobile moscow , for its part , seemed to stiffen on two issues on sealaunched cruise missiles , the soviets had previously agreed for each side simply to declare how many it planned to build but in april , they renewed their earlier insistence on legally binding limits these limits require verification procedures that are difficult to work out on airlaunched cruise missiles , moscow wants all with a range of 600 kilometers or more to count as strategic weapons washington wants to limit only airlaunched cruise missiles with a 1 , 000kilometer range soviet negotiators believe this issue was resolved in their favor earlier , but the us says it has no clear record of that a compromise on airlaunched cruise missiles hardly seems beyond the wit of the two sides if political leaders want an accord and the multiwarhead and sealaunched cruise missile issues might best be deferred until start 2 state department officials seem to be showing little sense of urgency they reinforce this impression by casting doubt on mr gorbachev s capacity to conclude start now that may be a shrewd political tactic but it also could signal a weakening of washington s resolve to make the compromises needed to lock in a landmark arms control treaty
to ease a worsening soviet cigarette shortage , america s two largest tobacco companies said yesterday that they would sell 34 billion cigarettes to the soviet union , or more than a month s supply philip morris , the nation s largest tobacco company , plans to sell more than 20 billion cigarettes to the soviets , and rjr nabisco , the second largest , plans to sell 14 billion the move comes none too soon for soviet smokers the shortage has led to street demonstrations and reportedly to riots in some cities philip morris s shipments will begin as early as the end of this month , and rjr nabisco s may begin by the first week of october the american cigarettes are destined for the russian republic , which has half the soviet population , but presumably that would free scarce domestic cigarettes for the rest of the soviet union cigarettes are sold for widely varying prices in different countries and are heavily taxed but if the two companies' shipments were valued at 1989 united states prices , excluding taxes , the cigarettes to be sold to the soviet union would be worth about 19 billion , or a little over a dollar a pack it is an indication of the soviet government s strong desire for the cigarettes that it has agreed to pay in scarce hard currency and countertrade items that can easily be sold for cash a philip morris spokesman declined to say what those items were but said the company was very comfortable with the items because they are readily and clearly marketable oil is one possibility , because the soviet union is a large producer of oil it is unclear why the soviets could not sell the items in question for the needed cash neither the philip morris companies nor rjr nabisco would disclose all the terms of the transaction , partly because the soviet union is still negotiating with other tobacco companies in the united states and other countries but philip morris said it planned to ship marlboros , the world s bestselling brand , as well as a selection of its other brands yet to be determined rjr nabisco plans to sell winstons and other brands the tobacco merchants association , a trade group , estimated that soviet consumption totaled about 4185 billion cigarettes in 1989 , or about 80 percent of the 524 billion smoked in the united states raymond j pritchard , chairman and chief executive of brown williamson , the nation s no 3 cigarette maker , said the soviet shortage could be equivalent to a shortfall of perhaps 200 billion cigarettes a year he said he had learned while traveling in bulgaria that 11 of 20 soviet cigarette plants had been shut down for repair or maintenance it was a major bureaucratic screwup , he said problem in bulgaria in addition , bulgaria , which provided nearly all of the 55 billion cigarettes the soviet union usually imports , started experiencing shortages of cellulose acetate , a material used for cigarette filters , because of a lack of hard currency the imports from bulgaria dropped very dramatically , worsening the shortage that was already apparent in the soviet union , mr pritchard said brown williamson , a unit of bat industries of london , is also negotiating with the soviet union for a large order of cigarettes but will probably sell the less expensive cigarettes known as generics the company said that by yesterday it had not received word on its bid the shipments by philip morris and rjr nabisco , which are the largest single export orders ever for both companies , may take as long as two weeks to ship to ports in europe like antwerp , belgium it may take another two weeks for land transport to the soviet union both companies are considering air freight for speedier shipment worldwide exports for philip morris are about 360 billion cigarettes and about 101 billion for rjr nabisco us production capacity the soviet order will tax philip morris s production capacity in the united states because demand is already high for many of its brands , especially marlboro , said john a dollison , a company spokesman the cigarettes produced for russia will be made in american factories , and an undetermined number of philip morris factories in other countries we will be looking to do deals with other republics of the soviet union , mr dollison said we are only too keen to talk the philip morris cigarettes will be sent between late september 1990 and december 1991 and the rjr cigarettes between october 1990 and september 1991 philip morris also announced that it planned to sell cigarettes to the soviet union over the long term as well it said that it signed two agreements with the soviet government one provides for the continuing supply of significant quantities of cigarettes to the russian republic between 1992 to 1995 the second agreement provides for philip morris to provide technical assistance to modernize antiquated soviet cigarette factories rjr nabisco is also close to signing similar agreements , said brenda h follmer , an rjr nabisco spokeswoman the company may produce winston cigarettes at the existing uritsky cigarette plant in leningrad and may help with the modernization of other cigarette factories , ms follmer said no health warning while phillip morris and rjr nabisco said the cigarettes destined for the soviet union will be identical in every way to american cigarettes , they acknowledged that the cigarettes would lack the surgeon general s health warning about cancer and other diseases linked to smoking we put whatever labels are required by local government authorities , ms follmer said it is unclear how much the american cigarettes will sell for , but there were reports that a pack of marlboros were selling for up to 20 rubles , or 32 , on the moscow black market the average monthly wage for a soviet worker is 240 rubles earlier this summer , the cigarette shortage added to public outrage over shortages of basic foodstuffs last month , staterun newspapers said that soviet authorities were cracking down on black marketeers hoarding cigarettes and that a moscow factory was running overtime to produce 45 million cigarettes in 24 hours prime minister nikolai ryzhkov sought to assure the soviet union s 70 million smokers that more cigarettes both domestic and imported would be available soon but street demonstrations have grown in leningrad and especially in moscow
washington , july 5 the justice department filed a suit today against the american institute of architects contending that the professional group unreasonably restrained price competition at the same time , lawyers for the department and the institute proposed an agreement that , if accepted by a federal district judge , would settle the government s lawsuit the institute is a professional association representing 54 , 000 architects , about twothirds of the registered architects in the country in its suit , the justice department invoked the sherman antitrust act , which was enacted in 1890 to break up the industrial monopolies created by the 19thcentury robber barons the act has been successfully applied by the justice department and the federal trade commission against professional associations , including those representing civil engineers , accountants and lawyers antitrust lawyers outside the government said the the suit also reflected increased aggressiveness by the antitrust division , now headed by james rill under the reagan administration , the division was largely guided by freemarket economic theories and was less assertive than in the past the justice department also used the antitrust act against the architects' group in 1972 in a case involving price quotations on bids today s action , which grew out of an investigation begun in the reagan administration , represented a much broader complaint of anticompetitive activity , justice department officials said justice department lawyers said they hoped the suit would lead to increased competition in the pricing of architectural services like planning , designing and supervising construction of office towers , hospitals , airports and industrial parks it is certainly important from our perspective to let people in various professions know that competition plays as important a role in the professions as it does in any industry , said robert e bloch , chief of antitrust division s section on professions and intellectual property 'no laws were violated' but a lawyer for the architects' group insisted that price competition already existed in the profession and said the suit would probably not lead to lower fees our position has always been that no laws were violated and the filing today does not establish that any laws were violated , said the lawyer , david k perdue , associate general counsel for the institute architects are already cutting fees in new york in response to a virtual evaporation of significant new construction projects , a situation that is having ripple effects elsewhere in the country the antitrust division s increased aggressiveness has become apparent in a number of recent cases last year it began an investigation into whether some elite east coast colleges fixed prices in setting tuition the division has also undertaken a pricefixing investigation into the fares of some of the country s major airlines and earlier this year , it indicted three dentists in arizona on charges of illegally setting patient fees none of these cases have been resolved today s suit charges that the institute entered into an unlawful agreement to prohibit members from engaging in competitive bidding , discounting fees and providing free services under the proposed settlement , the institute would not admit wrongdoing but would be prohibited from having a code of ethics whose aim is to discourage competition the suit says that from august 1984 to at least february 1985 , the architects' group discouraged price competition the justice department s complaint against the group cited a policy statement adopted by the chicago chapter that specifically prohibited price competition lawyers for the justice department , who declined to elaborate on that evidence , maintained that the institute was legally responsible for the actions of its local chapters they said in the suit that the group s national officers endorsed the policy statement adopted by the chicago branch the suit said thomas j eyerman , president of the chicago chapter , was responsible for the distribution of 6 , 000 copies of the statement to institute members and purchasers of architectural services in seven states policy is called shortlived the effects of the conspiracy have been to unreasonably restrain price competition among aia members in the sale of their services and to deprive customers seeking the services of aia members of the benefits of free and open competition in the sale of such services , the suit said mr perdue , the lawyer for the institute , said the policy statement was shortlived it was issued by the chicago chapter in 1984 on the subject of fees and compensations and it was rescinded within a few months there was no intention to violate the antitrust act the suit comes as the organization is already under a court order issued in 1972 that order was aimed at allowing its members to submit price quotations on bids for architectural services if today s settlement is approved , the institute would be prohibited from issuing any codes of ethics that violate antitrust laws , and each of the group s 280 state and local chapters would be required to withdraw any provisions in their codes that suppress competition the institute would also be required to begin a program to insure that it does not renew any anticompetitive practices and would pay the government 50 , 000 as partial compensation for the cost of the justice department s investigation
chicago , march 1 the decentralization of chicago s school system , the nation s third largest , hit its first serious snag this week as several communities were divided over the dismissal of principals by parentled councils protests have disrupted classes at half a dozen schools students have pulled fire alarms and walked out of classes , and teachers have joined picket lines hundreds of angry parents and teachers packed a board of education meeting wednesday to protest dismissals they say were based on race or ethnicity today , hundreds of students were involved in a melee at the racially mixed morgan park high school on the southwest side during a protest over the removal of the white principal six students and two police officers were injured , none seriously ten students were arrested , and classes were suspended for the day the recent unrest is the first serious trouble since the transfer of power last fall from the central board of education to parentled councils at each of the city s 541 public schools in at least six areas , outraged parents and community residents say they want to recall their school council members only a few schools affected this is becoming very destructive , said rev dante plata , who heads a hispanic group in a community where several schools are in turmoil we 're going to march on city hall and close the schools down advocates of decentralization say only a fraction of the schools are being disrupted what looks like a chaotic situation that s democracy , said ellis levin , a democratic state representative from chicago who heads the house committee that oversees decentralization school reform is not guaranteed to work 100 percent in every school , but it ca n't be any worse than it was before , he said in 1987 , education secretary william j bennett called chicago public schools the nation s worst the decentralization , the most ambitious ever tried in this country , was put into place without incident last october when 5 , 400 parents , teachers and community representatives serving on local councils were given the authority to approve budgets , determine curriculums and hire and fire principals each council has six parents , two teachers and two community representatives the parent members are elected by parents , teachers by teachers and the representatives by area residents first major decision there have been complaints that the central board has been slow to train the local councils and answer their questions , tasks that are among the main functions retained by the central board under decentralization but few people had criticized the councils themselves until this week the controversy erupted when half the local school councils faced the first major decision whether to retain their current principals or to seek replacements chicago s 541 principals have been working under temporary contracts until the school councils were in place by wednesday , the target date set by the school board , decisions to keep or dismiss the principals were due at 270 schools where principals' contracts expire this june contracts of principals at the remaining schools expire in 1991 tensions have run especially high at three predominantly hispanic schools , where white principals say they are being forced out because they are not hispanic although many of those protesting the dismissal of the principals have been hispanic , hispanic council members say that the nonhispanic white principals and staffs have tried to thwart the councils , and in some cases have used ethnic slurs in addressing them in an ethnically polarized vote on friday , the hispanic majority of the parent council at burns elementary school voted , 6 to 3 , against renewing the contract of donald kriz , who has been principal for 10 years nearly all the school s 950 students walked out of classes on monday in support of mr kriz , who is white defending the ouster , william velez , president of the local school council at burns elementary , said from the very first moment , the principal and staff demonstrated that they do n't want the council there they have used our limited experience as a weapon against us we want someone who respects the council ousted after 12 years the population of chicago is about 40 percent white , 40 percent black and 20 percent hispanic many problems stem from cultural and language barriers between principals who speak no spanish and councils in which few or no members speak english that was the case at spry elementary school , where ben natzke , a nonhispanic white , was ousted last week after 12 years as principal of the predominantly hispanic school on the southwest side to this day , i have n't been told why i was voted out , said mr natzke it s as if they 're saying , 'if you 're not hispanic , then get out' under the state law providing for the decentralization , neither the school superintendent nor the central board has the authority to intervene , except in rare instances , as when a council is completely nonfunctional while some school councils are considering whether to call another vote on their principals , advocates of change are hoping the councils will not give in to public pressure 'the essence of reform' what s at stake here is the essence of school reform , said dan solis , executive director of united neighborhood organization , a hispanic community group that ran hispanic slates in the council elections last fall principals and their supporters say mr solis s group planted on these councils dissidents who do not represent community sentiment mr solis has dismissed the allegations as attempts to undercut the councils what has become apparent is the central role that politics plays on the councils just because you reduce it to the grassroots level does n't mean you 're going to eliminate politics , even of the most virulent kind , said j s fuerst , a professor of social welfare policy at loyola university , who has been critical of decentralization photo the decentralization of chicago s school system is dividing communities as some parentled councils have been ousting principals

albany , oct 19 with new york city s jail population reaching an alltime high this week , city officials , raising the specter of an early release of prisoners , gained permission today to add 775 slots to the jail system the new slots will be created by moving beds closer together at several rikers island dormitories some private groups said they were concerned that the decision would add to the tension on the island just last month , the new york state commission of correction denied a request from the city for 400 new beds , citing deep concerns about the city s ability to prevent the kind of disturbances at rikers island that plagued the crowded complex this summer and left more than 200 inmates and guards injured but the commission reversed course today , saying there was a crisis need for the new beds and that the city had taken several recent steps at rikers to avert new outbreaks among these were more secure guard stations , an improved communications system and an increased stock of riot gear , commission members said prisoners' space will decrease the emergency beds approved today are separate from the up to 3 , 100 new beds called for by the city s correction commissioner , allyn r sielaff , under his longterm plans for new jail space city correction officials said they were confident they could safely handle the expansion , and noted that none of the new beds would be added at either of the two rikers institutions where the worst violence occurred this summer rikers island consists of eight penal institutions kept separate by guards and barbedwire fences some private groups that monitor the jails , however , said that adding new beds could well intensify violence at a complex that is already seriously overcrowded by state standards these standards call for each prisoner to have at least 50 square feet of space in taking its action today the commission broadened the number of institutions where it would allow this minimum to drop to 40 square feet a prisoner the number of prisoners either serving time or awaiting trial in new york jails hit 21 , 136 last monday , the highest total in the history of the system and nearly three times the level of a decade ago , said hector l eugui , the correction department s deputy chief for facility operations based on past seasonal fluctuations , he added , the figure is expected to increase in coming weeks capacity is exceeded the population is at about 105 percent of the city s legal capacity for prisoners , although new york has already been allowed under court order to exceed this capacity the city was last forced to free prisoners in 1983 , when judge morris e lasker of federal district court in manhattan issued an order that resulted in the release of 611 pretrial detainees the realignment of beds , often referred to as squeezing in the parlance of jail officials , could be accomplished immediately , a spokesman for the correction department said the commission s vote today authorizes the addition of about 575 beds at two institutions within rikers , the correctional institution for men and the rose m singer center , which houses female inmates the remaining 200 beds would be spread among smaller complexes in the bronx , brooklyn and queens the addition of new beds drew an immediate call from the head of the correction officers union , phil seelig , for hiring of more jail guards to keep pace robert gangi , the executive director of the correctional association of new york , a nonprofit group concerned with criminaljustice issues , denounced the plan as a march to folly and said the city should instead explore ways to decrease the jail population by releasing nonviolent offenders with a low bail putting more people closer together obviously increases the risk of violence , either between inmates or between inmates and guards , mr gangi said the chairman of the correction commission , william g mcmahon , said the panel reserved the right to revoke its approval of the new beds if it saw any indication that the city was not capable of insuring safety at rikers
there is a dividing line between cutting costs and cutting corners not all manufacturers recognize and respect this border , and that accounts for the difference between a good cheap product and a product that is merely cheap in lowcost loudspeakers , for example , compromises are unavoidable but if these compromises are intelligently chosen and balanced against other design considerations so as to minimize their effect , the result can be musically gratifying and a bargain to boot this point is exemplified in several bottomprice loudspeakers made by companies such as pinnacle , mordauntshort , bicventuri , boston acoustics and celestion none of these speakers , priced between 179 and 250 a pair , would quicken the pulse of passionate aficionados , but they rank among the best to be had for the money their perspicacious designers managed to shave costs at precisely those points that least detract from the subjective experience of music speakers in this class have collective limitations in the lower range they are all small , for size itself is a cost factor and while their compactness is a boon to listeners lacking space for larger speakers , these bantams cannot probe the bottom of the musical scale low notes are a little faint , and great orchestral groundswells lose much of their sweeping force yet within their range , and mainly in music of a lighter texture , these speakers are tonally truthful and altogether pleasant each speaker has its own sonic flavor for example , the lowestpriced model in this group , the pinnacle pn5 \( 179 a pair \) sounds surprisingly rich for a speaker and produces a sense of a blended orchestral mass this may be credited to a flared and angled duct within its enclosure that bolsters response at the low end , though perhaps at the expense of clarity in that range by contrast , the mordauntshort ms310 \( 229 a pair \) is marked by a slightly reticent but more clearly articulated bass and precisely delineated sonic detail at the top depending on personal taste , listeners may have a clearcut preference for one or the other to achieve its attractive price , pinnacle limits powerhandling capacity to 50 watts , which is enough for relatively small rooms with amplifiers of modest power ratings the speaker sounds best \( which is very good indeed \) at relatively low volume levels the mordauntshort handles heftier wattage despite its diminutive dimensions of 11 x 7 x 8 inches , and an overload protector allows it to be safely connected perhaps as an auxiliary speaker to amplifiers or receivers rated as high as 300 watts an exceptional performer and outstanding value in this price bracket is the newly introduced bicventuri v62 , whose angled cabinet contributes to uniform sound dispersion and belies by its elegant carpentry the speaker s price of 199 a pair here , too , a flared internal bass duct adds richness to the lower range , while a dome tweeter lends a feeling of airy spaciousness to the treble just a notch up the price scale , the choice of musically competent speakers broadens , but one could hardly find anything better than the boston acoustics a60 series ii or the celestion 3 , listing , respectively , at 240 and 250 a pair being slightly larger than the models already mentioned , they are somewhat more at ease in the lower tonal regions though they may not be able to replicate deep orchestral sonorities or the insouciant thump of a slapped bass in a jazz combo , they at least hint quite suggestively at music s lower depths the boston acoustics a60 series ii has long been a standby for listeners who appreciate it for the way it pampers their ears while preserving their piggy banks it has a sweetness of sound that softens eventual traces of harshness in a recording and flatters the string instruments tonal detail is not unduly emphasized , but it s all there , stated smoothly with a kind of suave discretion the designers wisely forgo any attempt to bolster the low frequencies by false resonance in consequence , the bass is true in timbre a rare achievement in so small a speaker overall , the sound is pleasing and persuasive , even to listeners who actually go to concerts the celestion 3 , a new british design , is the only speaker in this group to employ a metallic tweeter dome while the others use a plastic molding as the vibrating part that generates the highs , celestion opts for titanium a rigid , lightweight metal the result is a crisp treble with sharp definition of tonal detail , set in the context of a nicely balanced overall response this speaker will appeal to listeners with a liking for an incisive upper range of the kind much favored these days and usually heard only in more expensive speakers
cordoba , argentina at the turn of the century , rich as an argentine was a parisian simile for great wealth here in the center of the country , surrounded by pampas , there are outsized copies of french mansions all our grandparents were rich , said a gracious local lady who is n't talk focuses on the crisis argentines no longer lift an eyebrow when you ask what s wrong with their country , why it has failed they ask the same question , though the answers are diffuse , uncertain , contradictory if conventional development theory were right , argentina should be better off and more confident than canada it has vast resources , a varied but mostly temperate climate , a very low population density some 33 million on land five times the size of france , though half are around buenos aires , an almost exclusively european population with no racial or serious ethnic problems , neartotal literacy but it has a foreign debt it ca n't service of 62 billion , which means it received huge credits and wasted much of them for the last 60 years at least , with minor interruptions , it has given itself bad government so conventional development theory has it wrong to the extent that it does n't take enough account of the people , and argentina went seriously off track with its own bad mistakes onethird of the nation , echoing franklin roosevelt , is and always has been miserable in an unpopular book called why argentina does n't function , roberto roth , a businessman , lists the old argentine convictions of superiority disdain for north americans as yokels too busy making money to know how to live , indulgence for europeans as failed emigrants left behind to look after the castles and cathedrals , and a view of other latins as poor , backward relatives the core of the problem , he says , is that the society has never been fairly represented by the political system and that a financial nation always manipulated power behind scenes we have socialism without planning , and capitalism without money , quips one landowner we socialized the losses and exported the profits , says another argentina has none of the excuses of eastern europe , and a lot of the same difficulties in establishing a healthy democracy without experience some people are cautiously optimistic about president carlos saul menem , the peronist candidate who was honestly elected a year ago after president raul alfonsin was forced to quit his incomplete term in a storm of hyperinflation some bemoaned the same old merrygoround cordoba s governor , eduardo angeloz , was the candidate of mr alfonsin s party , who took only a couple of provinces , but his base here still gives him a national position he is a tall , hulking man of great vigor , and he says most of the right things he has fallen out with mr alfonsin , who is against his proposal for a national political accord , though he criticizes mr menem , whose party is also split down the middle consensus here is rhetorical , scarcely practical there is a wry , selfdeprecating awareness that argentina fell off the world , or never got sensibly on board it was always blaming others the great waves of change sweeping europe and other countries seem reduced to ripples here people know about it , but do n't feel much affected we do n't live in a democratic neighborhood , said an argentine who is a senior international civil servant spain s successful transformation to democracy , he pointed out , owed a lot to the desire to join the european community , which made that a condition the importance of outside regional constraints is highlighted in this part of the world , the kind of constraints deriving from the example of successful neighbors and not those imposed by a distant superpower with strategic preoccupations the fragile democracies of south america do provide some support to each other , but nothing like the firmly established requirements of europe it is another reason , besides the need for a larger economic base , that much more energetic regional cooperation is advisable the us should encourage it , as it did in europe information is moving the world people here speak of models and they know what has failed , including their own frenetic zigzags after all , the way out is out , into the mainstream it s hard to swallow , especially with injured pride , but argentina s example only confirms that shangrila is a selfdeluding oasis this colonial city , with the continent s secondoldest university and monuments of an unforgotten frontier , is another place to see the earth budge splendor is n't reliable , nor selfimportance partners matter
the united states is malled , so we have had to look at alternative ways of expanding our business , said stephen riggio , the company s vice president i think the company will place more emphasis on these stores in the next few years than on our traditional bookstores 20 superstores' possible he predicted that there might be as many as 20 superstores by the end of next year the company s move reflects several factors after a rapid period of expansion , there are few attractive malls in which b dalton or its main rival , waldenbooks , does not already have a store at the same time , the chains have discovered that the bestseller market is fickle and you have to try to appeal to the solid , regular reader , said constance sayre , a publishing consultant at market partners international in addition , new computer software has made it easier to cope with huge inventories but although the diversification appears to be a logical step , b dalton could face problems simply because the new business will be radically different from the one it knows best huge stores require highly trained workers , whereas the staff at b dalton s current stores generally need little knowledge of books moreover , the selection of inventory is complex and the overhead is much higher than in smaller stores sounds ambitious to me' it is very tough to operate stores like this , said robert diromualdo , the chief executive of book inventory systems , an ann arbor , mich , company that owns the 13 borders bookstores , each of which stocks more than 100 , 000 titles you have to manage an inventory that is not only huge but also everchanging we 're specialized in this , and we find it difficult he added , twenty stores sounds ambitious to me borders has expanded rapidly in recent years the crown chain has also recently opened some larger stores , although none as big as the barnes noble in st paul at the same time , large independent stores like the tattered cover in denver have grown increasingly sophisticated to meet the challenge of the chains thus , b dalton will face severe competition still , mr riggio said he saw tremendous opportunities in stores with a vast selection he emphasized that the company had some experience with big stores through its large barnes noble outlet on lower fifth avenue in new york city 'designed to lure the browser' the st paul store , a model for those to come , will have wooden shelves , antique furniture , comfortable seating and a knowledgeable staff it s designed to lure the browser , and it s a statement that attracting readers of sidney sheldon is no longer enough , ms sayre said apart from the 850 b dalton and barnes noble stores , the company also owns four scribners book shops and 40 doubleday stores
if their 1989 performances can be viewed as a prelude , sid fernandez and jose deleon could be ready to burst onto the level of virtuoso pitchers this year a study of 1989 pitching records finds their names dominating various areas they worked so effectively , in fact , that it would seem that they should have gained more victories deleon , the st louis righthander who four years earlier had a 219 record with pittsburgh , and fernandez , who has eclipsed ron darling on the mets' staff , ranked onetwo among national league starting pitchers in lowest opposition batting average \( 197 , 198 \) , onetwo in fewest hits allowed per nine innings \( 636 , 644 \) , twofour in fewest baserunners per nine innings \( 953 , 977 \) and fivetwo in most strikeouts per nine innings \( 739 , 813 \) deleon , a few days short of being a sixyear major leaguer , finished with a 1612 record and a 305 earned run average fernandez , who has five and a half seasons in the majors , had a 145 record and a 283 era the cardinals are deleon s third team the pirates and the chicago white sox gave up on him , prematurely , it would seem now obviously he s never won 20 games , dal maxvill , the cardinals' general manager , said but i think he s just on the brink of being able to do that now i guess that s the mark of an outstanding pitcher , one who when he goes into spring training you say if he stays healthy , he has a chance to win 20 the hershisers , the violas , the clemenses , that type of guy he s approaching that he s not there yet he needs consistency the difference between this deleon and the one who lost 19 games in 1985 , maxvill said , is his improved control and his maturing outlook he s throwing more strikes he s more consistent with his control , the executive said before , he 'd throw ball one , ball two , then take something off and throw a very hittable pitch also , he does n't get as flustered as he used to when someone made a mistake that comes with maturity fernandez has shown flashes , even halfseasons , of topflight pitching , but he has not put together the outstanding season that he often seems to have hinted at he s going to have a better chance to be a bigger winner if he goes the distance more often , frank cashen , the mets' general manager , said we have had a propensity in the past to yank him after six or seven as he gets stronger and goes longer , it 'll help his wonlost record he just needs a couple good things to happen , a couple breaks fernandez s inability to last longer is not his fault alone it is also the result of a lack of confidence in him cashen acknowledged that manager dave johnson has not been able to view the lefthander with the secure feeling he has in other starters sid s physical condition has always been a point of conjecture , cashen said we 'd like to see him pitch at 215 pounds someday he should give himself a chance to pitch at that all year and see what happens he usually comes in to spring training in good shape and puts on weight during the season what is the most fernandez has weighed while pitching \? i ca n't say , cashen said , because it might scare you ryan s amazing feat perhaps the most remarkable result of a study of nineinning pitching ratios is nolan ryan s ratio of 1132 strikeouts ryan , who will be 43 years old in 10 days , was nearly three strikeouts ahead of the no 2 man on the list of 78 major league starters who pitched at least 162 innings ryan was also the best in fewest hits per nine innings , allowing 609 bret saberhagen was no 1 in baserunners per nine , permitting 871 he was the only qualifying starter who averaged less than one runner per inning at the other end of the baserunner barometer , bob knepper reclaimed the no 1 spot he held in 1987 pitching for two teams , knepper allowed 1462 baserunners , even worse than his 1439 ratio in 1987 bobby witt of texas , whose penchant for walking people has at times ranked him beyond knepper range , was only third worst in the majors with 1380 baserunners per nine innings in his previous three seasons , his ratios have been , from his rookie year , 1575 , 1617 and 1218 from teammates to rivals in 1982 and 1983 , sid fernandez and ken howell were minor league teammates in the los angeles dodgers' organization now they are pitching opponents in the national league east and are further linked by the surprising nature of their new threeyear contracts fernandez , at 605 million , is surprisingly low howell , at 475 million , is surprisingly high howell , a 29yearold righthander , spent four seasons with the dodgers as a relief pitcher he started for philadelphia last season and compiled a 1212 record , giving him a career record of 30 victories and 41 losses last month , he signed a oneyear contract with the phillies for 615 , 000 last week he agreed to a threeyear contract , in place of the original , for 475 million we took a chance on the dollars , lee thomas , the phillies' general manager , said , explaining the new contract but he could be a free agent after next season , so we could 've been gambling if we had waited he has the stuff to be a no 1 pitcher steve greenberg , howell s agent , explained that even when he and the phillies negotiated the oneyear contract , they planned to discuss a multiyear deal
poiret the unwavering popularity of twoyearold poiret attests to the paucity of competent , moderately priced restaurants on the upper west side this lively bistro is the least institutionallooking link in the ark restaurants chain , which also includes ernie s , america and b smith s some of the food tastes as if it were conceived in a central commissary , but considering the neighborhood alternatives , the locals do n't gripe a visit to poiret several months after it opened was more notable for its din than for dinner the room was shatteringly loud and overcrowded since then , management has muffled the noise considerably by adding carpet votive candles and indirect lighting make for a more relaxed scene one problem with some chain restaurants , or at least places with absentee owners , is the lack of an easily identifiable leader , someone with authority and a longterm interest in the restaurant s survival in two out of three visits , my party arrived and stood unacknowledged inside the entrance for several minutes , like a foursome that had just wandered into the wrong office party on a third visit , an exceptionally cordial hostess apologized for the backlog in reservations and offered us a glass of wine which we drank standing off in one corner of the room the pace of the kitchen and the service staff can be erratic as both struggle to keep up with mounting orders the food at its best is satisfying but not memorable among the more reliable options are a somewhat chewy but flavorful steak au poivre with a mildly peppery brandy sauce , bland mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts nicely charred , juicy lamb chops with dry couscous , and a moist roasted chicken with golden shoestring potatoes the kitchen stumbles when it attempts bistro classics like navarin of lamb and carbonade of beef the navarin was not lacking flavor , but the lamb had been cooked to stringy dryness and came with more of that saharadry couscous carbonade , a flemish dish in which cubes of beef are browned and then cooked with beer , onions and vegetables , suffered the same fate as the navarin in fact , the two dishes even looked the same on the plate with the same couscous among seafood offerings , salmon paillard is moist and tasty , served over mixed greens , tomato , spinach and fresh chervil sole meuniere is competently done , too , with green beans , brussels sprouts and more of that couscous two entree salads sampled were the nicely grilled shrimp over curly chicory and grilled red peppers in a light vinaigrette , and the salade nicoise , slightly dry cubes of grilled tuna atop sliced potatoes , black olives , greens and hardboiled eggs poiret keeps its wine prices in line with the entrees , and the selection is varied among whites , you ca n't go wrong with the latour chardonnay for 17 or a pinot blanc from alsace for 16 in reds , good buys include the 1984 chateau meyney for 23 and a 1988 crozeshermitage for 21 except for a subtle cream of asparagus soup , sweet steamed clams , and grilled bleu de bresse with lettuce and tomatoes , appetizers are forgettable socalled mediterranean fish soup was a thick , lackluster puree with a solitary shrimp submerged in it and inferiorquality smoked salmon came out looking like something at an airport snack bar if you are a fan of paperthin , buttery apple tart , save room for this one otherwise , the creme caramel is fine , as is what the menu calls marjolaine cake layers of genoise , praline and chocolate a hot raspberry souffle is more air than flavor at this time of year , you would be better off with fresh strawberries and devon cream while it lacks the character and lusty charm of a familyrun bistro , poiret has convenience and a seemingly successful formula going for it in this neighborhood , that is no small accomplishment chez louis when this twofisted bistro came along in 1985 , it presaged what has by now become a fullscale revolt against overstylized food served in teaparty portions david liederman \( of david s cookies \) set out to emulate his gallic hero , the late antoine magnin of chez l'ami louis in paris , a glorious hovel on the right bank that features game and poultry roasted over wood fires for the first few years , new york s chez louis turned out some soulful and seductive fare , but recent visits indicate that the fires have dimmed somewhat chez louis bears no resemblance to its parisian icon it has a spacious bar in front and an elevated dining room in the back that faces an urban courtyard the room is done in florid red wallpaper with framed toulouselautrec posters all about some of the dishes i have enjoyed in the past now seem carelessly assembled and erratically seasoned take , for example , a hallmark dish here , the herbed roasted chicken for two on my first visit , the bird had been cooked so long that the breast meat was paperydry , and even the thigh was slightly overcooked on a second sampling it was right on target the herbinfused chicken stock sauce and roasted garlic were delicious both times

randall jarrell a literary life by william h pritchard illustrated 338 pp new york michael di capua books farrar , straus giroux 25 selected poems by randall jarrell edited by william h pritchard 115 pp new york michael di capua books farrar , straus giroux 1795 randall jarrell was the best poetry critic of his time , but of course he wanted to be the best poet during his lifetime , the reviews of his poetry were mixed , and now , 25 years after his death , his quality as a poet is still debated there has been no final verdict , and in randall jarrell a literary life , william h pritchard has attempted to arrive at one , to make up posterity s mind the book brings jarrell vividly to life so vividly , in fact , that i found myself wondering how the critic in him would have judged the poetry if it had been written by someone else in a review of oscar williams , jarrell said that his poems gave the impression of having been written on a typewriter by a typewriter would he have said of his own work that it was like a book written by a book \? this was how some reviewers felt that there was too much literature and too little life in his poems mr pritchard disagrees and as a disagreer he is one of the best in the business in his frost a literary life reconsidered , he rescued robert frost from lawrance thompson s smoldering biography in seeing through everything , mr pritchard disagreed with some of the established pieties about the major english writers between the two wars a professor at amherst college and a frequent book reviewer , he is the kind of close reader colorful and idiosyncratic that jarrell would have approved though i 've looked forward to jarrell as a perfect subject for mr pritchard , i 've wondered too whether he may not have felt a bit like a surgeon who , when he takes up the knife , ca n't be sure whether he will save or kill the patient to write , even to read , a biography of a poet is truly to look a gift horse in the mouth , for all too often the poet s life consists of only those things that were n't good enough to go into his poems the life merely makes the poems incredible a modern poet tells you , in a disguised , metaphorical way , everything you have no business knowing about him to put the poems back into the life is , in a sense , to undo art which is why so many writers dread biographers john berryman , a friend of jarrell s , was one of my favorite poets until i read john haffenden s biography after finishing the book , i felt that i could only see through berryman s poems they could never have again the brilliant opacities i once found in them mr pritchard knows the hazards of biography as well as anyone and tells us right off that he is no singleminded admirer of jarrell s verse the early poems were grandiose , toneless , highprophetic , full of the ironyoffate theme , of which young poets are often fond while selfcriticism is often the very substance or soul of modern poetry , jarrell showed a relative inability or unwillingness to be very critical of his work mr pritchard cites john crowe ransom s observation that jarrell s poetry was almost ruined by attempting to put william empson s doctrine of ambiguity into practice malcolm cowley called jarrell a swaggering rhetorician who lacked the central core of belief mr pritchard complains of portentousness and vatic profundity and finds some poems simply not powerful or interesting enough sometimes the poems suffer from flatness , sometimes from an overabundance of juxtapositions and associations jarrell himself is described as narcissistic , a man who was forever correcting his friends' literary opinions in public but received suggestions about his own poems with disbelief and dismissal according to mr pritchard , jarrell learned almost nothing from his contemporaries though poetry itself is a kind of tact , his tactlessness was legendary sexually unaggressive and fastidious to the point of prudishness , jarrell was little prone to questionings and explorations of his own behavior , nor was he plagued so it appears with a sense of guilt how can you make a poet out of such material , the reader wonders , but mr pritchard is not daunted though poets are not always regular fellows , it does n't matter , so long as they can write poems as good as jarrell s 'losses or a girl in a library or the woman at the washington zoo as jarrell himself says in a girl in a library , the ways we miss our lives are life wisely , mr pritchard tells us only what is necessary about jarrell s life , for it was not especially eventful or momentous and did n't throw much light on his work as a child , he lived in tennessee and california his father and mother were divorced when he was still a boy jarrell was a brilliant student who had john crowe ransom , allen tate and robert penn warren as teachers for most of his life he taught in colleges around the country he married twice
since the landmark visit of the peking opera to the metropolitan opera house 10 years ago , smaller chinese companies have appeared in new york with some regularity when the guangdong yue troupe played at the beacon theater in 1982 , one of its lead performers was the actress hong xiannu , whose daughter , hong hong , also played significant roles hong hong , who defected from the mainland to taiwan two years later , now heads her own company , the hong hong cantonese opera troupe , which appeared at alice tully hall on friday evening as part of its first american tour miss hong starred in the comedy the princess as an unorthodox bride , of which only the first hour or so was given the occasion was the 19th annual celebration viva chinatown , sponsored by the chineseamerican arts council , which also presented awards to several noted chinese performers miss hong was named the most outstanding performing artist of asia for 1990 the princess uses a story more than 700 years old , from the sung dynasty a beautiful , bright and dangerously mischievous princess manages to alienate foreign guests of her father sufficiently to bring war upon the empire a general subdues the enemies and ultimately the strongwilled princess herself , who finally , according to the program , realizes that she should learn to love and respect her consort unlike pekingstyle opera , which is traditionally performed in palaces and teahouses , cantonese opera is generally performed outdoors , a spokesman for the council explained , almost apologizing for the noise of this production yet the cymbal crashes here , though repeated at length , scarcely fazed a listener who vividly recalls a periodic racket of percussion from the peking productions the princess is a spectacle of a much more staid and austere sort , with none of the elaborate dance and acrobatics of the peking opera whether that is the difference between two genres or merely two companies , this observer is not qualified to determine the musical setting of the princess , though steeped in tradition , is of recent vintage , the work of miss hong s father , himself an actor of national repute it uses an orchestra of half a dozen players on native instruments , including the versatile yangchin , which by turns can sound like a zither , a dulcimer or a cimbalom the orchestra spins out long melodies that , despite repeated modules , evolve in ever new ways the voices always singly generally join but sometimes counter the instrumental tunes the real interest , however , lies less in those broad melodies , which move mostly wholetone by wholetone , than in the microtonal bendings and filigree the more one hears of the real chinese idiom , the more one realizes the naivete of so many western chinoiseries that rely for their exoticism on little more than pentatonic scales miss hong sang the title role with a nasal headvoice in western experience , close to a whine that , even amplified , did n't always surmount the instruments chan sai wah , as the general , sang his part much of it merely enhanced speech more naturally the hong hong troupe s sets for this traveling production are simple and elegant the costumes are lavish , colorful and gorgeous their extendable sleeves , which can reach to the floor , seem central to the stylized gesture that constitutes much of the acting one or another actor is always raveling or unraveling them the amount of planning and effort involved in bringing a production like this into the country must be enormous , and one is indeed grateful for the opportunity to have experienced it still , this is not easy fare for westerners \( however few there may have been in friday s audience \) to grasp immediately , and one wishes that the program had explained the work and its style more fully only a plot summary was provided , and even this must have mystified many in attendance , for it was nowhere explained that the work was not being presented in full the complete twoandahalfhour opera will be performed tomorrow evening in whitman hall at brooklyn college \( flatbush and nostrand avenues \) photo hong hong in the princess as an unorthodox bride , a cantonese comic opera , at alice tully hall \( audrey ross \)
monroe , conn , sept 27 when people here go to vote for a new governor in november , local nightmares like the alamo are likely to follow them right into the booth the alamo is what residents call the pink southwesternmotif shopping center on route 111 that bellyflopped in the northeast s realestate downturn it has sat empty , apparently with no survivors , for the last 18 months that is not to say that the world has fallen apart in this community of 17 , 000 people on the eastern edge of fairfield county monroe mostly remains a welltended , heavily republican former farming town what has changed , politicians and residents say , is that monroe , along with almost every other connecticut community , has been forced to acknowledge its limitations but in a state and region where the main questions until recently were how high \? and how fast \? , the news of mortality has been disturbing enough , and politicians say that how voters express their disappointment is generally expected to decide the election in the last 18 months , applications for welfare here have quadrupled the dollar value of losses from property crimes particularly burglaries has nearly doubled , attributed by the police to the rise of crack use in nearby bridgeport and the resulting need for quick cash the hot button the economy the local construction industry has all but died residents twice rejected budgets before approving one that raised property taxes by nearly 6 percent and cut spending for schools the action followed cuts in state aid last spring the votes also deeply divided monroe along lines of age and economics , with hardpressed young families joining retirementage people to force cuts in oncehallowed school spending that s the hot button this year the economy and the resulting impact on local taxpayers , said kenneth s heitzke , a retired army colonel who runs monroe s town hall as selectman we 're cutting anything that reeks of being something nice to have we 're down to the real hard nuts yet in dozens of recent interviews with residents , it was clear that no easy equation would directly link voters' frustration or anger to the success or failure of any candidate though united states representative john g rowland , the republican nominee , has represented monroe since 1985 and is expected to do well here , former united states senator lowell p weicker jr , a greenwich republican running under his own party label , is considered almost a local son the questions are the extent to which those candidates will carve up the vote a result that could benefit the democrat , united states representative bruce a morrison and how much voters will make local issues a basis of how they cast their ballots all three candidates have vowed to maintain local aid as much as possible next year , but with a projected 1 billion deficit in a state budget of only about 7 billion , many people here are skeptical of beer and bread it s fine and well that they want to keep their commitments , but what are they going to do about it \? asked henry w cortina , a systems analyst who has lived here seven years patrick c o'hara , a native who opened a wholesale nursery this summer , said , the thing is , they 've got to stop spending our money mr o'hara , in a sentiment echoed by several , said he was bothered that the town had to scrimp on its school budget , while it continued to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in state money to develop a town park in your house , if you do n't have enough money for bread but you go out and buy a sixpack of beer , something s wrong , mr o'hara said he said he would probably vote for mr weicker because he seems craftier little growth in 2 years for monroe , where the population grew by 22 percent in the 1980 s alone , one of the most ominous portents for the future is that growth has all but stopped in the last two years permits to build new houses are down to a few a month , compared with 30 to 40 a month in 1988 , according to town figures that s deadly for this town , said daniel tuba , monroe s town planner this town relies heavily on the residential property tax base , and without a reasonable annual growth rate in the grand list , the burden becomes that much worse in some areas , the dropoff has translated into fear i'm scared to death , said a woman who , with her husband , planned to move this winter into a condominium at great oak farm , a sprawling development of 300 , 000 homes that was halted in midconstruction last year the project is overgrown , weathered and neglected the couple , who refused to give their names , have spent thousands of dollars to fix up their condominium , even though the overall project remains in doubt foreclosure against the developers began this month there is the need for a change , that s for sure , said joseph dellaquila , a home builder who said he has seen his business dwindle in the last year mr dellaquila said he believed that the next governor should bring new businesses into the state and that the best way to do that would be to cut corporate taxes , which are now the highest in the nation at 138 percent but he added that making up the difference through other tax increases , especially a personal income tax , would be devastating all three of the major gubernatorial candidates have pledged to try and cut corporate taxes , but none have set a time table all oppose an income tax for the state , which currently taxes income on only dividends , interest and capital gains , but only mr rowland has vowed to veto an incometax bill some people said they feared that whatever happens next year may be too late 'you just worry' larry easter , a nineyear monroe resident who works as a mechanic at sikorsky aircraft in stratford , said he has seen the company cut back its nearly 12 , 000member work force by hundreds of employees it s a shame , he said susan nikola , who moved here three years ago from nearby shelton because of the reputation of the monroe schools , said , you see everything being cut and you just worry mrs nikola said she had not thought much yet about the governor s race it ca n't keep going on the way it is , though , she said photos there is a need for change , that s for sure , said joseph dellaquila , a home builder , who said he has seen his business dwindle in the last year larry easter of monroe , conn , said his employer , sikorsky aircraft in stratford , has cut its nearly 12 , 000member work force by hundreds \( photographs by joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
a gypsy cab driver was shot in the head and killed in brooklyn yesterday , the police said they said that the investigation into the death was preliminary , and that they did not know if the killing was linked to a series of killings of livery cab drivers in the bronx the 27yearold driver , whose name was not released , was driving north on troy avenue in the crown heights section about 1 50 pm when a passenger in the back seat fired a shot through a plastic partition , said a spokesman for the police , sgt norris hollomon the cabby was apparently shot as the car passed 162 troy avenue , the police said the cab rolled 150 feet , jumped a curb and crashed into a wall surrounding a playground , sergeant hollomon said motives are unclear the assailant fled , sergeant hollomon said the police said they canvassed the area for witnesses but found none the cabby was found slumped over the wheel , sergeant hollomon said both front doors were locked , and the cabby s wallet , with more than 100 , was at the scene it was unclear if the killer had intended to rob the cabby and had been prevented by the partition , the police said in the car , the police found a taxi and limousine commission hack license and papers affiliating the driver with at least four radiodispatched car services the car did not have a radio , however , and detectives said they believed that although the driver may have worked for livery car services in the past , he was operating on his own yesterday there are 15 , 000 unlicensed gypsy cabs in the city , which cruise the streets for passengers there are 20 , 000 radiodispatched livery cars , which are technically not allowed to pick up fares on the street , although many do four of the five cabbies slain in the bronx worked for radiodispatch services in three cases the police said are linked , the killer called and requested a car the fifth victim was a gypsy cab driver the brooklyn cabby was taken to st mary s hospital , where he died at 2 28 pm , the police said the police in the bronx said they believed the same killer was responsible for three deaths , because ballistics tests have shown that the bullets were from the same 22caliber gun the three killings occurred within a mile radius in the williamsbridge and wakefield sections ballistics tests on the gun in the shooting yesterday were not complete by last night
pittsburgh , sept 6 valera falters early tomlin far outlasted julio valera , the 21yearold rookie selected by the mets to pitch them into the homestretch of the pennant race while established stars like ron darling watched from the bullpen but valera , making his second start in a week , was knocked out in the third inning and the mets did not survive you do n't score runs , it does n't matter , said bud harrelson , the manager of the mets i still think we can win what can i do now \? pray a lot more , i guess we did the best we could , said howard johnson it s not the end of the world there s still time but the mets were clearly shocked at the turn of events this week tim teufel put it this way our fundamentals broke down we did n't hang in there we saw our offense at its lowest point , and that flowed over into other parts of our game succession of troubles for the mets , this was what harrelson calls reality , life in the thick of a pennant race with high stakes and low results and the reality of the situation was that harrelson s mets were reeling from one disaster to another while time was running out the pirates pounced on valera tonight from the start , rocked him with two runs in the first inning and three in the third , and ended his second game in the big leagues after 57 pitches the mets , meanwhile , were watching or waving at a full repertory of breaking balls , sizzling fastballs and offspeed pitches slung at them by tomlin with a sweeping sidearm delivery that seemed to come from somewhere out near first base for four innings , the mets did n't even get a hit four of them even struck out , including honchos like darryl strawberry , johnson and teufel they seemed as powerless against the rookie lefthander as they had been in their three previous losses against established lefthanders i do n't know what it is , miller said when we see a lefthander , it s not that we think oh , no , not another one of those' that s the weird thing about it weird or not , the mets were muzzled one more time by one more lefthander while the pirates pounced on the righthanded valera pirates attack quickly wally backman opened the home half of the first by hitting a high chop near second base , and he beat it out for a single when tommy herr s hurried throw pulled teufel off the bag jay bell drew a walk , and the omens were there next came andy van slyke , who pulled a sharp grounder to the right side that herr bobbled for an error , and now the mets' rookie was surrounded by the ultimate problem bases loaded , nobody out , bobby bonilla and barry bonds swinging bats he coped with the danger nobly for a moment when bonilla grounded into a double play but one run crossed , and another quickly followed when bonds singled deep to the left side of the diving backhand of johnson valera kept peace for one more inning , but in the third he faced five batters , got none of them out and was gone van slyke led the charge with a double to leftcenter bonilla doubled down the leftfield line , and the toll rose to 30 bonds was safe in a photo finish on a grounder wide of first base sid bream lined a single to right for another run jeff king drilled a single to left for yet another and harrelson walked slowly to the mound to rescue his rookie pitcher
san francisco , april 18 in the gloom before dawn , while most of the city slept on , undisturbed by memory or geology , a dwindling band of survivors of the 1906 earthquake assembled today to commemorate the day the earth shook and the sky burned their 5 12 am sojourn at lotta s fountain , a turnofthecentury gathering spot in downtown san francisco , is an annual event here , the first in a daylong series of festivities but this year it was celebrated with particular fervor it followed by 12 hours the sixmonth anniversary of october s temblor , a mere 71 on the richter scale of ground motion , as compared with the ruinous 83 shudder 84 years ago and it came on a day when the bay area was rocked by a swarm of moderate earthquakes on the san andreas fault the series of dozens of quakes , the strongest of them a 54 on the richter scale , began at 6 37 this morning and rattled cupboard doors and nerves throughout the day today s earthquakes , like october s jolt , centered near watsonville , caused rockslides , scattered power interruptions and cracked chimneys in santa cruz and santa clara counties in san francisco and alameda counties , the ground shuddered , the skyscrapers swayed and the mentalhealth telephone lines reported a surge of callers but for the elderly survivors , today s quakes barely deserved notice when the hardest of them hit , at 6 54 am , the oldtimers were at 20th and church streets in the mission district here , spraying a ceremonial coat of gold paint on a fire hydrant that is said to have gushed water in 1906 when most of the city s hydrants gave nothing but a muddy trickle none of the survivors batted an eyelash , continuing to sip bloody marys and reminisce about the '06 blaze that leveled 490 blocks , destroyed 250 , 000 homes and blackened the sky at noon while making it bright as day at midnight had a quake , did we \? said jim downey , 88 years old , when he was told that mother nature had joined the party , unbeknownst to him what time was it \? how big \? mr downey and his 84yearold brother , jack , were the spring chickens at today s events , which included survivors as old as 104 , many of them straining against hearing aids or leaning on canes some were accompanied by children , grandchilden and greatgrandchildren , all reared on stories of the big one the survivors came dressed with the formality of another age , the men in black bowlers and stiff suits , the women in white cotton gloves and coats with fur collars they laid a wreath to honor the dead and sang a tremulous version of san francisco , open your golden gate , none of them needing the lyric sheets that were passed out to the candlestick park crowd last fall when the world series resumed after the earthquake most of the survivors were small children in 1906 and remember the day more as a carnival of exciting and unexpected events than as a tragedy but cora luchetti , who is 90 , mourns anew each april 18 for her father , who was crushed to death beneath a falling telephone pole while driving his horse and wagon to market to stock the family s fruit store sidney p amber , spry at 104 , lives with his 95yearold wife , ruth , in the broadmoor retirement home here , where the pretty big one , as october s quake is known , rocked the dining room at supper time mr amber found himself stupefied , as he had been in 1906 and as many bay area residents were today when the swarm of mild quakes stirred old anxieties you 're absolutely numb , petrified , mr amber said , describing the feelings that immediately follow a temblor for those seconds , you ca n't move they say on tv what you should do go under a door frame or a table but you ca n't stand you ca n't think you ca n't talk you 're helpless because of the events of 1906 , april is earthquake awareness month in california as a rule , the duckandcover drills and other programs are sparsely attended , but this year has been different because of those 15 terrifying seconds in october at noontime on tuesday , for instance , workers in the financial district flocked to a preparedness rally in the shadow of the quakedamaged embarcadero freeway , scooping up survival guides offered by local utilities and telephone companies , the police and fire departments and various relief agencies the most popular booth at the rally belonged to the united states geological survey , the nation s largest earth science agency , which has tallied about 6 , 000 shocks and aftershocks in the bay area since the oct 17 quake , with the highest concentration of seismic activity in the last few weeks lines of people at the survey s booth watched a computerized animation of all that jiggling , examined a blockbyblock map of the hayward fault in the east bay , which is said to be overdue for a big one , and asked the geologist on duty lots of questions after today s shudders , the strongest since october , the survey expects longer lines and more nervous queries at its booth at sunday s earth day celebration here as time passes , there are fewer and fewer '06 survivors at the ceremonies here , a dozen this year at the predawn events , with about 100 more accepting invitations for a midday ferry ride on the san francisco bay among those who died this year was john james mcdonald , 90 , who was left an orphan by the 1906 earthquake in last fall s temblor , mr mcdonald fell in the bathroom and suffered head injuries , forcing him to quit his bachelor apartment for a convalescent home in monterey the oldtimers bring to the jolts and jiggles of recent months a welcome equanimity , a balm for bay area residents who have less historical perspective and more frazzled nerves you 'll have quakes here , you can expect 'em , mr amber said but i wo n't be around much longer to see 'em or feel 'em photo had a quake , did we \?

on their way out the door , the boston red sox stumbled badly again in the last three weeks , they have lost a division lead , lost their best pitcher and , it sometimes has seemed , lost all of their bluster and confidence they somehow even figured out how to make the yankees look good when they left the bronx and headed home today , the red sox had to prop up their chins to resemble a team that still believed it could regain the momentum it once had but nothing is going right anymore the red sox were beaten by the yankees , 54 , and fell out of a tie with the toronto blue jays in the tepid american league east , where the two contenders are slogging toward the finish as if their losing stretch is not bad enough 2 of 3 to the lastplace yanks , 8 of 10 on a disastrous trip and 14 of 20 since the first week of september now the sox have this news to lose sleep over roger clemens , scratched from today s scheduled start , may be done for the season workout is stopped clemens , who has not pitched since sept 4 because of tendinitis in his right shoulder , attempted to throw in the bullpen early in the game but was forced to stop he will be examined today by the team physician , dr arthur pappas today s prognosis was not good , said the boston manager , joe morgan , after the game he did n't feel good so he put the ball down he felt a little tender there was n't much sense throwing anymore is there much sense playing anymore \? the red sox slide came at the same time clemens was hurt , and now they must approach their final nine games eight of which are at home knowing he probably wo n't be available we 're in a position to win the division , said jody reed , the second baseman , and we 're not going to fret over one guy everyone would love to have roger pitch three more times , but if he does n't , what are we going to do , roll over and die \? not dead , but not good they are not dead , but they appear to be comatose today , they left three runners at third base , one of them in the eighth inning with no one out wade boggs , the no 3 hitter , went 0 for 5 and left five stranded we had a million chances and we did n't do the job , morgan said you 've got to be tougher than we were the yankees have n't enjoyed this kind of day since april steve sax hit a home run , and he , roberto kelly , don mattingly and randy velarde each had two hits but their pitching was even better in the eighth , after mike greenwell hit a triple to leftcenter off eric plunk that pulled the red sox to within one run , the party looked over but plunk struck out dwight evans and mike marshall , then retired tony pena on a ground ball to second twice earlier , boston had runners at third with less than two outs but failed to score something for fans we 're not in the race , said dave righetti , who saved his 34th game \( in 37 chances \) to give the victory to mike witt , but the fans get up for this and the players want to win the game for bragging rights , or whatever you want to call it the pot shots we 've taken have been incredible we 're called the worst team in baseball , and we 've taken a lot of beatings this lets us savor these wins a little bit more they had their way early with the red sox , who sent out tom bolton in place of clemens but got little in return bolton , a lefthander , was lifted in the second after having allowed three runs later , someone asked bolton if the red sox had the feeling that each day from now on was becoming crucial it s maybe getting to that point , he said everybody wants to do well , but we seem to be pushing ourselves too far everybody wants to be a hero yesterday , there were none leahy near deal tim leary , who will lead the yankees' starting pitchers in innings , victories and strikeouts , is moving closer to agreement on a threeyear contract that will keep him out of the freeagent market this winter within a week it could happen , said gene michael , the yankee general manager he wants to sign with us he wants to be here it s a heck of a contract if i were him , i 'd sign it , too  then there s dave lapoint , who was offered by the yankees to the red sox late last week asked yesterday if he felt he was suddenly out of the team s plans for next season , lapoint said i really do n't think they know what s in their plans they could lose a lot of guys that have n't signed , they 'd be taking a guess with the kids they 've brought up , and they do n't know if pascual perez will be healthy photo steve balboni , left , and alvaro espinoza congratulating steve sax after his seventhinning home run \( barton silverman the new york times \)
lying together by d m thomas 247 pages viking 1795 in the opening pages of d m thomas s latest novel , lying together , the narrator an english writer identified as mr thomas himself goes to an international writers conference in london and meets some old russian friends masha barash , an attractive poet , with whom he has possibly had an affair sergei rozanov , a writer with strange , shamanistic powers , who has survived a recent stint in a soviet psychiatric prison , and victor surkov , an aging poet who is as famous for his sexual exploits as for his verse during the daytime , the four writers attend various sessions of the conference including lectures on such relentlessly nonliterary topics as abortion , the irish republican army , liberation theology and greenpeace during the evenings , they amuse themselves by improvising a continuing story , like scheherazade the central characters in their improvisation are a married couple named anna and dmitri charsky , who live in a new glasnostliberated leningrad of course , none of this is as straightforward as it first seems though it can theoretically be read on its own , lying together is the concluding volume of a fictional quintet by mr thomas called russian nights readers of the quintet s earlier installments will doubtless recognize surkov , rozanov , masha and charsky not as colleagues of the author , but as fictional creations introduced , like russian dolls , in a series of stories within stories in ararat \( 1983 \) , mr thomas told the story of a soviet writer named rozanov who improvises a story about three other writers who take part in a competition of improvisation one story told in that contest involves a poet named surkov , who is writing a conclusion to an unfinished pushkin story called egyptian nights , a story about a poet named charsky who befriends an italian storyteller , who in turn spins an elaborate tale about love and death in swallow \( 1984 \) , the reader learned that rozanov was himself the invention of an italian improviser , that all of ararat in fact had been an entry in an olympiad of improvisation now , we are told , summit \( 1987 \) an antic political satire that seems to have little in common with the rest of the quintet was a collaborative work , produced by mr thomas and masha \( whom we met in sphinx of 1986 as a frustrated physicist , unhappily married to a jewish improviser \) during a week they spent together in switzerland sound complicated \? well , things get considerably more convoluted before lying together is over mr thomas now tells us that rozanov , surkov and masha helped him write earlier parts of the quintet as well and that he simply took credit for the books as a way of concealing his collaborators' identity from hardline soviet authorities what with the relaxations in censorship brought about by glasnost , he can now reveal the full extent of their collaborative assistance charsky \( who may or may not be a descendant of a character originally invented by pushkin \) and his wife , anna , who figure so prominently in the story improvised by mr thomas and friends in this volume , turn out to be based on a real couple , a hearty pair of philistines who bear almost no resemblance at all to their fictional counterparts indeed , the reader is made to see the ways in which the lives of the imaginary charskys reverberate with echoes of their creators' lives , as detailed in earlier parts of the quintet like the fictionreality transactions in philip roth s recent books , these mirror games are clearly meant to make several points that fiction generates more fiction that art reinvents life , even as life echoes art that imagination confers freedom on the artist by creating new equations between fantasy and real life the trouble is that these points have been made by mr thomas many times before , and with considerably more inventiveness and brio though there are moments of high comedy in lying together \( some of the literary conference scenes possess the satiric humor of john updike s bech books \) , though mr thomas s talent for formal invention is everywhere on display , there is something bloodless and narcissistic about this book the reader grows weary of all the inside jokes , all the willfully clever , nabokovian games often it seems as if mr thomas has simply run out of new material and ideas many of the central set pieces in lying together actually read like parodies of his earlier routines charsky s dreams about climbing the north face of the eiger \( dreams that are endlessly rehashed over pages and pages \) dimly reprise the passages devoted to mount ararat in ararat anna charsky s preoccupation with krafftebing s letters to a servant girl recall the sections devoted to freud s correspondence in the white hotel , published in 1981 and the masochistic tendencies of all the women in this book remind the reader in a debased , misogynist way of mr thomas s decision to use the freudian death drive as a way of explaining his heroine s suffering in the white hotel as the white hotel so firmly demonstrated , mr thomas is a writer capable of addressing the largest issues of history , art and psychology with astonishing ingenuity and invention here , in the russian nights quintet , he seems to want to address important philosophical questions about the provenance of fiction unfortunately , with nearly each successive volume , he has retreated further and further into a tiny , solipsistic world of selfreferential allusions the reader can only rejoice that lying together represents the conclusion of the quintet , and that mr thomas is presumably ready to move on to new ideas and new books photo d m thomas \( jerry bauer viking \)
washington , july 20 the ruling by a federal appeals panel today ordering new hearings in oliver l north s case demonstrates the enormous difficulties in bringing to trial a public official who has previously been forced to testify in a highvisibility case before congress the appellate court majority suggested that the decision by congress to grant immunity to officials in order to hold public hearings on the irancontra affair was a fateful one that may have severely damaged efforts to prosecute those officials as such , the ruling has great potential impact not only for mr north , but for john m poindexter , who was convicted earlier this year of crimes connected with the irancontra affair in a split decision , two members of the threemember appeals panel ordered that the information used to convict mr north be tested to insure that none of it came from his testimony during nationallytelevised hearings before a special congressional investigating committee he testified before congress only after he was given immunity , meaning that what he told congress could not later be used against him in a criminal trial the appellate court said that if it turned out to be impossible to show that mr north s congressional testimony did not contribute to the information used to convict him , he might escape prosecution considerable debate at the time of congress s irancontra hearings , there was considerable debate about whether granting immunity to the principals would rule out their eventual prosecution immunity is typically granted to help prosecutors build a case against someone else but the grants of immunity given by congress in the irancontra affair were for an entirely different reason members of congress , some of them mindful of the publicity potential of the irancontra case , said they wanted to get the story out first and did not want to wait the months and years a criminal prosecution might take the court today noted that lawrence walsh , the independent counsel chosen to prosecute the cases , had warned congress that giving immunity to officials in order to conduct a series of hearings , would create serious and perhaps insurmountable barriers to the prosecution of the immunized witnesses a fundamental choice the appellate court majority said that in a situation like irancontra , the government must make a fundamental choice between immunity or prosecution the government must occasionally decide which it values more , the court said the court today relied on a 1972 supreme court opinion , kastigar v united states , that requires prosecutors to demonstrate that none of their evidence was developed from testimony given under a grant of immunity it may be an impossible burden , said kristine strachan , the dean of the university of san diego law school whose law review article was quoted in today s opinion jerold israel , a professor of criminal law at the university of michigan , said that the issue of whether immunity is an obstacle to eventual prosecution really only occurs in high visibility cases , such as irancontra where there were televised hearings although the watergate hearings certainly classify as a high visibility case , congress did not grant immunity to the principals but only to a few of the lesser players , none of whom were ultimately prosecuted , lawyers said at the time , immunity for congressional and criminal prosecutions was not as common as it is now lawyers said today s ruling is not expected to be the last word although mr walsh did not say whether he would appeal the ruling , several lawyers familiar with the case said they expected it would be supreme court role expected this is an issue that will almost certainly go to the supreme court it s an issue which has not been resolved by the supreme court and on which lower courts have been troubled , mrisrael said after the november 1986 disclosures that the reagan administration had secretly sold arms to iran and used some of the profits to fund the nicaraguan rebels known as contras , congress was eager to explore what really happened because many of the principal figures involved in the irancontra affair faced possible criminal prosecution , they could not be compelled to testify against themselves unless they were given grants of immunity some lawyers said they were intrigued by the lineup in today s decision the majority opinion that set higher standards for the prosecution came from two of the circuit court s most conservative members , laurence h silberman and david sentelle , while the dissent was written by chief judge patricia m wald , regarded as a leading liberal
port st lucie , fla , march 8 the metsinexile continued their informal workouts today and reported that they were staying in good shape despite the threeweek lockout of the spring training camps but they said that it might take all of april before they could recover their skills and play at a major league level i'm in good shape , tim teufel said after working out with barry lyons and ron darling again at an exercise room in a shopping mall but this delay in spring training definitely will make a difference we 'll feel the difference in our muscles in the first couple of weeks and then it 'll be a month before we 're playing up to our normal level look at the pitchers usually in spring training they pitch three innings in the first couple of exhibition games , then increase it to four or five , and then they 're ready to go seven or more by the time the season opens but now they 'll be trying to do six weeks of work in three and after they go north , they 'll be pitching three innings that count can their arms take that various venues teufel and half a dozen teammates have been working out in florida for most of the last month but their workout venues have been changing in line with the changing directions issued by the players' union for a couple of weeks , the players worked in public on a little league field in port st lucie then they were told to keep a lower profile , so they switched to the martin county high school field , played basketball in the gymnasium at port st lucie high and worked with weights at the world gym meanwhile , their shiny twoyearold training complex with its six fields and its many batting cages stood empty while the labor dispute was being argued in negotiations back in new york the players now take light batting practice in the morning , then some of them work with weights and nautilus equipment at the world gym then they all go home and wonder if they can still pitch and hit baseballs ruling out a crash course we 're getting some swings now , teufel said but the pitchers are n't throwing well yet they 're just trying to stay in shape , too so , the swings do n't mean much a couple of weeks of games would n't solve it , either if you split the squad and schedule two games every day , maybe more guys can play but none of us can play two games every day so , you ca n't have a crash course in getting ready lyons , who should succeed gary carter as the no 1 catcher on the mets , said that catchers faced the same problems as pitchers in a short spring strengthening their arms gradually for the season but he conceded that lifting weights was n't the same as crouching behind the plate , springing up and firing to second base simulations are n't the same my arm s in good shape , he said , because i 've been throwing fairly hard all winter but it s not the same you ca n't compress six weeks' work into three , whether you 're a catcher or a pitcher there s no way you can simulate crouching behind the bat for nine innings and i believe we all need six weeks of training i'm not one of those in favor of shortening spring training hitters need the time , too your hands get callouses the first few days , as it is so , you could hardly double your time in the batting cage it s just not physically possible there s no doubt , he said sadly a short spring will hurt our performances
after months of trying to reach an outofcourt understanding with its creditors , integrated resources inc sought voluntary protection yesterday under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code the new yorkbased company , once a highflying real estate syndicator , has suffered financial setbacks since the tax reform act of 1986 made it virtually impossible for the company to sell its most popular taxshelter products the company has since diversified into other areas of financial services like mutual funds and aircraft leasing , but at great cost to its profits with the jittery market for highrisk debt securities and integrated s mounting problems , the company was unable to extend its shortterm borrowings that came due last june and ended up defaulting on 16 billion in debt yesterday , however , the company s top management said it was driven to make the filing because certain dissidents broke ranks with the company s other creditors we are disappointed by the fact that a few recalcitrant creditors could derail this process , said stephen d weinroth , the company s chairman he cited first fidelity bank na , new jersey , in newark in particular for forcing the company to make the filing in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york about three weeks ago , first fidelity had gone to new york state supreme court to recover 116 million that it had lent to various partnerships that are guaranteed by integrated last thursday , judge beatrice shainswit signed an order that would have allowed the bank to place liens on integrated s assets this was incredibly foolish on their part , mr weinroth said , adding that integrated could not appeal the decision without paying the entire 116 million in advance we told them if they did that , we 'd have no choice but to file 'independent matters' but a first fidelity spokesman , who asked not to be identified , disputed mr weinroth s assertions we feel that the bankruptcy filing by the company is not related in any way to the judgment which we received , and that these are entirely independent matters , he said integrated has relied heavily on drexel burnham lambert for financing and advice , and mr weinroth left the investment house to take the post at integrated last august but there is a limit to the help drexel could offer now , given its own fragile financial condition indeed , analysts attributed the sharp drop in price on integrated bonds yesterday not so much to the company s filing as to the separate announcements by drexel in recent days indicating that it needs an infusion of capital to survive this paper has drexel s imprint all over it , and people are afraid that there is not going to be liquidity in anything drexel underwrote or is associated with , said leigh walzer , an analyst with r d smith company , a research boutique that specializes in distressed securities he noted that investors were particularly concerned that prices might deteriorate further as drexel liquidates its own junk bond holdings to satisfy its debts securities decline prices of integrated s securities could not fall much further the company s stock , once trading as high as 40 a share , fell about 8 cents , to 17 cents yesterday integrated s senior bonds traded yesterday between 13 cents and 17 cents on the dollar , while the company s subordinated bonds traded between 1 and 2 cents on the dollar a plan that integrated presented to its creditors last month shows that the company believes its assets are worth slightly more than 700 million and put its debts at 16 billion the company said its biggest creditors are manufacturers hanover , which it owes 558 million , and chemical bank , which it owes 516 million the two banks' actual exposure is probably less , however , since the bulk is owed by integrated s sponsored partnerships none of which have filed for bankruptcy executive life insurance owns about 488 million of highyield bonds and is the thirdlargest creditor , followed by the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation , which owns about 45 million of another highyield bond issue , according to integrated drexel , which has been helping integrated to restructure and sell various asssets up until this week , is believed to be the fifthlargest creditor , with about 411 million in debts

somers , conn detailed proposals about crime and punishment have been few and far between in connecticut s race for governor many people inside the state s overwhelmed criminaljustice system say the relative silence has raised the level of campaign honesty with a crushing budget deficit looming for the state , a huge prison expansion only now approaching midway , and a toughened sentencing system taking effect this month after years of debate and public outcry , experts say that promises of sweeping reform in how connecticut deals with crime could probably not be kept for the shortterm , they say , the state s next governor will be just one more prisoner of the apparatus forged in the 1980 s operating budget has tripled prior financial commitments alone will be considerable the 10year prison expansion that began in 1985 , at nearly 1 billion for 8 , 200 new prison beds , is one of the most expensive in the nation yet the prison system is still expected to fall far short of the growing criminal population the new construction has in turn forced a tripling of the prison operating budget since 1985 , to 231 million this year , and state budget officials say that further large spending increases for new guards and administrators extend as far as the eye can see the department of correction is seeking a 49 percent oneyear spending increase , to 3456 million , for the year that begins next july 1 here at the somers correctional institution , the state s largest prison , the concerns are more gutlevel somers , which was built to house 900 inmates in 1963 now holds more than 1 , 400 and officials plan to squeeze in another 200 the prison , set on 1 , 400 acres that were once part of a shaker farm , is one of four state prisons on the site , with a combined population of about 3 , 500 more than a third of the state s prison population of 9 , 876 two more prisons are to be completed by 1993 there are shortages of both space and staff younger guards with less experience , hired in the expansion , are supervising inmates who are more violent and less controllable than ever doublebunking in many cell blocks has pushed tensions higher still a shortage of guards has made mandatory 16hour toursofduty common then there is what they call creaming down the phrase , attributed to the state s commissioner of correction , larry meachum , is a direct result of the way connecticut has expanded its prisons , with almost all of the growth in lowersecurity , fasttrack construction of dormitorystyle prisons rather than higher security and far more expensive individualcell lockup prisons with only one maximumsecurity prison in the state , somers , here on the massachusetts border , officials admit that many inmates who should stay in maximum security are shipped out like skimming cream on milk , the idea is to take out the best of the worst criminals and disperse them to other operations guards say , however , that creaming down leaves somers with an everharder core of violent inmates , and the new dormitory prisons with growing numbers of only slightly less dangerous inmates who cannot be isolated in cells when things get out of hand the dormitory prisons do n't have cells 'a lot more dangerous' it means that cheap minimumsecurity structures are housing maximumsecurity inmates , said michael ferrucci jr , the chief negotiator for the union that represents state prison guards it s a lot more dangerous job than it used to be , said officer william stark , who has worked at somers for eight years all you want to do is do your shift and get out alive or unhurt lawenforcement and prison authorities directly blame creaming down along with simple overcrowding for a riot in june that caused more than 27 million in damage at a fouryearold minimumsecurity prison just down the road from here in enfield some officials warn that worse could come on the next governor s watch if the highsecurity prisons , to be built in the second half of the plan , are not built if it were a perfect world , we would have one cell per inmate , said william h carbone , chairman of the state s prison and jail overcrowding commission , which oversees prison construction in the state but the rate of increase in the population did not permit us to do that what was feasible was dorms pay would be frozen so far , none of the three major candidates for governor has proposed any sweeping changes in either the construction plans or operation of the system , though one , representative john g rowland , republican of waterbury , has said he would try to make it easier for the state to impose the death penalty and would seek salary concessions from all state employees , including prison guards , whose pay would be frozen mr rowland has also said he would not rule out trying to squeeze more inmates into the current space , perhaps up to 130 percent of capacity current state law imposes a ceiling at 110 percent of capacity both the democrat , representative bruce a morrison , of hamden , and the former senator , lowell p weicker jr , running on his own connecticut party , have said that building more prisons is fruitless , though neither has recommended turning back on commitments already made both men have emphasized alternatives to incarceration , especially community service and drug rehabilitation mr morrison says in addition that he would favor life without parole or death in prison , as he calls it , for particularly heinous crimes opposition from lawmakers in any event , efforts to change the sentencing system would probably encounter opposition from lawmakers and administrators who worked , in some cases for years , on the overhaul completed just last spring the plan , enacted under public pressure to keep inmates in jail longer , eliminated a supervised homerelease program that had allowed many convicted criminals especially for nonviolent crimes like selling drugs to be released after serving only 10 percent of their sentences in its place , the new law requires anyone sentenced to prison to serve at least 50 percent of their sentence before being eligible for release longer prison time will in turn , however , require more prisons and mr carbone s commission is expecting to have waiting on the next governor s desk in january a request for at least 3 , 000 to 4 , 000 more prison beds , or the equivalent of about 10 new units those are optimistic numbers that 4 , 000 beds are going to be enough , said state representative richard d tulisano , democrat of rocky hill , who is cochairman of the general assembly s judiciary committee , and the main author of the new law we have yet to accept that we ca n't build our way out of this photo connecticut s prison overcrowding

cincinnati milacron , the last major american maker of heavy robots , is selling its business to a swiss company that will leave most of the us robot market in the hands of foreigners does it matter that yet another hightech , americangrown industry is now dominated by foreigners , mostly japan \? conventional wisdom says no industrial robots have proved less promising than hoped but the wider point is that yet again japan has targeted an industry it thinks has an important future , and driven out most major us competitors just as semiconductor chips are the key to all electronics industries , from computers to telecommunications , robots and machine tools are critical to manufacturing industries each of these bedrock technologies robots , machine tools and semiconductors has been targeted by japan so successfully that many us companies are under severe pressure japan s formula is not well understood in america prevailing economic wisdom , to cite the president s 1990 economic report , holds that excessive government involvement in the economy leads to unsound decisions slows growth and costs jobs that is indeed washington s sorry experience in a range of illfated projects , from the breeder reactor to synfuels but it s a fallible leap of logic to suppose that if washington messes up , tokyo must inevitably fail too tokyo s brand of industrial policy , perfected over six decades , differs from washington s as much in methods as in results its key ingredient is abundant capital tokyo s powerful bureaucrats compel their fellow citizens to save those skyhigh land prices in tokyo the emperor s palace grounds are worth more than all florida are no accident japanese must save like fury to be able to afford a house these savings are then available as cheap capital for industry last year japan , whose economy is half the size , spent an astonishing 549 billion on capital investment , exceeding the 513 billion spent by the us unlike their western counterparts , tokyo s officials do not try to secondguess the market but let the market define winning industries when they decided to build up a computer industry , they induced their telecommunications companies to compete vigorously against each other behind protective walls tokyo then subsidized research and barred ibm from selling competing products after years of failure , these efforts struck technical gold in 1980 by 1992 , japan s share of the world computer market will reach 42 percent , and the nearmonopoly once enjoyed by the us will have shrunk to 32 percent against such methods , even the most efficient and innovative american companies are hard pressed to compete their japanese counterparts can sell freely in the us while their domestic market is protected by tokyo many belong to company groups , or keiretsu , whose member bank is ultimately supported by the bank of japan freed from the fear of bankruptcy , a japanese company can take a longerterm view than its us competitor moreover , as japan dominates one manufacturing industry after another , it builds up synergistic strengths its chip makers have a vast captive market in japan s domestic consumer electronics industry america s chip makers have none washington wo n't respond because it believes government should not favor one industry over another , and because the us economy is in any case a fertile creator of new industries but if japan can consistently dominate industries it deems promising , americans will be pushed into less desirable ones tokyo believes it is far more profitable to produce robots than radishes or rutabagas the result of this policy , if present trends continue , is that america may soon make its last robot nicholas wade
philadelphia , aug 14 violent criminals have so overloaded jails , courts and the police here that city officials say they are routinely setting free thousands of other criminals who repeatedly burglarize houses , snatch purses , steal cars and sell drugs the police commissioner says the city is living in a climate of fear , while the district attorney speaks of the criminal justice system as on the verge of collapse the city pays the bail the police say they are so understaffed that it may take one or two hours to respond to a call on one of these lowpriority crimes and if the police make an arrest , a federal court order to the city requires that the suspect be released without bail unless it is the suspect s third arrest even then , bail may be waived with no consideration as to whether the suspect will show up for trial and in some cases where bail is required , the city pays it just to keep the suspect from taking up another jail bunk problems like these are shared , to some extent , by other major cities in portland , ore , for example , jail cells are so scarce that the police take only the most serious offenders into custody , said john c bradley , the first assistant district attorney if police , say , arrest someone for stealing a car radio , they write out a citation , like a speeding ticket , and release him , he said but criminal justice experts say that philadelphia s situation is the most drastic of any major city and that many of the problems are due to inefficiency and mismanagement philadelphia has had the nation s most extreme response it s provided a kind of amnesty for some criminals , said gerald m caplan , a law professor at george washington university who is a former director of the national institute of justice , the justice department s research arm philadelphia has one of the worst criminal justice systems in the nation , he added there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel crime rate is still low philadelphia is not simply a place overrun by crime and criminals in fact , the federal bureau of investigation reported this spring that philadelphia , the nation s fifth largest city , still had the lowest crime rate of the nation s 10 largest cities the city s fundamental problem , rather , seems to be its inability to respond to what crime it has the city s perilous financial condition is partly at fault philadelphia s credit rating has fallen to junkbond level , and hiring freezes or layoffs have been common throughout the criminal justice system the police force , which had 8 , 400 officers in 1977 , fell to a low point of 5 , 900 in 1988 it is now back to 6 , 200 in addition , a report commissioned by pennsylvania s chief justice and issued this spring summarized available research and found a system rife with patronage and inefficiency philadelphia has the nation s most expensive court system , it said , with a per capita cost of 75 a year compared with a per capita cost of 30 in new york , the nation s ninth most expensive in 1987 at the end of last year the courts had a backlog of 12 , 199 criminal cases the average case takes 245 days from arrest to final disposition , a period that is twice the national norm judges , whose ranks were thinned by a bribery scandal in 1987 , handle about half as many cases as their peers in other cities , and some philadelphia judges were spending as little as a hour a day on the bench , the report said the sheriff , it added , regularly fails to get the right defendants to the right courtroom on time , and the report proposed eliminating his office the tough lawandorder stance of the office of the district attorney , ronald d castille , has resulted in fewer plea bargains and more systemclogging jury trials than in 26 other major cities , the report said why many cases collapse the system s choice is stark , the report concluded either the road to justice in philadelphia is cleared and improved , or it will shortly become impassable the initial failure to detain criminal suspects often leads to the collapse of the entire case when only crime victims and witnesses regularly show up for court hearings , many of them give up after the cases are repeatedly postponed because the suspect is absent , prosecutors say when a fugitive is finally detained there may be no victims or witnesses to testify , and judges are then forced to dismiss the charges the worst thing is that the situation creates a climate of fear that the government ca n't control the criminals , that the police ca n't control the criminals , that the courts ca n't control the criminals and that there is no hope , said police commissioner willie l williams some critics suggest that the court order requiring automatic release of certain suspects has , in effect , decriminalized some kinds of crimes catherine bachrach , director of northwest victim services , a nonprofit support group here , said the order has created problems for twothirds of my cases there is little debate about the scope of the crisis we are faced with a criminal justice system that is on the verge of collapse , mr castille , the district attorney , said at a recent city council hearing problems in other cities philadelphia is one of 130 cities that are under court orders to improve jail conditions or reduce overcrowding , or both , as is the case here
the soft new jersey real estate market has led the sponsors of a condominium conversion to offer potential buyers a leasepurchase program , which state officials say might set a trend although many publicly financed projects offer similar programs , the commons at princeton landing in plainsboro township is apparently the first privately financed condominium development in the state to offer such terms real estate experts have been advising developers to do this , said stewart p palilonis , manager of the planned real estate development office of the new jersey department of community affairs , where the terms of sale on all condominium developments must be registered but that s the only such offer i know of i think that if the market does n't improve soon , we 'll see many more offers of this type the 12yearold development contains units ranging from onebedroom apartments to fourbedroom town houses the units are sold in either asis or renovated condition asis units range in price from 85 , 000 , for a onebedroom apartment , to 119 , 000 , for a fourbedroom , oneandahalfbath town house renovated units sell for 8 , 000 to 10 , 000 more under the offer , people buying asis units may apply up to four months' rent to the purchase price buyers of renovated units may apply up to six months' rent to the purchase the sponsor , the value group , clifton , nj , acknowledged that it was making the offer because of sluggish sales in the last three years , since value began marketing the condominiums , only 20 of the 120 units have been sold , most of them to insiders we looked at the market , explained mary boorman , director of sales and marketing for the value group , and came to the conclusion that people are not buying because they just ca n't come up with the down payment a straight discount would not help them buy our units , so we are dealing with the root of the problem since the offer was made , according to ann marie ladis , a sales representative for the commons , 18 prospective home buyers have begun the process of leasepurchase none of the sales have been completed yet the development is on plainsboro s sayre drive just off route 1 its threestory apartment buildings and twostory town houses are set on 11 acres owners and tenants share a swimming pool , tennis courts and a clubhouse with the adjoining princeton landing development , where the value group is building 412 town houses and singlefamily houses for asis units in the commons , the tenant must put down one month s security plus one month s rent and must pass a normal renter s credit check he or she may decide within a year whether to buy at the market rate for the unit at the time that the option is exercised those moving in to renovated units must commit to buy and apply for mortgages when the initial contracts are signed they must also sign a promissory note for 5 percent of the purchase price and pay one month s rent as a binder , which is refundable when the purchase option is exercised according to mrs boorman , the note and binder protect the company s investment to fix up such apartments since the developer has arranged 95 percent financing , the first six months' rent generally covers most of the down payment the development was built in 1978 as economy housing the value group purchased the property from the builder , harold sarshik , in 1986 so far , it has invested more than 1 million in renovations these include new windows and doors in the common areas and new stucco facades with cedar trim to replace the original clapboard the asis apartments come freshly painted and cleaned , but have 12year old appliances the renovated units have new kitchen cabinets , appliances , carpets and baths mrs boorman said that the company s target markets include firsttime home buyers and executives who are relocating to the route 1 corridor , where many office employers have settled in recent years mr palilonis of the state s development office said that leasebuy transactions seemed to work well for everyone involved the developer sells units that he is stuck with , he said and even if he does n't make a sale up front , he gets the cash flow to cover the carrying costs of the unit the buyer , who has income but no equity for a down payment , can buy , he continued and , where there is no binder agreement , the renter can even try out the neighborhood before deciding whether to buy mr palilonis said he would advise buyers to consider the purchase carefully if he is buying the unit to live in , that s fine , he said if he hopes to make a quick profit , forget it if the developer ca n't sell the units without offering special incentives , the buyer will have no resale potential until the market picks up
washington , jan 31 several members of civil rights and minority groups have written to eight major national environmental organizations charging them with racism in their hiring practices the letter , which did not accuse the environmental groups of actually refusing to hire or promote anyone on racial grounds , said the national environmental movement was isolated from the poor and minority communities that it said were the chief victims of pollution spokesmen for the environmental groups , including the natural resources defense council , the wilderness society and the sierra club , agreed that they had a poor record of hiring and promoting minority employees , but they denied that racism was involved and insisted they were trying to correct the situation they said they had not had an aggressive recruiting program in the past to attract minority employees but part of the problem , several of the spokesmen contended , was a scarcity of black or hispanic people among the pool of trained environmental specialists , and the fact that few of them wanted to work at the relatively low salaries offered by nonprofit environmental groups no response in writing among those criticizing the environmental groups were dr benjamin chavis jr , director of the united church of christ s commission for racial justice , and the rev fred shuttlesworth , cochairman of the southern organizing committee for social and economic justice they demanded that the environmental groups take steps within the next 60 days to assure that 30 to 40 percent of their staffs are members of minority groups none of the environmental groups has yet responded in writing to the letter , which was sent jan 16 i do n't think anybody is as aware of the whiteness of the green movement as those of us who are trying to do something about it , said jay d hair , president of the national wildlife federation , the nation s biggest conservation organization in addition to the wildlife federation , the natural resources defense council , the wilderness society and the sierra club , the letter was sent to the environmental defense fund , friends of the earth , the national parks and conservation association , the national audubon society and the isaak walton league none of the top leaders of any of those groups is black or hispanic or asian , and few of their middle managers come from minority groups of 315 staff members of the national audubon society , for example , only three are black , said bob norman , the society s director of human resources 'we are not proud' friends of the earth s staff of 40 includes five minority workers , counting secretaries the natural resources defense council has five minority professionals among its staff of 140 the sierra club s 250member staff includes one hispanic person but no blacks or asians among its professionals , said j michael mccloskey , chairman of the group the other groups have similar records we are not proud of our record we are terrible , mr norman said but he said i ca n't believe it is racism we are not getting the candidates from the minority community frederic d krupp , executive director of the environmental defense fund , said , the truth is that environmental groups have done a miserable job of reaching out to minorities one problem , he said , is that minority members who are cause oriented tend to be attracted to issues like discrimination and poverty , rather than environmental issues only recently , he said , have environmental problems been recognized as falling disproportionately on the poor and minority neighborhoods at the grass roots on the grassroots level , many local environmental organizations , whose members and constituents are often those directly exposed to environmental threats , are led by blacks , hispanic people or women , in contrast to the national groups the national environmental groups have formed an environmental consortium for minority outreach , which its , executive director , gerry w stover , described as part of a concerted effort to remedy the hiring imbalance among the other civil rights leaders signing the letter were the following richard moore of the southwest organizing project amos favorite sr of the ascension parish residents against toxic pollution in louisiana sharon lewis of the monte santo tenants organization in baton rouge , la bettye ewing of the mississippi tenants organization rose mary smith of the marrero tenants organization in jefferson parish , la the rev avery c alexander of louisiana anne braden of the southern organizing committee for economic and social justice photo dr benjamin chavis jr , director of the united church of christ s commission for racial justice , criticized environmental groups on their hiring practices \( nyt \)

washington , june 14 the nation s capital reacted today with sorrow , joy and plain relief to mayor marion s barry jr s decision not to seek reelection after being the alldominant local political figure for a dozen years but his announcement had no apparent effect on the federal prosecutors who are preparing to try him on 14 charges of possessing cocaine and lying to a grand jury today they continued choosing a jury for the trial some of the mayor s closest advisers said his announcement wednesday had been intended partly to persuade prospective jurors that he was contrite and that he had met the prosecutors more than half way , or , alternatively , to induce the prosecutors to reduce or drop some of the charges he faces the prosecutors held out no hope on those possibilities while they refused to comment on the announcement , their spokeswoman , judy smith , pointed out that the chief prosecutor , united states attorney jay b stephens , said several weeks ago that mr barry s political plans were irrelevant to the government s handling of his case question on reelection still , when jury selection resumed this morning in united states district court , with the mayor present and looking relaxed , the prosecutors once again began asking prospective jurors a question they first posed early wednesday as rumors swept the city that the mayor was about to make an announcement would an announcement by the mayor that he would not seek reelection have any effect on the way you judged his case , should you be chosen to sit on the jury \? every prospective juror answered no the mayor , now in the last year of his third fouryear term , said wednesday that his legal difficulties had played no role in his decision he insisted that his sole aim was to help bring about healing , both for himself , because he suffers from addiction to prescription drugs and alcohol , and for his city , because his problems have resulted in so much political and racial division i think i did ok , he said today as he left the courthouse for lunch many people , supporters and detractors alike , said the mayor , in deciding to cut short what was once one of the most promising careers of any black politician in the country , had made the right move they expressed relief 'correct and courageous' it was correct and courageous and appropriate and welcome , said the rev jesse jackson , who had publicly urged mr barry to forego another reelection effort mr jackson called on mr stephens and r kenneth mundy , mr barry s chief lawyer , to negotiate an end to the mayor s legal problems he has made his statement , mr jackson said of the mayor there should be some favorable response because his making that speech does alter the climate in the trial , this long drawnout trial , there 'll be no winners there are losers all around and there is much pain after court today , mr mundy said that although he and mr stephens had been in plea negotiations a week or so ago , no substantive talks were now under way there s nothing on the table , nothing in the mill right now , he said asked what the odds were that some substantive plea negotiations might resume by the end of the weekend , he replied , 20 to 80 he would not elaborate lorne love , who handed out pamphlets during a noontime rally for the mayor at the courthouse , said she felt only sadness and anger what he did just shows that there is a racist system in this country that never lets a black man of stature stand very long , she said charges against barry mr barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of possessing cocaine and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use he also faces a single misdemeanor charge that on at least 20 occasions he conspired to obtain and use drugs if convicted on all counts , he could be sent to prison for as many as 26 years and he could be fined as much as 1 , 850 , 000 when plea talks between mr mundy and mr stephens reached a stalemate about 10 days ago , people familiar with the negotiations said the mayor had offered to plead guilty to one or more of the misdemeanor charges in return for a suspended sentence and an agreement by the prosecution to drop all felony charges mr stephens reportedly held out for a felony plea misdemeanor pleas and a suspended sentence would have allowed the mayor not only to avoid serving time behind bars and a reputation as a convicted felon , but also would have insured that none of the evidence and testimony against him would be aired publicly some of mr barry s friends say he is particularly concerned about the impact that a public airing of evidence and testimony would have on his family under federal guidelines , judges are expected to sentence anyone convicted of felony perjury to a minimum of six months in prison there are very few provisions for a suspended sentence , and probably none apply in mr barry s situation under city law , any elected official who is convicted of a felony must resign from office if the conviction comes as a result of a trial rather than a plea negotiation , the defendant may remain in office pending the outcome of all appeals photo mayor marion s barry jr arriving for his trial on 14 charges of possessing cocaine and lying to a grand jury about it \( associated press \)

art back it is part of our heritage , and it s been plundered in the breakin , two thieves dressed as police officers took a dozen works valued at more than 200 million , including paintings by vermeer , rembrandt , degas and manet as well as a chinese bronze beaker from the shang dynasty of 1200 to 1000 bc the gardner museum , housed in an italianate edifice built by its namesake at the turn of the century , is considered one of the world s finest private museums the museum disclosed on monday that it did not have theft insurance , partly because of the cost , which would be greater than its 28 million annual operating budget , and partly because of the strict terms of mrs gardner s will , which bars the museum from acquiring any new or substitute artworks , even in the case of a robbery 'a horrifying thing' diana d brooks , the president of sotheby s inc in new york , said that as far as she knew the offer by her concern and by christie s was the first time either house had helped a museum put up a reward for stolen art mrs brooks said sotheby s had decided to underwrite the reward after being approached by the gardner museum on monday it was such a horrifying thing for the art world , and it was our feeling we were in a position to help make a difference , mrs brooks said daniel davison , the chairman of christie s of north america in new york , said his firm and sotheby s had agreed to act jointly today after being told by the fbi that a quick offer could be crucial , before these things get out of the country mr davison and mrs brooks said that they would now approach some individuals for help in underwriting the reward , but that they were prepared to foot the bill alone if none were forthcoming previous attempt reported a few other details about the theft emerged today paul cavanagh , an fbi agent in boston , said the two museum security guards who let the thieves in , after being told they were there to check on an alarm , were handcuffed and tied with tape the guards were then put in separate rooms , where they were not able to observe how the robbers left it is not known if the robbers had an accomplice outside or how they made their getaway , mr cavanagh said mr cavanagh and museum officials said they had no information to substantiate a report in today s boston globe that the thieves may have tried to enter the gardner two weeks earlier by staging a disturbance outside the museum quoting unnamed investigators , the globe said three people had taken part in the incident , with one pounding on the door , begging to be let in to get away from attackers it was the same door that the thieves used on sunday but when the guard on duty refused to let the man in , he got in a car and drove off with the two supposed assailants , the paper said during the robbery on sunday , the thieves managed to disable the museum s security system , in which each artwork was connected to a central monitoring post but not directly to the police , a law enforcement official said the official said the thieves were knowledgeable enough about the security system to remove videocassettes that would have shown them moving around the building 'eclectic character' of thefts some art experts contended today that the thieves' main focus was on the dutch masters , while others suggested that the chinese bronze may hold a hidden clue i 've never seen a theft which had such an eclectic character , said evan turner , the director of the cleveland museum of art the pieces taken fell into three categories the dutch masters , including the concert , by vermeer , and three rembrandts french impressionists , including five paintings by degas and one by manet and the chinese bronze vessel the choice of the shang bronze is astonishing , mr turner said it s completely out of context the bronze , in the form known as a ku , was also an unusual choice because it is dark brown its ancient green patina was removed before mrs gardner purchased it traditional chinese collectors preferred their bronzes and jades without the encrustation that formed when the pieces lay buried for centuries , said james watt , the brooke astor senior curator in the department of asian art at the metropolitan museum of art in new york in recent years , as many bronzes have been unearthed , western collectors have preferred to keep the green patina , showing the pieces' antiquity the theft of the bronze suggested to some experts that a wealthy asian collector might be behind the robbery but robert bagley , a professor of art at princeton university and an authority on chinese bronzes , said that the gardner s bronze was not an especially valuable piece and that because it was sitting on a table near one of the stolen rembrandts , the more likely explanation was that the thieves just saw it on their way out maybe they thought it would be a good thing to put flowers in , professor bagley said photo chinese vase from circa 12th century bc was stolen from the isabella stewart gardner museum \( associated press \)
san antonio , may 26 more than 200 years ago , a wealthy pennsylvania merchant named jacob dehaven lent 450 , 000 to the continental congress to rescue the troops at valley forge that loan was apparently never repaid so mr dehaven s descendants are taking the united states government to court to collect what they believe they are owed the total 1416 billion in today s dollars if the interest is compounded daily at 6 percent , the going rate at the time if compounded yearly , the bill is only 983 billion the thousands of family members scattered around the country say they are not being greedy it s not the money it s the principle of the thing , said carolyn cokerham , a dehaven on her father s side , who lives in san antonio you have to wonder whether there would even be a united states if this man had not made the sacrifice that he did , she said he gave everything he had the federal government , on the other hand , says the money is very much the issue spokesmen for the departments of justice and the treasury said they could not comment on the case because it was in litigation in january , a united states claims court judge in washington ruled that the statute of limitations on the suit expired at least a century ago this week an appeal was filed on behalf of the family with the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia questioning the constitutionality of the ruling unofficially , a treasury spokesman said yeah , we 'll take it seriously , but they ai n't going to win you ca n't believe for a minute that anyone is going to get that kind of money legal experts said they could not remember a similar case family is flexible the descendants say that they are willing to be flexible about the amount of a settlement and that they might even accept a heartfelt thank you or perhaps a dehaven statue but they also note that interest is accumulating at 190 a second none of these people have any intention of bankrupting the government , said jo beth kloecker , a lawyer from stafford , tex , who has taken the case in exchange for a share of any proceeds they understand about the deficit but they want some acknowledgment of what jacob dehaven did what mr dehaven did was respond to a desperate plea in 1777 from george washington , the commander in chief of the continental army , when it looked as if the revolutionary war was about to be lost one of nine children in a wealthy family of merchants and landowners , mr dehaven was living in pennsylvania on farmland adjoining the valley forge campgrounds in the winter of 177778 the soldiers there were short of food , clothing , shelter and ammunition general washington sent a plea to the leadership of pennsylvania asking for money and saying unless aid comes , our affairs must soon become desperate beyond the possibility of recovery the army must disband or starve mr dehaven was among those who responded he lent the government 50 , 000 in gold and what his descendants estimate to be another 400 , 000 in supplies the continental army survived the winter at valley forge , and when the war was over , mr dehaven apparently tried several times to collect what was owed to him 'not worth a continental' ms kloecker said she could not discuss the specific evidence the family has accumulated to substantiate the claim , but she said there is reason to believe that mr dehaven was offered continental money for his loan certificate and that he held out for gold the continental dollars were notoriously worthless , leading to the expression at the time that something was not worth a continental mr dehaven died penniless in 1812 and is believed to be buried in swedeland , pa , in a family cemetery he had no children had he possessed anything tangible to bequeath , his siblings and their children would have been his legal heirs he did leave behind his story , and it was handed from one generation to the next every decade or two there was an attempt by someone in the growing clan to collect the debt ms kloecker said there is evidence that descendants tried to recover the loan from the treasury shortly before and immediately after the civil war , and again in 1886 and 1894 many of these efforts were carried out independently , with one branch of the family not knowing that another branch had tried and failed a decade earlier and in another part of the country one branch s experience in 1910 , a branch of the family in huntsville , ala , hired lawyers to investigate the claim though the lawyers concluded that enough evidence existed to substantiate that the money was still owed , no suit was brought in the 1920 s , president calvin coolidge told congress that he thought the loan , then calculated at 4 million , should be repaid in 1966 , representative tom pelly of washington state introduced a resolution to repay 50 , 000 in settlement to the family , but the bill died in committee the latest attempt is thought to be the first time that the case has been brought to a court , rather than to congress or federal agencies the suit began in january 1988 when thelma weasenforth luunas of stafford , tex , a dehaven on her father s side , approached ms kloecker mrs luunas had promised her father shortly before he died that she would do her best to recover , or at least verify , the legendary loan
moscow , feb 12 a state of emergency was declared in the capital of the central asian republic of tadzhikistan today after a mob of several thousand people set cars , buses and the communist party headquarters on fire because of rumors that armenian refugees were being given scarce housing , official soviet accounts said local officials in the capital , dushanbe \( pronounced dooshahnbeh \) , a largely muslim city of about 600 , 000 just north of the afghan border , tried to convince the crowds that the rumors were untrue but the editor of the local government newspaper said 5 people were killed and 70 wounded before crowds throwing stones and wielding guns and clubs dispersed this evening judging by sketchy accounts from dushanbe , the violence followed the pattern of the largescale strife in a few other central asian areas , as well as armenia , azerbaijan and georgia a dangerous mix of racial and religious prejudice and resentment over impoverishment brought by the declining soviet economy that presents president mikhail s gorbachev with perhaps his most difficult problems tass , the official soviet press agency , gave no reports of casualties but said in its first brief report of the disturbances that the tadzhik government had proclaimed a curfew from 10 pm today to 6 am tuesday , after violations of public order , and manifestations of extremism , accompanied by mass disorders including pogroms , arson and pillaging youths and religious leaders incited the violence , according to mazabsho mabatshoyev , the editor of the tadzhiklanguage government newspaper tadzhikistoni soveti soviet radio said tonight that the violence began after the second rally in two days in front of the tadzhikistan communist party headquarters interfax , a news service of the moscow radio , reported that the first meeting , on sunday , was in response to rumors that several thousand armenian refugees arrived in the capital , and that the authorities promised to give them comfortable flats to the detriment of the local population local officials , including the tadzhik communist party chief , kakhar m makhkamov , tried in vain to convince the crowd that there were no more than 40 armenians in dushanbe , staying with relatives , the interfax bulletin said the violence started after another rally that began at 3 pm today when the crowd rejected similar assurances and attacked the party headquarters , setting fire to its first two floors , said abdullali rakhmanov , chief of the dushanbe militia , which is enforcing the curfew 'give us apartments ! ' they burned cars noise , screaming , shouting 'give us apartments ! send the refugees back ! ' mr mabatshoyev said in a telephone interview they say someone from azerbaijan spread the rumor on purpose in order to rouse the people , he went on , there s not enough housing , and the only slogan was , 'you give the apartments to others , and we ourselves have no apartments' vladimir n alekseyenko , a militia inspector , said by telephone that 4 , 000 to 5 , 000 people had taken part in the violence people were wounded by sawedoff shotguns , metal rods , stones and sticks , he said , but he could not say how many victims there were , or if any militiamen were among them soviet television reported tonight that the mob had thrown stones at the police and then gone on a rampage , wrecking and looting stores and setting fire to buses and trolleys before calm returned this evening the basis of the tass report that pogroms had taken place was not clear troops in azerbaijan last month , mr gorbachev sent tens of thousands of army troops to azerbaijan after gangs of muslim azerbaijanis and christian armenians began what the soviet authorities have called civil war in the republic s capital , baku , and other cities the authorities in dushanbe said the local militia was enforcing the curfew there , under the command of tadzhikistan s interior minister , m n navzhuvanov they also said no refugees from the fighting in azerbaijan had been resettled in tadzhikistan a few armenians had sought refuge with relatives in dushanbe after the 1988 earthquake , they said , but it was not known if any of them had been attacked in azerbaijan , where the conflict that indirectly gave rise to the violence in dushanbe flared last month , the soviet authorities have reported no ethnic violence this week none has been reported in armenia , either but tass reported today that rail traffic from azerbaijan to armenia was at a standstill and that the most likely explanation was strikes by azerbaijanis protesting martial law the power of rumors clearly the authorities in moscow are worried about the current climate of distrust and uncertainty , one in which rumors always a powerful force in what has been until recently a closed society can acquire hugely destructive power evidence of this concern was contained in an unusual statement by the kgb , the state security service , that was published on saturday recently in moscow and in a number of other places there have been exaggerated rumors about the supposed preparation of pogroms against jews , azerbaijanis and armenians , it said as far as the dissemination of rumors about pogroms is concerned , there is no concrete basis for them the only evidence the organs of state security have received are the rumors themselves map of dushanbe , tadzhikistan
to the editor in your generally pessimistic assessment of ways the united states could lower its dependence on oil for energy needs \( business day , sept 24 \) , you discuss increased use of bicycles for transportation , especially commuting to work the prospects for increased use , you conclude , are dim without a dramatic change in personal habits and how people are required to dress for work yet none of the other proposed strategies have so many subsidiary benefits bicycling is inexpensive , enjoyable and healthy besides saving oil , increased use of bicycles will save urban space and help solve traffic congestion in american cities almost half the urban space goes to accommodate the automobile traffic congestion often makes automobile transportation slower than bicycling bicycling is booming in the united states this may be why it is more seriously considered as a partial solution to the oil problem today than during the oil crises of the 1970 s such cities as palo alto , calif , where enlightened policies that require bicycle parking facilities and that assure a proper place for bicycles on the roads have encouraged commuting by bicycle people who commute by bicycle have found ways to solve the problem of the required dress for work for increased bicycling to be an important part of our energy policy , a dramatic change in personal habits is not required what is required are governmental and employer policies that ease the use of bicycles for commuting when the artificial impediments to their use are lessened , their many benefits will lead to increased use we will probably never have thousands of bicyclists clogging the road as in beijing , but one of the best options for lowering our dependence upon petroleum will be much more popular bob nordvall eastern regional director league of american wheelmen baltimore , sept 26 , 1990 drawing
at times , especially after 9 pm , china grill resembles a restaurant in which the adult proprietors have gone home and the teenagers have taken over on a recent thursday evening , the sound system

among a fragile forest of brittle rice noodles , deepfried spinach and ginger in a lovely curry sauce sizzling whole red snapper is monstrous but lacks the promised ginger marination flavor and is overcooked barbecued salmon with a subtle chinese mustard sauce is satisfying but not special , and steamed fillet of halibut in cucumber broth is as insipid as it sounds a savory if architecturally

a chore getting its jaws around this assembly you may be perplexed at the haphazard way dishes are brought out one at a time from the kitchen our waiter called it chinese style , which means the dishes arrive one by one when the kitchen gets around to them that may work fine in familystyle chinatown restaurants , but for an a la carte midtown place that caters to a timepressed business crowd at lunch , it can be exasperating except for the dizzy folks at the front desk \( i was cut off two out of three times i called for reservations \) , the service staff is good natured and at times energetic among scintillating appetizers to sample are little rolls of sakecured salmon in cabbage leaves , garnished with ribbons of cucumber and filaments of raw beets two gargantuan salads make fine lunch entrees shreds of roasted chicken are tossed with toasted sesame seeds , mixed greens , crispy rice noodles , sesame oil and a touch of hot pepper oil peking duck salad is on the sweet side , combining red cabbage , sweet peppers and an orangetangerine sauce the often spicy and highly acidic dishes here call for crisp , clean white wines , but the list here , heavy on bigname bordeaux and expensive french whites , is more appropriate to a french or italian restaurant at the end of the meal , even the coffee is served chinese style , which is to say whenever the staff feels like bringing it to you , before , with or after dessert among the best of the sweets is moist poundcake covered with tart cranberries and adrift in a hot caramel sauce with vanilla ice cream a combination platter of cinnamondusted wontons with coconut and chocolate ice creams is fun , but cinnamonraisin pudding is nondescript and the zany dessert of the month award goes to a plate of anemic coffee

any preconceptions one might have about the fare to be found at a cafe calling itself no fish today can be tossed out the window when the huge chalkboard menu is hauled to the table the long list is awash with fish and seafood dishes , plus a handful of other choices the restaurant s name derives from prohibition lore on days when liquor was available , speakeasies posted a sign in the window that read no fish today insiders hurried over the significance in 1990 \?

memphis while the aftershocks of the racial controversy at shoal creek country club continued to reverberate through the golf world , many of the players who are competing there at this week s professional golfers' association championship have taken what amounted to a free drop on the issue at the federal express st jude classic , which ended yesterday , top veterans like curtis strange and lanny wadkins responded with no comment to questions about their opinions on the situation , and fuzzy zoeller spoke for several pros when he said , i play golf , not politics the touring pros , used to operating apolitically in one of sport s more insulated environments , generally reacted uncomfortably to questions regarding the absence of blacks at many clubs where pga tour events take place they reacted similarly to questions regarding whether shoal creek s agreement last week , under pressure , to accept two black members would change the face of golf at private clubs maybe on monday david ogrin , a journeyman professional who did not qualify to play in this year s pga championship , said he was not surprised that players were reluctant to discuss the ramifications of shoal creek winning the pga , whether it s at shoal creek or wherever , is still a major deal , ogrin said , and the players are n't going to allow one man s comments and one group s reactionaries to get in the way of the golf tournament right now , they are n't commenting because it is just something you cannot allow to bother your game maybe monday after the tournament , guys will finally let their true colors show personally , i think the whole thing has been blown out of proportion people really try to scrape the bottom of the barrel to make golf controversial dave stockton , a twotime pga champion and the man the pga of america picked as the 1991 ryder cup captain , said he thought that many players were leery of expressing their views in what has become a socially volatile environment when you are dealing with some thing as important as racial issues , there s something to be said for not taking the chance of being misquoted , stockton said i also know a lot of pros feel that they get trapped into being socalled experts just because they 've won a few tournaments most of us are of just average intelligence we 're golfers we 're not from the united nations but such reasoning rang hollow to calvin peete , the winner of 12 tour events since 1979 and , along with jim thorpe , one of only two black players on the pga tour i really do n't understand it , peete said of the general reticence of his peers regarding shoal creek i know professional golfers are independent contractors and that playing golf is business , but i feel that we , as highly visible touring professionals , have a moral obligation to express an opinion on this issue it s politics , but it s also personal i'm disappointed , but they have their consciences to live with peete said the events of shoal creek would mean progress for blacks in and out of golf , but he believes that the issues of allwhite clubs being host to tournaments held by the pga of america and by the united states golf association should have been addressed sooner by golf s leadership says whites can help blacks have always gotten things faster the more whites speak out , peete said even causes heading in the right direction move much slower when the whites stand back of course , i think most of the players are not saying anything now because they are on the opposing side of the issue i think they are closer to agreeing with hall thompson than with calvin peete thompson , the founder of the shoal creek country club , was quoted as having said that his club would not be pressured into accepting blacks he later apologized for making the remark none of the players who were interviewed said they concurred with thompson s comments about the discriminatory membership practices at shoal creek several said the developments at shoal creek would ultimately be good for the game i think some good came out of it , scott simpson said i do n't think it is as major a topic among the players as you might think who s to decide what clubs can do and what they ca n't do \? stockton agreed , adding that touring professionals could best do their part by encouraging young members of minority groups to play golf i'm sad there was such an uproar about it , stockton said of the controversy at shoal creek on the other hand , i was happy with the way it was resolved maybe this will lead to more black people being at the better clubs , which means their kids will have access , which means we will have minority kids in the golf programs and ultimately coming out here on tour nobody can say that s a bad thing photo john baldwin watching his tee shot on the third hole yesterday \( vic delucia the new york times \) \( pg c8 \)
from residents of a highrise in houston that was listed as a singlefamily residence to families in oakland neighborhoods that are recovering from the october earthquake , hundreds of thousands of americans have said they never received census forms here is a look at what is being said about the census in cities and regions around the nation new york many lost forms sheila h grimm , the regional director of the census for the new york city area , said the return rate was 462 percent as of yesterday and the rate went from a low of about 34 percent in northcentral brooklyn to a high of 55 percent in staten island hulburt james , coordinator of census efforts for new york city , said city officials estimate that close to 10 percent of the households had not received census formsthe city council president , andrew j stein , issued a statement yesterday that said about 20 percent of his own office staff had not received census forms mayor david n dinkins has expressed displeasure that the immigration and naturalization service had recently conducted raids in washington heights , where many dominican and other latin american immigrants live , in violation of what he said was an agreement not to conduct such raids while the census was being taken , since that might inhibit participation ms grimm said it was not too late for people to send in forms that have been sitting around if that form is sitting around , please return it boston city vs census boston officials say they know the census will be inaccurate because the city s records show more than 20 , 000 housing units that do not appear on the census s list we do n't know how much the undercount will be , but a substantial number of human beings wo n't be counted , said allan k stern , boston s director of information management systems and the city s coordinator with the census bureau mr stern said the units not on the census list are about 7 percent of the city s 258 , 000 housing units philadelphia now , door to door public officials say the census bureau has missed thousands of families and failed to set up scores of neighborhood centers to help people fill out the forms the census bureau says it is doing the best it can the office of senator john heinz has received many complaints from people who did not get census forms , said grant oliphant , a spokesman for senator heinz in some cases , the census bureau listed large housing complexes as single homes , including an expensive 300unit apartment building in downtown philadelphia and a public housing project with 1 , 000 units in north philadelphia laverne vines collins , regional director of the census , said her biggest problem now was hiring census takers to go door to door we 've run ads in local newspapers , we 've gone to radio , we 've done everything we can think of to shake people loose to do this job , she said chicago 'just monumental' the census office for the chicago region , which includes illinois , indiana and wisconsin , reports a response rate slightly higher than 70 percent but in chicago , raymundo flores , of the city planning department , said his office received 60 to 75 calls every day from people who have not received questionnaires and had identified four apartment buildingsthat did not receive census forms this is just a symptom of the problem , mr flores said , who added , the city has received good cooperation from local census officers and we understand that the task is just monumental miami language barriers in miami , and throughout much of florida , the main concern is that hispanic residents will not be counted charles w blowers , the chief of research for the dade county planning department , said we have more illegals than in '80 , so that is where the undercount will be the illegals today do n't speak english and might not even be aware of the census to help get a more accurate count of spanishspeaking residents , census workers and local officials have taken steps like recommending that people who do the doortodoor followups speak the dialect spoken in the neighborhood and setting up centers where english forms can be swapped for spanish ones it is unclear how these efforts are faring census officials would not give figures on the return rate in the miami area the south 'censusconscious' ken baldowsky , spokesman for the bureau of census effort in georgia , alabama and florida , reported only scattered problems with delivery it was no epidemic , he said the problems involved incorrect zip codes , misspelled street names or faulty street designations the solution , in many cases , is hand delivery of forms one town that is already edgy about how the count will turn out is adairsville , ga , about 70 miles north of atlanta , a town of about 3 , 500 people that mayor earl towe describes as census conscious we remember that right after the 1980 census we annexed a nearby area , but the census records did n't reflect it , mr towe said it seems that every grant application we sent into the state or federal government got kicked back because they said we were too small a town for this or that we went out in 1984 and spent 700 on an update and it was the best 700 we ever spent we 've gotten about 2 million in grants since then so warning flags went up this year when local postal authorities started to hear about missing and misdelivered forms it looks like the problem has been straightened out now , the mayor said , with some relief , adding , the census is our bread and butter houston 'it s not too late'

summer squall for his whole career have gotten used to the fact that this small and reedy colt always outruns his looks , but he invariably disappoints those who are seeing him for the first time when

doubts surrounding this colt have been physical all along , and his uninspiring appearance only reinforces them summer squall has had two major physical setbacks , a broken bone last fall and a severe bleeding episode in february he has never dazzled anyone in a workout , and his lean looks always make people think he is on the downswing when he made his season debut in the swale at gulfstream on march 17 , every experienced workoutwatcher on the florida backstretch predicted he would run horribly instead , he ran the race of his life to be second to housebuster in his only career defeat he had every right to rebound badly when he ran in the jim beam two weeks later , but he rated perfectly and pounced at the right time to win easily two weeks later in the blue grass , he came back after

albany , april 1 state budget talks dissolved early this morning after an eighthour private meeting between gov mario m cuomo and legislative leaders broke down in a new round of angry public accusations the breakdown meant that today , for the sixth year in a row , the state started a new fiscal year without a budget legally , the state s authority to spend has lapsed and emergency measures will be have to approved if it is to pay its bills speaking to reporters at 5 am today , mr cuomo said that senate republicans had brought budget negotiations to an impasse by insisting that the last year of the state s fouryear income tax cut be preserved the governor and the assembly speaker , both democrats , maintain that the state s dire financial troubles make it impossible to save the tax cut i think the people of the state of new york have been done a grave disservice , the assembly speaker , mel miller , said at a news conference before dawn i think we were more than accommodating in trying to meet the needs of the senate republicans but in truth i think the bottom line is there truly was no interest in coming to an agreement this evening tax cut is stumbling block acknowledging that the tax cut was the stumbling block , the senate majority leader , ralph j marino , accused the governor and the assembly speaker of creating the impasse i suggested that we were n't going to leave without a tax cut , he said so they said , 'there s no way we can afford a tax cut' and i said , 'there 'd better be a way , ' because i was n't going to compromise on the tax cut even as mr marino was insisting on the tax cut , he acknowledged publicly for the first time today that the senate would accept new taxes to close the state s budget gap until this morning , he had maintained that the entire gap , estimated at 15 billion , should be closed through spending cuts i'm willing to do taxes , mr marino , of oyster bay , li , said i'm not trying to cripple the state he would not say which taxes he would be willing to raise but participants in saturday night s negotiations said that mr marino had agreed to almost 1 billion in unspecified new taxes governor cuomo has proposed a wide array of tax increases , including higher taxes on gasoline , alcohol and tobacco , and a 10 percent surcharge on corporate taxes the governor and legislative leaders have agreed to almost 500 million in spending cuts , including cuts in social programs and education the major obstacle to a budget accord is now the last of four tax cuts approved by the legislature in 1987 in this phase , the state s top income tax rate was scheduled to drop from 75 percent to 7 percent in october cut would cost 400 million the cut would cost the state about 400 million during the fiscal year that started today , and would create a new gap in the 51 billion budget mr cuomo presented in january that budget plan assumed the tax cut would be eliminated at a time when the state is running an operating deficit for the third year in row and its credit rating has sunk to its lowest level ever , most financial analysts say that new york cannot afford the tax cut but senate republicans , backed by most of the business groups in the state , insist that canceling it is not the way to solve the state s problems they say that cutting spending is they have not , however , produced a plan that would reduce spending enough to offset the tax cut the assembly speaker , mr miller , a brooklyn democrat , said today that he and the governor had offered several plans to phase in the tax cut more slowly so that it would not cost as much but mr marino said that he had rejected them because none would have provided any tax reduction within two years senate s uncompromising stance the senate s uncompromising stance on the tax cut has prompted many politicians in albany to speculate that the republicans are trying to delay the budget to further embarrass governor cuomo , the state s most prominent democrat some democratic politicians have gone so far as to suggest that the senators are being urged on by the national republican party , which , they say , is hoping to discredit the governor as a potential presidential candidate mr marino denied that this governor has this idea that somebody in washington is trying to get him , he said it s just not true in an apparent effort to foster the notion of a washingtonalbany republican connection , governor cuomo said today that he had called united states senator alfonse m d'amato , a republican , to urge him to intervene in budget negotations i asked him to talk to his friend ralph and he assured me that he would , mr cuomo said mr d'amato did not return a phone call to his home in long island 'it s symbolic politics' whether or not the senate s strategy serves a national political function , it is clearly motivated by state political concerns this november , there will be elections for 61 seats in the senate , and the republican party is trying to preserve its slim fourseat majority many political analysts say that by defending the tax cut , republican senators hope to cast themselves as the voters' best defense against a taxandspend democratic administration this has transcended policy , said gerald benjamin , a political science professor at the state university of new york and a republican it s symbolic politics , he continued and it s about winning and losing the senate majority has to find a way to say it s important to have republicans in albany
the officials prosecuting cincinnati s contemporary arts center and its director for displaying seven sexually explicit photographs by robert mapplethorpe appeared to have everything going for them the judge hearing the case was a lawandorder republican and a close friend of the sheriff who shut the museum down briefly to videotape evidence when the exhibit opened several of the judge s preliminary rulings favored the prosecution seven of the eight jurors hailed from the still more conservative suburbs of an already conservative community only three had ever been to an art museum , and none had seen the exhibition the only thing the museum and its director , dennis barrie , had going for them was the law and that appears to have been enough civil libertarians were displeased when miller v california , the united states supreme court s leading ruling on obscenity , came down in 1973 it was the latest in a long line of cases , involving works like lady chatterly s lover , an american tragedy , and fanny hill , in which the courts have struggled to define obscenity in it , the high court declined to promulgate new and overarching free speech protections and chose instead to reiterate the importance of contemporary standards in local communities criteria on obscenity what is obscene under miller , a case involving a california man who sent sexual materials through the mail , is any work that meets each of three different criteria the average person must find that it appeals to prurient interests , that it depicts or describes in a patently offensive way sexual conduct , and that , taken as a whole , it lacks serious literary , artistic , political or scientific value this test is imperfect and imprecise many find the formulation of another cincinnatian that of the late justice potter stewart , who said he could n't define hardcore pornography but he knew it when he saw it considerably easier to fathom but if the verdict yesterday is any indication , miller poses hurdles that zealous prosecutors are hardpressed to overcome unless the political climate changes very dramatically , the miller test provides quite solid protection for civil liberties , said cass r sunstein of the university of chicago law school the mapplethorpe case shows there s a wide consensus that we should n't regulate speech just because it s disturbing , he continued even people who seem to have very traditional values are opposed to censorship those who think we 're entering into a period of widespread prosecutions are wrong mr sunstein and other scholars agreed that it is the third prong of the miller test , regarding a work s literary or artistic value , that provides the greatest bulwark against censoring art , as opposed to what is sold in adult book stores at least these jurors seem to have been prepared to say that a person who spends his life making artistic judgments is entitled to some respect for his opinion , whatever they may have thought of the work themselves , said kenneth l karst of the university of california at los angeles law school matter that ca n't be ignored but while the mapplethorpe case suggests that fears of local intolerance and artistic provincialism can be exaggerated , it does not suggest that they can be ignored indeed , community sensitivities were very much on the minds of lawyers for the mapplethorpe estate , who deliberately hired local counsel for the trial our first instinct was to hire a biggun , new york first amendment lawyer , said michael b stout of new york , a lawyer and executor of the estate but it might have made the wrong impression to come in with some sharpshooter from new york it could have led people to say 'we do n't want that new york filth in this town , ever' in a sense , the acquittal has more symbolic value than real meaning the legal scholars said any conviction would surely have been overturned the reversal , they say , could have been either on the ground of the photographs' artistic value or on the more narrow ground that by forcing the jury to consider the photographs in isolation rather than in the context of the entire 175photograph exhibition , judge david albanese misconstrued the law gerald gunther of stanford law school says a long line of cases suggests that books must be judged in their entirety rather than on selected passages that principle was first laid down in the celebrated ulysses case , in which judge john woolsey held the value of the joyce work could not be based on molly bloom s soliloquy that precedent could prove powerful if extended to the mapplethorpe exhibition , which , for all the attention given to a few disturbing works , was made up primarily of inoffensive still lifes and portraits
the big sam derby also differs from many of the events in which professional black bass anglers compete in that it is open to all , beginners or experts , men or women there are no qualifying tournaments leading up to it , no limit on the number of participants , and the cash prizes are guaranteed to put it another way , if only 500 anglers showed up and all caught fish , each would get a check for the full value of his prize with the last in mind , says groves , 785 , 000 has been deposited under an irrevocable letter of credit at a bank in new york city that is approximately the amount that statisticians believe will be paid out in the derby at the moment , groves says , gold bracket registrations are two to one over silver open bass tournaments with guaranteed cash prizes have been part of the texas scene for more than a decade , says groves , but , he adds , none has offered such large cash prizes there will also be 54 hourly prizes 1 , 000 , 500 and 250 for first , second and third during the big sam tournament which runs from 6 am to 3 pm each day \( the hourly prizes are the same for both gold and silver bracket entrants \) all fish are entered on a time clock in the case of a tie whether for an hourly prize or one of the 500 basic awards the angler who enters his fish first is the winner such ties are unusual the scales register to onehundredth of a pound but they do occur as each day progresses , competing anglers , who are encouraged to bring hand scales with them , will learn , via local radio stations , the size of fish that are being weighed if it appears that they might have a winner for that time slot , they should probably head for one of the four weighin sites on the lake at a normal level , lake sam rayburn , the largest lake completely within the state s borders , covers 114 , 000 surface acres and has about 100 launching areas anglers are permitted to weigh five fish per day , but only one in each hour you might , for example , catch two hefty sixpounders in the first 45 minutes you could weigh one of them before that hour was up , then wait a few minutes and weigh the other for the next hourlong time slot the hourly prizes add an element of excitement to the tournament judgments have to be made in a period of 10 minutes , you might catch two good fish and lose a third one that is even larger should you leave an area where big fish are feeding and go for the hourly prize , or should you keep fishing \? the hourly prizes also result in large numbers of fish being weighed in then immediately released throughout the day obviously , the less time a bass spends in a live well , the better its chance of survival in typical black bass tournaments , anglers weigh in their catch at the end of the day , and survival is high even under those conditions a portion of each entry fee in the big sam derby will be donated to an organization that is assisting the texas parks and wildlife department in building a new largemouth bass hatchery in huntsville groves says that the tournament will provide the average bass angler an opportunity to fish for big money he did not hazard a guess at how many anglers might show up for his event , but he did say that all the rooms in hostelries around the lake have already been booked for the tournament he also said that more than 6 , 000 anglers took part in a twoday bass tournament on the lake this spring the tournament is being held in conjunction with a music fair and a boat , truck and tackle exposition the exposition will include a seminar by wellknown black bass anglers billy and bobby murray their presentation will include casting to bass in a glasswalled tank that allows spectators to see how the fish strike and how various lures should be worked for more information and registration , call \( 214 \) 3573838 , monday through friday registration may also be accomplished by calling at any hour of any day \( 800 \) 9823100
bolechowo , poland the economic forces that pushed pressta into new lines of business are buffeting the world s arms industry , particularly companies in eastern europe that earned hundreds of millions of dollars in the 1980 s selling to the countries of the warsaw pact and to combatants of various political stripes polish officials now disclose that their customers even included members of the north atlantic treaty organization those markets have largely collapsed despite the military moves in the persian gulf , the number of nations that are buying weapons has dropped significantly in addition , the reshaping of the superpowers' military strategy in europe from an offensive to a defensive posture has created surpluses of weapons both in eastern europe and the soviet union tough times for arms sales forget about what is happening now with iraq , said samuel cummings , the president of interarms , a company that arranges weapons deals from offices in britain and alexandria , va it is a terrible time for the arms business , east and west for instance , mr cummings estimates that eastern europe and the soviet union have 40 , 000 surplus tanks the public stances taken by the countries on this issue reflect their differing viewpoints in czechoslovakia , for example , the government of president vaclav havel says its decision to withdraw from the arms business was a matter of morality but here in poland , officials see it as a straightforward example of the sort of market economics they are trying to foster figures for tank production in poland illustrate how much the world s geopolitics has shifted the bumarlabedy factory , which makes all of poland s tanks , has trimmed its output from 250 annually in 1986 to 100 this year only 30 are expected to be produced in 1991 separately , officials at the ministry of trade disclosed that it was now unclear whether poland would ever manufacture large quantities of a jet fightertrainer , the i22 , which had been intended to raise hard currency through sales to third world nations exports decline the latest government estimates predict that poland will realize only 55 to 57 percent of a projected 2 billion in military sales to the west for the years 1986 to 1990 exports to the soviet union and eastern european neighbors will be off 25 percent for the same period , the government said ryszard jankowski , the director of the bumarlabedy tank factory in the southern region of silesia , said his company was struggling to remake itself bumar has produced civilian products like heavy construction cranes for years , but the bulk of its profits came from the sale of tanks mr jankowski estimated that tank purchases by the polish army had shrunk to onefourth the levels of 1986 a polish official disclosed that the factory had dozens of unsold t72 tanks , and he said the problem had persisted even after the asking price was sliced to less than 1 million , from 13 million our exports have radically decreased , mr jankowski said this year , it s mostly the production of spare parts and a few subsystems there is much lower demand among the postsocialist countries he added , the germans , for example , wo n't be buying anything soon they 'll have leopards , a reference to the west german battle tank mr jankowski said his company now uses a glossy englishlanguage brochure to promote sales of the t72 tank earlier versions were written only in russian he declined to identify any of the countries to which he is marketing the tanks , but told a visiting reporter if you can find a good customer , we can discuss the commission salaries of 100 a month the 9 , 500 workers at bumarlabedy are feeling the pinch just a few years ago , they were among the highest paid in poland now , they earn the national average , a little more than 100 a month mr jankowski said 1 , 000 jobs had been eliminated through attrition , but he added he hoped to forestall further layoffs by generating new civilian business mr jankowski said the company wanted to expand civilian lines , like the production of construction cranes , as well as develop new ideas , such as a cooperative venture with the soviet truck maker kamaz or the possible manufacture of a west germandesigned tractor under license in its best years , mr jankowski said , the factory earned tens of millions of dollars until now , he insisted , it has received no government subsidies mr jankowski said the tank production lines would be kept open , even at a loss , because poland must retain the ability to make its own weapons the conflict in the middle east offers no respite for the polish arms industry poland s parliament recently passed laws barring military sales to any nation involved in a war or terrorism even before the united nations voted to impose an economic embargo of baghdad , iraq had been added to the list of countries iraq had been a customer iraq had been a leading customer for poland , buying hundreds of millions of dollars in arms many of baghdad s most sophisticated sovietdesigned tanks , the t72 s , were made in poland stanislaw amanowicz , a senior official in the ministry for foreign economic relations , said 30 to 50 percent of the country s annual earnings from the arms trade had come from baghdad , which had paid for 500 million in past purchases with oil deliveries those shipments have been halted by the united nations sanctions under the communist government , poland pursued what could be called an eclectic policy that seemed more motivated by profits than ideology a polish official disclosed in a recent interview that polishmade tanks were secretly sent to both iran and iraq during their eightyear war jan majewski , the deputy foreign minister , said none were sent directly to teheran , but added that i would n't exclude such a possibility of their having been transferred from other countries to iran it was disclosed during the irancontra investigations that poland secretly sold weapons to the nicaraguan rebels , backed by the united states , that were fighting to overthrow the sandinista government mr majewski said he was startled recently by a list of countries to which polish manufacturers sold military equipment in 1989 , the last year of communist rule it included western countries like britain , finland , austria and belgium , he said photos butane gas canisters in production at pressta metalworks in bolechowo , poland the factory is one of the first of eastern europe s staterun weapons factories to reshape itself primarily as a civilian manufacturer we still have military capacity and our army still exists , but the orders are much smaller , said jerzy lenartowski , director of the pressta metalworks \( photographs by stephen

wayne arnold speert , the president of william paterson college , remembers sitting next to his baseball coach , jeff albies , as a player spoke to the team at a dinner last year the player was far from the best student ever to play for mr albies , but a year after his eligibility ran out he was there to tell his team how much he had learned from playing baseball for mr albies and how much he could apply to his life after he graduated that spring jeff leaned back , dr speert said , and mumbled under his breath , 'there is a god' that s the kind of warmth he has that warmth and rapport with players have been one of the keys to mr albies s success as coach of the william paterson pioneers for 16 years at the end of the regular season this year , the pioneers , who compete in division iii , had a 4081767 record under mr albies , and a 65422 record against division i opponents his teams have been new jersey athletic conference champions the last four years , made the ncaa division iii regionals the last nine years and participated three times in the division iii college world series for small colleges since 1980 , 11 of his players have been named allamerica eleven have signed professional contracts , as many as rutgers in new brunswick , which is in division i , has produced over the same period a model for another coach i'm trying to model my program after his , said ron van sader , coach at the rutgers campus in newark , whose team competes in division iii norm schoenig , coach of a conference rival , montclair state college , said he always puts his players first i think that s why they 've responded over the years and the players and their parents continue to respond some former players visit and volunteer time , equipment and money year after year the parents of more than a dozen players followed the team on a march trip to florida and 10 former players are coaching baseball , some as assistants at william paterson jeff has raised coaching from an art to a science , dr speert said it is n't a baseball team it is n't a series of games it s a program mr albies , who is 44 years old , grew up in the bronx and in glendale , queens , went to bishop laughlin high school in queens and graduated from long island university a low round pick in the professional baseball draft , he spent three years in the atlanta braves' farm system he went on to receive other degrees from hunter college and fordham university , teach fourthgrade physcial education in new york city and coach the junior varsity baseball team at city college with the help of mr van sader , a william paterson alumnus and a fellow player in the metropolitan semipro league , he was hired as coach in 1975 mr albies says that the universities provided him with credentials and that bishop laughlin , with its history of athletic and academic success , gave him an understanding of what tradition and community support can do for a program but professional baseball did the most to shape his approach to baseball as a coach it taught him perspective it ate me up , mr albies said , recalling the way he dealt with pressure that he put on himself during his stint in the minors i learned from that if i was ever going to coach young men , i was going to impart the best way to play the game , because the game can tear people up the best way , for mr albies , is a relaxed way , with more teaching than regimentation , more friendship than authority , and the understanding that baseball is not all there is to life he just lets you get on the field and play , said garrett teel , a 1989 graduate now with the dodgers' class a team in bakersfield , calif he would n't get on you about little things he 'll help you as a friend , not as a coach and you do n't have to look over your shoulder every time you make a mistake 'i'm just like they are' mr albies said i'm nobody special i'm just like they are i'm plodding through also maybe because i was not a very good professional baseball player myself , i can identify with their needs all of our kids have foibles that s why they 're not at big places the reality is i enjoy that imperfect kid success as a coach begins with getting good players , which can be tricky on the division iii level , where no athletic scholarships are permitted the typical william paterson baseball player is just short of what he needs to get the scholarship to the school he desires he might be too small or too slow or have too weak an arm there are an awful lot of kids who have one or two outstanding qualities , not necessarily that make them a prospect , but that make them good college baseball players , mr albies said we try to find that one thing that will make the kid successful and enjoy himself the players say there are few on the team who do not dream of getting a professional contract despite their success at william paterson , most will not have that chance the coach keeps after players to make sure they keep up with their academics and makes himself available for advice as a friend rather than as an authority figure mr albies says that getting players like dan pasqua , the former yankee now playing with the white sox , or joe lynch , a pitcher for the san diego padres' triple a affiliate , was a matter of luck yet the process of convincing these players that william paterson is the school that best fits their needs has more to do with mr albies than he readily admits
washington , sept 17 saying a new trial would be unlikely to achieve substantially more , federal prosecutors announced today that they would not retry mayor marion s barry jr on the 12 drug and perjury charges that a jury was unable to resolve last month the announcement means that the government , after spending several years and several million dollars investigating and prosecuting the mayor , achieved only a single misdemeanor conviction , possession of cocaine , for which mr barry might receive little more than a suspended sentence the prosecutors said this was a substantial legal achievement nonetheless , if for no other reason than that the highly publicized and emotionally charged case helped keep the mayor from seeking reelection for the mayor , the announcement was a bittersweet moment in a case that has caused deep racial fissures in washington and focused embarrassing , worldwide attention on the city though he is likely to end up with a relatively light sentence , his arrest and twomonth trial badly tarnished his record as a major black leader , laid bare his freewheeling life style and seriously eroded his political power , as well as helping force him out of the 1990 mayoral race 'i'm obviously relieved' mr barry , who had contended during the trial that white prosecutors were trying to topple a black leader and who had predicted that no jury in this predominately black city would convict him , greeted the government decision with a broad smile i'm obviously relieved at this phase of the legal proceedings , he said he refused to say whether he would appeal his single conviction as much as i 'd like to talk , my lawyers have advised me not to , he said the chief federal prosecutor here , united states district attorney jay b stephens , said the government felt it had won a major legal victory with the single misdemeanor conviction he said any new convictions in a second trial would not add significantly to mr barry s sentence because the penalties would be telescoped under federal sentencing guidelines when all the dust has settled , mr stephens said , in the final analysis the ultimate truth remains that the chief executive of this city , charged with leading the fight against illegal drugs and violence , has himself been convicted of contributing to that human devastation what has been achieved here really is substantial , and a retrial would not contribute substantially more to that result besides convicting on the one possession charge and deadlocking on 12 other counts , the jury acquitted mr barry on a second cocaine possession charge three of the unresolved charges involved allegations that the mayor lied to a grand jury about drug use , a felony offense , while the other charges mainly involved drug possession , a misdemeanor offense one of the possession charges that was not resolved resulted from an undercover operation in which federal agents videotaped mr barry as he smoked crack that a former girlfriend had helped him obtain she was secretly working for the police the government disclosed its decision not to try mr barry a second time at a hearing before the trial judge , thomas penfield jackson he set oct 26 as the sentencing date for the mayor , who could be sent to prison for up to a year and fined up to 100 , 000 , though a lesser sentence is more likely since he is a firsttime offender government officials said the decision to drop the case was reached after consultations between mr stephens and top justice department officials mr stephens said only legal considerations went into the decision and that the political and racial turmoil caused by the first trial was not a factor should new evidence of illegal activity surface against mr barry , prosecutors could reopen the case against him and seek a new indictment but mr stephens said today that no further investigation was under way a federal grand jury is looking into contract irregularities within city hall , but there has been no strong indication that the mayor is a target of that investigation no clear winner some lawyers not directly involved in the barry case had a mixed view of the decision not to retry the mayor it s not a clearcut victory or defeat for anybody , said nathaniel h speights , a former head of the washington bar association if you 're a prosecutor , you never like to let a defendant get by on serious charges but given the deep divisions in the barry jury on the hung charges and the fact that more convictions would not add much to his sentence , the prosecutors made the professional decision they had to make on the other hand , marion barry has to live with all that came out about him in the trial , and he has to face the people and the judge now that sentencing is near mr stephens refused to say what penalty he will propose the mayor has never before been convicted on a drug charge , and firsttime drug offenders in misdemeanor cases often receive suspended sentences in deciding the sentence , judge jackson is to consider not only mr barry s conviction on the single cocaine possession charge but also information about his character and life history as compiled in a presentencing report , including any signs of contrition further , under federal sentencing guidelines , the judge can consider evidence presented on the 13 other charges in the case , despite those verdicts the report also will note that shortly after mr barry s trial ended in august , he announced that although he had decided not to seek reelection as mayor , he nevertheless would run for city council in the november general election , running as an independent instead of as a democrat , his usual party mr barry entered the trial insisting that he did not use illegal drugs but in the trial , a dozen or so witnesses , many of them close friends , testified that they had seen the mayor use drugs on more than 200 occasions in places as diverse as resorts in the caribbean and the basement of the barry home near the end of the trial , mr barry s chief lawyer , r kenneth mundy , told the court the mayor had occasionally used illegal drugs but he insisted that none of the use was on any of the occasions alleged by prosecutors photo mayor marion s barry jr of washington leaving the federal courthouse yesterday after prosecutors announced they would not retry him on 12 drug and perjury charges his wife , effi , was at left \( agence francepresse \)
san francisco , july 18 after an extraordinary public hearing , thought to be the first by a church on the issue of ordaining homosexuals , the evangelical lutheran church in america suspended two congregations today for ordaining an openly gay man and two lesbians the fiveyear suspensions , which fall short of the expulsions that were possible , come at a time when virtually all mainstream denominations are wrestling with homosexual ordination the decision of the disciplinary committee , characterized by anguish at the need to impose punishment , reflects that struggle the committee chastised the national church for having ignored homosexual people and their story of faith , urged the two congregations to continue to be a voice and a witness and begged the church to reconsider its policy over the next five years if church policy remains the same and if the two congregations remain in violation of it five years from now , they will be expelled , the committee said that decision drew a written dissent from 5 of the panel s 14 members practical impact is limited until 1995 , then , the suspensions have little practical impact on the two congregations , where the gay pastors will continue their ministry without recognition from the national church the three ministers , jeff johnson at the first united lutheran church and ruth frost and phyllis zillhart at st francis lutheran church , were ordained last winter , providing the first real crisis for the 53millionmember evangelical lutheran church in america the church , the fourthlargest denomination in the united states , was created in 1988 by the merger of three lutheran groups like many denominations , the three groups had tolerated gay clergy as long as they were silent , or at least oblique , about their sexuality and like many others before him , mr johnson had been certified for the ministry by a bishop who knew of his sexual preference but chose not to make it an issue but the merged church took a more explicit approach , asking mr johnson to take a pledge of lifelong celibacy and withdrawing his certification by the predecessor church when he would not in response , a number of bay area lutheran clergy banded together to press the issue by finding a congregation that would risk expulsion from the church by ordaining mr johnson and by recruiting a lesbian candidate for another congregation plea for reconsideration the national and regional bishops of the evangelical lutheran church in america urged the group to reconsider but first united and st francis chose to go forward with the renegade ordinations on last jan 20 at the threeday hearing here , witnesses for the evangelical lutheran church of america argued that the church constitution had been violated when the congregations had ordained candidates not on the church s call roster , which excludes practicing homosexuals the two congregations acknowledged that they had technically violated the constitution , but argued that they were fostering the higher goal of the church to be an inclusive fellowship the church called only four witnesses , including bishop lyle miller of the sierra pacific synod , mr johnson s childhood pastor and longtime friend , who had with great ambivalence filed the charges against the two congregations the four witnesses , all church officials , spoke of the chaos implicit in permitting congregations to ordain unauthorized candidates the two congregations called about 30 witnesses among them were pastors who described the routine practice of ordaining homosexuals as long as they disguised their sexuality , and gay men and women who said they had left the church because it insisted on such silence testimony of anguish mr johnson , ms frost and ms zillhart were among the witnesses they described the process of publicly acknowledging their homosexuality to church officials , being sprurned and then finding congregations willing to let them work openly also testifying were the senior pastors of the two accused congregations , the rev james delange of st francis , where half the 130 members are openly homosexual , and the rev john frykman of first united , where none of the 100 members except mr johnson is openly gay both mr delange and mr frykman said their congregations had acted in the best tradition of the lutheran church , which was born in a 16thcentury act of protest they also commended the disciplinary committee for agreeing to an extended airing of the issue , rather than hewing to the constitutional violation , which would have been resolved in minutes photos the rev jeff johnson , foreground , who is gay , at the first united lutheran church with his pastor , the rev john frykman the evangelical lutheran church in america

chicago , sept 29 brian dennehy , most visible these days on film as harrison ford s treacherous boss in presumed innocent , is one of those indelible character actors who could very profitably spend the rest of his career in the movies playing crusty irish pols and cops but not unlike his most gifted predecessors in the same hollywood niche , charles durning and the late kenneth mcmillan , mr dennehy cannot keep away from the stage a few seasons back he earned acclaim at the goodman theater here for his title performance in brecht s galileo later he proved an exceptionally sensitive lopakhin in the peter brook cherry orchard that visited brooklyn now mr dennehy has returned to the goodman in a eugene o'neill role that is made for him hickey , in the iceman cometh and his shattering turn leaves one hungry to see his falstaff , his macbeth and , when the time is ripe , his lear and his james tyrone mr dennehy is a big bear of a man , but sometimes more of a teddy bear than a grizzly there s a buried , dainty tenderness in his burly frame as well as a hint of festering violence as hickey , a hardware salesman who comes to harry hope s endoftheline gin mill and flophouse on a deranged evangelical mission , the actor shows off a spectrum of passions that runs from love to hate , from a drummer s forced optimism to a condemned man s sweaty vertigo his hickey seems to encapsulate all the salesmen in american theatrical literature , from meredith willson s ebullient harold hill to arthur miller s weary willy loman at the same time , o'neill s fourandahalfhour play , written in 1939 and first presented on broadway in 1946 , bridges the illusionstripping theatrics of early moderns like ibsen and strindberg and the bleak , godless terrain of postwar beckett dramas that were still to come in the iceman cometh , hickey is the man who , for guilty reasons of his own , elects to show the soused bums of hope s sad establishment that there is no hope for the longheld pipe dreams that allow them to fantasize about someday redeeming their misbegotten lives when mr dennehy , in chalkstripe suit and vest , first enters the dank saloon , he practices a soft sell , working the room with the wide , wellpracticed grin and extravagant handclasps of a gregarious party hack \( he s big enough to embrace three giggling prostitutes at once \) hickey assures his old drinking cronies that his only ambition now is to offer them the peace and salvation that comes from shaking off the haze of booze and the lies of selfdelusion to face one s true self in the mirror but for all his warm effusions , there is , as one skeptical observer puts it , the touch of death about this wouldbe angel of mercy mr dennehy s curtain line in act i all i want is to see you happy is delivered in an exhausted , broken cadence , with a quizzical halfsmile that curls into a demonic grin just as the lights go down the meaning of that grin and the truly herculean test in this role arrive much later , in the act iv soliloquy that made a star of jason robards in the landmark jose quintero iceman cometh revival of 1956 neither fighting the robards characterization nor imitating it , mr dennehy gives his own riveting account of the marathon speech in which hickey s sales pitch for personal salvation becomes intertwined with cruel autobiography and , finally , a confession of murder the actor s mood swings are shocking as hickey describes how his wife , evelyn , loved him , and his selfrevulsion at betraying that love with whoring and drinking , mr dennehy s voice becomes plaintive , his expression almost babyfaced he recalls his marital bond facing forward from a centerstage seat , hat in hand , with a tender intimacy that brings him and the audience near tears in the circumspect account of evelyn s murder that follows , he stands and raises his voice just slightly , to acknowledge hickey s lightheaded feelings of relief in the immediate aftermath of the crime but dark laughter quickly dissolves into sheer blackness mr dennehy bellows to the rafters and smashes a chair into the floor when he reaches the moment of truth in which hickey suddenly refers to the dead evelyn as a damned bitch the full power of the actor s physique and voice , summoned at last after four hours of restraint , reveal a killer and symbolically reenact a killing on the spot where only moments earlier had stood a sympathetic o'neill braggart with a touch of the poet by that point the surrounding production , directed by robert falls , is ready to meet mr dennehy s hickey in that o'neill abyss from which the only deliverance is death earlier , especially in the hour or so of hamfisted exposition that precedes the star s first entrance , this iceman cometh tries the patience somewhat the younger derelicts in hope s living morgue , the fatherobsessed harvard law alumnus willie oban and the informer don parritt , are given stock renderings here , as are most of the elder inmates \( with larry mccauley s somnambulent jimmy tomorrow being a notable exception \) in the final act , however , mr falls and his two best supporting players , jerome kilty as the pickled hope and james cromwell as the terminally detached and lapsed anarchist larry slade , join with the set designer john conklin and the lighting designer james f ingalls to give this staging its own corrosive identity the design plays a crucial role , with mr conklin varying the standard set in each act to help push the iceman cometh out of kitchensink realism and into the timeless , trancelike realm it must finally inhabit the third act , in which the barflies don their sunday best in a doomed effort to return to the outside world , unfolds in a spooky , tilted barroom whose gates open into a blank magritte sky for act iv , the full depth of the large stage is revealed for the first time , filled with gloomy row upon row of tables the isolated patrons , no longer able to find the kick in their booze , stare straight ahead like mannequins and , in a surrealistic touch , are stripped of some clothes along with all their illusions when hickey s final departure allows the bar s denizens to emerge from that stupor and retrieve their sustaining pipe dreams once more , they return to demented life by slamming all the tables together and drinking , stomping , singing and dancing their way back to oblivion the stage picture could be from daumier , and the din accompanying it builds to such an obscene crescendo that not even the sound and sight of a suicide leap can upstage the ruckus mr falls can only extinguish the grotesque spectacle with an abrupt blackout that , like mr dennehy s performance , puts the kick into a ferocious american classic that has lost none of its power to send one shaking into the middle of the night the iceman cometh by eugene o'neill directed by robert falls set by john conklin costumes

a generation ago , telephones were mostly black and square corporate switchboards were full of tiny gears and wheels like an alarm clock , and the equipment in telephonecompany central offices was crammed with copper wiring one company made almost all of it western electric , the manufacturing arm of the american telephone and telegraph company today the latest centraloffice equipment uses hairthin glass filaments to carry calls , and the switchboards are small computers the telephones come in all shapes and colors , and even the western electric name , which evokes vague and romanticized images of cowboys stringing wires across the prairies , has been replaced at att with pedestrian titles such as the network systems group and business communications systems unit yet att continues to make a vast range of phone equipment , remaining the world s largest producer of switchboards and centraloffice equipment sales and rentals of equipment made up twofifths of the company s 36 billion in revenues last year but the products are mostly in markets that , unlike longdistance service , are stagnant and vulnerable to imports , and becoming more so western electric grew fat as an inhouse supplier to the nation s telephone monopoly , and att s current manufacturing operations are still trying to shake a legacy of slowmoving technical perfectionism and inattention to customers corporate officials still sound tentative and a little apologetic about being competitive we 're sort of lean and mean and hungry , said robert s russell , vice president of marketing for att s network systems group it s an awful way to describe us , but that s the way i feel , wall street analysts and investors alike were painfully reminded of all these facts on wednesday , when the company announced that weak equipment sales , as well as high creditcard costs , would depress its profits for the second quarter and the year the unexpected statement from the company briefly panicked institutional investors , who promptly pushed down att s stock by 2125 a share , to 39125 , in a trading avalanche that totaled 115 million shares , or 8 percent of all consolidated new york stock exchange trading that day trading of the nation s most widely held stock continued to be extremely heavy on thursday , at 38 million shares , and friday , at 2 million shares the stock price ended the week at 3850 the strong reaction startled company officials i'm a little surprised at the volume , said morris tanenbaum , chief financial officer and a vice chairman of att mr tanenbaum said the company felt obliged to issue the unusual statement because wall street analysts were so wrong in their estimates of att s secondquarter earnings , predicting they would go up , instead of down as the company s own forecasts indicated part of the problem is that the people who pay closest attention to att are telephoneservice analysts when they are not writing about att , they write about the mci communications corporation , say , or the regional bell operating companies created by the 1984 breakup of att none of these companies have large manufacturing operations some analysts wish att would sell its manufacturing business and focus on longdistance service i 'd just as soon see them get rid of it , said jack b grubman of paine webber , who slashed his estimate of att s secondquarter earnings by a fifth after wednesday s announcement but with a few exceptions , such as an agreement four weeks ago to sell a huge factory in south carolina that recycles copper from old wires and cables , att says it has no intention of leaving the equipment business and with 14 billion in annual sales and rentals , att s manufacturing operations alone are nearly as big as the mcdonnell douglas corporation and larger than the digital equipment corporation , caterpillar inc or the goodyear tire and rubber company some of these att manufacturing operations have had trouble this year , although the company says the difficulties are not serious particularly weak during the second quarter were sales of telephone network switching , transmission and cable equipment to telephone companies sales of electronic switchboards , multipleline telephones and computer equipment to corporations , and sales of all products to the federal government , said richard a gray , a spokesman for the company analysts say that the problems are a combination of weak demand in a sluggish economy and growing competition , from domestic , european and japanese rivals it s a little of both , said j michel guite , a telecommunications equipment analyst at salomon brothers inc other telephone equipment producers agree , with the notable exception of att s archrival , northern telecom ltd of canada northern telecom has grabbed huge chunks of the american market share because of its quickness in seeing the advantages of digital equipment , which uses the computer language of ones and zeros to convey calls instead of the old analog method of mimicking the wave pattern of the human voice

washington , sept 7 the report , which was prepared by a private consulting firm , gellman research associates of suburban philadelphia , found that the government backers of the consortium france , west germany , britain and spain had already committed or disbursed 135 billion into airbus industrie programs since the late 1960 s with the addition of commercial interest rates , the total value of the aid was put at 259 billion yet none of the programs are commercially viable , or are likely to be , the study said instead , the report added , airbus sold aircraft below cost to increase market share , a process that deprived american makers of revenues to invest in new aircraft the subsidies provide an unfair advantage over united states manufacturers and could injure the industry s future competitiveness , said j michael farren , under secretary of commerce for international trade against an overall trade deficit last year topping 100 billion , he noted , this industry generated a 12 billion surplus europeans respond that the united states government distorts free and fair trade in aerospace at least as much as the europeans through pentagon and national aeronautics and space administration contracts and buy american policies according to henri martre , chairman of aerospatiale , a french aerospace organization , the american industry receives at least three times as much overall support as the european europeans also say that the american industry is now being helped by the low dollar exchange rate , which makes american planes more competitive bonn has just agreed to provide daimlerbenz guarantees of more than 2 billion to cover the currency exchange risk from airbus programs until 1999 daimlerbenz , germany s largest industrial corporation , recently acquired messerschmittbolkowblohm , the german partner in the airbus consortium the other partners are aerospatiale of france , british aerospace and construcciones aeronauticas of spain program strongly criticized washington has strongly criticized the currency guaranty program and threatened to file charges against bonn under the general agreement on tariffs and trade , the world s freetrade charter exchange loss reimbursement undermines free trade by forestalling a normal redressment of deficits , american officials argue the administration has warned that it will be forced to take legal action against the consortium if the issue is not resolved by oct 1 a european community spokesman , peter doyle , said that the publication of the report came in the middle of the negotiations and was therefore untimely and unhelpful he added that the release was even more surprising in that it came a day after ministers from the airbus countries had met with a member of the community s executive commission , frans andriessen , in london and concluded that there was common ground for the continuation of talks with the united states report 'was ready' asked why the report was issued at this time , commerce under secretary farren said only that it was ready he added that he did not expect it to affect the negotiations the united states for at least the last five years has been highly critical of airbus subsidies for the reasons cited in the report but officials said this was the first time a detailed objective analysis of the subsidies had been placed within a single complete package entitled an economic and financial review of airbus industrie , the report is expected to figure prominently in internal administration discussions about what action to take on oct 1 the commerce department paid gellman associates 50 , 000 for the study the same firm did a similar paper for the department in 1986 , but it was never published the earler work cost the department 150 , 000 asked whether the europeans provided any data for the report , aaron j gellman , the president of the consulting firm , said we sought assistance from them we were promised much and virtually nothing was delivered
washington , may 13 american and philippine officials say the united states may have to relinquish at least one of its two huge military bases in the philippines over the next 10 years because of rising opposition to the installations in the former american colony the officials made that assessment as negotiators from the two countries prepare to meet on monday in manila to begin exploratory talks on the future of the installations , clark air base and subic bay naval station in the philippines , two american servicemen were shot and killed today while waiting for a taxicab near clark air base a philippine police official said the authorities suspected that communist rebels were responsible talks to proceed despite killings in washington , a state department spokeswoman noted that the rebels had for years said they would target official americans as part of an effort to persuade the united states to shut down its bases she said the talks on renewal of the agreement on the bases would go forward on schedule the current 25year agreement expires on sept 16 , 1991 while the defense department would prefer to keep the bases , pentagon , state department and white house officials say american forces will leave if filipinos want them to go we ought to be there only as long as we 're wanted , said secretary of state james a baker 3d if they do n't want us , we ought not to be there duration of the shift under secretary of defense paul d wolfowitz said , we hope to retain our military presence in the philippines at least over the midterm but he added that the philippine government could require us to withdraw the emerging consensus among philippine officials seems to favor such withdrawal the debate focuses on the duration of the shift to philippine control , with proposals ranging from 2 to 10 years , and the terms under which the americans would withdraw philippine nationalists see the bases as an infringement on their country s sovereignty they contend that manila was forced to sign the original bases agreement after world war ii because the americans threatened to withhold aid for rebuilding the country any new treaty is subject to approval by the philippine senate , where at least 15 of the 23 members are on record as opposing renewal in some cases , though , the degree of opposition is uncertain the government of president corazon c aquino seeks a compromise that will satisfy both nationalist sentiments and more pragmatic economic needs the philippine ambassador in washington , emmanuel pelaez , suggests that use of the bases might be governed by a commercial contract rather than a treaty the united states would pay for services rendered , a private workerowned company would repair ships at subic bay and there would be much more use of the bases by the philippine armed forces in the current fiscal year , the united states is providing 513 million in aid to the philippines , but only 385 million is regarded as compensation for the bases through purchases of goods and services , the bases generate jobs for 500 , 000 filipinos and inject more than 1 billion a year into the philippine economy , accounting for at least 3 percent of the gross national product , american officials say the american negotiating team will be led by richard l armitage , a selfconfident former defense department official who has handled many delicate missions the chief philippine negotiator , foreign minister raul s manglapus , combines the polish and debating skills of a lawyer who spent more than a decade in exile doing postgraduate work at cornell and harvard in the marcos years us rescue of aquino the united states has a major advantage in the negotiations because it saved mrs aquino s government in december , when american warplanes helped suppress a coup attempt by philippine soldiers the aquino government is a hostage of the bases , said renato constantino , a professor of history at the university of the philippines without decisive american support , which hinges on retention of the bases , it cannot hope to survive , he said but the united states enters the negotiations at a disadvantage because it has provided much less aid to the philippines than it promised in late 1988 , when the agreement was last reviewed in a letter to mrs aquino then , president ronald reagan pledged that the executive branch of the united states government would make its best efforts to provide 481 million a year in the fiscal years 1990 and 1991 by state department calculations , washington fell short by 96 million in the first year to help make up the gap , bush administration officials say they are prepared to give the philippines some of the surplus military equipment being withdrawn from europe pressures on the pentagon budget are forcing the united states to reassess the need for each of its overseas bases the fading of the cold war , reflected in a widespread perception of a diminished soviet threat , makes it possible for the united states to consider closing some of those bases the pentagon has studied many redeployment options , including greater use of existing bases in japan , guam and hawaii and the construction of additional bases in singapore or on such islands as saipan , tinian and palau large area covered none of the alternatives have the precise combination of virtues found in the philippines the bases in the philippines support united states military forces from the persian gulf to japan and korea and provide most repair and supply services for the seventh fleet , which operates in the western pacific and the indian ocean if the administration decides to abandon the bases , it is likely that members of congress would acquiesce some have become disenchanted with mrs aquino , saying she snubbed defense secretary dick cheney in february and has not fulfilled the promise of the peaceful democratic revolution that brought her to power some members of congress have also expressed dismay at reports that philippine officials had demanded 2 billion a year , or four times as much as the united states now pays representative patricia schroeder , democrat of colorado , said on the one hand , filipinos say , 'you have to stop treating us as a colony' on the other hand , they ask for 2 billion a year that s just an outrage senator john mccain , republican of arizona , said he feared that the united states might be forced out of the philippines by unrealistic demands representative g v \( sonny \) montgomery , democrat of mississippi , said it would be an inconvenience to pack up those military bases and move but we still have a powerful and mobile navy , and i think we could project that naval power and look out for us interests in the pacific without the benefit of the philippine bases photo negotiations open today on the future of american bases in the philippines the american team is led by richard l armitage \( associated press \) \( pg a8 \)

hempstead , li , aug 29 the winner of the jets' quarterback showdown thursday night may not win the starting job after all if somebody has a great performance , it s not necessarily his job , coach bruce coslet said today the jets go into their final exhibition game , against the buccaneers at tampa , fla , without a no 1 quarterback will the starter for the season opener be the incumbent , ken o'brien \? or will it be tony eason , o'brien s best friend , who was picked up last season \? talked with steinberg this game will be just one more factor in the whole decision , coslet explained dick and i spoke last night because it s more than a onegame decision it s not a doordo n't situation if either quarterback has a solid supporter on this rebuilding club it is eason dick steinberg , the new general manager , who chose coslet , was also the man who drafted eason for the new england patriots in 1983 ahead of o'brien steinberg also favored eason in last year s quarterback derby on the patriots , which doug flutie won and after the jets' first exhibition game , in which eason performed impressively against a tough eagles defense , steinberg likened him to the eason of 1985 and 1986 those were winning new england seasons , and included a trip to the super bowl edge in statistics the bare numbers favor eason this summer a completion rate of more than 60 percent , an average of more than 7 yards a throw , a pair of touchdown tosses and no interceptions o'brien , meanwhile , has failed to complete half his passes and is averaging 5 yards an attempt he has thrown for a touchdown and avoided interceptions but he has also started only 11 drives to eason s 15 , and has been involved in 35 fewer plays with quarterbacks , though , there are intangibles , none of them lost on coslet , the old tight end who played in what he describes as the neanderthal era leadership and mobility count , especially on a team that needs selfstarters coming off a 412 year in addition to a guiltbyassociation with recent jet failures , o'brien does n't have any holdover coaches to put in a word with coslet coslet s previous impressions of both quarterbacks may color his decision coslet was a coach with the bengals and faced o'brien and eason with new england , eason had a record of 21 as a starter against cincinnati , but was intercepted four times and threw only one touchdown o'brien , meanwhile , started four games against the bengals , with the teams splitting , but he was intercepted six times and threw for three touchdowns 'i'm planning to be the guy' when pressed on his thoughts of starting , eason replied i'm planning to be the guy in there i'm just getting ready to play obviously , coach coslet does n't feel comfortable yet when he does , it will be better for everybody o'brien added , the decision has got to be made soon because the season is starting indeed it is , on sept 9 against coslet s old team , the bengals but the jets will have some extra time to prepare for it because of the thursday night game coslet said the decision to bench the starting tight end , mickey shuler , and fullback , roger vick , for the tampa bat game had not been made simply to raise the players' performances i do n't play games like that , not for careers , he said i do n't play mind games i think the players will appreciate that coslet said he had told the team this is n't a demotion for the guys who had been starting coslet decided he would give jim sweeney some playing time against the bucs after all the center reported tuesday morning after a lengthy contract dispute i 'd hate to put him in cincy and in the first game he comes across tim krumrie , said coslet , speaking of the formidable nose tackle blair thomas , the jets' top draft pick , who signed last weekend , will see limited action at running back we 've got a special little blair list , coslet said joe kelly , the linebacker acquired in monday s trade with cincinnati , described himself as the bengals' best linebacker , an opinion coslet did n't dispute kelly described himself as shocked after the trade once you feel you 're a stable part of the team , and then you 're traded out of the blue , he said he felt so stable that two weeks ago he bought a house in cincinnati reggie rembert , the jet draft pick who was traded for kelly , signed a contract with the bengals the team would not disclose terms

washington , april 3 the house approved a special spending bill today that provides nearly all the money president bush requested for panama and nicaragua , including 30 million to demobilize and resettle the nicaraguan rebels but the 24 billion bill for additions to 1990 spending faces a difficult passage through the senate , and the maneuvering over it in both chambers foreshadows bigger battles on foreign aid later this year , when congress takes up the 1991 budget the 24 billion includes 420 million for panama and 300 million for nicaragua mr bush had requested 500 million for panama , but under an agreement with the administration , 30 million of that sum was allocated for aid to africa to replace a similar amount that had been taken from the african account and used for an initial package of aid for panama earlier this year the bill also includes more than 1 billion in additional spending for domestic programs including food stamps , veterans affairs , lowincomeenergy assistance and fighting forest fires most of this total spending was offset by rescinding money that had been approved last year as part of the 1990 pentagon budget where to allocate resources \? lawmakers are divided on priorities many are torn between the obligation they feel to address longneglected domestic needs , to assist the emerging democracies in eastern europe , and to aid latin american nations whose economies are in shambles as a result of american economic or military action before the house agreed to the spending bill , 362 to 59 , it defeated a series of amendments by representative james a traficant jr , democrat of ohio , that would have cut the foreignassistance money by 5 percent i know i'm going to be called a demagogue or unamerican , but i'm tired of seeing the money go all over except to america , mr traficant said i'm not going to vote for another cut in programs for american kids , for housing , for education , for infrastructure on monday , the senate majority leader , george j mitchell , democrat of maine , served notice that he would oppose the president s full request until the administration provides a comprehensive longterm plan spelling out american foreign aid objectives and explaining how they are to be met , given current budget constraints mr mitchell did not specify what amount of aid he would favor or when the senate might act but in a letter to secretary of state james a baker 3d , mr mitchell sharply criticized the administration for making piecemeal special requests without any thought to an overall strategy the administration asks that we approve a oneshot infusion to panama and nicaragua by cutting the defense budget , mr mitchell said in a floor speech but they provide no information for the longterm needs in panama and nicaragua and what about eastern europe \? what about other parts of the world \? deadline likely to pass even the house s seemingly straightforward approval involves complications that make it unlikely that the aid money will be in place by april 25 , when the newly elected government of violeta barrios de chamorro is to take power in nicaragua none of the money in the house bill can be spent until a separate piece of legislation setting guidelines for the assistance is approved that legislation is stalled in committee pending discussions between the administration and house members over aid to el salvador the house speaker , representative thomas s foley , democrat of washington , said i do not think all of the funding has to be provided immediately i think the important thing probably is to provide some assurance to the governments of panama and nicaragua that we are going to provide assistance
a remarkable comeback appears to be taking shape on wall street the man who stitched together a patchwork of investment firms to build what is now one of wall street s biggest brokerage houses , only to lose control after selling it to the american express company , may return to run his old firm , shearson lehman hutton inc sanford i \( sandy \) weill garnered the respect of wall street as his once small firm grew ever larger over two decades then he knocked the street on its ear in 1981 when he sold the firm to american express in a bid to create what he , and many others , thought would be the financial services company of the future but the corporate culture of american express and the maverick mentality of mr weill did not mesh in 1985 , he resigned , and the next year he took charge of a financial services operation in baltimore from the control data corporation for a couple of years , he lived in relative obscurity running the firm , the commercial credit company but in 1988 , mr weill returned to his familiar surroundings with a vengeance , buying the primerica corporation , a diversified new york financial services company that is the parent of the brokerage house , smith barney , harris upham company and yesterday , the circle in the career of sandy weill appeared to be nearer than ever to closing wall street executives said mr weill was in negotiations with the american express company that could lead to the creation of the largest brokerage firm in the country and put him back as chairman of shearson shearson has been in financial and internal turmoil over the last year , resulting in the recent resignation of its chairman and chief executive , who was a protege of mr weill as a measure of its trouble , the firm yesterday told its employees that it planned 2 , 000 layoffs by april the serious negotiations between mr weill s primerica corporation and american express began last week , and have focused on the possible merger of smith barney with shearson to form what would become the largest brokerage on wall street people directly involved in the negotiations stressed that the talks were at a tentative stage , meaning that they could result in a preliminary agreement as soon as a matter of days , or could fall apart one person involved in the talks emphasized that no agreement had been reached , while another said last night that they had ended right now , it s the magical mystery tour , a person involved in the talks said we 'll see where it takes us assets for stock under the terms of the deal that has been discussed , mr weill would assume the post of chairman of shearson , while retaining his position as chairman of primerica the potential deal , which was described as a swap of assets for stock , would merge the two brokerages , with primerica receiving a large stake in shearson the two companies would then be partners as parents the sources said that there were no talks under way yesterday , but that they were expected to resume soon they added that other possible structures to the deal have been considered , including bringing in another party along with mr weill a spokesman for american express confirmed the talks , but stressed that no deal had been made and that many possible structures for one had been considered , including the type of deal described by the other wall street executives as under discussion he said , however , that none of the proposals involved the sale of shearson mr weill did not return a call for comment , and a spokeswoman for primerica would not comment howard clark jr , the chief executive of shearson , also confirmed last night that talks had been held and said that the deal that had been discussed involved the purchase of smith barney by shearson shearson would have paid for the transaction by issuing new stock in the firm to primerica , mr clark said mr clark said the talks between the various parties had broken off but other wall street executives directly involved in the situation said that while they thought the talks could go either way , they had no reason to believe they had ended for mr weill , an emotionally charged executive with a strong leadership manner , such a deal could well be his ultimate achievement the 56yearold executive would be able to run a firm with the strength of shearson and maintain the relationship with american express at the same time , he would be able to stay as the top man at primerica , and therefore shape his own culture two top executives the talks began between mr weill and james d robinson 3d , the chairman and chief executive of american express the two men , who have remained friends since mr weill was president of american express and mr robinson was his boss , reportedly had spoken about a possible combination in general terms for some time and recently began to consider such an action aggressively since the serious talks began , lawyers and investment bankers have been brought into the negotiations for example , joseph flom , a partner with skadden , arps , slate meagher flom , was said to be playing an active role in the deal , as was j tomilson hill 3d , the head of mergers and acquisitions at shearson neither man returned telephone calls yesterday you 've got law firms all over the place now , one wall street executive said it seems like there are 19 , 000 people involved
last year at the american urological association meeting , 1 , 500 physicians signed a petition to the food and drug administration extolling the virtues of a tiny germ that causes tuberculosis in cows the germ has emerged as an effective , if unlikely , weapon against certain bladder cancers that might otherwise require surgery to remove the organ when instilled into cancerous bladders in studies , a weakened strain of mycobacterium bovis produced a localized tuberculosis infection that seemed to bolster the tumorfighting ability of the patient s immune system , causing cancers to melt away in may , the fda responded to the surgeons' pleas , recognizing a preparation of the germ , known as bcg , as the only approved medical therapy for a shallow but agressive bladder tumor called carcinoma in situ proponents of the therapy predict that a range of earlystage bladder cancers can be treated by the technique , and urologists are already enlisting the germ in some cases against other types of bladder tumors bcg is far superior to anything we have and less expensive , said dr kevin pranikoff , a urologist at the state university of new york at buffalo i will be using it a lot in the future the product is marketed in the united states by connaught laboratories under the name theracys 'deaths have been dropping' it s my feeling this is going to make a really big difference in mortality of bladder cancer patients , said dr donald lamm , chairman of the urology department at west virginia univerity , who was the author of many of the studies of the treatment over the last five years i do n't want to make too much of this , but ever since we started using bcg for research , deaths from bladder cancer have been dropping there will be an estimated 49 , 000 new cases of bladder cancer in the united states this year , according to the american cancer society , and almost 10 , 000 people will die of it the only early sign is blood in the urine the quantities may be microscopic the cancer is diagnosed by finding malignant cells in urine specimens most early cancers are papillary tumors , mushroomshaped growths that can be seen by the surgeon through a fiberoptic scope inserted throught the urethra the surgeon can snip off the tumors through the instrument , although they frequently recur but up to 30 percent of the new cases may involve the carcinomainsitu tumor , which is invisible and so cannot be removed hope for life with bladder in about 50 percent of the patients , the carcinomainsitu tumor will progress within four years to an agressive cancer that burrows into the bladder muscle and spreads to distant sites once invasion has occured , the only treatment is removal of the bladder and , generally , diversion of the urine through a hole in the abdomen even then , half the patients will die within a few years bcg offers patients with this type of cancer the first hope of a cure with their bladders intact having gained the food and drug administration s approval , bcg , for bacille calmetteguerin , may qualify as the oldest new drug in existence the preparation was created in 1906 by two frenchmen as a vaccine against human tuberculosis injected under the skin , a small quantity of the bacterium , which was artificially weakened by the researchers , is unlikely to produce infection and will protect against the disease since the vaccine is only partly effective , and since the risk of getting tuberculosis is small for healthy people in the united states , the vaccine is rarely used in this country , although it is commercially available but during decades of experience , doctors had noticed that bcg was a potent stimulant of local immune cells , including those that attack tumors , when injected in the skin in 1976 , that observation impelled canadian cancer researchers to infuse the vaccine into the bladders of nine cancer patients , with encouraging results since then , urologists like dr lamm have toiled to refine the technique and to collect enough data to convince sometimes skeptical peers that the therapy works sixweek course of treatment the vials of bcg sitting on drug company shelves have been both a blessing and a curse to this crusade on the one hand they allowed some urologists to use the germ to treat bladder cancer long before approval by the fda , although the doctors had to accept additional legal risks and insurance would not cover the cost of the therapy on the other , vials made for vaccination sometimes had an insufficient number of organisms to be effective as a cancerfighting agent the connaught preparation is designed specifically for the urologists use in the bcg treatment , cancer patients have the organism infused into their bladder through a catheter once a week for a period of six weeks patients frequently get a low grade bladder infection , complete with all of its annoying symptoms burning on urination , a frequent urge to urinate and some bloody urine burning can be reduced with medicines twentyfive percent of patients will experience tiredness and low grade fevers in a very small percentage of cases , patients treated with bcg can come down with severe tuberculosis , which spreads beyond the bladder earlier this month , in the journal of the national cancer institute , a group of greek researchers reported that one of their patients developed tuberculosis pneumonia when it occurs , tuberculosis can almost always be treated , but patients must take antibiotics for months three people in the united states have died of bovine tuberculosis after bladder treatments because of the potential for serious infections , people with weakened immune systems are not eligible for bcg therapy therapy a 'major advance' dr pranikoff said , the local toxicity kept people from using it early on , but it s proven so far superior that doctors are going to feel confident saying 'this may make you a bit uncomfortable , but its worth it' dr arnold melman , chairman of the urology department at the montefiore medical center , hailed the therapy as a major advance doctors has experimented with instilling traditional chemotherapy drugs into the bladder , but none worked very well dr lamm said that compared to the best results with these agents , bcg therapy caused twice as many tumors to disappear in some studies 82 percent of patients become free of disease and , on average , the patients stayed in remission eight times longer , for an average of four years recurring papillary tumors that are aggressive and maybe even tumors that have invaded the bladder wall are the next frontiers , said dr lamm and the treatment has melted some tumors in patients with advanced burrowing bladder cancers who are either too frail to live through bladder removal or who refuse the procedure as too disfiguring dr jerome kruse , a urologist in san antonio , tex , said he had watched a few patients live for years after the treatment without signs of cancer photo dr donald lamm cites a decrease in bladder cancer deaths \( john sotomayor the new york times \) diagram
bucharest , romania , feb 11 secretary of state james a baker 3d visited romania today , closing a tour of eastern europe that seemed to leave him exhilarated over the hope that the united states apparently has inspired among the new leaders , yet sober about the prospects for easily turning their revolutions into democracies during his fourhour stay in romania , mr baker held brief meetings with prime minister petre roman and president ion iliescu , leaders of the council of national salvation that replaced the deposed dictatorship of nicolae ceausescu , as well as more lengthy discussions with student and opposition leaders during his talks with the two officials , mr baker said washington was prepared to provide bucharest with 80 million worth of cattle feed and butter , either through grants or at highly subsidized prices but the secretary said that any additional aid including a waiver of trade restrictions , and american support for romania s efforts to join the general agreement on tariffs and trade and the international monetary fund would be conditioned on the free and fair elections scheduled for may mr baker was next headed today to ottawa to join nato and warsaw pact foreign ministers for talks on an open skies agreement between the alliances the secretary of state and his staff seemed to have mixed emotions as they reflected on the stops here and in bulgaria and czechoslovakia their exhilaration derived from the fact that , for the first time since taking office , mr baker found himself being treated by people as a symbol of hope it was obvious in the questions romanian students asked mr baker about what america was going to do today , this minute , to help them translate their revolution into a democracy it was obvious in the way mr baker , not a man given over to emotion , scrambled onto the steps of his hotel in bulgaria and awkwardly , but with great sincerity , addressed hundreds of demonstrators who had waited hours in the cold to see him mr baker has spent most of his career as the ultimate insider , a man behind the scenes , not someone crowds waited in the cold for he appeared visibly moved , even shakened in a way , by the experience emotional display at reception finally , it was most obvious in prague at the reception given for the secretary of state by the archbishop of prague , frantisek cardinal tomasek mr baker was accompanied by the state department s czechoslovak translator , zdenek sadlov , who escaped from czechoslovakia in 1973 at the age of 19 and came to the united states the cardinal began by thanking mr baker for everything the united states had done for his country in 1918 when it was founded , in 1945 when it was liberated and in 1990 with the american aid package he said that czechoslovaks look to washington as a beacon of freedom mr baker started to say that the united states would continue to support freedom in czechoslovakia , that this is what america was about the translator , who was making his first trip back to his homeland since leaving for america 17 years ago , started translating mr baker s words into czech , but was overcome by emotion tears started streaming down his cheeks , and he began sobbing in the middle of the reception hall the secretary of state and the cardinal were dumbstruck they patted the translator s arm , each saying in his own language that they understood but the same encounters that left the secretary moved also left him sober about the prospects that these countries will fulfill their aspirations havel complains of apparatchiks the czechoslovak president , vaclav havel , complained bitterly that so many oldline communist apparatchiks still populated his government s ministries that it was proving very difficult to push through any reforms maybe , he asked , mr baker could send some technical experts who would help the government work around some of its own ministries in romania and bulgaria the situation was seen as even worse in both countries communists or former communists of a more liberal variety remain in power , and they are using every advantage that comes with controlling the state media , jobs and other levers to defeat the opposition in coming elections the romanian opposition leaders today told mr baker that the government had given them the right to publish a newspaper , but they could not afford to buy newsprint some complained of midnight phone calls from the stillfunctioning security services threatening them to stay out of politics still others declared that their revolution was being hijacked by former ceausescu aides like president iliescu gabriel nuta , a romanian student leader , said , we want to tell baker to keep a tough position , because the government is against democracy they are of the old stalin school and they are using the old methods it is not going to be possible to beat them when mr baker asked to meet opposition leaders in bucharest he found himself sitting around a table with representatives from more than 35 opposition parties , none of whom had ever worked together aides said that mr baker gazed around the long table and said look , you people have got to bury the hatchet between you you have a strong and powerful opponent you must get unified easier said than done , bulgarian opposition leaders confided to the secretary of state they said that outside of the capital , sofia , the democratic opposition was not very strong it had little support in the provinces if free and fair elections were held tomorrow , they said , the communists now in power just might win at mr baker s meeting with romanian students , a 20yearold stood up and said sir , we have this publishing idea we are thinking of printing two pamphlets one would be called 'what is private property \? ' and another called 'what is democracy \? ' do you think that would be a good idea \? one baker aide said we are dealing with people who do n't know the first thing about how a democracy works i mean these people do n't even have xerox machines baker had to tell them how to organize a campaign it was no wonder , then , that one administration expert on europe said the trip left him feeling that , for the near term at least , the future in places like romania and bulgaria will not be one of a flowering democracy , but rather of popular authoritarianism photos secretary of state james a baker 3d meeting yesterday with romanian student leaders in bucharest \( associated press \) about 1 , 500 demonstrators gathered yesterday outside a bucharest television studio to protest government control of the station the studio had been taken over by anticeausescu forces in december \( agence francepresse \)
washington , aug 9 iraq informed the united states today that thousands of americans and other foreigners stranded in iraq and kuwait since last week may not leave , the state department said the explicit iraqi notification removed lingering hopes within the administration that the americans might be able to leave and raised fears that the iraqi president , saddam hussein , intends to use the foreigners as a shield against united states military retaliation , or as a diplomatic bargaining chip the iraqis have apparently not yet made any demands in return for release of the foreigners we have been told that diplomats only will be allowed to leave , said marlin fitzwater , president bush s press secretary we have told the iraqis that all americans should be permitted to depart mr bush , apparently hoping that muted comments might help gain the release of the americans , has reduced his warnings to the iraqis since he said last sunday , i think you know how i feel about the protection of american life and the willingness to do whatever is necessary to protect it on wednesday , mr bush said freeing americans from iraqi control was one of his four goals in handling the persian gulf crisis american officials continued to refuse to characterize the captive foreigners as hostages , saying that might incite president hussein further but the semantic distinctions could not mask the increasing concern that the already explosive persian gulf situation was developing an inflammatory new dimension that carries particularly risky domestic political ramifications the united states has requested that the international red cross , turkey and a number of arab countries ask the iraqis to allow foreigners to leave the country 10yearold freed officials are acutely aware of the damage hostage crises inflicted on the carter and reagan administrations iran s 444day confinement of 52 american hostages contributed to president carter s election defeat in 1980 , and president reagan s effort to help free american hostages in lebanon led to the irancontra scandal , which crippled his administration according to state department estimates , there are about 3 , 000 americans in kuwait , including 117 embassy personnel and dependents , and 580 in iraq , including 30 connected to the embassy there there are tens of thousands more westerners , japanese and russians , most of them oil drillers , technical workers and teachers , as well as arab migrant oil workers residing in the two countries the british embassy instructed its citizens in iraq not to try to leave the country since the borders were closed the british government reported that syrians , lebanese , palestinians and jordanians could leave iraq at will , but that westerners were being turned back two thousand british citizens are in iraq , with another 3 , 000 in kuwait the british foreign secretary , douglas hurd , told reporters that the iraqis had yet to state their conditions for release agreeing with the american position on the condition of the foreigners in iraq and kuwait , he said they are not technically hostages , although they are held against their will more than 170 foreigners are being forcibly held in at least three baghdad hotels , including 38 americans who are under armed guard in the al rashid hotel in baghdad the americans have been permitted to see embassy consular officials on a regular basis during the last week , and have free access to the hotel s services american diplomats persuaded iraq to release a 10yearold american , penelope nabokov , from the al rashid on wednesday , but she was not allowed to leave the country united states embassy personnel in the embassy compound are taking care of her members of the americans' families seemed to take today s news as a statement of what was already obvious i already determined that was what they had in mind , said edwin davis of koran , la , whose daughter martha and two grandchildren are in kuwait they are keeping the americans for their own security , for iraqi safety this is their ace in the hole i do n't think they will let them loose till something is settled in a number of diplomatic encounters in baghdad since the invasion of kuwait last week , american and other foreign diplomats have pressed the iraqi foreign ministry to release their citizens and to explain why they are being detained richard a boucher , a state department spokesman , said the iraqis had given inconsistent answers but had guaranteed the safety of those being detained describing discussions between american diplomats in iraq and iraqi officials , mr boucher said we 've asked that these people be allowed to depart , and we have gotten different explanations in the last 24 hours or so , we 've gotten somewhat more precise explanations but we still do n't think we have an adequate explanation among the reasons given for the closing of borders to foreigners is that it is unsafe for them to move around either iraq or kuwait but the iraqis have distinguished between diplomatic personnel and nondiplomatic personnel , suggesting that some diplomats will be able to leave of the 38 held in the al rashid , 35 of whom were bused from kuwait by iraqi authorities , mr boucher said , the kind of explanations we get are that it s related to the fact that they were in sensitive areas in kuwait before they came out categories of foreigners in discussions with american diplomats , mr boucher said iraqi officials seemed to divide the foreigners in iraq into four categories about 170 foreigners held under guard in the baghdad hotels they cannot leave the premises foreigners who have longterm resident visas the iraqis say they can leave once they receive exit visas , though none are being granted at this time foreigners in iraq traveling on shortterm visitors' visas who do not need exit visas to leave a few dozen such foreigners left the country before borders were closed today diplomats and their dependents who can leave after a week s waiting period for the processing of travel permits to this point , no americans have been reported harmed , although some who have escaped iraq and kuwait say some nonamerican foreign women have been raped by iraqi troops
washington the poem was a simple , dramatic dessert to a long dinner around a table laden with delicacies rarely seen during a soviet winter plates full of beef and fish and a pyramid of fresh oranges we listened , soviets and americans , as yevgeny yevtushenko , the legendary poet of conscience , declaimed it , freezing into awed silence what had been a spirited debate about the course soviet leaders must adopt the poem , mr yevtushenko said , was a new creation , but it was delivered with such command that it seemed to be recited from memory he said that it would be called half measures our host , in an ornate room in an old moscow restaurant , was vitaly korotich , editor in chief of the controversial magazine ogonyok he is also a member , in the congress of people s deputies , of the interregional group a loose alliance of delegates who believe perestroika will fail if mikhail gorbachev does not dramatically accelerate economic reform mr yevtushenko is also a delegate to the congress , which meets at least once a year he brings an unusual blend of poetic insight and knowledge of insider politics to his responsibilities when asked how virulent national rivalries and ethnic hatreds could boil over at a time of relatively unfettered political life , he spoke of a mastodon , perfectly frozen in time imagine , he said , that the scientific expedition that discovered the animal takes great pains to defrost it even if they proceed flawlessly , unseen to their eyes but thawing with the huge beast would be tiny microbes carrying ancient diseases with the ability to destroy it only the onset of decay would signal the microbes' presence this is equally true of ethnic conflicts and antisemitism , which are now thawing along with political processes frozen for so long , mr yevtushenko said it was while we talked of the possibility of a third path that mr gorbachev might follow to lead the soviet union to safety that mr yevtushenko s low , musical voice captivated us with half measures for some , the third path involves an economic transition from the discredited command model to something approximating a free market , yet not quite capitalism to others , it involves giving up the old imperial structure for something resembling a confederation , yet not quite entirely a union of sovereign equals for still others , it means a society in which people need no longer lock their thoughts away in secret places , yet a society that is not quite based on the paramount value of individual rights the essential truth about the circumstances of the soviet union is conveyed in mr yevtushenko s few lines none of us in the west can presume to know how the soviet union can best make the excruciatingly difficult transition it is now attempting after all , this is a society organized along lines so alien to our own that opening a mcdonald s restaurant in moscow has been accompanied by planning and economic lifesupport arrangements worthy of sending a mission to the moon it is worth appreciating , however , that many in the soviet union believe that the only real choice may be all or nothing full economic and political freedom or the possibility of a return to conservatism those half free are half enslaved

washington , june 22 the soviet government , concerned that ethnic unrest in some regions could imperil control of its nuclear arsenal , has begun moving scores of battlefield nuclear weapons out of troubled areas and into the more politically stable russian republic , american officials said today the officials , confirming an account today in the wall street journal , said that tactical , or shortrange , nuclear weapons had been removed from bunkers in at least some of the separatist baltic republics of estonia , latvia and lithuania , and from some restive transcaucasian republics like azerbaijan , where longsimmering differences with armenia have led to conflict a private expert on soviet nuclear forces who is familiar with the reports , raymond l garthoff of the brookings institution in washington , said it was possible as well that some theater nuclear weapons , designed for use in a european conflict , had been removed from shortrange bombers at baltic air bases mr garthoff and the government officials said the steps were a precautionary reaction to growing tensions in outlying soviet republics , intended to remove a potential source of political friction and eliminate any chance that nuclear bombs could fall into unauthorized hands violent breakup feared that possibility has increasingly worried the pentagon and military experts on congress s armed services committees , who say they fear that a violent breakup of the soviet union could create what one american official last week called 15 unpredictable nuclear superpowers instead of one administration officials privately expressed the same concern a year ago when another nuclear power , china , seemed close to civil war today , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , gen colin l powell , expressed confidence that the soviet military kept adequate safeguards over its nuclear weapons to prevent theft or unapproved use i'm fairly comfortable that those weapons will not get into improper hands or even if they were able to , the systems they have to protect those weapons would make them pretty much unusable , he said during a questionandanswer session at the national press club so , i am not terribly concerned about that kind of a scenario peril of a weapon seizure even so , other officials said , if revolutionaries seize a nuclear weapon enough panic could be caused to create a serious threat of civil disorder armed security around some soviet nuclear arsenals was stepped up in january , when conflict between azerbaijanis and armenians turned into separatist turmoil in the azerbaijan city of baku in recent weeks , one official said , american reconnaissance satellites detected soviet military forces removing loose bombs and nuclear artillery shells from dozens of fortified bunkers in politically sensitive regions in the transcaucasus and some of the baltic republics the official said that the number of weapons being moved is not known , but that the bunkers almost certainly house a hundred or more bombs mr garthoff , of the brookings institution , said the largest nuclearweapons storage sites in the western soviet union are in the ukrainian and byelorussian republics those areas also have experienced some unrest , but there was no indication that nuclear bombs are being withdrawn , officials said no longrange nuclear missiles are involved in the movements because none are based in the baltics or the transcaucasus

washington , oct 30 the first day of october brought the beginning of a new fiscal year and the unobtrusive end of a federal requirement that artists sign antiobscenity pledges for grants from the national endowment for the arts it was a federal law that applied to 1990 grant recipients , said virginia falck , a spokeswoman for the endowment all of the 1990 grants have been allocated , ms falck said yesterday as of sept 30 , the obscenity law expired if it is no longer a law , it is no longer included in the packet in midseptember john e frohnmayer , the endowment s chairman , rejected the suggestion , made by an independent commission that investigated the agency s grantmaking procedures , that the agency rescind the antiobscenity pledge he said he preferred to await pending court decisions on the matter and final passage of reauthorization legislation by congress on saturday , congress passed a new bill extending the life of the endowment for three years and leaving decisions on obscenity to the courts although it dropped the obscenity ban , the new law includes a plethora of procedural reforms whose impact is still unknown for example , it requires the chairman of the arts agency to make grants taking into consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the american public a victory or none \? the end of the obscenity ban did not , however , mark the end of some artists' concerns about the endowment i do n't consider this a victory , said joseph papp , director of the new york shakespeare festival , one of many institutions and artists that declined money because of the law there are so many things that have entered the picture that it now needs a very elaborate explanation on how an arts institution relates to the nea , or if it relates to it at all , mr papp said he said he plans to hold a news conference on thursday to address the subject of federal arts grants the current law requires grant recipients to return money if they are convicted of obscenity by the courts there are other commitments that people have to enter into under the new legislation , mr papp said i do n't think there s been a victory at all three lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of the previous obscenity ban are pending one of the lawsuits involves the new school for social research , which refused to sign the pledge and turned down a 45 , 000 grant floyd abrams , the lawyer representing the new school in its suit , said there is still the question of whether the arts agency is now going to drop the certification requirement for grants made in 1990
mayor david n dinkins , who has asked new yorkers to get involved in the fight against crime , carried his request to the streets of east new york yesterday , a section of brooklyn with one of the highest crime rates in the city and east new yorkers who were later interviewed were , for the most part , enthusiastic about the mayor s message but many also said they were afraid to join community patrols in the most dangerous areas , and none said they would be willing to give up their guns , as mr dinkins has also asked the mayor made his pitch during the 18th annual east new york street fair in a speech to community leaders at the united community centers on new lots avenue you should get to know the officers in your community so well that they could tell your children to go in at night if they 're out late , he said , or that if you see them on the street you could say , how are you , how is your wife and how is your husband in recent months east new york has been hit particularly hard by violent crime involving young people among those killed have been veronica corales , 9yearsold , who was hit by a stray bullet as she slept in her parents' car , and a man and his 1yearold daughter who were struck by bullets fired into their car from a rooftop in another instance , a 3yearold boy was thrown to his death from the roof of a sevenstory building 'i care about you' dramatizing the growing fears of many city residents , especially those in east new york , the mayor chose a neighborhood precinct , the 75th , as the setting last month to announce that he would hire 1 , 058 more police officers yesterday , in his speech in east new york , he did not specifically address crime in that part of brooklyn he did say , however i care about you here in east new york do n't think that we have forgotten you and the things you worry about the mayor has been pressured in recent weeks to respond to a muchpublicized surge of violent crime in new york in addition to saying he would hire more officers , he has called on new yorkers to come out from behind their locked doors and become involved in community policing , an appeal he made in an address at st patrick s cathedral while many east new yorkers said in interviews that they would participate in community patrol groups , some said their neighborhoods were too dangerous and too overrun with drugs for them to become involved i shut up in my house and close my windows and lock the doors at night and do n't come out until the next day because it s just too dangerous , said helen thomas , a 66yearold retired nurse i 've lived in east new york all my life , and i gave up on this place a long time ago there s nothing they can do , there s nothing nobody can do but denise mckinney , 35 , a bookkeeper , said that though mayor dinkins was taking significant steps in the right direction , government needed to provide more activities for youths to keep them out of trouble fear of crossing the street mrs mckinney , who lives in the cypress hills housing complex , said her neighborhood was so dangerous that she had to walk her 12yearold son across the street to intermediate school 218 each day mrs mckinney said she had gone to is 218 to see if it had afterschool programs for her son to get involved in but the school s administrators told her there were no such activities , she said i often work late so i need something to keep him busy and out of trouble , she said another local resident , john mills , criticized mr dinkins all i 've been hearing is a bunch of rhetoric from the mayor , he said if the mayor wants to make a difference in this community , then he needs to get us some money for economic development , jobs , and health care otherwise it s just a lot of hot air another resident , jesus marcal , said he would be willing to patrol his neighborhood but not without a gun you 'd have to be a fool to leave home at night without it , he said
los angeles , jan 28 a team ca n't just turn it on again like a light switch , james patrick said and so patrick , standing in the indisputably bright aftermath of a 31 defeat of the los angeles kings on saturday night , would say no more for the rangers than that the darkness had given way now , 10 wins in a row and you might be able to actually say there was light again , patrick said patrick , the rangers' veteran defenseman , then concluded his metaphoric musing with what could hardly be called a dim smile the rangers , an abject disaster for more than a month and as recently as two weeks ago , are 412 in their last seven games the pessimism that pervaded their locker room is gone the tension of trade talk has relaxed amid the revival displaying old character in that context , saturday s handcuffing of the kings was particularly cathartic because it was so characteristic of the way the rangers had won during their startling rush at the beginning of the season the rangers , strafed silly by the calgary flames on thursday night , not only bounced back , but did so by regaining so much of their forgotten form the tight checking , the breathtaking goaltending , the opportunistic , if not omnipotent , offense you would think we 're out of it , kelly kisio , the captain of the rangers , said of the slide that made slump sound far too inadequate , far too polite we 're building again of course , the raw materials are different the victory saturday was shaped by mike richter s goaltending and bernie nicholls s bullet of a shot for the third goal the face of the team s changed , patrick said of the calling up of richter from the minors and the acquisition of nicholls from the kings promise him nothing and because richter s face , and not that of john vanbiesbrouck , was the one behind the goaltender s mask , it is no longer unreasonable to speculate that the team s makeup might change again before the trading deadline roger neilson , the coach of the rangers , had said that he planned to play richter for as long as he continued to win beyond that , he said , there were no promises thus when richter was riddled for 4 goals on 12 shots and yanked after just 12 minutes of play against the flames , many around the rangers fully expected that vanbiesbrouck , out of action for more than two weeks , would be the starter against the kings i'm good , healthy and ready , vanbiesbrouck said in the locker room after thursday night s 85 pasting vanbiesbrouck got a chance to prove none of the claims , as he sat on the bench and watched richter at what might have been his most acrobatic outing , stopping 28 of 29 shots with a goaltender , particularly a young goaltender , we thought we had to come back with him , neilson said of his decision to allow richter his redemption stoicism vs shocking vanbiesbrouck accepted the choice stoically richter , for his part , was perhaps the more shocked i was honestly surprised when i was told , richter said afterward and now that it s over , i'm pleasantly surprised there were no hard feelings over me being yanked , but this means an awful lot to me if i was to grow , it was a great way to do it and so the sense grows that the organization has decided to find out as much as it can about richter as quickly as it can , as it works its way toward a resolution of its uncomfortable goaltending situation if the rangers discover to their satisfaction that richter is the real thing , vanbiesbrouck could be dealt for the kind of quality wing that would arguably round out the team impressively i do n't want to put myself in the position of getting between mike s success or the team s success , vanbiesbrouck said saturday night but i understand what s going on asked if he could be moved to demand a trade if his apearances remain as rare as they are now , vanbiesbrouck nodded sadly , but forcefully that s not unrealistic , he said
we do not divert and we do not send any russian immigrants or any jew who comes from russia to samaria , to judea , to gaza , because we understand the seriousness of the situation those welcome words of restraint come from none other than ariel sharon , the housing minister in israel s new rightwing government and the man whose political trademark has been to press for jewish settlers in the occupied territories this policy statement is the least that could be offered by yitzhak shamir s government otherwise , president gorbachev might have carried through with his threat to curtail further jewish immigration to israel , now expected to average more than 10 , 000 per month throughout 1990 president bush has also made clear his displeasure about the settlements but the sharon statement is n't without ambiguities it says the government wo n't encourage soviet immigrants to settle in the west bank or the gaza strip it says nothing about whether those who choose to settle there still would be eligible for government subsidies as of now , the government offers far better terms for home buyers and renters in the occupied territories than in israel itself other israelis , mr sharon made clear , will continue to settle in the occupied territories , and the government will encourage them with building construction and subsidies and mr sharon did nothing to clarify whether the shamir government would start new settlements or limit itself to expanding existing ones perhaps the most hopeful sign came from science and energy minister yuval neeman , who is even further to the right than mr sharon i would rather have one million jews settle in the negev and the galilee than have them stay in the soviet union , he said and for the sake of getting them here , we do n't have to push them where gorbachev does not want them to go mr sharon underlined this same farsighted point he said the government intended to steer jewish immigrants toward sparsely populated regions like the southern negev , northern galilee and the tel avivjerusalem corridor that s good news for the soviet jews who will have a better chance to live in peace in these areas , and for all who seek hopeful omens on arabisraeli negotiations
tokyo , monday , feb 26 the usually stable tokyo stock exchange plunged monday in a day of wild gyrations that japanese officials always thought only took place in other markets the nikkei index was off nearly 7 percent at one point , then rebounded near the close to finish down 45 percent for the day it was the worst decline here since the global stock market crash in october 1987 , and was regarded as a harbinger of tough times ahead in tokyo and perhaps new york and european markets the slide continued last week s rout of stock prices here and was caused by many of the same factors , analysts said sharply rising interest rates resulting from the value of the yen and a growing loss of confidence by investors that the japanese government will be able to react decisively to halt the severe decline influence from abroad perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the violent decline in stock prices for the japanese is that to a great extent the slide reflects events outside japan particularly the signs of increasing inflation in west germany and a subsequent climb in interest rates there and in the united states the rapid move toward a united germany is unsettling financial markets and is pushing the west german central bank to the center of the world economic stage page d1 japan , which had seemed immune to such external influences by keeping its economic house in order , is finding itself in the unfamiliar and unhappy position of being buffeted even more than markets overseas , as interest rates here soar , the yen tumbles and stock prices skid japan is finding that maintaining a vigorous domestic economy is not enough in this new era of economic interdependence japan is discovering its vulnerabilities a lucid analysis it was telling that when ariyoshi okumura , the thoughtful president of the industrial bank of japan s money management arm , was asked what was behind the frighteningly steep plunge on the troubled tokyo stock market , he delivered a lucid analysis not of japan s markets , now the world s largest , but of west germany s , which are tiny by comparison the closely watched nikkei stock index fell 1 , 56910 points monday , to 3332187 that was an improvement from its low point of the day , when it had fallen nearly 2 , 500 points last week , the nikkei index tumbled by nearly 7 percent , and it is off more than 15 percent from its record high , set in december both worrying and reassuring signs were in the market , with traders and analysts saying that severe as the decline was , it did not seem at this stage to be heralding the kind of crash that struck markets on oct 13 , 1987 trading volume has been running at about half its normal level and was light this morning , meaning that investors are not panicking , analysts said but in a troubling sign , many shares could not even open this morning , since selling was so heavy that prices had hit their preset limits before the bell was even truck japanese authorities began to mobilize this morning , another sign of how seriously the decline is being taken here last week , the finance ministry warned major securities houses to limit their program trading , which has been blamed for contributing to the tumble volume was an unusually light 400 million shares on monday , suggesting that as was the case last week , large financial institutions were not active participants in the selloff monday morning , the bank of japan was actively intervening in the foreign exchange market , selling dollars and buying hundreds of millions of dollars in yen in a sofarfutile effort to stem the dollar s rise the higher the dollar goes against the yen , the more pressure there is to increase japanese interest rates , which could well send stock prices spinning even lower in addition , the bank of japan was reportedly calling large financial institutions this morning , offering loans in an effort to reassure them that cash would be available if necessary to meet any unusual demand in addition , the japanese finance minister , ryutaro hashimoto , issued a statement today saying he was very much concerned by the market s drop and the weakening yen he attributed the decline not to economic problems japan s economy is booming but to lingering uncertainties raised by the recent elections in japan and growing stresses in japan s relationship with the united states other analysts added that there were some domestic factors behind the problems in the market a senior executive at the nomura securities company , japan s and the world s largest brokerage house , said computerized program trading was a factor monday morning and last week higher interest rates lawrence prager , a senior analyst at the nikko securities company , said that the jump in interest rates here an increase of nearly 30 percent in certain key rates since the beginning of the year was hammering the bond market and that stock prices were simply reflecting those factors but all those concerns eventually reflect the value of the yen and interest rates , which are being heavily influenced by the developments in europe and the united states that is the unfamiliar reality to which tokyo is just now adapting with such difficulty five years after the major industrialized nations met to chart a new era in economic cooperation and interdependence , in the form of the socalled plaza agreement , none of the nations has accepted easily the notion that keeping one s own domestic economic house in order is not good enough any longer the output of goods and services in japan is still booming at a growth rate of more than 4 percent , with inflation actually expected to decline this year to below 3 percent corporate profits will set a record , yet again , for the fiscal year that ends march 31 , and are expected to grow a robust 10 percent in the coming year increasing pressure all the same , the bank of japan is under pressure to raise interest rates for the fourth time since last may to bolster the sagging yen fear of inflation are also lingering , due to a severe shortage of labor , soaring land prices and rapid growth in the nation s money supply the adjustment to higher shortterm interest rates in tokyo last week took place in the american financial markets a few weeks ago , as united states rates bobbed upward and stock prices slid under similar pressures tokyo s markets rode the shinkansen to catch up with amtrak , said mr okumura , referring to japan s famous bullet train and the wellknown american railroad tokyo has only caught up with movements that took place in new york several weeks ago , and now everyone is watching the situation in germany

lee p brown , joseph a fernandez and alan f kiepper have something in common besides being named to the three most prominent appointive public posts in new york city none is a new yorker mr brown , the incoming police commissioner , was born in oklahoma and headed police departments in atlanta and houston , where the force is oneseventh the size of new york s mr fernandez , the new schools chancellor , is an east harlem native , but he left new york 30 years ago for florida he ran the miami school system , which has fewer than onethird as many students as new york mr kiepper , born in syracuse , was appointed president of the transit authority after serving in similar posts in atlanta and , most recently , in houston , which has no subway does it make any difference that they come from out of town \? yes generally , it is riskier to appoint officials with no new york experience but the potential reward , in an outsider s capacity to budge resistant bureaucracies , may be worth the risk there is ample evidence of both henry a barnes , recruited from baltimore , served with flair and distinction as traffic commissioner in the 1960 s howard r leary , who came from philadelphia in 1966 , was less successful as police commissioner and was the last outoftowner appointed to that post before mr brown dr abraham j kauvar , hired from denver in the koch administration , lasted five months as president of the health and hospitals corporation midway , he suggested to a racially mixed audience in brooklyn that critics of government were always looking for a nigger in the woodpile dr kauvar learned a lesson this is new york , and i'm a smalltown boy moreover , said robert f wagner jr , the board of education president , dr kauvar discovered that new york was not just denver multiplied by 10 coming from the outside , there is a lack of being able to navigate the sharkfilled waters and even to know what variety of sharks are out there and their particular feeding habits , mr wagner said but there is also a sense that anything can happen , whereas new yorkers , especially from within agencies , often have a sense of defeat , he said dr richard r green , from minneapolis , was the latest of several imported schools chancellors who were slow to understand the system \( dr green , like mr barnes , died in office \) outoftowners have fared better in transportation posts mr kiepper succeeds david l gunn , who was hired from philadelphia by robert r kiley , the metropolitan transportation authority chairman who , himself , came by way of boston there is clearly a longer learning curve , mr kiley said , at least on the question of who all the other players are but you start with a clean slate when you 're on the inside , you 're a captive of your culture mr gunn s fresh perspective enabled him to overcome resistance to creation of a cadre of supervisors his technical skill won the confidence of transit workers that he actually relied upon the system he managed , as a regular subway rider , gained him public respect there s nothing unique about this place , he said , except its size and geography historically , new york has been a mecca for people who , if they made it here , could presumably make it anywhere if not , their failure could be attributed to problems too intractable for anybody to have made it any better living costs and the costs of living in a fishbowl with all varieties of shark , though , may have lessened the attraction mr fernandez , who was making 163 , 000 in miami , collects a 195 , 000 salary in new york , plus 10 , 000 in expenses raised privately , a free residence or housing allowance and other fringe benefits mr kiepper s pay will rise from 135 , 000 to 149 , 500 , plus a 3 , 000 monthly housing allowance but mr brown s salary increase , from 99 , 000 to 110 , 000 , may be eroded by taxes and living costs mr brown was one of two outoftowners among the four finalists recommended to mayor david n dinkins , although the other was a former new york commander outsiders have been offered or are being considered for other city posts too ultimately merit is far more important than whether you were born in staten island or san francisco , said nathan leventhal , president of lincoln center for the performing arts , who presided over mr dinkins s transition , but by and large an administration should be composed of people who know the city mr dinkins himself is a transplanted new jerseyan , though he arrived decades ago today , with an influx of immigrants , most of his constituents are outoftowners , too
chichibu , japan no , that s wrong ! growled akira kurosawa as two giant fans sent clouds of brown dust into a farmhouse on the set of his latest movie the 80yearold director leaped up and rearranged the machines for a different combination of wind , rain and dust in his artificial storm back in his chair , mr kurosawa shouted yoi staato ! \( ready start ! \) this time he grimaced while crew members with hoses spewed water into the wind from atop three tall cranes that spray is much too thin it looks like fog , he declared , shaking his head by now the ground was soaked , and the cast and crew realized that the scene could not be shot again until it dried see you tomorrow , mr kurosawa grumbled with a cursory nod this was definitely not a good day but for mr kurosawa , the making of rhapsody in august has been a happy milestone for the first time in more than 25 years , the patriarch of japanese cinema is working on a new movie immediately after completing a film , akira kurosawa s dreams , which is now playing in the united states he could not be more pleased to be back on a set running out of time since 1965 , mr kurosawa has had to wait five years between each of his films while he and his colleagues looked for financing his search for backing has taken him to the soviet union , france and hollywood , where steven spielberg and george lucas helped make dreams possible indeed , until rhapsody in august , his 29th film , mr kurosawa has not been able to win japanese backing for any project in two decades the chance to make movies back to back is of no small importance wearing baggy cotton pants and a polo shirt , mr kurosawa charges around his set like an old bull filled with restless energy , sometimes lost in a world of his own concentration but the people around him know he does not have many years left to execute all his ideas asked recently if he would ever retire , mr kurosawa snapped it 'll never happen i will be the happiest man if i die at the precise moment that i'm saying , 'yoi staato ! ' rhapsody in august marks a break with the past for mr kurosawa in many other ways it will also be his first film featuring an american movie star , richard gere , who speaks only japanese in the movie memorizing the sounds in an interview , mr gere explained that he did not learn the language itself but studied and memorized the words and worked hard to pick up a natural cadence and sound i knew what i was saying , but not much more than that , he said mr gere has a minor but pivotal role in the movie , playing a wealthy american of mixed parentage who comes to japan from hawaii to visit his old japanese aunt and her children and grandchildren as the story unfolds , it turns out that the aunt s husband was killed on aug 9 , 1945 , under circumstances that for years the whole family had swept under the rug the dropping of an atomic bomb on nagasaki by the united states it s not a large or demanding part , mr gere said of his role when you do a kurosawa film , you want to play macbeth in 'throne of blood' but the idea of working for kurosawasan was very exciting to me this is a film about death , but there s also a lot of humor and poetry in it the screenplay of rhapsody in august is based on a short novel published in 1987 about a grandmother and her family discovering the existence of a rich relative living in hawaii but it was mr kurosawa who wrote the screenplay , adding the connection with nagasaki and the bomb the film is thus mr kurosawa s first attempt to explore cinematically the complex emotional relationship between japan and the united states it is also his first film dealing directly with the american nuclear attacks a difference in 2 cities mr kurosawa said he was intrigued by the fact that nagasaki , unlike hiroshima , does not publicize itself very much as a bomb victim i was interested in finding out the reason for the silence , he said i wanted to find out through the character of this grandma many details about the movie are being kept secret , but it appears that rhapsody in august takes a different approach from that of i live in fear , also known as record of a living being , a 1955 movie with a darkly satiric vision of the nightmare of a future global holocaust in this film , the japanese family members are embarrassed to talk about the bomb , fearing it will hurt their chances to ingratiate themselves with a rich american relative but to their surprise , the american is deeply sympathetic , anxious to ease the grandmother s feelings of loss in one scene in a moonlit garden , he tries to comfort her and she replies it s all right , thank you very much the scene is described as summarizing the theme of forgiveness and friendship by both the united states and japan with the approach of the 50th anniversary of the start of the war between them the movie is to be released in the summer of 1991 mr kurosawa said he never meant to take advantage of the anniversary of pearl harbor but that it was a subject that needed to be aired there are so many things that we should be discussing with americans , he added the issue of the atomic bomb is one an intimate setting
washington , feb 3 a 9 million program to assist the opposition in nicaragua s presidential election has encountered so many delays and bureaucratic obstacles that a nicaraguan government agency has received more money than the coalition of opposition parties supported by the united states , american officials say the problems are attributable to obstacles put up by the sandinista government and to the caution of american officials in the aftermath of the irancontra scandal , the officials say nicaragua , unlike the united states , permits foreign contributions to political parties in national elections but under nicaraguan law , foreign contributors must pay a 50 percent tax to the nicaraguan election agency , the supreme electoral council 'considerable irony' roger f noriega , the official at the united states agency for international development who supervises the nicaraguan election program , said the electoral council had access to 1 , 371 , 000 in american money but he said the national opposition union , a coalition of 14 parties opposing the sandinista government , has received only 278 , 000 the opposition alliance , known as uno , includes parties ranging from rightwing conservatives to socialists and communists its presidential candidate , violeta barrios de chamorro , is publisher of the chief opposition newspaper , la prensa there is considerable irony , mr noriega said the sandinista authorities have blocked uno s access to this money , but the nicaraguan government has access to its share that was the worst nightmare of many people after a visit to managua this week , former president jimmy carter said the nicaraguan authorities agreed to release american funds to the opposition coalition but only three weeks remain before the feb 25 election , and american officials say the sandinistas have reneged on similar promises in the past the program s objective the purpose of the aid program , as described by congress , is to provide assistance for free and fair elections in nicaragua in september , secretary of state james a baker 3d said there was an urgent need for such assistance to help register voters but none has been used for that purpose by the time the president bush signed the bill into law on oct 21 , there was only a day remaining in the the registration period there are two basic reasons for delays since then the agency for international development and various intermediaries , including the national endowment for democracy and foundations associated with the democratic and republican parties in this country , have been extremely cautious before disbursing money , they wanted to establish strict financial controls and procedures to verify and audit all payments a dozen auditors from price waterhouse and three from the united states general accounting office are in nicaragua that caution is a legacy of the irancontra scandal , in which reagan administration officials diverted money to opponents of the nicaraguan government in defiance of restrictions imposed by congress in addition , people involved in the election aid program say the sandinistas have deliberately tried to block or delay the delivery of american money to opposition groups j brian atwood , president of the national democratic institute for international affairs , which is affiliated with the democratic party , said that in view of bureaucratic hurdles in managua and delaying tactics by nicaraguan authorities , we can only conclude that political decisions have been made to slow down the program 'one delay after another' paul s reichler , a lawyer for the nicaraguan government , denied that the sandinistas have not blocked or delayed receipt of the funds , but on the contrary have created special exceptions to their own laws and procedures to facilitate the timely receipt of these funds by the intended nicaraguan beneficiaries , he said but ted d morse of the agency for international development said the response from managua had been just one delay after another american officials offered these examples of problems they have faced wire transfers of money from the united states did not get through to nicaragua checks deposited in nicaraguan banks take weeks to clear the central bank of nicaragua told opposition groups that they could not withdraw dollars needed to pay suppliers because the currency was in

vehicles have been held up by the nicaraguan government for payment of customs duties government offices were closed in a crucial period , from dec 23 to jan 2 a circuitous route american officials say that 17 million people are eligible to vote in nicaragua , so the 9 million represents more than 5 for every potential voter the american aid follows a circuitous route to nicaragua , through a

crack has begun to get a bad name among a growing number of young people in new york city s poorest neighborhoods , according to some teenagers , police officers and researchers who work on the streets rather than a challenge , something to test a teenager s mettle , they say , the smokable form of cocaine is gaining a reputation as a drug for losers these young people tell how their families , friends and neighbors have been broken by the drug , and , along with several crack addicts and police officers , they tell of a violent backlash , in which groups of teenagers and even younger children have set upon crack addicts and beaten them up or pelted them with sticks or stones one teenager who says he has turned to violence is 18yearold luis solla , who lives in the williamsburg section of brooklyn and works as a lifeguard at a fitness center his 21yearold brother , he says , is a crack addict and dealer who was thrown out of the house at 17 and into prison at 19 his sister , who is 19 , was also a crack addict she abandoned her baby , and ran off to live with her crackdealing boyfriend in connecticut 'we do n't do crack' i do n't want to be like some people out here , mr solla said they lose their homes because they 're on it i do n't want to get involved with that every day , he says , he is reminded of crack s toll all my friends , we do n't do crack because we look at the older guys on the block , he said they 're all bad crackheads i look at them and i see what they 're doing , and i do n't want to be like that he and his friends , he added , fight with crack users we beat them up we 're trying to get them out of the neighborhood these reports of changing attitudes are largely anecdotal , and lawenforcement officials say they have no hard evidence of major changes in patterns of drug use but for researchers who work on the streets of new york , they offer hope that five years after the arrival of crack , social pressures and the daily sights of devastation are turning some young people away from the drug along with experts at drugtreatment centers , they say that the addict population seems to be getting older , a sign , they say , that the epidemic may be starting to wane i'm seeing that there is a movement away from crack , said dr terry williams , a sociologist at the city university of new york who lives in east harlem and has been studying the epidemic there , right now , it s certainly clear that that s happening at the street level dr ansley hamid , a researcher at the john jay college of criminal justice who works in williamsburg and other areas of brooklyn , agrees young people are ridiculing crackheads in their neighborhoods , even beating them up , and are abstaining from drugs themselves , other than a little marijuana and beer , he said 'they 're like fiends' on the streets of williamsburg , one of mr solla s friends , 16yearold joseph drexler , looks around and sees two uncles and an aunt who are homeless crack addicts i do n't even consider them family , he said mr drexler has also seen friends and acquaintances ruined by the drug i have a few friends they 're older than me but i grew up with them all my life , he said they started using crack a long time ago they 're crackheads they live on my block and they rob all the time they rob off their best friends , their families they 're like fiends they 'll do anything to get the money we do n't want them on our block on a recent afternoon , a skeletal young woman in a red tank top and dirty white pants huddled on a rubblestrewn crack corner in the bushwick section of brooklyn and told of a harrowing experience at the hands of a gang of children the woman who , fearing reprisal , spoke on the condition that her name not be used said she was 25 and began smoking cocaine eight years ago , when it was sold as a powder and she had to cook it up into a smokable form now she prostitutes herself and sells crack to support her habit children s taunts , and sticks she is humiliated , she says , by the children s taunts crackhead , thirsty crackhead do you know how much that hurts \?

hallandale , fla rrshug mcgaughey left gulfstream park on nov 6 with two breeders' cup victories and a broken spirit two days earlier , the trainer for the phipps stable had come within a neck of the greatest afternoon of training in american racing history after sending out dancing spree to win the 1 million sprint and rhythm to win the 1 million juvenile , mcgaughey was oddson to add the 3 million classic with easy goer victory would have made him the first trainer ever to win three cup races in a day , and would have made easy goer the official horse of the year and unofficial horse of the decade the length of sunday silence s neck at the classic finish changed everything when the eclipse awards are handed out friday night in miami beach , sunday silence and not easy goer will be the horse of the year and charlie whittingham instead of mcgaughey will be honored as the outstanding trainer of 1989 the outcome of the race knocked the wind out of mcgaughey s year , and rearranged his travel plans he had been scheduled to fly from fort lauderdale to lexington , ky , two days after the breeders' cup , to attend a couple of horse auctions and be toasted by his hometown cronies for a year that included 8 million in purses and 14 grade i stakes victories instead , mcgaughey quietly got on the coach section of a flight back to new york , unable to enjoy his two victories and more dejected by easy goer s defeat than any of the colt s fans it felt like a long , long year , mcgaughey said yesterday morning as he sat in a canvas chair just outside his stable at gulfstream and squinted into the morning glare of the florida sun it took me a long time to get to where i could even think about it i was just disappointed and really worn out the new year began inauspiciously , as mcgaughey sent out seven straight losers at gulfstream , most of them oddson favorites who were n't even close they were the small artillery in the stable , though , and now mcgaughey is wheeling out the big guns on sunday , dancing spree flew home from last place and was awarded first place in the gulfstream sprint championship yesterday morning , easy goer s feet touched a race track for the first time since the classic , and the 4yearold looked just fine during a light jog this morning , rhythm will work five furlongs to get him set for the hutcheson stakes on saturday , the colt s first step toward the kentucky derby on may 5 rhythm , like easy goer a year earlier , was voted the nation s champion 2yearold , but that is about all that the two have in common easy goer was a colt of raw brilliance and boundless potential , the heaviest derby favorite in a decade rhythm , at this point , is nothing more than one nice colt among at least a dozen evenly matched derby prospects , and is no better than second choice to grand canyon in the derby winter books i think he s a pretty decent race horse , mcgaughey said yesterday he s got plenty of quality , plenty of class and plenty of pedigree we kept him in training since the breeders' cup , and he s just where i want him he has n't grown much but he has filled out , and there s been a tremendous attitude change as a 2yearold , he was ornery , but now he walks up to the track like a pony the plan is to run rhythm in the hutcheson , the fountain of youth on march 3 , the florida derby on march 17 , and the blue grass on april 15 mcgaughey has two other derby possibilities in polish numbers , who is likely to run in the gotham and wood memorial at aqueduct , and adjudicating , who may take the arkansas route it is clear , though , that none of these colts holds a candle to easy goer in the trainer s mind or heart , or in any race tracker s opinion when people around the track ask him how the big horse is doing , they are asking about easy goer and mcgaughey responds without asking for clarification easy goer will return to new york in early april and point for the metropolitan , suburban and brooklyn handicaps at belmont this summer the goals for the fall are the jockey club gold cup , likely to be shortened to a mile and a quarter and run on oct 6 this year , and finally the breeders' cup classic on oct 27 at belmont sunday silence , who will race in california this summer , is scheduled to run in the classic and could conceivably come east a race earlier for the gold cup mcgaughey would be game for as many as three rematches with his nemesis if we beat sunday silence at belmont , people will say it s because we 're in new york , so i 'd be happy to meet him on neutral ground as well , mcgaughey said yesterday i do n't want any part of a match race , but if we could run against him at arlington park late in the summer , i 'd do it i do n't want it to be a bitter thing , just a fair race like most trainers , and especially those raised in bluegrass country , mcgaughey wants to win the derby more than anything else he knows he may never get his hands on another easy goer , and that he will be playing a weaker hand this year it will be nearly as sweet a homecoming triumph as a derby , though , if this year s classic turns out the way mcgaughey hopes and he takes that trip to kentucky he just could n't face last fall photo shug mcgaughey \( the new york times vic delucia \)

xinshi , china tan youyun , a 42yearold private businessman , nibbled a bit of steaming pig intestine and furrowed his brow as he tried to think of some way in which life had changed since the rise of the hardliners last year i know , he finally said with some relief , as if it would be a political mistake not to be affected occasionally , i used to gamble a little , just small amounts it was for fun , but now that the government has declared that gambling is evil , i do n't do it anymore otherwise , things are just the way they are before eight months after china s democracy movement ended in bloodshed , the country s airwaves and newspapers remain full of harsh ideological language but underneath the ideological blizzard , for the great majority of the chinese population that lives outside the major cities , the texture of life seems to have changed very little there really has n't been any change , said yi yujiao , a housewife here in xinshi , a small town in hunan province when there was turmoil in beijing , we were anxious that there might be a policy change but so far , nothing has happened and we feel more at ease main change less pornography from a distance , one might get the impression that all of china is chafing at the political repression and yearning for the resignation of leaders like prime minister li peng but beyond the city limits , many people do not even know who the prime minister is , and few are political enough to have encountered any repression on a sixday tour of hunan province in south central china , and on visits since the summer to fujian , shaanxi , gansu , hainan and heilongjiang provinces , very few people acknowledged any significant impact on their life or work the only change that many people frequently mention is that their corner newsstand sells less pornography , as a result of the campaign against 6 evils under way since the fall in china s biggest cities , and especially beijing , the mood is very different , and most people in interviews and conversations seem to be still seething at the authorities in the capital , especially , many residents knew someone who was killed , wounded or arrested , and lives and jobs were disrupted by the subsequent wave of political indoctrination as well as by the presence of martiallaw troops despite the government s publicrelations efforts , such as the love the people month proclaimed by the police , the hostility to the leadership in beijing seems as great as ever in beijing , some residents say the situation is now less tense than before , and they point to the lifting of martial law and the release of students and workers who had been detained the authorities have even advised university officials to prepare for the release soon of guo haifeng , the secretary general of the united association of beijing universities , a beijing university administrator said but others note that troops remain in the capital , and that those freed from jail have mostly been fired from their jobs and denied new work , and they say little if anything has changed discontent in the provinces outside beijing , the atmosphere was never so tense , and almost everybody interviewed says tensions are declining partly , that may be because in the provinces , neither the democracy movement nor the repression went as far as in beijing here in hunan province , for example , with a population of 60 million , a provincial spokesman said that about 400 people , none of them students , had been arrested in connection with the democracy movement and with a looting rampage that coincided with a demonstration in april most have been released , and fewer than 100 who committed specific acts of violence remain in prison , while nobody has been sentenced to death , the spokesman , you bizhu , said it is impossible to confirm his figures there is widespread discontent in the provinces , as well as in the cities but except among intellectuals , it often has less to do with political repression than with corruption among officials , delayed payment by the government for crops , family planning policies and the economic slowdown for someone familiar with the horror expressed in beijing and in many foreign countries at the killings in june , it is striking that chinese outside the capital often do not sound particularly outraged while many people have heard that there is more to the story than the government lets on , they did not see the army assault on television or read about it in any detail it is more distant to them emotionally than it was to many in the west result of economic stagnation maybe it was n't right to use so much force in beijing , i do n't know , said a middleaged worker in the northeastern city of harbin , in a typical comment but since then , the government has n't done much that is different , and for me and my generation , what we care about most is social stability some say that even if thousands of innocent people were shot , it is not such a large number by chinese standards of brutality hundreds of thousands were killed in the cultural revolution , for example and they seem more exercised by other issues , like the government s austerity policy it is through the austerity policy that the hardliners have made their presence felt on the lives of most ordinary people more than through political measures , chinese say however , the austerity program was adopted before the democracy movement began , and since in general terms it is endorsed by the world bank and most western economists , it is difficult to regard it by itself as a hardline policy but some intellectuals argue that while a large part of china s population may be oblivious to the political repression , the entire country will pay a price in longterm stagnation because of the present leadership s unwillingness to adopt steps toward wideranging economic changes while china is standing still , other countries increasingly are restructuring their economies along market lines 'campaign ! a campaign ! ' in trying to explain why the hardline language has not been accompanied by more change at the grassroots levels , some say that the best analogy is a famous chinese movie filmed here in hunan province , a small town called hibiscus the movie , and the book by the same name by gu hua , record the political savagery that takes place in a small village in the 1960 s and 1970 s when the maoist period ends in the late 1970 s , one of the party members who had led past political campaigns loses his mind and begins to rant and rave , shouting campaign ! a campaign ! , but now the villagers ignore him and even laugh at him these days , some intellectuals say , the party leadership in beijing is in the same position , ranting and calling for political campaigns , while most people ignore it and go about their business pretty much as before that s exactly what it s like , said a young woman in the southern city of haikou the leaders are rushing around , yelling 'campaign ! a campaign ! ' but china has changed and opened up and it s no longer like the cultural revolution we 're not willing to follow behind them any more photo since china s democracy movement ended eight months ago , everyday life has changed very little when there was turmoil in beijing , we were anxious that there might be a policy change but so far , nothing has happened and we feel more at ease , said yi yujiao , who fed her pigs in xinshi , china \( the new york times nicholas d kristof \) map of xinshi , china
bremen , west germany , feb 27 last fall , the first waves of east german refugees were greeted with tears and champagne now they are increasingly met with resentment and disdain nowhere is that more evident than in bremen , which recently became the first city in west germany to shut its doors to the east german immigrants who have continued flooding into west germany despite the political changes in their land the reason , mayor klaus wedemeier declared , was that we simply had no more room with 7 , 000 of its own residents waiting for housing and 145 percent unemployed , he said , the city simply could not cope with any more east germans something had to be done' five gymnasiums had already been converted to emergency barracks for the east germans and when city officials went to the suburb of vegesack this month to take over yet another gym , they found that the local sports club had occupied the building to keep them out our action was not aimed at the east germans , said heinz kording , president of the club but something had to happen we had to give a signal to the government that something had to be done to stop this the local government did on feb 20 , the city council , known as the senate , declared a freeze on accepting resettlers if any east germans were sent over , the mayor said , they would go homeless or be shipped back under existing procedures , arriving east germans first go to a federal processing center and are then distributed among states bremen , despite a population of just 600 , 000 , shares with hamburg the distinction of ranking as a separate state , the legacy of their history as independent hanseatic cities the formula for distributing resettlers is based on the population of the 11 west german states bremen , with about 1 percent of the west german population , is expected to take 1 percent of all new arrivals , though in fact it accepted 17 percent , or about 7 , 700 east germans so far , and a somewhat larger number of germans from eastern europe euphoria turns to resentment by comparison , north rhinewestphalia , the largest state , took 170 , 000 east german resettlers last year and 5 , 400 so far this year hamburg , the other citystate , has accepted about 10 , 000 east germans only two months ago , when the euphoria over the reunion of the two germanys was still ablaze , bremen would have been denounced as unpatriotic and inhumane for closing its doors but in the sober mood that has settled over the land in the last two months , bremen echoed a growing resentment across west germany last fall , when the first waves of east germans arrived through hungary or czechoslovakia , they were escaping from tangible repression and breaching a barrier that had cooped them up for 40 years now , with the gates wide open and changes imminent , they are increasingly perceived to be fleeing only for the money , and in the process to be undermining the east german economy and straining west german social services that , in turn , has made the exodus the dominant argument for rapid reunification many resettlers remain jobless rare is the west german city that has not felt the weight of the flood of immigrants , whether from east germany or eastern europe youth hostels , gyms , even prisons and ships in the hamburg harbor , have been converted into emergency housing , and still there is not enough hamburg took a new step today when it commandeered several vacant apartments for the resettlers last year , 344 , 000 east germans crossed into west germany , along with 377 , 000 ethnic germans from eastern europe and 121 , 000 asylum seekers from the third world as of today , 114 , 635 east germans had arrived this year , at a rate that has steadily crept up from an average of about 1 , 800 per day in january to 2 , 250 per day this month about 60 , 000 other resettlers have arrived from elsewhere in europe so far this year a large number are unemployed , and no end to the flow is in sight the german institute for economic research predicted this week that the rate will begin decreasing in 1991 , and that 18 million more east germans will move west in the next decade low regard for latest arrivals bremen has not been alone in its resistance hamburg has cut back the numbers of resettlers it accepts to a trickle in the neighboring state of north rhinewestphalia , 64 communities have declared themselves saturated , and the premier of the state of lower saxony , ernst albrecht , has called for a halt to resettlers after the march 18 elections in east germany unless they have housing and a job oskar lafontaine , the premier of saarland state and the likely challenger to chancellor helmut kohl from the social democratic party in december s election , has campaigned strongly on a platform of ending all special treatment for east german resettlers added to such arguments is a growing sense that those east germans who are fleeing now are increasingly the dregs of their society criminals , alcoholics , prostitutes , divorced men fleeing alimony , shirkers outside the sports club in the suburb of blumenthal , two of whose gyms have been taken over for the resettlers , joachim mitera , a customs officer and parttime yoga teacher , sounded an increasingly common plaint 'if it s full , it s full'
sofia , bulgaria , march 26 a special commission of the bulgarian government has uncovered a series of concentration camps where some prisoners were tortured and killed in the 1950 s and early 1960 s under the rule of todor zhivkov , the communist leader ousted last november the existence of the camps was made public in an article on friday in demokratsiya , the newspaper of the opposition coalition called the united democratic forces , and more reports with new details and allegations have appeared since in other newspapers and on bulgarian television iordan ormankov , a lawyer who is the spokesman of the ministry of interior , said today in an interview that mr zhivkov himself might be implicated by the investigation of the serious crimes committed in the camps in an authoritarian regime such as existed before nov 10 it was not possible for such things to be neglected by the ruler , mr ormankov said todor zhivkov at least knew or gave the orders the problem is that from this period there were few material traces it was done on the telephone zhivkov is confined mr zhivkov is now confined in a military hospital on the southwestern edge of sofia , while the state prosecutor continues an investigation of other possible crimes committed during his 35year rule the concentration camps under investigation were at kotsian , bogdanov dol , belene island in the danube and at lovech the disclosures most shocking to ordinary bulgarians concern lovech , situated in the northern center of the country some bulgarian press reports are calling it a death camp mr ormankov said a preliminary examination of interior ministry archives and interviews with former inmates indicate that between 700 and 1 , 000 people were interned at lovech starting in 1959 and that about 100 died there or were killed the inmates included common criminals , people who refused to work and possibly some members of the communist party as to who was directly responsible , mr ormankov said documents show that the activities of these units , or 'objects' as they were called , were under the control of the deputy minister of interior , col gen mircho spasov he issued the directives , mostly verbally , although there are several documents bearing his signature general 'alive and well' general spasov , who retired several years ago , occupies a large brick villa surrounded by a steel fence in dragalevtsi , a village on the north slope of mount vitosh overlooking the capital he is alive and well , the spokesman said , but if i were in his shoes , i would use my gun on myself that is strictly a personal opinion lovech was apparently opened in 1959 and , according to mr ormankov , closed by a decision of the ruling party politburo on april 5 , 1962 the spokesman said the remaining prisoners were freed and several camp officials dismissed or otherwise disciplined none was convicted , he added a nearby parallel camp for women , mostly prostitutes , was also closed down would other former interior ministry officials besides general spasov face trial \? mr ormankov said i do n't exclude it very probably some will face trial for serious crimes we want to make a clean break with the past and to be governed by the rule of law many employees dismissed to this end , he pointed out , the former state security secret police has been dissolved and the ministry of interior completely reorganized a major part of the employees have been dismissed , he said among the incidents described by surviving camp inmates are a visit to lovech by general spasov , who was quoted as ordering a major , beatings for everyone and work , work , work some prisoners were clubbed to death , the former inmates said another inmate who was doing forced labor at the camp charged that he heard mr zhivkov say of the prisoners during a visit , these are weeds that should be cut at the roots without mercy a former inmate , dimiter mitov , said that at lovech some prisoners , including three former army colonels and a physician , had been compelled by guards to drag chunks of ice from the river osam in winter and that those who collapsed were left to freeze or drown last weekend , about 5 , 000 bulgarians demonstrated at lovech carrying signs saying , death to the killers
los angeles , april 27 about a year ago , carol burnett got a call from michael eisner , the chairman of the walt disney company and one of hollywood s most persuasive behindthescenes matchmakers mr eisner suggested that she get together with matt williams , a television writer and producer who had recently signed on at disney after creating the hit abc series roseanne ms burnett had not done a weekly television show since her immensely successful comedyvariety show ended its 11year run on cbs in 1978 , but she agreed to meet with mr williams out of their meeting came the concept for carol company , which after four weeks on the air on saturday nights on nbc is shaping up as a triumphal return to television for the popular actresscomedian and one of the most successful new shows of the season for the network what lured ms burnett back to television was mr williams s idea of doing a comedy anthology a halfhour show in which she would play a new character in a new situation every week , a concept that , by network television standards at least , was innovative and daring ms burnett had come up with a similar idea five years ago , but when she pitched it to a network she got a negative response i 'd already done a variety program , and i did n't want to do a grandmagoestocollege kind of sitcom , said ms burnett , who turned 57 this week but still has no problem convincingly playing characters two decades younger i knew if i came back to weekly television , i wanted to do something different avoiding a sitcom trap to ms burnett , the format plays to her experience in sketch comedy on the old carol burnett show , along with tim conway , harvey korman and vicki lawrence yet it also allows the characters to be developed more fully than in a fiveminute sketch it also enables her to avoid what she considers the trap of the formula sitcom in situation comedy you get locked into specific characters and situations and the audience comes to expect certain things of you , mr williams said the anthology format allows you to explore many other ideas and themes i do n't know if it could be done without a star to hang it on , to introduce all the new things every week there has to be one thing that s familiar every week , and for us that s carol ms burnett saw the show as a oneact play that could be taped in front of a live audience in a single runthrough , which she says is the way she prefers to work \( as a concession to television realities , the show is taped once before the audience comes in to provide a backup in case a line is badly flubbed or the set falls apart during the live taping \) ms burnett s proven popularity was enough to get nbc interested last year if you look at the track record of anthology shows , it has n't been the strongest , said ted frank , the vice president for current comedy programming at nbc but we were comfortable going into this with carol burnett because people are used to seeing her play a variety of characters 'the hardest kind of show' still , carol company had a difficult gestation , which led many people at nbc and at disney , the show s producer , to wonder for a while whether an anthology presented too many logistical and creative problems because it requires new sets and involves creating a whole new cast of characters each week , a halfhour anthology show costs more than the 500 , 000 average it takes to produce most comedy shows if you could pick the hardest kind of show to do , it would be this one , ms burnett said you have to come up with allnew characters , say what you want to say , and wind it up in 20 minutes the main problem the show faced last fall was assembling a regular cast to work with ms burnett the original idea was to cast each show separately , often using guest stars , and to assemble a regular repertory company from the ranks of those who appeared during the first season but it quickly became apparent that it was too difficult for the writers to do scripts each week for actors and actresses they did not know and that it was difficult for ms burnett to establish chemistry with her coplayers when the cast changed completely each week i felt like a kid whose parents were moving every week and had to go into the playground to make new friends all the time , she said a company of five as a result , production on the show was shut down after four episodes to assemble a permanent cast , something that neither mr williams nor ms burnett had time to do in the crazy rush to put together another show each week by january , mr williams had put together a company of five actors they are terry kiser , who recently appeared in the film weekend at bernie s meagen fay , richard kind and jeremy piven , all alumni of the second city comedy troupe , and anita barone , a relative newcomer the shows produced before the permanent cast was assembled will be broadcast along with the other episodes this spring with the new cast in place , production resumed in january the first of 12 shows ordered by nbc for this season had its premiere on march 31 at 9 30 pm , following the hit show the golden girls it has since moved to its regular 10 pm slot , following empty nest so far carol company has met the test faced by new shows , not only winning its time period in the ratings , but also holding onto or expanding the audience from the preceding program as a result , said randy reiss , the president of disney s network television division , the show is virtually certain to be brought back by nbc for next fall s schedule since her former show went off the air a dozen years ago , ms burnett has started her own production company , written a book about her mother , appeared in several films and done television specials her actor s selfprotective instinct , she said , has kept her from opening the champagne just yet killer from the yellow pages among the episodes broadcast so far none of which were with the now permanent cast was one in which ms burnett plays a wife who , fed up with her husband s philandering and abuse , hires a hit man out of the phone book to kill him , and another in which she plays georgette , a woman attending the 25th reunion at her high school , where before her sexchange operation she had been george , the quarterback on the football team what you have in carol is someone who is not just a great comedian but a great actress , mr williams said she approaches everything as a theatertrained actress instead of asking how many jokes are on this page she wants to know who this character is and what this show s about photo carol burnett in an episode of carol company
the sheer volume of new construction here , in this last gasp of the boom of the 1980 s , is startling almost never have so many huge buildings come to completion at the same time in a single , highly concentrated area of manhattan , let alone one with as much symbolic import as times square two new skyscraper hotels , the macklowe and the holiday inn crowne plaza , have just opened another , the embassy suites , is opening next month , and a fourth is just going into construction three major office buildings are being finished this fall , joining two others that were completed last year and all this is without the biggest project of all , the subsidized , citystate venture called the times square redevelopment project , which is planned to include four immense office towers with a total of four million square feet of space , another hotel , a merchandise mart and renovations to the decrepit historic theaters on west 42d street that multibilliondollar effort , in which private developers will work in partnership with the government , has been mired in controversy since its announcement in 1981 it has recently survived several legal challenges , however , and the possibility that the longstalled project will move forward has increased back in 1981 , one justification put forth for surrounding times square with huge office towers was that public investment on that scale was necessary to stimulate private investment in the troubled area the buildings nearing completion prove that supposition wrong , of course , since what we are now seeing is the completion of a new , privately financed and privately built times square neighborhood , so filling the blocks of broadway and seventh avenue just north of times square that only a handful of sites undeveloped what is this new times square going to be like \? it s a world of tall buildings that are not quite the same as most of the others that were deposited on manhattan by the boom of the 1980 s first , the new towers of times square are determinedly modern in an age in which so many architects of largescale commercial buildings have been seduced by the postmodern charms of limestone and granite , the designers of the new skyscrapers here seem to have had eyes only for glass and shiny metal is it the ultimate rearguard action , or the newest wave \? a little of both none of the new towers represent any real architectural innovation , although most of them seem to have a sense of playfulness that is rare in recent manhattan towers not brilliant wit or daring invention , but mild playfulness , which is n't the worst thing for times square some of this playfulness comes in connection with the second distinguishing thing about these new skyscrapers , their lighted exteriors and commercial signs city planners , fearful that the press of new construction would obliterate the fabled advertising signs of times square , several years ago wrote new zoning regulations requiring that all new skyscrapers in the times square district have exterior lighting and a provision for elaborate signs around their bases it s hard not to think that there was some tie between this provision and the nearly unanimous embrace of modernism around times square , if only because it s much easier to graft exterior lighting and commercial signs onto a modern form than a classically inspired one can you do classical pediments and column capitals in neon \? we can consider ourselves lucky that neither postmodernism nor times square has come to that in any event , the intentions in these zoning laws were reasonable enough , though it wo n't be possible to evaluate the success of the effort until the signs many of which have yet to be rented to advertisers are completely in and operating \( in some cases , as at the holiday inn crowne plaza on broadway at 48th street , designed by alan lapidus and finished last year , this can follow the opening of the building by some time the crowne plaza s signs still are n't all in \) so it s going to be the old times square well , a cleanedup version of the old times square at street level , a sleek world of office workers and hotel guests up above \? that s the idea , and while it may not be as pleasing as the messy , amiably chaotic , random streetscape that has always characterized times square , it s probably better than letting the whole thing deteriorate into another avenue of the americas the city s desire was not to try to stop the inevitable spread of highrise building to times square but to force it to accommodate itself to the elements that have given the square its identity as to the buildings themselves as works of architecture , it will be necessary here , too , to wait just a little bit longer probably the most is expected of 1585 broadway , at 47th street , designed by the firm of gwathmey siegel with emery roth sons this shiny structure of aluminum and glass , at once massive and sleek , is the first skyscraper to come from the architect charles gwathmey across the street is 750 seventh avenue by kevin roche , an agreeably quirky building of black glass with a silver spire that looks like a hightech version of an old factory smokestack both will be open shortly the firm of fox fowle , which designed the recently completed 1675 broadway , at 52d street , an exceptionally handsome , even dignified , tower of gray granite with a form loosely inspired by 30 rockefeller plaza , moves closer to times square with two more buildings the first is a neatly discreet , redbrick office tower at 114 west 47th street with a domed top , opened recently the other is the embassy suites hotel at 47th street and seventh avenue , a curving slab of gray masonry with blue accents and red stripes built over the old palace theater , the hotel looks like an international style skyscraper from the 1920 s done over in the early 80 s by memphis skidmore owings merrill , designers of the serious , hightoned classical tower of worldwide plaza that opened last year , have a more modern entry in the times square show , a glass tower with the pretentious , redundant and false address of one broadway place the building s most notable element is a spire at its base there will be just what new york city needs , a retail atrium and then there is the hotel macklowe on west 44th street just east of broadway , on the same site in which , in a notorious event some years ago , a singleroom occupancy hotel was illegally demolished this is no sro but a bid to bring true luxury accommodations to the times square area the hotel , designed by william derman , is a tower of a curiously appealing , enamellooking dark green glass , set on a stone base that has nothing to do with it at all inside is a lobby of considerable luxury and finesse , a splendid mix of 1930 s new york and viennese modernism , all in black and white and glass and rich woods , a bit like a movie set for a sleek new york interior space from the 1980 s photos times square , looking north and west from the paramount building and , left , at twilightright now , the temptation is to say that times square is changing from a tawdry theater district to a tawdry hotel and office district \( photographs by jack manning the new york times \)
elton fax , an illustrator and author , says he will never forget the first movie with an allblack cast that he saw nearly 70 years ago when he was growing up in a black neighborhood in baltimore the film was oscar micheaux s house behind the cedars and he was thrilled , he said the other day , because it was the first time i had seen black performers on the screen who were n't doing stepin fetchit roles , not doing the old chickenstealing scenes and looking scared and seeing ghosts recollections by mr fax and others have inspired an exhibition and a film series that trace a neglected period in film history the development of movies produced for black audiences , a genre known as race movies movies and reminiscences from harlem to hollywood american race movies 19121948 , at the american museum of the moving image in astoria , queens , features production stills and posters , lobby cards , programs and portraits of stars , in an exhibition scheduled through march 3 the accompanying series of films , mostly from that period , runs through nov 2 throughout the exhibition are quoted reminiscences by mr fax , who wound up illustrating the jackets of two micheaux novels , and by performers and others involved in making race movies , all of whom were interviewed as part of an oral history project for the museum this exhibition grew out of that project , said sharon blume , the deputy director of the museum the information gathered in those interviews to a great extent does not exist in any books the guest curator of harlem to hollywood is pearl bowser , who amassed artifacts from collectors she has come to know during nearly two decades of research she is the executive director and founder of african diaspora images cefs , an archive that documents the history of black independent productions a second film series , feb 2 to march 1 , will explore the resurgence of black cinema in hollywood in the 1970 s lectures on black film and the portrayal of blacks are also scheduled race movies evolved in reaction to hollywood s demeaning stereotypes of blacks , ms bowser said , and one film in particular gave the films impetus d w griffith s birth of a nation \( 1915 \) the epic film , which ridiculed the reconstruction era , focused on a white southern family victimized by evil blacks \( white actors in blackface \) and rescued by the ku klux klan a poster in the exhibition , heralding the mighty spectacle , shows a heroic , hooded klansman seated on a rearing horse and holding a fiery cross lowbudget realism the film drew protests from black leaders and white liberals , and became a kind of catalyst for the creation of films seeking to counter griffith s white supremacist image budgets were tiny , the exhibition notes , and technical problems were often evident on screen but the films gave a more realistic portrait of black americans and explored racial topics , such as lynchings , that were taboo in hollywood and they provided training for black writers , directors and technicians , as well as such performers as lena horne , paul robeson , dorothy dandridge and eddie anderson most early race movies were melodramas focusing on social questions including racial identity lightskinned blacks passing as whites , for instance reflecting that theme , a lobby card with a scene from the call of his people \( 1922 \) shows a woman seated apart from other blacks in a room , looking troubled and apparently wearing white makeup but not all were serious dramas , as seen in a poster for the bulldogger \( 1923 \) showing bill pickett in cowboy attire featuring the colored hero of the mexican bull ring in death defying feats of courage and skill , it declares , adding , thrills ! laughs too ! the struggle for money between 1912 and 1948 , 350 race movies were produced by 150 companies , many of which were owned by whites , particularly after the 1920 s many of the black producers who surfaced after birth of a nation were so pressed for funds that they made only one or two films , ms bowser said many of the whiteowned companies just continued the tradition of black stereotypes , she said i think they were more motivated by the reality of this new market they were targeting almost exclusively for black audiences and there was money to be made an early exception was reol pictures , owned by a white producer , robert levy he made eight allblack silent films based on literature by black writers they were racially uplifting , serious drama , and did not create black stereotypes , she said by the end of the 1920 s , black producers , already troubled by fierce competition and distribution problems , were virtually wiped out by the advent of talkies and the depression talkies required expensive conversion to sound , and they also were the start of blackcast films by big hollywood studios , which crowded out small independents micheaux the survivor but one major figure survived micheaux he is described in the exhibition as an unabashedly aggressive and shrewd entrepreneur who is perhaps the most important single figure in the history of race movies he made about 10 percent of them while most race movies in the 1930 s and 40 s were made by whites who imitated hollywood , and melodrama was giving way to more entertaining fare , micheaux prevailed by adapting to the changing scene while growing dependent on white companies for financial support he had his critics , some of whom are quoted in the exhibition in micheaux s films , mr fax says , the heroes all were nicely groomed and the girls were all nice looking , svelte and certainly none too black after all , why were they selling skin whiteners and hair straighteners so vigorously then \? micheaux played with all of this yet , he added , as negatively as i feel about some of the things he did , this man s pioneering is very significant the schedule of the series films to be shown in the museum series include micheaux s murder in harlem \( 1939 \) , based on an actual lynching , scheduled for friday at 2 pm william alexander s souls of sin \( 1948 \) , about a writer , a musician and a drifter turned gangster who share a basement flat \( saturday at 3 pm and oct 31 at 2 pm \) , and the emperor jones \( 1933 \) with paul robeson , on sunday at 2 pm bright road \( 1953 \) , a dramatic love story starring dorothy dandridge and harry belafonte , will be seen at 4 pm on sunday and on the final day of the series , nov 2 at 2 pm photo an advertisement for the film the bronze buckaroo
lurching there s no better way to describe the kind of leadership mayor david dinkins gave new yorkers last week with the economy in deepening trouble , the city urgently requires a forthright voice and a steady hand here is what it got on monday , he announced an unrealistically generous settlement with the teachers' union that rocks the city treasury in two ways it will cost 236 million by itself worse , the 55 percent raise sent a giltedged invitation to other unions to seek similar raises for themselves on tuesday , responding to a wave of fear about crime and stray gunfire , he proposed an intelligent , ambitious law enforcement plan it would cost the ordinary citizen only about 50 a year , the mayor said there s another way to do the arithmetic the fouryear cost would be 18 billion on thursday , in obvious response to criticism of the labor settlement , he imposed a partial job freeze and suddenly raised the prospect of laying off 15 , 000 city workers new york may be wealthy enough to find funds to give teachers a healthy raise and to pay for an anticrime program or it may be so broke it must contemplate laying off thousands but how can it be both \? and what assurance is there that the dinkins administration wo n't now lurch in some other direction , in response to some other bad news \? it s as if the business conducted in city hall is daybyday public relations instead of sober management of the politics of scarcity the mayor s new initiatives are narrowly plausible in the sense that he does outline how he proposes to get the money for teachers and police but such earmarking misses the point his own officials estimate a budget gap of 14 billion in the next fiscal year outside analysts think 2 billion is more like it and now comptroller elizabeth holtzman says 26 billion none of this is meant to imply that teachers do n't deserve more it s not to deny that the city needs a crime program and the one proposed by police commissioner lee brown is admirable but it s no trick to tell the public what it wants new york knows from the fiscal crisis of the 1970 s that the road to ruin is paved with justifiable programs what makes mr dinkins s initiatives so problematic is that they have emerged piecemeal does it make sense to give teachers a 55 percent raise if the price is truly 15 , 000 layoffs \? should the city hire all 6 , 479 new police officers if that means closing libraries or curtailing foster care \? those may or may not be the choices there s no way to know because mr dinkins has yet to present them coherently indeed , last week s lurches impel some people to wonder if mr dinkins would n't be wise to undo the teacher settlement , suspend the crime proposal and start over that would be a grave retreat , but the problems are grave real estate is in trouble so are finance and insurance media and advertising are sagging and this year , it is costing the city more to operate than it budgeted for it is not too late for mr dinkins to recoup but to do that , he 'll have to offer a steady plan the public can understand if they know why , people will grumble but accept sacrifice otherwise the mayor , and new york , will be left in the lurch
for years it has been no secret that a key to beating any team for which rickey henderson plays is beating rickey henderson yet , knowing about henderson and being able to do something about it has been as elusive a goal as henderson has been as a runner for opposition teams that is why henderson is poised to establish the american league career record for stolen bases after yesterday s game in milwaukee , henderson had a leagueleading 16 steals on the season that gives the oakland outfielder 887 steals in his career , five short of ty cobb s league record of 892 before the year is out , henderson may establish the major league record as well , surpassing lou brock s total \( 938 \) there s been other players who dominate , said frank robinson , the orioles' manager , but not the way rickey does because rickey can hit the ball out of the ball park , he can bunt for hits and when he gets on , it s almost impossible to throw him out and keep him from doing what he does best and that s steal bases 'mixing in intelligence' rickey has n't been a secret for over 10 years clubs really set up to stop him , said tony la russa , henderson s manager in oakland but they ca n't stop him because he keeps mixing in intelligence henderson is uncanny at adjusting to and coping with as many new looks as a defense is willing to give people think i do n't pay attention , but i'm studying all the time , henderson said i analyze the pitchers i analyze the catchers i even analyze the hitters that henderson is everlearning is as frightening a prospect to the rest of the american league as the fact that henderson is only 31 years old he came up young , he s still young and he s still running because he s strong and can take the pounding , said davey lopes , a premier basestealer whose career in the 1970 s and 1980 s overlapped parts of brock s and henderson s careers no pitcher has ever bothered henderson enough to stand out as his no 1 adversary conversely , henderson ranks bob boone , the veteran catcher of the kansas city royals , as someone he is definitely wary of when testing a catcher s arm boone will call pitchouts on odd counts he is not afraid to call for inside pitches or fastballs when least expected to give him a better shot at getting henderson he s definitely intelligent and tough , henderson said but what success boone does have against henderson pales in comparison to henderson s success against the league and since henderson was reacquired by oakland last summer from the yankees , he has given the athletics an even stronger look than many thought possible powerful legs we were playing very well and had a good team so it would have been hard to move us very far , la russa explained not that we were perfect you could improve us in bits and pieces but to pick up a player like rickey , all of a sudden , you make a substantial jump like brock , henderson gets his great acceleration from powerfully built legs after that the two differ in major ways , said lopes , who now coaches for the texas rangers lou always went in feetfirst , but 90 percent of the time rickey slides headfirst , lopes said and rickey steals third , which lou did not like to do that puts rickey ahead in aggressiveness when i look at the films , i admire the aggressiveness of ty cobb and i used to admire the way maury wills stole the bases , he said but , as far as idols , i really admired lou he knew all the time where he was on the bases , how many steps it takes until he got to his slide , when he should slide as for comparisons to other modernday runners , both henderson and his numbers say there simply are none i took notice of willie wilson when i first got into the league because of his speed and skill , henderson said but other than that , most of the other guys came behind me tim raines has great skills so has vince coleman henderson paused , then added as a broad smile crossed his face , they probably admire me more and watch me because , a lot of times i say , they came behind me , so i ai n't gotta look at them
washington , may 25 attorney general dick thornburgh submitted to a polygraph examination during an internal criminal investigation at the justice department that led to the reassignment of his two closest aides , senior bush administration officials disclosed today the officials said mr thornburgh , the first attorney general known to have taken a polygraph , or liedetector , examination , passed the test , which was conducted in secret on a weekend last september this unusual action by the attorney general was the latest development in an investigation that has developed into a morale and political problem for mr thornburgh the turmoil at the department has aroused concern at the white house , where president bush s advisers are hoping he can take steps to calm the situation the investigation involved an attempt by mr thornburgh to determine the source of an unauthorized disclosure to cbs news concerning representative william h gray 3d of pennsylvania in the investigation two of mr thornburgh s top aides , david runkel , his press secretary , and robert s ross jr , his executive assistant , failed polygraph examinations two aides were reassigned neither was implicated as the primary source of the information given to cbs last week the two were reassigned to lesser positions in the department two weeks ago , the justice department s second highest official , donald b ayer , resigned in protest over what he said was an attempt by mr thornburgh to shield the two aides from the investigation the cbs report last may said that the federal bureau of investigation was investigating financial irregularities involving the office of mr gray , who is now the thirdranking democrat in the house at the time , department officials issued a statement saying that mr gray was not a target of the financial investigation and subsequent reports indicated that the inquiry had focused on an accountant who once worked for the congressman mr thornburgh took the polygraph examination at the request of edward s g dennis jr , the head of the department s criminal division after members of the investigative team decided they could not conclude their inquiry into the disclosure to cbs unless all key officials who had access to information about the case were polygraphed it is not known whether mr thornburgh was reluctant to participate , but the meeting that led up to the decision to conduct the polygraph examination was described by administration officials as a tense session in which investigators debated the step , but decided that the credibility of the inquiry could be jeopardized if they failed to question mr thornburgh considers matter closed department officials declined to comment on the assertions about mr thornburgh s polygraph examination in an interview earlier this week , mr thornburgh said he considered the entire matter closed there s nothing unanswered with respect to this matter , so that s it , he said , responding to questions about mr ayer s allegations suggesting that mr thornburgh was trying to protect his two aides mr thornburgh said that no further discussion of the case was warranted because one of the department s top lawyers , solicitor general kenneth w starr , had conducted a review of the investigation , clearing the attorney general and members of his staff of any wrongdoing in the interview , mr thornburgh denied that mr starr had raised concerns that led him to reassign his mr runkel and mr ross that s not correct , said mr thornburgh they were not changes recommended by judge starr if people are going to continue to call me a liar , i am going to get to resent it the turmoil at the department has prompted senior white house officials to express misgivings about mr thornburgh s stewardship for the first time in the interview , he said no one from the white house had expressed concern to him directly about his operation of the department i wish they 'd express their views to me , because i try to be responsive to the white house and they 've expressed their confidence in my stewardship of this department , he said as to whether president bush or senior white house aides had provided any directions for operating his department , the attorney general said , none whatsoever public defense by president publicly , mr bush continues to defend mr thornburgh , white house aides said but privately , senior bush advisers said mr thornburgh had erred by attempting to run the department as he ran state government as governor of pennsylvania , relying on a handful of longtime aides , including mr runkel and mr ross the white house staff is now expressing hope that william p barr , mr ayer s replacement as deputy attorney general , will bring about a calmer atmosphere and greater order and help repair mr thornburgh s public image mr barr , now the assistant attorney general for the office of legal counsel , is one of the few outsiders to work his way into mr thornburgh s inner circle the administration officials said today that mr starr had expressed serious concerns about the responses by mr ross and mr runkel during the gray inquiry the officials' comments suggested that the justice department misrepresented the results of mr starr s review , which has been repeatedly cited by mr thornburgh in recent days to assert that he and his aides had been exonerated of wrongdoing in the matter the role of those aides in the investigation was described in further detail by the officials it has been known that both men failed polygraph examinations , but officials said that they also changed their sworn statements to the fbi after their tests showed deception statements were changed mr runkel at first told investigators he had no involvement in the providing information to cbs , officials said but later , after he failed the polygraph exam , he provided a substantially different account in the later version he acknowledged that had played a role in confirming the information later broadcast the network mr runkel said he would not comment on the matter mr ross initially told investigators that he had no dealings with the network s reporter , officials said but his polygraph exam indicated that he had provided a deceptive response when he was asked whether he talked to a network reporter in the period in which cbs is believed to have prepared its report later he provided an additional statement indicating he had no recollection of such a contact mr ross has insisted that the investigation found he did not provide information to the network and he has said that the changes in his statement were minor the officials also said that another justice department official whose name has not yet been disclosed also provided deceptive answers during a polygraph examination the other department official is the united states attorney in philadelphia , michael m baylson , the administration officials said mr baylson today declined to comment on whether he took a polygraph examination photo attorney general dick thornburgh , who reportedly submitted to a polygraph examination during an internal justice department

a 24foot concrete floor slab , the skeletal remains of a tenement demolished years ago , collapsed in a pounding rain on a bleak hillside lot in the bronx yesterday and killed three homeless men huddled underneath in a makeshift shelter , the police said the victims part of the army of homeless who find refuge in the city s nooks and crannies were crushed under tons of debris as the slab , apparently undermined by daylong rains , fell on their hovel near jerome avenue and 181st street in the university heights section just after 5 pm several hours later , under stark floodlights and surrounded by police and fire rescue teams , a consolidated edison crane gently lifted two slabs of concrete , exposing a narrow crevice a firefighter crawled in and the bodies of the victims were pulled out it was like living in a cave , chief michael cuccio , the commander of the fire department s seventh division , said at the scene , a steep slope a halfblock long that had been churned to mud by the rains and the boots of the rescuers we did n't know if they were alive or dead , the chief said , noting that a census estimate had indicated there might be as many as 15 homeless people at the site we had to go on the assumption that they were alive , but they were dead everybody was dead advocates for the homeless called it a tragedy that represented the plight of many homeless people who choose to avoid the city s armories and official shelters on foul days and seek havens in packing crates , in abandoned drainpipes and under wood or canvas leantos there are tens of thousands of other people holed up in obscure places throughout the five boroughs , said robert m hayes , chairman of the coalition for the homeless until these folks have some place to go , they are all at tremendous risk to their survival the police said one of the dead men was identified by his father as benjamin olivero , 29 years old the father , they said , knew his son had been living under the slab and went to the scene when he heard about the collapse the other two victims were not immediately identified they were described as hispanic men , 30 to 35 years old it was unclear how long they had been living under the concrete slab , which jutted from the hillside and offered minimal protection from heavy weather housing was never built amada castillo , a secretary for geronimo auto parts corporation at 2111 jerome avenue , next to the lot where the collapse occurred , said homeless people had been living under the slab for several months , perhaps longer sometimes they passed by here , she said there are many homeless people on jerome avenue neighborhood residents recalled that the site of the collapse had been one of several sixstory tenements until the mid1970 s , when they were torn down to make way for new housing that was never built one resident , martha torres , said the buildings were demolished 14 years ago the reinforced concrete slab left from the demolition was once apparently the floor of a building , the authorities said resting atop the hill , the slab was about 24 feet long , 12 feet wide and 8 inches thick an old refrigerator was wedged under it , giving the illusion of support police capt frederick e britton said the men who sought shelter under the slab had dug deeper into the hillside to enlarge their quarters , and he speculated that the digging may have destabilized the slab but it was apparently the rains that brought it down the national weather service said more than an inch of rain fell yesterday in the bronx , most of it in the late afternoon , when the downpour at times became a torrent slab fell without warning the police said the slab fell without warning at 5 07 pm it broke into two 12foot main sections that covered the cavity residents and working people nearby heard no roar , just a dull crump as the concrete came down on the homeless men the authorities were called , and police and fire rescue teams were soon on the scene census takers who scoured the city this spring in an effort to identify the doorways , abandoned buildings and makeshift shelters where tens of thousands of homeless people spend their nights had reported that as many as 15 people stayed under the jerome avenue slab chief cuccio said the chance that a number of people were trapped alive under the slab guided the rescue operations instead of digging into the hillside and risking a further collapse that might endanger anyone inside , the officials brought in a yellow crane to gently lift the slabs service on the irt s no 4 woodlawn train running underground nearby was suspended to prevent vibrations during the rescue the rescuers looped metal cables around each slab , which was then lifted carefully away much of this work unfolded in heavy downpours , and one slab slid down the muddy hillside as it was pulled away oh ! watch out ! it s going ! someone shouted as firefighters and police officers , most of them in black slickers with yellow stripes , stood by helplessly in an eerie glow of floodlights in the downpour about 6 30 pm , a narrow opening was gained firefighter john o'connell of rescue squad 3 volunteered to go in sliding in on his stomach , he found the victims , one of whom appeared to be squatting the others were one atop the other he checked for pulses , but found none , and then brought them out one by one they were pronounced dead by a doctor at 7 18 , 8 35 and 8 37 pm digging went on for more than an hour longer dogs were brought in to sniff , but no other victims were found nearby , on jerome avenue , a large crowd of bystanders stood by under a sea of umbrellas , silently watching the drama in the rain photo the concrete remains of a demolished bronx building collapsed yesterday in the rain , killing three homeless people who were sheltered beneath it rescue workers tried to remove bodies with the aid of a con edison crane \( bill swersey for the new york times \)
palace walk by naguib mahfouz translated by william m hutchins and olive e kenny 498 pp new york doubleday 2295 for centuries most westerners thought of the middle east as a place of mystery , where writers like sir richard burton and t e lawrence swaggered across sandy landscapes and returned with accounts of the exotic customs they had glimpsed there more recently , the mystery has turned sinister many of us have come to believe that the entire islamic world is seething with inscrutable religious fanaticism that ferments violence and mayhem these stereotypes are , of course , no more accurate than the opposite one of the west as the great satan but they may explain why the 78yearold egyptian novelist naguib mahfouz , the first of whose more than 40 books was published half a century ago , had to wait until he won the nobel prize in literature in 1988 to become known in the englishspeaking world until this year , his masterpiece , the cairo trilogy , published in arabic in 195657 , has been unavailable in translation now , finally , readers can see for themselves why mr mahfouz has long been considered the finest arab writer of modern times palace walk , the first volume of the trilogy , centers on the life of a family living through the period between the end of world war i and the beginning of the 1919 revolution against british rule , a time of dramatic change in egypt the family s patriarch , alsayyid ahmad , is a member of the colorful fraternity of cairo merchants at home , he is a tyrant who has forbidden his wife to go outside the walls of the house for 25 years when he discovers that his adolescent son fahmy has a crush on a neighbor s daughter , alsayyid is enraged he could not imagine that the world of the emotions had infiltrated the atmosphere of his home , which he vigilantly strove to keep one of stern purity and immaculate innocence yet his wife and children revere him as much as they fear him the father is a complex figure , whose life is composed of a diversity of mutually contradictory elements , wavering between piety and depravity in his shop he is generous and gregarious , and on his nightly carousings with other middleaged businessmen he is a connoisseur of fine wines and fleshly courtesans mr mahfouz spares us none of alsayyid s insensitivity , but shows us his fears and anxieties as well , and even makes us sympathize with him when events conspire to threaten the dignity he has worked so hard to maintain if the father holds the family together through intimidation , the mother , amina , does so through her warmth and kindness in many of his books , mr mahfouz shows a special feeling for oppressed women here , though amina is presented as a totally submissive wife , she also enriches the household with her curiosity , enthusiasm and innocent piety each evening , her two daughters and three sons meet with her for coffee and conversation , a ritual that makes their life not only bearable but lively and rewarding during these discussions , amina s 10yearold son kamal tells her about his school science lessons , which fascinate but sometimes disturb her they differed once about whether the earth rotates on its own axis in space or stands on the head of an ox when she found the boy insistent , she backed down and pretended to give in all the same , she slipped off to fahmy s room to ask him about the truth of the ox supporting the earth , and whether it still did the young man thought he should be gentle with her and answer in language she would like he told her that the earth is held up by the power and wisdom of god his mother left content with this answer , which pleased her , and the large ox was not erased from her imagination one day , her sons persuade amina to leave the house to visit a local mosque , and she is overwhelmed by the bustling scene that as an adult she has previously viewed only from her roof garden when the woman s feet touched the floor of the shrine , she felt that her body was dissolving into tenderness , affection , and love and that she was being transformed into a spirit fluttering into the sky the journey is a dramatic centerpiece to the book everything starts to change for the family afterwards though her husband punishes amina severely for her disobedience , she never regrets the new vision her brief escape has given her both daughters , the beautiful but dim aisha and the plain but witty khadija , have husbands chosen for them and leave the household the oldest son , yasin , who has trouble keeping his hands off the family maidservants , embarks on a disastrous marriage but it is the revolution that poses the greatest challenge to the ultraconservative world of alsayyid kamal becomes the mascot of the british soldiers camped in the street outside the house his brother fahmy , however , becomes a political activist ultimately , he must defy his father , who rightly fears that any involvement in politics will bring tragic consequences to his household

mayor david n dinkins and his top deputies and aides huddled at gracie mansion yesterday , discussing new york city s deepening fiscal problems and how best to explain them to the public after a troubled week of seemingly conflicting signals from city hall we think we do have a plan , one senior aide said we 've got to figure out how we articulate that plan , just what steps do we take , and what window do we have until we have to make definite decisions but even as they sought to regain control of the debate prompted by their actions last week , which ended with mr dinkins saying he was considering the layoff of 15 , 000 city workers , the mayor and his aides faced the challenge of making still more difficult decisions to cut spending to close a budget gap for the coming fiscal year that they estimate at 14 billion cuts for building projects the dinkins administration must present such plans as part of its scheduled quarterly report to the state financial control board on nov 1 , and in its 10year plan for capital building projects , required to be issued by november under the new city charter the administration , some senior aides said , is expected to detail its plans , perhaps later this week , for cutting outlays for building projects like roads , parks and bridges to reduce mounting debtservice costs cuts in some agencies could range up to 25 percent , mayoral aides have said of all the recent bad fiscal news , some experts say trimming the capital budget which is financed by longterm bonds , was built up painfully and proudly after the city fiscal crisis of the mid1970 s and has been mostly immune to the recent cuts in other city programs is the most telling sign of the problems that lie ahead the citizens budget commission , a watchdog group financed by businesses , recently issued a report calling for the city to cut its capital commitments by 20 percent , or an average of 1 billion a year , by eliminating lowpriority projects or stretching out 10year goals over a 12year period the commission said it had reluctantly concluded that the city s current program is not affordable in light of new economic conditions of stagnancy and slipping revenues if building continued on pace , the report said , the cost of debt service on capital bonds , which must be paid out of annual operating revenues , would climb to 59 billion in fiscal 1999 from 21 billion now officials have said virtually the only agency to be exempted from the cuts in capital spending would be the correction department , which under mr dinkins s proposed anticrime program would have to build about 3 , 000 jail beds in the next few years 'all kinds of problems' making his official rounds between meetings with aides yesterday , mr dinkins took note of the challenges facing him as you doubtless know , since you read the papers , we are inundated with all kinds of problems , he said at an anniversary celebration at the house of the lord pentecostal church in brooklyn , where the pastor is his ally , the rev herbert daughtry the political pressures on the mayor were intense , from fiscal monitors and other elected officials , as well as editorial boards and the local teamsters union , which took a largely symbolic vote to authorize a strike over the layoff threat a new review panel over the weekend , felix g rohatyn , chairman of the municipal assistance corporation a state watchdog agency set up during the fiscal crisis to issue bonds on the city s behalf when its own near insolvency barred it from the credit markets suggested that the city s current problems should be reviewed by a new panel made up of the governor , the mayor , union officials and business leaders for his part , gov mario m cuomo said that the state would give the city s actions increased scrutiny , and that the speaker of the city council , peter f vallone , should have a role in handling the problems mr vallone saw mr cuomo at a columbus day ball saturday evening and insisted then that the council should play a role , though it was not clear in precisely what forum , a senior council aide said yesterday the mayor met early yesterday morning with first deputy mayor norman steisel and the mayor s top political aide , deputy mayor bill lynch , and again late yesterday afternoon with them and others , including the mayor s press secretary , albert scardino the corporation counsel , victor a kovner , and other deputy mayors 'overloaded' circuits mr scardino said the issue is not whether there s anything different to be done the issue is why have n't we been able to make ourselves clear a remarkable series of events in one week has overloaded everybody s circuits none of this was unanticipated , mr scardino said , referring to a week that began with agreement on a 55 percent pay raise for teachers and 18 billion in proposed new taxes over the next four years to finance a plan to hire thousands of police officers and expand the criminaljustice system , and ended with a partial hiring freeze and the threat of layoffs it was a clear and deliberate attempt to accomplish these various items by this week , he said this administration has shown it can make the difficult decisions
tokyo , may 28 japan s major banks announced their earnings today for the justended fiscal year , and , as had been expected , most reported lower profits and margins because of the tumultuous changes affecting the financial markets here none of the banks reported the sort of huge writeoffs that have plagued many major american banks in recent years but analysts said that they were generally disappointed by the depth of the declines and predicted that the japanese banks would have to brake their rapid growth of recent years , concentrating more on improving their profitability all the major national japanese banks reported drops in their net incomes for the fiscal year ended march 31 , and for most the decline was in doubledigits daiichi kangyo bank the daiichi kangyo bank , japan s and the world s largest bank in terms of assets , reported that its nonconsolidated operating profit fell 24 percent , to 2955 billion yen , or 187 billion , in the latest fiscal year its net income slid 134 percent , to 1556 billion yen , or 985 million daiichi s total assets jumped 229 percent , to 6659 trillion yen , or 421 billion but it suffered huge losses on the value of its mammoth japanese share portfolio japanese banks are permitted to own up to 5 percent of the shares of industrial and other companies those portfolios are reported on the banks' balance sheets at what they paid for them , rather than the current market value the difference between their cost and the current value , or unrealized gains , has provided a major source of capital for the banks , allowing them to bolster their earnings and their capital bases as needed but with the japanese stock and bond markets in the doldrums over the last year , the banks saw those capital cushions shrink dramatically for daiichi , its unrealized gains on its stock portfolio tumbled 23 percent from a year earlier , to 2118 billion sumitomo bank the sumitomo bank , japan s and the world s thirdlargest bank , reported a 154 percent drop in its operating profit , to 3526 billion yen , or 223 billion net income slid 12 percent , to 1745 billion yen , or 11 billion , making it japan s most profitable bank sumitomo disclosed a 549 billion yen , or 347 million , charge to cover the plunging value of bonds it held in its own portfolio , the clearest sign of the toll the volatile markets took on the banks total assets at the end of the fiscal year rose 185 percent , to 6277 trillion yen , or 3973 billion sumitomo also saw the value of the unrealized gains on its stock portfolio decline 17 percent , to 29 trillion yen , or 1835 billion mitsubishi bank the mitsubishi bank announced that its operating profit slid 24 percent , to 27098 billion yen , or 1715 billion net income fell 10 percent , to 1499 billion yen , or 948 million mitsubishi reported that its total assets rose 223 percent , to 6067 trillion yen , or 384 billion the value of the unrealized gains on its share portfolio fell 17 percent , to 338 trillion yen , or 214 billion bank of tokyo the bank of tokyo announced a nonconsolidated operating profit of 897 billion yen , or 568 million , a 12 percent decline from the year before net income slid 14 percent , to 509 billion yen , or 322 million total assets at the international bank rose 218 percent , to 318 trillion yen , or 201 billion the bank of tokyo suffered one of the worst declines in the value of the unrealized gains in its stock portfolio those gains tumbled 31 percent , to 1145 trillion yen , or 72 billion table showing the decreases from the previous fiscal year for japanese banks
the new york city board of elections has squandered millions of dollars on contracts with companies that have financial and political ties to party leaders , from a longterm lease on a decrepit warehouse to an extravagant system of repairing voting machines for 30 years , the board has paid a politically influential company millions of dollars to fly in technicians from across the country , all expenses paid , to perform rudimentary repairs on voting machine that other cities train their own workers to make in a staten island warehouse leased from a former borough political leader , half a dozen laborers work with faltering heat in winter , and upstairs toilets routinely overflow onto expensive voting machines deadend street state officials say that one reason the city must spend 50 million on new voting machines is that its current ones have been damaged from years spent in leaky , rundown warehouses another reason is that the board s truckers , many of them hired under patronage arrangements , often drop them during moving the board s office in queens is tough to find , situated in a largely vacant building on a deadend street missing from some city maps it opened 10 years ago , after the landlord s lawyer , a close friend of several board members , recommended it to board officials an examination of these and other contracts shows how new york s republican and democratic parties , placed at the helm of the agency that runs the city s elections , have shaped it into a powerful patronage tool for dispensing lucrative contracts single bid on big contracts with scant monitoring from the city or state , the board has tailored bid specifications to favor specific companies , has ignored lower bids in favor of longstanding and highpriced contractors and has been accused of thwarting new companies forced upon it by the city none of this is illegal but the board s contracting has become so insular that some companies say they do not even bother to compete , arguing that they do not stand a chance some of the biggest contracts , worth hundreds of thousands of dollars , draw only a single bid by state law , the party bosses get first crack at every appointment that the board makes but their influence has historically gone beyond this , with the board awarding two trucking contracts in each borough one trucker by each party and encouraging the company that counts school board ballots to hire workers recommended by political organizations something s wrong' constance cushman , executive director of the city s procurement policy review board , set up in response to the contracting practices at the heart of the 19861987 city corruption scandals , said that any government agency should seek at least three bids for every major purchase to promote competitive pricing and to avoid the appearance of collusion between officials and contractors there are many suppliers in the marketplace , ms cushman said if they are unwilling or unable to bid , something s wrong decades after limits were placed on government patronage and officials became sensitive to charges of political influence , the board of elections , whose 10 commissioners are appointed by the city council after being nominated by party leaders , talks openly of the power that parties wield over contracts the commissioners are paid 100 for each meeting , with a maximum of 10 , 000 a year a queens republican board member , joseph previte , was removed by the party in 1985 because he was too timid in getting trucking companies to buy tickets for fundraising events executive director s view you know , there s big bucks involved , lillian bachmann , cochairwoman of the queens republicans , said then referring to the truckers who work for the board in queens , she said , our movers bought only one ticket , and other movers had to buy 10 last month , when the board appointed a new administrator , a republican , to oversee its largest contracts , democrats argued that a democrat should help daniel defrancesco , who as executive director is responsible for the daytoday operations of the board , argues that contracts are awarded by the city s department of general services , though based on the board s specifications and while he acknowledges the role of patronage in contracting , he contends that it is the legacy of his predecessor and mentor , betty dolen , and that he is working to correct it 'believe in the patronage system' there were a lot of things wrong before , in my eyes , said mr defrancesco , a bronx democrat mrs dolen , a manhattan democrat , counters that when mr defrancesco was her top aide he never complained we worked very closely together , she said whatever i thought , he thought though mr defrancesco says he is trying to encourage more contractors to bid , he and other defenders of the system say that patronage has made it work , that knowledgeable contractors who can meet tight deadlines have helped run the nation s biggest municipal elections without a hitch
bucharest , rumania , jan 3 some of rumania s nascent political parties called today for a delay of national elections , now planned for april , because they said they could not get ready in time the request underlined the inherent difficulties in trying to create new political structures in this society , long accustomed to being told what to do by one party , the communists , and by one man , the toppled dictator , nicolae ceausescu of the halfdozen parties that have surfaced since mr ceausescu s downfall on dec 22 , only one , the national peasant partychristian democrats , has managed to acquire office space and telephones that is the extent of its equipment none of these groups have been able to register yet under a process set forth a few days ago by the provisional government , the council of national salvation more significantly , the new parties complain of being denied access thus far to television , radio and a smattering of newborn newspapers that have yet to find an independent voice the press and broadcast outlets , at least for now , are firmly in the hands of the council , which intends to put forth its own candidates in the april elections , even though its leaders insist they will not create an official party opinion is divided given these handicaps , two groups the agrarianbased peasant party and the democratic party said today that they needed more time to prepare the democrats , who say they are in the tradition of western european social democratic parties , proposed that the elections be put off until september or october the peasant group , whose roots go back to a party that was forceably dissolved in 1947 , offered no specific date , but said that it , too , wanted a delay they control all the means of the media , nicolae costel , a democratic party spokesman , said of the ruling group they say they will give us access , but we need facts , not words , immediately not all the new groups agree with an election postponement the sooner the better , said radu vilsanescu , spokesman for the liberal party even within the peasant party , a senior official , pavel suian , expressed concern that a delay would give the ruling group time to consolidate its power as matters stand , it already has a considerable head start in political experience , since many of its leaders are former communist party officials and ceausescu associates silviu brucan , a leading tactician of the ruling council , acknowledged in an interview this week that april elections may be unfair , but he insisted that the early date had been demanded by student activists who helped bring down mr ceausescu and whose opinions , he said , could not be ignored but mr brucan said today that if opposition parties present a formal request for a postponement , we shall consider it sorting out the mysteries as rumania struggles with new political forms , large questions remain about events surrounding the ouster of mr ceausescu two weeks ago , including how many people were killed , who had fired into crowds and what kind of a rebellion it was among the questions raised is whether a spontaneous revolution had produced the country s new leaders , or whether a group was already in place , waiting to take charge if the opportunity arose the issue gained fresh life earlier this week when a french television network aired an amateur video of a meeting of the new interim government in the hours after mr ceausescu s flight on the tape , nicolae militaru , a retired general who is now the defense minister , is heard proposing that the government be called the national salvation front since it has been functioning for six months at a news conference today , general militaru s deputy , a lieut gen vasile ionel , denied any conspiracy i declare openly and firmly that general militaru did not even say that the army was preparing a coup six months before , he said , adding the revolution was made by the people it broke out spontaneously , and the army supported it from the first moment casualty figures remain elusive for the violence that erupted dec 17 in the western city of timisoara and spread a few days later to bucharest and other key cities revised casualty tolls general ionel today provided the first casualty tolls for the army , saying that 196 officers and noncommissioned officers were killed and more than 450 were wounded but he offered no information about enlisted men or civilians , saying only in general terms that there is a rather high number of dead all over the country western diplomats this week estimated the death toll at 7 , 000 , significantly lower than figures of as high as 80 , 000 that had been mentioned early on in foreign press reports and since cited by rumanian officials the israeli embassy here said that a physician from israel had visited bucharest hospitals and concluded that the number of people killed in the capital was at most 3 , 000 , and probably closer to 2 , 000 there also seems to be a lack of agreement about the military s role in the uprising many rumanians now present idealized portraits of the army , heaping their abuse on mr ceausescu s hated security forces as having been responsible for all the killings they accept as fact that no soldiers killed antigovernment demonstrators in timisoara on dec 17 , and that all the shooting was done by members of the security forces dressed in army uniforms this idea was echoed today by general ionel , who said that the dead of timisoara are not victims of bullets of soldiers of the army but other officials insisted in interviews this week that the reality was different security forces did most of the killing , mr brucan said , but he added that in timisoara , some army units did shoot the french knew paris , jan 3 \( reuters \) rumania s council of national salvation was formed about six months ago , the french foreign minister , roland dumas , said today interviewed by the french europe1 radio network , mr dumas said that france , and probably the soviet union as well , had been informed as far back as the summer of the existence of a group of communist party members hostile to the ceausescu government i knew because our ambassador there did his job , mr dumas said he described the debate over whether the rumanian revolution was spontaneous as a bogus quarrel it is true that politicians had to prepare for the aftermath of mr ceausescu , he said but it is also true that the uprising did the rest and allowed them to take power photo outside the foreign ministry in

moscow , march 12 the soviet parliament struggled with the nation s long history of centralized and dictatorial authority today as critics and proponents agreed that the executive powers proposed by president mikhail s gorbachev would give him broad new control over the life of the nation in a daylong opening debate tightly controlled by mr gorbachev himself , the majority loyal to him in the congress of people s deputies welcomed the proposal for an elected presidency as a creative , balanced and overdue prescription for dealing with the crisis in the nation s politics and economy an alarmed minority , however , warned that the powers he was seeking for dealing quickly with problems from street crime to separatist rebellion undermined the hope for balanced constitutional government and were so broadly phrased as to be open to easy abuse by some future dictator 'grievous political error' this is a gross and grievous political error , warned yuri n afanasyev , a historian and leader of the congress s unofficial opposition group , who drew hoots of protest when he traced decades of soviet violence and lawlessness directly to lenin , the stillrevered founder of the soviet state violence is actually our entire history , mr afanasyev declared , complaining that the presidency proposal was being rushed to enactment with limited debate and without the fullscale constitutional reform needed to protect the legislative and judicial branches from executive dictation there is no reason to believe that the institution of the presidency could allegedly lead to authoritarian personal power , countered vice president anatoly i lukyanov , taking the podium in behalf of mr gorbachev we need oneman responsibility , he said , citing the public s growing dispiritedness as a justification for the proposal the debate is extended initially , mr gorbachev expected to have the presidential law approved in one day , but then let it slip into a second day this was done in the name of allowing more debate , but some opponents thought the soviet leader was being extra cautious about lining up the twothirds vote he needed 1 , 500 of the congress s 2 , 250 members his appointment to the new presidency would follow a day later , with a simple majority of 1 , 126 votes needed the strengthened presidency is the heart of mr gorbachev s plan to switch the nation s executive focus from the unwieldy , increasingly discredited system of communist party oligarchy the fiveyear term of office would be be filled by popular election after an initial appointive term that the congress is expected to award to mr gorbachev mr gorbachev is offering the presidency proposal in parallel with a plan for the communist party to retreat formally from its traditional role of dominance in the nation s government and politics as a practical matter , the party s influence has been in everquickening decline through the five years of mr gorbachev s incumbency as soviet leader while mr gorbachev is currently referred to as president , he is technically chairman of the supreme soviet , the sitting chamber of the congress 'paralysis of power' cited the debate in the congress was marked by repeated references to communist and russian history and the specter of centralized authority personified by such dictators as stalin , who used the party leadership as a vehicle for waves of autocratic terror we are still adhering to totalitarian ideas of what a state is and any idea is still seen in that context , sergei alekseyev , chairman of the congress s constituional revision commission , said rather sadly he endorsed the presidency as long overdue because of a paralysis of power , but noted that soviet society would first have to believe that a civilized secular state was still a possibility our social structures are disintegrating , he warned the presidency issue should have been resolved yesterday in six hours of debate , none of the critics of the proposal seriously questioned mr gorbachev s position as the leader of the effort to revitalize soviet society there was , however , considerable implicit complaint about his stewardship by both proponents and opponents of the measure everything is coming apart , said nikolai shmelev , an economist who spoke in favor of the strengthened presidency our economy has been turned into a lunatic asylum , he declared , drawing grumbles from the audience as he asserted that the government is the main thief in the national economy he said his main worry was not dictatorial abuse but whether the president would be bold enough to use the new powers to increase the role of private enterprise in the economy drastically powers of the presidency the precise powers of the presidency were themselves the heart of much of the dispute and the opposition s concern that the office will make the fitfully evolving new government executivedominated under the proposal , the president would have among other powers the right to issue decrees of emergency throughout the nation , a main cause of concern that the soviet republics might lose further authority to the central

washington , june 4 the supreme court today upheld a 1984 federal law that requires public high schools to allow students' religious and political clubs to meet on the same basis as other extracurricular activities a high school need not permit any student activities not related to the curriculum , justice sandra day o'connor said in the opinion but she said that if it does , the school is bound by the equal access act not to discriminate against any student group on the basis of its religious , philosophical or political viewpoint the decision , in a case from a public school district in omaha , upheld a ruling last year by the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit , in st louis a group of omaha high school students led by bridget mergens mayhew , then a senior at westside high school , successfully sued the school district in 1985 after being denied official recognition for a christian bible club undercover role upheld in another decision today overturning an appellate ruling , the court ruled that a lawenforcement officer can pose as a prison inmate and elicit a confession from an actual inmate even though the officer gives no miranda warning about the inmate s constitutional rights page a24 the omaha case was the latest battle over the place of religion in the public schools , and today s decision could affect other cases in buffalo , a student bible group won temporary permission from a judge to meet at a high school after school officials barred them in renton , wash , the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit struck down the equal access act on the basis of a 1989 appeal by high school students who wanted to start a bible study club there are a lot of schools waiting for this decision , said virginia roach , project director for the national association of state boards of education by a vote of 8to1 , the justices today rejected arguments that the equal access act breached the constitutionally required separation between church and state but the court s constitutional analysis was splintered three separate opinions , none commanding a majority , supported the result the eight justices agreed , however , that the federal law was not an unconstitutional establishment of religion by the government the only dissenter was justice john paul stevens , who said the court had interpreted the federal law in a way that left too little discretion to local school districts students are mature enough' in essence , today s decision was an extension of a 1981 supreme court ruling , widmar v vincent , in which the court held that public universities had to permit student religious groups to meet on the same terms afforded other student organizations that ruling suggested , without deciding , that the analysis might be different for younger , more impressionable students below the college level in her opinion today , justice o'connor said we think the logic of widmar applies with equal force to the equal access act we think that secondary school students are mature enough and are likely to understand that a school does not endorse or support student speech that it merely permits on a nondiscriminatory basis she went on , there is a crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion , which the establishment clause forbids , and private speech endorsing religion , which the free speech and free exercise clauses protect those three clauses are in the first amendment to the constitution the case , westside community board of education v mergens , no 881597 , was one of the more politically charged of the court s term , now in its final month the equal access act was a longsought goal of the religious right after the defeat of earlier efforts to bring prayer back to public school classrooms the law was strongly supported in congress by the reagan administration and in the supreme court by the bush administration reaction to the ruling many friendofthecourt briefs were filed a number of jewish groups , including the american jewish congress , the american jewish committee and the antidefamation league of b'nai b'rith , urged the court to strike down the law , as did the american civil liberties union and people for the american way but a number of protestant and catholic groups filed briefs supporting the law burton s levinson , chairman of the antidefamation league , said today that the ruling was troubling because it sanctions the use of public school facilities to advance religion in violation of the first amendment mrs mayhew , now 23 years old , told the associated press today that the decision sent a clear message to schools that they could not discriminate against religion it s a source of strength to be able to share your faith and share what you believe , she said i think it s a very important part of that age because you 're a kid and you 've got all these things coming at you tying activities to curriculum the equal access act applies to any public secondary school which receives federal financial assistance and which has a limited open forum virtually all public schools receive some federal money justice o'connor noted that high schools could remove themselves from the law by refusing federal money , although she added that this may be an unrealistic option the act says that a school has a limited open forum if it permits at least one noncurriculum related student group to meet on the premises the school district argued that all 30 of the student organizations at the high school , including the chess club and the scuba diving club , were related to the curriculum , and that the school was therefore not an open forum under the law but the court rejected this argument in a section of justice o'connor s opinion that five other justices joined she said that congress meant to provide a low threshold for triggering the act s requirements and that a school would be covered unless all student activities were tied directly to the curriculum for example , she said , participation in a band or orchestra would be directly related to the curriculum if it resulted in academic credit clarifying school s position in a separate concurring opinion , justices thurgood marshall and william j brennan jr said that depending on the context , the majority s approach to the open forum question could pose a danger under the establishment clause they said that schools that already permit organizations with distinct or controversial viewpoints could more readily absorb a religious club than a school in which only a few student clubs engaged in advocacy in that situation , the two justices said , the school must fully dissociate itself from a religious club to make clear that it was not sponsoring or endorsing the club s goals justice o'connor s opinion was joined in full by chief justice william h rehnquist and by justices byron r white and harry a blackmun justices anthony m kennedy and antonin scalia filed a separate concurring opinion in which they said that recognition of religious clubs was constitutional as long as no student was coerced to participate photos bridget mergens mayhew , who sued after school officials blocked formation of a bible club \( associated press \) \( pg a1 \) justice sandra day o'connor wrote the main supreme

riga , latvia , may 4 defying moscow s warning to curb separatist movements , the latvian parliament today declared the beginning of a transition period leading to establishment of the republic s independence the action was taken despite the kremlin s continuing economic sanctions against lithuania , the neighboring baltic republic , which declared itself fully independent of moscow eight weeks ago , and despite growing official criticism of similar moves by estonia , the third of the three baltic states lithuanian example but the latvian legislators seemed mindful of the consequences suffered by lithuania , now in its third week of a partial fuel blockade by moscow , and eager to maintain the talks that they have begun with the kremlin over latvia s future relationship with the soviet union estonia s parliament pledged on march 30 to restore full independence gradually since then , president mikhail s gorbachev has offered estonia a special status in what he has described as a new kind of soviet confederation if it drops its plan for independence the latvian document stops short of declaring a complete break between latvia and the soviet union and explicitly states that for the most part the soviet constitution and laws continue to be valid here during the transition period faces serious opposition while the latvian approach was cautious , the declaration still faced serious opposition in the parliament , though not enough to prevent the twothirds majority needed for it to pass in protest , 57 deputies refused to take part in a vote that they called premature and dangerous the declaration was adopted by a vote of 138 in favor , none opposed and 1 abstention it is not clear how moscow will react to the latvian declaration the kremlin could regard the move as a conciliatory gesture or a sign of confrontation and defiance i think there will be some kind of conflict with moscow , said anatolijs gorbunovs , who was reelected this week as chairman , or president , of the latvian parliament we did n't fulfill certain things that moscow asked of us for example , we specified that we are reestablishing the independent state of latvia and we formally declared a transition period , he said but the way we did it is very important we think we left the door open and that our dialogue with moscow will still continue moscow has said that any republic is free to leave the soviet union if it follows the law on secession recently established by the soviet parliament , which includes the support of twothirds of the voters in a public referendum , a negotiation period of up to five years with moscow and other republics on territorial , financial and other matters , and final approval by the full soviet congress the baltic republics , latvia , estonia and lithuania , assert that they are not bound by the new soviet law because they were illegally incorporated into the soviet union all three were independent nations when they were occupied by the soviet army in 1940 as a result of a secret treaty between stalin and hitler and then annexed lithuania and estonia have already rejected outright the possibility of using the secession law as a means of breaking with the soviet union latvia said as much today the declaration states the republic s application to join the soviet union was invalid from the moment of adoption , and the document further describes latvia s desire not to secede , but rather to restore de facto the free , democratic and independent republic of latvia conciliatory tone explained but one of the main actions taken by lithuania and estonia that angered the kremlin was the suspension of the soviet constitution in those republics in its declaration , the latvian parliament reestablishes the constitution of the former independent latvian republic but the declaration immediately suspends that constitution until it can be revised and adopted , except for articles expressing the constitutional and legal foundation of the latvian state those articles do not challenge outright the authority of the soviet constitution , and the declaration leaves standing soviet laws that do not contradict latvian sovereignty the declaration further guarantees new rights to all soviet citizens who choose to continue living in the republic latvian legislators said today that any conciliatory tone in their declaration was not a response to the kremlin s tough stance toward lithuania caution , they said , was dictated by the fact that independentminded deputies won twothirds of the seats in the parliament only narrowly people of latvian descent make up barely half the population of their own republic , and many nonlatvians oppose independence the situation in latvia itself objectively dictated what i would call not caution but our realism , said dainis ivans , leader of the popular front , one of the first grassroots orgnizations to call for latvian independence , and first deputy chairman of the parliament but there should be no question about what we have done we have taken the first step on the road to independence many deputies at the session today said that that road was chosen hastily and without sufficient consideration , prompting dozens of them to refuse to take part in the vote the fate of a nation should n't be decided in three hours , said anatoly alekseyev , leader of interfront , an organization composed mainly of nonlatvians opposed to latvian independence mr alekseyev was the lone deputy to walk out of the parliamentary chamber in protest during the vote i sat and ate soup for lunch while i read through ther documents , he said this is not right they should have given the deputies several days to read them , they should have published them in the paper and allowed people to express their opinion at rally , flowers and tears alfreds rubiks , head of the latvian communist party faction loyal to moscow , said the declaration could bring strikes and possibly violence within the republic and possible economic sanctions from moscow a small group of people opposed to independence stood with soviet flags outside parliament today as several dozen held a small demonstration hundreds of supporters of independence waited anxiously alongside them after the vote , the deputies left , passing through a crowd in the old city s cobbled streets the people embraced the legislators and many wept as they pressed flowers into the deputies' arms as they walked to a rally of several thousand people gathered at sunset of the banks of the daugava river chart showing latvia at a glance \(

the new york concert singers , a chamber choir started by judith clurman in 1988 , offered its first program of the season at merkin concert hall on wednesday evening as in seasons past , miss clurman offered a varied program that drew on the european literature but did not neglect contemporary american composers this time , in fact , new music dominated miss clurman s choir has progressed impressively since its early days two seasons ago , intermittent ensemble problems made for inconsistent if enthusiastic performances on wednesday , though , the concert singers were a model of choral virtue textures were velvety , diction was clear , phrases were carefully shaped , and there was a sense of unity that never flagged there was also an impressive flexibility , evident in the faure settings that opened the program in the madrigal , op 35 , the choir s 17 voices were so firmly blended that they gave the impression of being a quartet , yet the chorus s rendering of the more expansive dynamics in the cantique de jean racine \( op 11 \) created the illusion of a much larger group in the choir s other standardrepertory offering , brahms s second set of liebeslieder waltzes \( op 65 \) , the choral settings were superbly sung , and the solo settings were variable , but always at least competent there were two new york premieres on the program bruce maccombie s color and time is a setting of four nostalgic poems by thomas bezanson , in a madrigallike style mr maccombie s language is essentially tonal , but it moves alluringly between consonant harmonies and gradations of dissonance , so that the ear never quite knows what to expect the other premiere , stephen paulus s madrigali di michelangelo , uses older texts five love poems by michelangelo set in a style not so far from mr maccombie s mr paulus s work is the larger and more varied , partly because the michelangelo poems are heftier than mr bezanson s aphoristic verses , and partly because mr paulus s style balances counterpoint and chordal harmony more actively the program also included four virgil thomson settings of texts by the elizabethan poet and composer thomas campion these are bright , robust , innocent works , with none of the suave harmonic tinting one hears in the paulus and maccombie settings they made a fine closing group the choir s accompanists were the pianist elizabeth rodgers in the faure and the brahms the pianist erika nickrenz , in the brahms and the harpist susan jolles , the clarinetist bernard yannotta and the violist adria benjamin in the thomson
university of wisconsin researchers have found no support for the common belief that sugary foods or the abnormal metabolism of sugar can provoke aggression or other behavior problems in juvenile delinquents or , for that matter , in nondelinquent boys in fact , a study published in the current issue of the journal pediatrics reported , a sugarladen breakfast actually improved the performance of delinquent boys on standard behavioral tests even those boys described as hyperactive by their teachers showed no adverse effects from the sugary meal , which was consumed after an allnight fast the effects of sugar , given in the form of a sucrosesweetened breakfast cereal and sweetened orange drink , were compared with the effects of the artificial sweetener aspartame in a similar meal in a related study published in the same journal , the wisconsin researchers found what they described as small , but unimportant , differences in sugar metabolism between delinquent boys and those without criminal records but none of the behavior or other symptoms typical of reactive hypoglycemia , in which blood sugar drops to very low levels an hour or so after a large amount of sugar is consumed , were noted in response to a large dose of sugar consumed on an empty stomach in a person with reactive hypoglycemia , a concentrated dose of sugar prompts the body to release too much insulin , which causes blood sugar to fall precipitously a variety of uncomfortable symptoms can accompany the drop in blood sugar , including headache , mental confusion and dullness , anxiety , muscular weakness and personality changes wide belief about sugar although sugar is widely believed to stimulate hyperactivity in normal children and uncontrolled wildness and aggression in those who are already hyperactive , most scientifically controlled studies have failed to document such reactions in the current study , involving 115 incarcerated delinquent boys and 39 nondelinquents , laboratory tests were used to assess the boys' performance and behavior after meals that contained either sugar or aspartame overall performance was better in the delinquent boys after the sugar meal when the responses of hyperactive boys were analyzed separately , they too seemed to perform better after the sugar meal delinquents who were less disruptive or behaviorally disturbed were more likely than the most troublesome boys to show some decline in test performances after the sugary breakfast the researchers , joanne bachorowski and her colleagues , conceded that differences in the caloric value or nutritive balance of the test meals could have affected the results they also suggested that aspartame might have had adverse consequences that made sugar look good in the comparison despite such limitations , the researchers concluded that their study provided no support for the contention that sucrose ingestion compromises behavior
trenton , aug 31 faced with an angry outcry over tax increases , gov jim florio today appointed a new chief of staff and in doing so signaled a turn both toward more openness and a closer coordination of politics and government until recent weeks , governor florio , under fire for ramming through the legislature the biggest tax package in the history of any state , has been accused for keeping tight control on information , neglecting grassroots sentiment and maintaining an aloofness from politics that critics interpreted as arrogance on the hustings but in the last two weeks the governor has been blitzing the state with radio and television appearances , backyard barbecues and questionandanswer sessions and today , he made official the appointment as his new chief of staff of his longtime friend , aide and political manager , joseph c salema , a man those who know him describe as both an alter ego to the governor and a master of marrying government action with political consensus while the governor played down mr salema s political credentials he managed mr florio s congressional campaigns in the 1970 s and his first bid for governor in 1981 as well as being his chief administrative assistant the appointment comes as leading democrats are deeply concerned about his plummeting popularity in the polls and the growing tax protest sweeping the state despite a landslide victory last november over representative jim courter , a poll taken in july after mr florio s 28 billion tax increase showed that only about one in five voters gave him a high job rating organizers report that 600 , 000 voters have signed a petition protesting taxes and calling for establishment of a recall mechanism in response , mr florio has undertaken a series of fireside chats and highly publicized visits to taxstrapped families two weeks ago he went on television statewide to plead for time to let his tax package work and last week he shifted his chief of staff , steve perskie , a former legislator and state judge who is considered a skillful legislative technician with little grassroots political sensitivity , to a new job as head of the state s casino control commission to make way for mr salema 'he s street smart' both mr salema and the governor were at pains at two news conferences today to reject suggestions that mr salema was brought in to save the governor s skin as one questioner put it but top trenton democrats say privately that is substantially the case although mr perskie is certainly needed at the helm of the casino control commission at a time when the industry is in a crisis mr perskie as a legislator wrote the bill that legalized gaming in 1978 they also say that mr salema is the man the governor needs to cool the political crisis joe s genius is that he s street smart , he incorporates his intellectual abilities and his street smarts together , and that has a calming effect rather than a threatening one to people , said wayne r bryant , a longtime associate of mr salema in camden who is now majority leader of the assembly and a leader of the legislative black caucus as mr florio s top aide in congress , he said , joe made sure that his constituent services , his legislative agenda , his publicity , every aspect , were all brought together as well as bringing together his political fortunes now is the time for mixing governmental with political skills joe can do that not just politics although the governor and mr salema turned aside questions about what political initiatives his new top aide would pursue , those who know mr salema and his tactics suggest his approach will not be purely political speeches , public and broadcast appearances but rather appeals to the elderly , urban dwellers with school problems and poor and middleclass taxpayers , to make sure the benefits of his tax initiatives and other legislation already passed and to come , are fully explained and drummed home until recently , in the face of the explosive tax revolt , little of that was done we were all caught unaware by this , said senator gabriel m ambrosio , a demcocrat whose district lies in a tradtionally republican area of bergen and passaic counties , and who has until recently been trying to calm a furious constituency with no help from the governor all of us have said in one way or another that we would have dealt with the public relations aspects of this tax plan differently none of us anticpated the enormous reaction to this the thing sat on the table for months , and the reaction came after passage there were people who should have known better painting a door mr ambrosio , like other democrats , was delighted by mr salema s appointment he knows government , he knows politics , and most of all , he knows jim florio , he said mr salema , who is 42 , first met mr florio in 1972 , when , as a recent political science graduate of the university of south florida who lived in rural gloucester county , he volunteered to work on the first race for congress by mr florio , then a member of the state legislature his first job , he recalled in an interview , was painting the door of the shabby campaign headquarters , and the next as mr florio s driver in his own car , a new pontiac , on which he rolled up 37 , 000 miles in what turned out to be a losing campaign but he learned fast , and in 1974 managed the campaign that sent mr florio to congress for the next 10 years , he alternated as mr florio s campaign manager and chief aide , running his congressional campaigns and his district ofice , making sure both that constitutents were served and that his candidate won in the mid80 s , however , in the wake of mr florio s first , hairthin loss in a bid for governor in 1981 , he left the staff and fomred a financial and governmental consulting firm in camden mr salema obtained many lucrative local government contracts , a matter that became an issue in mr florio s 1989 campaign , when he was accused of benefiting from his association with a powerful political figure , and voluntariliy severed any connection with mr florio to assuage any damage his affiliation might cause his thing is pragmatic , said harold hodes , former aide to governor brendan byrne , who also faced , and overcame , a tax revolt when he engineered and got approved the first state income tax in 1977 he is politically close , personally close to the governor , worked 18 years with him , mr hodes said here is a guy who saw himself as a liabililty in the campaign and took himself out of it that took a lot of guts but it shows what type of guy he is , visavis his loyalty to florio photo joseph c salema , left , longtime friend and aide to gov jim florio , after being appointed by mr florio as his new chief of staff mr salema held his son , joseph , and daughter , emily , at a news conference yesterday in trenton \( associated press \)

the burden of proof by scott turow 515 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 2295 few , if any , first novelists , even in their most private fantasies , would dare to imagine the reality that scott turow encountered with his first novel , presumed innocent wildly enthusiastic reviews , feature stories in fashionable magazines , a long hardcover run on bestseller lists across the country , a monumental paperback sale , an equally colossal price for a forthcoming movie adaptation with bigname actors and a star director and it was all richly deserved presumed innocent was the tale of a prosecutor who , caught up in political machinations not of his making , finds the tables turned on him when he s put on trial for the murder of a sometime girlfriend who worked in his office it was , well , terrific readers were so carried away with the suspense of whether or not the innocent prosecutor would beat the rap that they tended to forget there was a real killer lurking out there which made the novel s o henry ending pack an especially wicked wallop now comes mr turow s second excursion into fiction , the burden of proof the title alone would indicate that , in an attempt to avoid the old sophomore jinx , he s going to give us a reprise of presumed innocent this time , moreover , the protagonist is none other than alejandro \( sandy \) stern , the canny attorney who masterminded the prosecutor s defense in presumed innocent and , lest we forget , mr turow takes pains to remind us three years ago , stern had been retained to represent the chief deputy in the kindle county prosecutor s office , who was charged with murdering a female colleague it had been the tricities' trial of the decade , revealing tawdry passions and political intrigues , and stern s role had briefly riveted attention on him across the nation i regret to report that if recreating the strengths of presumed innocent was mr turow s intent , he comes up short and if it was n't , that s still the case there is one caveat here if you 're an aficionado of soap opera , you 'll probably love the burden of proof if presumed innocent was flawed in any way , it was in its depiction of the emotional lives of many of the peripheral characters but that did n't matter mr turow , a former assistant united states attorney who is now a lawyer in private practice in chicago , provided an authentic , even mesmerizing account of what it s really like down at the courthouse , passing along the kind of information that we on the outside are not usually privy to how the game is played , how judges think and act , what prosecutors and defense attorneys actually do , what truly motivates everyone who comes before the courts , the very human aspirations , arrogance and fears that lie behind those blind scales of justice here , it s all reversed the characters and their hangups , mostly freudian , occupy center stage , and the problem is that their emotional makeup is generally about as deep as a wading pool the burden of proof starts off promisingly enough stern , complacently successful in his law practice , returns home from a business trip , opens his garage door and is stunned to find his wife of 31 years slumped dead in their cadillac , a suicide she s been lying there for a couple of days right after he calls the cops , stern quickly summons his son , peter , a physician who lives in the same , unnamed midwestern city peter is absolutely adamant that there be no autopsy mystified , stern eventually discovers a note from his wife it s not much help it simply says , can you forgive me \? there are other mysteries stern begins to conclude that his wife was suffering from some dread disease he berates himself for not being closer to her , so that she could have confided in him far from being a shrewd , sophisticated man of the world , stern is in fact a ragged bundle of nerves then it s discovered that his wife withdrew all the funds from a large trust that had been established for her by her family the bank officials are unable to explain how this happened , or why meanwhile the reason for his trip stern is engaged in defending his wheelerdealer brotherinlaw dixon hartnell , married to stern s beloved sister , silvia , is a kind of juniorgrade michael milken he is also the subject of an investigation by an ambitious and unscrupulous local united states attorney , who suspects hartnell of wildly complicated commodities market malfeasance as the investigation moves along , we meet stern s other offspring but it s hard to believe they 're from the same gene pool besides peter slim , intense and athletic , possibly gay and certainly unsavory from first to last there is stern s heartbreakingly beautiful flowerchildlike daughter , kate , married to an allamerican hunkcumdolt , and another daughter , a lawyer , unwed , the lumpish , bespectacled \( and smart \) marta it s even harder to swallow stern s transformation after he recovers from the shock of his wife s suicide he is first presented to us as a short , retiring , outofshape 56yearold , stout and bald suddenly , this stuffy middleaged lawyer develops the libido of a 16yearold what s more , as he attempts to plumb the meaning of his own life , women of all shapes and ages gratifyingly respond to him with relentless ardor and , finally , what s hardest to take is the great , secret reason for clara stern s suicide , the linchpin for the above plot ingredients , which turns out , in this era of aids , to be nothing short of absurd as stern picks up clues about his wife s extracurricular activity , he also proceeds , at a glacial pace , to try to find out what happened to her money he suspects that his nextdoor neighbor , a notorious philanderer , may somehow be involved but stern s main concern is defending his brotherinlaw , who , inexplicably , does little to help himself against the relentless feds as anticipated , mr turow does come up with a couple of twists in tying up all these narrative threads but for this reader , at least , it was too little , too late scott turow can do better , as he s already shown and undoubtedly he will again caught in the world s muck he was accosted , more or less unaccountably , by a memory of her , as he happened to have observed her one day on her way to her teaching assignment in the innercity arts program stern and the children had long expressed concerns for her safety coming by to swap cars so he could take hers to the shop , stern had caught sight of her marching boldly to the school doors her hands were jammed into the pockets of her plain coat and her head was erect in that splitsecond , he recognized something essential not that she was fearless , but rather that he had seen the same expression often before and that for clara every trip beyond her home apparently required the same effort to master her anxieties there were all those inner demons which she conquered only by persuading herself they were not real somehow , at the end , they had come to life , surrounded and devoured her a taciturn , mannerly , dignified woman , clara stern had gotten herself caught in the world s muck , and it had sucked her down , like one of those prehistoric creatures whose bones were found in the tar pits he knew that sooner or later he was going to stumble into the very heart of it , too , enduring all the same nightmare horrors she had from the burden of proof drawing \( pg 1 \) photo scott turow \( jonathan kirn for the new york times \) \( pg 35 \)
paris , june 1 michael chang , a player whose panic threshold seems nonexistent , is not the sort of person to cry wolf today , down by two sets to none as he continued the defense of his french open title , chang never flinched and never allowed christian bergstrom of sweden to assume even the illusion that he had control of their match instead , chang unveiled another of the houdiniesque maneuvers that made him the french open s youngest and most improbable champion last year turning a tight place into a showcase , he beat a gritty uphill path through three more sets to defeat bergstrom , 26 , 57 , 60 , 62 , 64 the thirdround match lasted 3 hours 42 minutes , in perfect keeping with chang s proclivity for marathon encounters i prepared myself in my mind to know i was going to be out there for quite some time , said chang , who improved his record in fiveset matches to 51 his opponent brought a playbook that contained only two sets of dynamic tennis to center court , hardly sufficient for a date with chang , and it cost bergstrom his fifth consecutive loss in a fiveset match 'did n't have that fear' chang said his resurrection today was not so extraordinary as the one he performed here last year against ivan lendl in the round of 16 , a 4 37 epic that he left in tears despite earning an upset victory today , i did n't have that fear of being blown off the court after i was down , two to love , said the 18yearold chang , who calmly put the missing pieces of his game back together as if he were assembling a jigsaw puzzle chang likened his approach to erasing a deficit to his triedandtrue tactic for cutting a stack of homework down to size there would be nights when i 'd have homework in all six classes sitting on the table and i 'd look at it and think , 'how am i supposed to get it all done \? ' he recalled i 'd just take it one by one and pretty soon it s all done , but i guess everybody has their own philosophy about it fortunately for chang , bergstrom , 22 , had no philosophy to fall back on when it came to protecting his twoset advantage after breaking chang in the final game of the second set , using a drop shot to stymie him at set point , bergstrom proceeded to selfdestruct and dropped nine games in a row i felt no one was expecting me to come back and win , and it took the pressure off , said chang , who will next face javier sanchez , who defeated niclas kulti of sweden , 64 , 64 , 63 but he let up a whole lot , and it hurt him at the start , chang got into big trouble when he could n't synchronize his overheads to contradict the drop shot and lob combination bergstrom was using bergstrom , whose spirited topspin kept chang on the defensive , sprinted off to a 40 firstset lead and , delivering a double dose of drop shots on his second set point , broke chang a third time in the eighth game to claim the set , 62 after i got to 40 in the first set i played almost perfect tennis , said bergstrom , who by the end was left staring hopelessly behind him as chang snapped the final shot of the match , a backhand , perfectly down the line and out of reach much ado about clothes while chang dazzled the roland garros stadium crowd with his recuperative skills , andre agassi , who dresses to dazzle , found himself in the midst of a debate instigated by an announcement from philippe chartrier , president of the french tennis federation , that disparaged colorful tennis clothing today , agassi , the topseeded player left in the tournament , was a straightset victor over the lowestranked player to survive to the third round , the qualifier arnaud boetsch of france \( no 263 \) agassi wearing a pink and black shirt with matching headband , black denim shorts and pink cycling pants was thrilled to get the opportunity to follow up a rather dull tennis match with a debate over the suitability of his attire for the staid grand slam circuit in response to chartrier s assertion that the french open was toying with the idea of adopting the same predominantly white dress code that has kept agassi away from wimbledon , the entertainmentminded 20yearold from las vegas , nev , said such a rule change could conceivably keep him away from this event next year agassi s next match will be against jim courier , who beat johan anderson of australia , 60 , 62 , 61
washington , oct 10 the headlines around the country today used words like flipflop , waffle , blink , retreat , zigzag and fickle to describe george bush s erratic course on taxes none of them exactly calculated to please the president , who is as eager as his predecessors to be seen as a strong leader but the comments in the washington political community were even tougher a republican strategist , as reluctant as other party leaders to be quoted at a time when the party line looks more like a doodle , said , we 're really getting slaughtered , because the president looks indecisive and the administration looks rudderless thomas mann , a political scientist at the brookings institution , said the bush presidency was threatening to disintegrate before our very eyes , because he has completely abdicated his leadership responsibilities that word is back by giving the impression that he could easily be pushed around agreeing with one group one minute , another the next mr bush revived talk of him as a political wimp , a description he seemed to have shaken two years ago shocked by what they are seeing and hearing , politicians here offer a spectrum of explanations for what nearly all see as a major stumble by a president who had been highly successful a thin white house staff , with a weak political operation and a dubious capitol hill liaison team , that has neither provided good information nor spoken with one voice a president more comfortable with foreign affairs than with the nittygritty of domestic policy an administration with no clear idea of where it wants to go and , as several people suggested , an attack of fecklessness at a crucial time there s no plan , said edward j rollins , cochairman of the national republican congressional committee they just wish this would go away so they could deal with something easy like saddam hussein but with four weeks left until election day , they 're eroding the republican voting base no sun in the bunker hunkered down at the worst moment of the bush presidency , white house aides seemed too stunned to explain what had gone wrong , but many freely acknowledged their predicament not a sunny day in the bunker , one of them said all of this is potentially much more damaging to this president than it might have been to a ronald reagan or a lyndon b johnson , because the public tends to identify mr bush with pragmatism rather than policies success has bred success for mr bush so far , but now he runs the risk that the evenhandedness that once looked like professionalism will look more like weakness in addition , the republican unity nurtured by mr reagan has been fractured in little more than a week as of tonight , representative bill archer of texas , the top republican on the house ways and means committee , was backing a deal in which a cut in the capital gains tax would be paired with higher income tax rates for the wealthiest americans , and senator bob packwood , the top republican on the senate finance commitee , was opposing it even with the president s energetic help , the republican congressional leadership could not deliver a majority in the house last week for mr bush s original budget package representative newt gingrich of georgia , the republican whip , defied the president with impunity and patrick j buchanan , a leading spokesman for republican right wing , announced in his syndicated column today that mr bush no longer seems a sure bet for 1992 mixed signals all around nor does there seem to be much unity in the white house a former aide to mr reagan said today , they 're setting a world record for mixed signals over at that building , and one of the bestinformed republican lawmakers said he had not the slightest idea what mr bush really wanted mr packwood insisted tuesday night that the president had rejected the deal on capital gains and income taxes that he seemed to embrace that morning , and the white house chief of staff , john h sununu , told a group of lobbyists the same thing bob dole of kansas , the republican leader in the senate , said mr bush had ruled nothing out , and marlin fitzwater , the white house spokesman , who had echoed mr packwood on tuesday , sounded a lot like mr dole on wednesday as his credibility trickled away in washington , the president was campaigning in north carolina for senator jesse helms , who had called the original bush budget deal a turkey and when reporters asked him while he was jogging what he planned to do to sort out the mess , mr bush replied , read my hips stephen hess , who has written two books about the presidency , said negotiating with congress on domestic issues was never going to be george bush s forte , and it was never safe ground for him mr hess once worked for richard m nixon , and he said mr bush resembled mr nixon in his distaste for the complexity of domestic policy you get an international problem , you call in three people cheney , scowcroft , baker , said mr hess budget problems , the table gets too large things slip out of the president s control you do n't like that , unless you 're basically a capitol hill man , a compromiser like lyndon johnson 'king of expediency' a close republican friend of the president s said , the next thing you know , they 'll be saying bush has been carterized he argued that like jimmy carter on his doomed energy bill , our man has n't told the american people why deficits matter , and remember they 've been conditioned by eight years of ronald reagan to think they do n't matter , and they basically still think that with no real support from the public , the friend said , mr bush is twisting and turning in search of some formula that will solve an important problem , but doing so in a way that makes him look like the king of expediency robert s strauss , the texas democrat who has formally or informally advised the last three presidents , said mr bush s problems began when he allowed mr gingrich to escape without penalty presidents who let key people in their own parties go into business for themselves look like nice guys , but they eventually suffer a heavy penalty for it , mr strauss said now the president has major , major problems , he went on , and john sununu , who s a very able man in many ways , does n't know how to fix them for him photos president bush , despite

dream science by thomas palmer 308 pp new york ticknor fields 1995 wakefield nathaniel hawthorne s tale of a man who leaves his house one day and , for no apparent reason , takes up residence for 20 years in the next street concludes with this chilly existential warning amid the seeming confusion of our mysterious world , individuals are so nicely adjusted to a system , and systems to one another and to a whole , that , by stepping aside for a moment , a man exposes himself to a fearful risk of losing his place forever rockland \( rocker \) poole , protagonist of thomas palmer s second novel , is such a man somehow this young suburban professional has been displaced from his house in connecticut , and , like a balloon that had slipped through a child s grasp , deposited into another reality he finds himself stuck in a windowless office , off a corridor without an exit , with no clue as to how or why this has befallen him it feels like a dream or rather , his past life feels like a dream , and this feels like wakefulness what he felt was that he had never been freer in his life from this somewhat familiar premise one ca n't help thinking of borges , kafka , lewis carroll , television shows like the prisoner and the twilight zone , though not necessarily in that order mr palmer constructs a metaphysical chinese box , full of shifting walls and sliding windows , that poole must stumble through in order to reclaim his identity poole , it turns out , has a severe case of reality failure he s under observation by a mysterious research group called panlogo , which is investigating this new , broken world , scouting its perimeters , trying to determine its exact nature panlogo gives poole special attention with some tutoring , he learns to travel through lines between realities , eventually working his way back to his former life a life that now seems excruciatingly tenuous and provisional how many times do i have to be reborn \? he wonders , in a letter to his wife if everything i was led to assume is a lie , if the earth is not real , if history is not real , if men and things are not real , if i always have passed and always will pass through these shadows like a shadow myself then why does it hurt to be alive \? there are a many such questions in dream science , which unfortunately becomes less and less interesting as it goes along poole gets flung in and out of worlds , has a number of traumatic , often grotesque , adventures and eventually finds a nonetooorthodox therapist , a dr waxman , who has a way with snappy rejoinders \( i 'd think reality might get a little stale after a while like hanging around in a college town after you 've graduated \) waxman is a winning presence , to be sure , but when , toward the end of the book , mr palmer inexplicably hands over to him the narrative s point of view , he quickly loses his appeal there are other problems in this section of the book the impending apocalypse all he knew was that at a certain moment shortly before one am he had felt the shadow of extinction lap the edge of this world is elaborated at such solemn and repetitive length that it begins to sound silly by the time stamford goes up in smoke , because of a berserk line inadvertently created by poole himself , it s difficult to get very excited about it but then i'm from new jersey mr palmer has worthy obsessions here the most interesting character , to my mind , is poole s wife , carmen , who in time becomes tainted by his malaise to the point where she loses her grip on her own life , but without ever having traveled to another world stoical and obdurate , she has a touch of genuine pity , too , for her husband as well as for herself but ultimately she s not given much to do , other than fret and observe dream science flags about halfway through and degenerates into uninspired science fiction it could have used a little humor , i think as borges and others have demonstrated , when setting up labyrinths like these an ironic touch is required in stepping aside , poole , like hawthorne s wakefield , learns a thing or two about the lightness of being , but mr palmer betrays him with a heavy , plodding story one that captures the unbearability , but not the comic , giddy freedom , of our absurd plight

erba , italy the television producer asked him for just five minutes i do n't have five minutes , franz beckenbauer said then , one minute , said the producer , one of scores begging for a moment of beckenbauer s time just one minute ok , beckenbauer said one minute from out of nowhere , the producer , working for a japanese network , pulled out two soccer shoes , one brand new , never worn the other , a scuffed , oldfashioned boot , far heavier than a newer one here , the producer said , handing them to the coach of west germany s team in the world cup finals , who looked at him with absolute incredulity talk about the difference between them , the producer said beckenbauer took the shoes , one in each hand , inhaled deeply , stared at the camera and started to talk a promise was a promise such is life for west germany s legendary coach as his team has moved safely out of the first round , scoring more goals than any other team in victories over yugoslavia \( 41 \) and the united arab emirates \( 51 \) and a tie with colombia \( 11 \) , beckenbauer is finding himself more in demand than ever it could get worse three more victories , starting with one today over the netherlands in milan , would put west germany into the world cup final game for a third consecutive time and sixth over all , both records four more victories would bring west germany alongside italy and brazil as the only countries to win three world championships since the tournament was first held , 60 years ago but at this time and place in history , a world championship for west germany and its 45yearold coach would be all the more poignant , for several other reasons with political leaders in west germany and east germany rapidly bringing their countries together , it is virtually certain that this is the last major tournament in which west germany will be represented the next world cup finals , to be staged four years from now in the united states , would include a team representing a unified germany that may be a daunting prospect for the rest of the world in soccer east germany has some very good players , beckenbauer said in an interview here friday at the team s world cup base , about an hour s drive north of milan germany would be even stronger than it is now i see it as a perfect situation while world cup history shows west germany to be one of the tournament s most heralded participants , east germany has lagged behind with limited funds available for sports , the east german government generally spends greater amounts on individual sports rather than team sports , under the rationale that individuals produce more medals than a team thus , it is hardly surprising that east germany has not qualified for the world cup finals since 1974 , while west germany has ever since 1954 in recent years , however , the east german program has gradually improved , and when political reforms swept through the country last fall , giving east german citizens freedoms unknown before , three soccer players andreas thom , matthias sammer and ulf kirsten became the first east germans to sign with first division west german club teams after unification , those players could earn positions on the national team , making a strong squad even stronger no matter who may be on the teams of the future , the coach will be someone other than beckenbauer , once west germany s greatest player he was a 21yearold midfielder on the 1966 team , which lost the world cup final to england , and the 29yearold sweeper on the 1974 team , which beat the netherlands in the final he went on to play with the new york cosmos of the north american soccer league and then returned to west germany to become the national team coach in 1984 , two years after the team lost the world championship to italy he guided the team to the final again in 1986 , only to lose again , to argentina several months ago , beckenbauer announced he would return after the world cup to serve the west germany soccer federation in some other capacity we 've talked about the marketing , sponsorships maybe that s what i will do , he said , sounding not entirely enthusiastic about the idea other possibilities seem more intriguing , like working for the united states soccer federation or the 1994 world cup organizing committee , for example he brightens at the suggestion these are not ideas out of the wilderness beckenbauer has often been mentioned as a possible successor to bob gansler , the national team coach for the united states , who has a series of four oneyear contracts with the federation through 1994 that position may be less attractive than others to beckenbauer , whose engaging personality would make him an ideal spokesman or fund raiser i know werner fricker and the other people , he said , referring to the president of the united states soccer federation if they want something from me , they can ask but i do n't think as coach bob gansler is a very good coach maybe i can help in some other way beckenbauer watched with interest as the united states lumbered through its first world cup finals in 40 years , failing to advance beyond the first round but he saw improvement the first game was a disaster , he said , recalling the 51 victory by czechoslovakia then against italy and austria , they played well i could see the potential is there if they take some chances to build up in four years , they can do it the potential is there they have a lot of players two years ago , i was in florida on vacation i coached the team of under18 west german players against players just from florida , and we won , 31 it could easily have been 33 now the base is at a pretty good level for the time being , no matter how close the future is , it remains too distant to think about , with the netherlands next the dutch are a familiar opponent and not one of west germany s favorites the most recent of their 29 matches included a 21 victory by the dutch in the semifinals of the 1988 european championships , which the netherlands won , and two draws , 11 and 00 , in world cup qualification games , during which several players exchanged unpleasantries emotions aside , it s still a fine match rudi voller has already announced himself and jurgen klinsmann as the most beautiful pair of strikers in the world voller and lothar matthaus , an offenseminded midfielder , have scored three goals each klinsmann has two the dutch , who tied egypt , england and ireland in their firstround games , have outstanding players in ruud gullit , marco van basten and frank rijkaard , although none of them have played to his potential so far it s a pity to have germany and holland in this round , said beckenbauer , mindful of so many previous spirited matches between the teams , some in which he played , some in which he coached and certainly all of which he was asked to talk about
tokyo , jan 25 two hundred leading corporate executives met the other day to listen to an urgent appeal to come together and help a valued client it was not a business that was in distress , but the govering liberal democratic party , which was in desperate need of cash indeed , the party that has represented the establishment and governed japan for 35 years is in such political trouble that it has borrowed more than 100 million from banks , using its tokyo headquarters as collateral , to finance a campaign war chest for the crucial national election on feb 18 the party , together with its candidates and factions , may well end up spending nearly 1 billion raised by the private sector in the months leading up to the election , dwarfing the amount spent by the socialist party and others in the opposition , party officials say when the liberal democratic party needs money , we are ready to listen , said masaya miyoshi , director general of keidanren , japan s most powerful business organization this election is vital not only for the party , but for all business we have got to support them for more than a year , japan has been rocked by scandal , corruption charges and public outcry against the flood of money from business and special interests into the political system , leading last year to the resignation of prime minister noboro takeshita and to the party s subsequent electoral defeat in july but in the current campaign for the election to the lower house of parliament , money politics is as strong as ever no one knows exactly how much money travels from private individuals and businesses into the japanese political system , but some government figures suggest the amount is enormous over 2 billion is reported officially japan s home ministry has reported that in the year ending last spring , all politicians and political organizations raised more than 2 billion from businesses and private individuals but takeshi sasaki , professor of political science at tokyo university , said the consensus among outside political experts appears to be that this figure represents only 50 or 60 percent of the total money flowing into the political system , most of it from businesses despite some disclosure requirements , so much money flows as informal gifts and offthebooks donations that it is impossible to track the national tax agency has reported that in 1988 , for instance , japanese businesses spent a staggering 32 billion , an alltime record , for kosaihi , a category including entertainment expenses and gifts for customers and clients that experts say often go to politicians the enormous amount of cash spent by japan s companies for such things is another testimony to the rocketing japanese economy , in which businesses awash in funds are eager to enhance their position by seeking protection or special favors from the government in interviews , politicians , scholars and businessmen disclosed many details about how this money is raised , where it goes and the ways that it distorts the public decisionmaking process in japan scandal curbs only the most blatant after a year of scandal , only the most blatant public fundraising practices have been curtailed for instance , the governing party no longer encourages huge dinner parties at which businesses buy hundreds of tickets , raising as much as 7 million or 8 million in one evening the scandals have forced us to reflect on our behavior , declared fumitake kishida , finance director of the liberal democratic party we want to make this money subject to public disclosure , and we have exercised restraint in holding these parties but mr kishida said the cutback in big fundraising receptions has forced the party to resort to bank loans and to seek special donations from the automobile , electronics , construction and securities industries , which have prospered because of particular policies of the party additional donations are being sought from utilities and from the insurance , steel and oil industries the liberal democratic party has long been the richest political organization in japan , raising at least 175 million for national races and 100 million for local races in 1988 , according to a home ministry report last year by contrast , the socialist party , the leading opposition group , spends a fraction of this money , relying on much smaller loans , union contributions and volunteer efforts favors and warnings from the party japan s major industries are generally sticking with the governing party for example , the construction industry has benefited from high land prices encouraged by the government s policies of liberal money growth so has the securities industry , which is riding a boom at japan s stock exchanges in addition , sales of automobiles , electronics goods and appliances were spurred last year by tax cuts on these products , even as the government imposed a new 3 percent sales tax on other goods and services despite the benefits received , knowledgeable business executives said the leaders of the liberal democratic party warned auto and electronics industry executives that if they did not work harder for the party , their tax cuts might be restored the warnings stirred enormous resentment
the untouched key tracing childhood trauma in creativity and destructiveness by alice miller translated by hildegarde and hunter hannum doubleday 180 pages illustrated 1795 the untouched key is the latest book by dr alice miller , the polishborn swiss psychoanalyst probably best known for her first book , the drama of the gifted child \( basic books harper colophon \) , which was originally published in english in 1981 as prisoners of childhood in this earlier book , dr miller articulated certain perceptions at which she had arrived through her psychoanalytic training , through reconsidering her own childhood experiences and through her work with patients in a formal analytic setting these insights have attained wider currency today , but they bear repeating to put them in a toosmall nutshell parents act out on their children their own childhood traumas , and their children are affected for life by such unconscious treatment indeed , it is the very experience of having children that often provides the outlet for the parents' buried childhood feelings since publishing the drama of the gifted child , dr miller has evolved her ideas on childhood abuse in a series of books whose titles are selfexplanatory for your own good hidden cruelty in childrearing and the roots of violence thou shalt not be aware society s betrayal of the child an autobiographical work , pictures of a childhood 66 watercolors and an essay \( all published by farrar , straus giroux \) , and the present volume , the untouched key , which , like all of her books , was originally written in german after teaching and practicing psychoanalysis for more than 20 years , dr miller has retired to develop a radical critique of psychoanalytic theories and psychiatric methods at least part of this will be addressed in the banished knowledge , a work on therapy to be published this fall meanwhile , the untouched key poses the important question of why some troubled children turn out to be artists and others turn their sufferings back against the world more a casebycase review than a fully rounded thesis , the book explores the childhoods of figures like pablo picasso , kathe kollwitz , buster keaton , hitler , stalin and friedrich nietzsche these soundings turn up some valuable material dr miller discovers that within a fourday interval in 1884 the 3yearold picasso experienced both a violent earthquake in his hometown of malaga , spain , and the birth of his first sister , lola as dr miller argues , these events provide a more plausible psychological explanation for the painting guernica than does the 1936 bombing attack by the nazis that has always been accepted as the work s inspiration and though she does not mean to disparage nietzsche s mature genius , her rereading of his major work in the light of his childhood sufferings at the hands of his loving but shortsighted family does much to lend a deeper and more personal meaning to such nietzschean ideas as the will to power , the hypocrisy of christianity , the search beyond good and evil and the coming of the ubermensch there is a slight tendentiousness in the way the untouched key develops its points , a seeming impatience on the author s part that the world has failed so far to embrace her discovery that childhood impairment is the key to everything picasso s traumas of 1884 are unquestionably pertinent to his work but , in dr miller s hands at least , they fail to account for the artist s ambivalence toward women , particularly evident in the painting les demoiselles d'avignon and to attribute the deadpan style of buster keaton s comedy merely to the film actor s having been abused by his parents when he was part of their vaudeville act seems a shade on the simplistic side moreover , a faint note of utopianism creeps into the closing sections of the untouched key , where dr miller writes as if all of humanity s troubles could be cured in an instant if people would only open their eyes to the abuse of children one misses the subtlety of the drama of the gifted child , where , for example , the author acknowledged that , just as parents do , psychoanalysts can have trouble disentangling their narcissism from the objective interests of their patients still , the implications of alice miller s vision are undeniable and she sums them up effectively in her conclusion she recounts how , while searching for a picture of abraham sacrificing isaac with which to illustrate the dust jacket of one of her books , she discovered that in all of the 30 portrayals of the scene that she could find , abraham s face or entire torso is turned away from his son and directed upward dr miller continues in none of the paintings can we detect any questioning in isaac s eyes , questions such as 'father , why do you want to kill me , why is my life worth nothing to you \? why wo n't you look at me , why wo n't you explain what is happening \? how can you do this to me \? i love you , i trusted in you why wo n't you speak to me \? what crime have i committed \? what have i done to deserve this \? ' her point is simply that the time has come for abraham to stop taking for granted his compulsion to sacrifice isaac parents must turn their eyes to their children , and acknowledge the needs of separate and integral human beings bertelsmannd \( doubleday \) , news corporation d \( basic books \) photo alice miller \( julia miller \)
pittsburgh , sept 26 should cecil fielder be the first player from a team with a losing record to be the american league s most valuable player \? he s done a heck of a lot for this ball club and baseball internationally , bill lajoie , the detroit tigers' general manager , said when asked the question mvp \? i think he s in the top three i do n't know if he s first , but i do n't know who is no 1 lajoie , the man who could be executive of the year simply for the fielder signing last winter , could easily have replied emphatically that of course fielder was the league s most valuable player campaigning is not foreign to a candidate s employers but lajoie , it should be remembered , is the man who two years ago acknowledged , when no one would have known otherwise , that fred lynn had n't joined the team in time to be eligible for postseason play in other words , he is one of baseball s few proven honest men , and he was n't about to state unequivocally that fielder should be mvp if , in his mind , the matter was n't clearcut the matter is not clearcut , though some people believe that rickey henderson of oakland should be a unanimous winner of the award henderson , to be sure , has impressive credentials he led the league in hitting for most of the season \( he s now second \) he leads in runs scored , stolen bases and onbase percentage and he is second in slugging percentage , all this for a team that has won its third consecutive division championship kelly gruber of toronto is another strong candidate he was a force for the blue jays in the first two months of the season and this month has reasserted himself as the blue jays have rushed from six and a half games out of first to a game and a half in front he is second in runs batted in , extrabase hits and total bases and fifth in home runs and slugging percentage then there is fielder his team has not been a contender at any time this season , even though it has been in third place the last four weeks the tigers have never even been at 500 this year but going into tonight s games , fielder , the most intriguing player of the year , led the major leagues in home runs \( 48 \) , runs batted in \( 126 \) and slugging percentage \( 601 \) and led the american league in total bases \( 325 \) and extrabase hits \( 74 \) whether or not he becomes the first player to hit 50 home runs since 1977 and the first in the american league since 1961 would not affect his candidacy for the mvp award he has already established a strong argument last year , when fielder played in japan , the tigers were easily the worst team in the majors with a record of 59103 this year , they are close to 500 , with a 7579 record entering tonight s game fielder is the sole reason for the turnaround he has made that much of an impact not only has he powered the tigers' resurgence , but by batting behind alan trammell he has also helped the shortstop turn in the second most productive season of his 13year career tram has been very selective , lajoie said he knows he s going to get a good strike to hit somewhere in the count so he s patient most valuable players almost always come from a contender , often a winner robin yount of milwaukee last year became the first american league mvp from a team with a nonwinning record \( the brewers were 8181 \) in the national league , only members of the chicago cubs have won the award with teams that had 500 or worse records \( hank sauer in 1952 , ernie banks in 195859 , andre dawson in 1987 \) those players were special cases fielder is another special case forget that the tigers were not a contender judging the candidates on their value to their teams , none has been more valuable than fielder of course , henderson has been instrumental in oakland s latest championship , but the athletics are loaded with talent , diluting the value of any one player , including henderson without fielder , the tigers would most likely have inhabited yankee territory and had a similar record this man gets worked on unmercifully , lajoie said , discussing the way pitchers try to get fielder out the count always goes high on him he goes 32 a lot but there s total concentration on his part he s so calm and mature he s got everything together mentally he s been tremendously consistent of the three , he s been the most consistent it is highly unlikely that the members of the baseball writers association who vote for the award will place fielder no 1 , but he would be a legitimate choice close race in national league while much attention is focused on the batting races willie mcgee s stationary 335 and george brett s remarkable effort the national league race for the runsbattedin title is both close and interesting entering tonight s games , bobby bonilla led with 115 , joe carter and matt williams had 114 and barry bonds 113 if williams wins , he would give the san francisco giants their third successive league rbi leader \( following will clark and kevin mitchell \) , and that would be the first time the national league had three different players from the same team win in successive seasons bob meusel , babe ruth and lou gehrig did that for the yankees in 19252627 , the only time it has happened in the american league photo the tigers' cecil fielder he s got everything together mentally , said bill lajoie , the team s general manager \( associated press \)
bangkok , thailand , may 29 as results continued to trickle in today from the first multiparty elections in 30 years in myanmar , formerly burma , western diplomats said the main opposition party had already won at least 66 percent of the seats in a new national assembly but as of tonight , only 53 contests had been officially declared in the government newspaper or on state radio the main opposition group , the national league for democracy , had won 48 of those seats , and the militarybacked national unity party had won none but questions were raised about the tardiness of the official count and whether the results might yet be manipulated , despite the western diplomats' assertion that the national league for democracy had won at least 322 of the assembly s 485 seats most western diplomats interviewed by telephone today discounted the discrepancy to be official , the results must be handcarried to yangon , formerly rangoon , along a primitive transportation system , one diplomat said in any event , he continued , to try to tamper with the election at this late stage would be obvious , and would provoke an uproar , both domestically and internationally some ominous questions his confidence is not universally shared by other diplomats interviewed today and other , serious questions hang over these remarkable elections in myanmar , where overwhelming majorities voted to repudiate the last 30 years of military rule under gen ne win although gen saw maung is now the leader of the military government , general ne win , who formally gave up his power last july , is still believed to be in control individual members of the foreign ministry and the information section of the state law and order committee , the name of the junta that has run the country since prodemocracy demonstrations were brutally crushed 20 months ago , have told journalists that the military is willing to hand over power to a civilian government once the newly elected assembly writes a new constitution and forms a government but there has not been any formal , collective statement to that effect from the state law and order committee some diplomats and burmese find this silence a little ominous even optimistic diplomats say they cannot dismiss the possibility that some of the more conservative or vulnerable members of the military command may be adamant against allowing civilian politicians to take over , and are trying to prevent it mixed signals from officials nor is there any clear set of rules or even a timetable for the convening of the new assembly , the writing of a new constitution or the forming of a government some military officials have said that they will set temporary ground rules for the assembly others have said the assembly can behave as it wishes but the size of the national league for democracy s victory is likely to make ratifying a new constitution and forming a new government easier than the military might have imagined when it agreed to hold these elections the attitude of the reclusive general ne win is also a mystery in some sense , he set off these events by resigning his official post as chairman of the country s only party in july 1988 at the time , he said he was willing to foresee a public referendum on allowing a multiparty system the party the direct forerunner of the national unity party so thoroughly repudiated this week objected , the idea was scrapped , and the demonstrations for democracy began to accelerate until they were put down , with great loss of life , in september 1988 but general ne win is hardly likely to enjoy the prospect of daw aung san suu kyi , the 44yearold leader of the national league for democracy , emerging from house arrest to become myanmar s prime minister she is the daughter of u aung san , considered the founder of the nation , who was assassinated in 1947 , just before independence general ne win was one of the original 30 in mr aung san s circle and has always seen himself as the inheritor of mr aung san s mantle mrs aung san suu kyi s sweeping victory , said a senior western diplomat , must be like a finger in ne win s eye opposition leader s importance under a law protecting the state from destructive elements , mrs aung san suu kyi was sentenced last july 20 to a year of house arrest , renewable yearly the military authorities who sentenced her thus far show no inclination to let her out early without her leadership , diplomats say , her party will have a hard time handling its new responsibilities the party has been split between young people who support her and former military men who support the party chairman , a retired general , u tin oo , who is currently serving three years at hard labor on a charge of sedition the party will rally around aung san suu kyi , a diplomat said , but only if she is free to lead it as so often in burma , the personality of individuals plays a big part , and she s the only one with the requisite qualities , fame and charisma to run the party , to hold it together and provide direction she is also , he continued , one of the few able to contain the country s hatred for its military rulers the whole focus has been to stay alive and build a political movement , a diplomat said there are a lot of deep problems here , and nobody s done much thinking about them although the military has barred foreign journalists from myanmar in recent months , about 60 reporters , most of them from television and news agencies , were allowed to enter the country for the elections last week
it s hard to overstate the significance of yesterday s epochal votes in moscow this is truly a third russian revolution the first overthrew the czar in february 1917 nine months later , lenin s bolsheviks ousted an interim democratic regime and imposed a dictatorship of the communist party now , heeding a bold appeal by an embattled mikhail gorbachev , the central committee of the soviet communist party has voted to do what no one thought it would ever do abandon its constitutional monopoly on power this may not have been what mr gorbachev intended when he started down the path of reform lenin certainly never envisioned multiparty democracy he viewed the communist party as the ark and anchor of the soviet system , as the infallible vanguard of a triumphant working class whoever in the least weakens its iron discipline , he taught , actually aids the bourgeoisie against the proletariat democratic centralism would be permissible for party leaders , but no democracy , with trappings of parties and free press , for the people stalin carried this system to monstrous lengths , shaping a party itself tyrannized by oneman rule his creed of submission and blood sacrifice was imposed on all communist states in his own blunt words the proletarian parties become strong by purging themselves of opportunists and reformists , social imperialists and social chauvinists , social patriots and social pacifists stalin s heirs ended the blood sacrifices but none questioned the party s leading role , as enshrined in article 6 of the soviet constitution mr gorbachev , until his january visit to rebellious lithuania , denied any willingness to eliminate the party s permanent monopoly indeed , he talked as if only the party could bring about the reforms he envisioned now he seems to know that his reforms can succeed only if the party apparatchiks yield up their stifling power no one can say with confidence how mr gorbachev s watershed decision , backed by most of his central committee colleagues , will fare in a country lacking a democratic tradition but the hammer has been separated from the sickle , and all who thought this could never happen can rejoice
los angeles , aug 10 a federal judge ruled today that the united states had violated its extradition treaty with mexico by abducting a mexican doctor accused of involvement in the torture slaying of an american drug agent the judge ordered that the doctor be returned to mexico the ruling was a stinging rebuke to the united states government in a case that has soured its relations with mexico the mexican government had complained that the united states had violated mexico s sovereignty in the way that the doctor , humberto alvarez machain , was brought from guadalajara , mexico , to los angeles last april for trial in the slaying of the american agent , enrique camarena salazar 'acted unilaterally' the united states acted unilaterally , without the participation or consent of the mexican government , and the mexican government has registered an official protest to these actions , said federal district judge edward rafeedie given these facts , the united states has violated the extradition treaty between the united states and mexico while the judge said the court lacked jurisdiction to try dr alvarez , he stayed his order to repatriate dr alvarez for seven days to allow american officials an opportunity to appeal officials at the united states attorney s office here refused comment in washington , the drug enforcement administration and its parent agency , the justice department , had no immediate comment on the judge s ruling there s no way we can comment on that now , said cornelius j dougherty , a spokesman for the drug agency we have a week to consider an appeal , and we 'll make use of that time we do n't and ca n't have anything to say right now in mexico city , a spokesman for president carlos salinas de gortari of mexico said the ruling was a victory for justice and legality he called it an example of the high level of cooperation existing between mexico and the united states , who have a mature , adult and effective relationship judge rafeedie said he could find no precedent for his ruling in past cases of abductions of suspects abroad , he said , the governments involved either participated or aided in the apprehension , or at least assented to it agent and pilot slain mr camarena , who worked for the drug enforcement administration , was kidnapped in guadalajara on feb 7 , 1985 , and taken to a ranch owned by rafael caro quintero , a leader of a local drug ring the agent s mutilated body and that of his pilot , alfredo zavalaavelar , were found a month later at the ranch , 65 miles from the city in all , 22 people have been indicted in the case three were tried and convicted two years ago in los angeles they are jesus felix gutierrez , convicted of accessory after the fact and sentenced to 10 years in prison , and rene verdugo uquidez and raul lopez alvarez , both convicted of murder and each sentenced to 240 years plus life four others were convicted in recent weeks they are javier vasquez velasco , charged with the murder of two american tourists mistaken for agents of the drug enforcement administration and ruben zuno arce , juan ramon matta ballesteros and juan jose bernabe ramirez , all charged with the kidnapping of mr camarena none have been sentenced three others who were indicted have died , the prosecutors said eleven more are either fugitives or have been incarcerated in mexico dr alvarez , a 42yearold gynecologist , is charged with aiding and abetting the kidnapping , accessory after the fact and conspiracy to commit violent crimes the indictment says he played a central role in the torture of mr camarena by administering drugs to keep the agent conscious while he was being interrogated by members of a local drug trafficking ring 50 , 000 reward offered dr alvarez was abducted at gunpoint in guadalajara on april 2 , and was flown the next day to el paso , where he was arrested by drug agents and taken to los angeles in may , william f fahey , an assistant united states attorney for the central district of california , argued in court here that dr alvarez was turned over to american officials in el paso by the mexican police working with other mexican citizens mr fahey said this procedure , while admittedly outside the formal usmexico extradition treaty , was not a violation of the law after first denying direct american involvement , the government was later forced under questioning by judge rafeedie to concede that it had offered a 50 , 000 reward for dr alvarez s capture and had paid 20 , 000 in expenses to the mexicans who abducted him and 6 , 000 a week in living expenses for them and their families in the united states hector berrellez , the federal agent supervising the investigation , told judge rafeedie on may 25 that the plan was approved by john c lawn , then the administrator of the drug agency , and that attorney general dick thornburgh was consulted antonio garate bustamente , a former lieutenant colonel in the mexican federal police now living in los angeles , testified that he helped arrange the abduction for the drug agency mexican president protests the mexican government protested the abduction , and president salinas said it contradicted mexican law if the doctor faces criminal charges it should be in mexico , in accordance with mexican law , the president said testimony in the trial of other defendants in the case has implicated many highranking mexican officials in drug dealing and in mr camarena s death among those implicated was javier garcia paniagua , a former cabinet minister who is mexico city s police chief today s ruling came on a motion by dr alvarez s lawyer , robert k steinberg , who accused the united states of outrageous conduct in the abduction of his client decision based on treaty judge rafeedie , who was appointed by president ronald reagan in 1982 , based his decision solely on the extradition treaty between the united states and mexico with authorization from the highest levels of the dea and perhaps the department of justice , the united states through its paid agents unilaterally abducted dr alvarez from mexican soil , the judge wrote in his decision the record reveals that mexico has vigorously opposed this act while judge rafeedie rebuked the government for its handling of the case , he stressed that he was not dismissing the indictment to date , seven of the 22 indicted persons have been brought before this court to stand trial on these offenses , he wrote of the seven , three have been brought before this court by means of covert forcible abduction from their homelands the two other abducted defendants were mr matta , who was captured in honduras and convicted here of kidnapping , and mr verdugo , captured in mexico and convicted here of murder in neither case did the honduran or mexican governments protest photo enrique camarena salazar , the drug enforcement administration agent who was slain in mexico in 1985 \( associated press \) \(

berkeley , calif , aug 28 at the university of california campus that was once the national stage for student unrest , young men and women with bright eyes and promising futures warily started a new semester this week in a world poised for war there were no big antiwar demonstrations in sproul plaza on the opening days of classes , no heated polemics in the bear s lair pub , no clear consensus among the 31 , 000 students about the united states military buildup in the persian gulf instead , amid the giddy sensations of the first few days of school , there was an undercurrent of uneasiness among students who were interviewed , more than 50 in all , that the tensions in the middle east could spill over into their peaceful lives the basic questions the questions in many of their minds would they be drafted \? would a war in the persian gulf become to them what vietnam was to their parents \? alex bustamante , a freshman from southern california , said the international crisis was not a big topic among his friends until somebody mentioned the word 'draft' and commentators related it to vietnam we 're all sitting here , 18 to 21 years old , and this could be a grave reality , mr bustamante added during a break in a class about mediation techniques , part of an undergraduate program called peace and conflict studies that is popular with students of a pacifist bent his comments were echoed across campus , among army cadets in the reserve officer training corps everybody relates it to vietnam , which was our parents' thing , said cecilia riedel , a senior cadet from san francisco you 've heard so much about it and there s this vision of 'oh , my god , total catastrophe , everyone going , death all over the place' their own priorities on the berkeley campus , as elsewhere in the nation , the current crop of students is said to be relatively quiescent , uninformed about world affairs , selfabsorbed even now , when so many adults are obsessed by international events and riveted to the television set , the students here went about their business , poring over course catalogues , soaking up the late summer sun , squealing with pleasure at reunions with friends at sproul plaza , a sea of people at noontime , bart simpson tshirts were everywhere and us out of saudi arabia ones seen elsewhere are nowhere to be found a vendor with a socialist action newspaper urging bring the troops home now could find no takers in registration lines and at lunch tables , none of the overheard conversations were about the gulf crisis , although students were quite knowledgeable when their opinions were sought nobody has come rushing up to me saying , 'what do you think \? ' said todd gitlin , a professor of sociology who wrote the sixties , a book about the decade it s hard to know whether things are inert or incipient but some instructors detected an immediate difference meta mendelreyes , a graduate teaching assistant , asked the students in her introductory political science sections whether citizens in a democracy really participated in the decisions of government ms mendelreyes intended to nudge the discussion toward the situation in the middle east , using it as an example , as she used the abortion issue last year but the students began talking about the persian gulf before she got around to it they do n't exactly know which way to go , but they 're paying attention to this , she said , buoyed by the avid class participation they are going to be affected , and i think they 've figured that out worries over a draft for many students , the alarm bell was sounded by a parent , worrying about the resumption of the draft , a prospect that has not been formally raised in washington but is already a staple of conversation in families with children of the vulnerable age my wife is asking , what will happen to norman \? said changlin tien , berkeley s new chancellor his son norman is a doctoral student in microelectronics at the university of california at san diego the students here had sketchy knowledge of the way the draft worked during the vietnam war , and most assumed they would be protected because they were in college i'm trying to stay in school for that reason , said paul tullis , a history major i only have a year and a half left , and who knows how long it might go on mr tullis added that from what he had learned in school about the conflict in southeast asia , it seemed that people who were floundering around and not in school got sent dario martinez , a senior from los angeles , made the same assumption , citing a family friend who got out of vietnam by going to berkeley when mr martinez was told that deferments were not automatic for all students in the vietnam era , his face momentarily clouded what about being gay \? he asked i'm gay that 'll work , wo n't it \? \( in fact , the armed forces have regulations excluding homosexuals \) while uneasiness about the possibility of a draft seemed pervasive , opinions about the persian gulf were mixed for every student dismayed at the idea that the united states might risk a war to guard its supply of cheap oil , there was another who commended president bush for standing up to iraqi aggression hoping to demonstrate the bottomline reason the united states is there is oil , the same reason saddam hussein took kuwait , said eric meyer , a junior from hollister , south of here , who was trying without much success to drum up interest in a demonstration scheduled for wednesday in the plaza charles connolly , a freshman from nearby alameda , was just as emphatic in the other direction if the us had n't intervened , no one would have , and the situation would have gotten really bad , he said i think we should go in there and take care of it , full throttle more often , however , the young men and women on campus were ambivalant , like so many of their elders usually if students get involved , it s railing against politicians for sending them off to war , said bruce cohen , a chemistry graduate student from cherry hill , nj but that seems sort of kneejerk this time it s very difficult to side against the government with this kind of aggressor among students attracted to berkeley by its reputation for activism , there was some wishful thinking this week that current events could revivify the campus it s really depressing how conservative berkeley has gotten , said kristin kopp , a junior studying german and biology this is n't the 60 s , and i'm waiting for the pendulum to swing back it might take a nice ugly war and conscription i'm sure that would mobilize people on this campus photos dario martinez , student what about being gay \? i'm gay that 'll work , wo n't it \? alex bustamante , student we 're all sitting here , 18 to 21 years old , and this could be a grave reality changlin tien , chancellor of the university of california at berkeley his wife is concerned about what will happen to their son if the united states goes to war

the huskyvoiced caller from pittsburgh was almost pleading tell me something that will restore my confidence in the freeenterprise system , he asked the guest on larry king live , a popular cable news network talk show michael lewis , the author of liar s poker , a book about salomon brothers , paused and then answered , i do n't think there is much going on on wall street now that would restore your faith in free enterprise it was every investment banker s nightmare it is bad enough for those on wall street that jokes about their profession have become a national pastime now , several recent books paint a devastating portrait of the street and some of its most senior executives bestselling books two of those books have soared to second and third positions on the new york times list of bestselling nonfiction hardcover books barbarians at the gate , a harper row book by bryan burrough and john helyar , is an account of the takeover struggle for rjr nabisco inc , which ended with the company being acquired by kohlberg , kravis , roberts company liar s poker , a hilarious firstperson account of life on a trading floor , is published by w w norton company the excesses of wall street have been popularized before in films like wall street and in the off broadway play other people s money both are works of fiction many people on wall street are divided about the accuracy of the portrait of the street painted in the new books , most of which are nonfiction but some executives said such harsh representations of wall street whether accurate or not could have serious repercussions they come as the nation seems to be in transition to a new gestalt oldfashioned values are coming into vogue again , spurred on by the model of an ostensibly kinder , gentler president , political analysts say conspicuous consumption is out environmentally correct diapers are in in such an atmosphere , some analysts say , a populist backlash might develop against business in general and wall street in particular culturally , you 're probably looking at the leading indicators of a move away from looking at finance and business through favorable glasses , said kevin phillips , a political analyst in washington with close ties to the republican party mr phillips thinks that conservatives of the let s deregulate , anything goes school are already on the run , thanks to widely publicized debacles involving the savings and loan industry , overly leveraged companies and highyield , highrisk junk bonds his views are shared by many on wall street , who worry that if the economy weakens and unemployment rises , public attitudes toward business could turn hostile some of these books are indictments of the business community as much as the wall street community , said john c whitehead , a former deputy secretary of state who was a senior partner at the wall street firm of goldman , sachs company although none were willing to discuss it openly , several prominent wall street executives said a new novel called hanover place , written by michael thomas and published by warner books , has aroused fears of a resurgence of antisemitism in its apocalyptic ending , the novel equates takeovers and insidertrading with a new moneygrubbing culture many of the characters are jewish and , in the novel , that produces a virulent antisemitic backlash the other books do not raise an issue of such gravity but they do offer insights that many readers have found astonishing and disturbing in mr lewis s liar s poker , salomon brothers executives are depicted as an unruly band of juvenile delinquents whose idea of a good time is to rig chairs to collapse when sat upon and replace a suitcase of their colleague s travel clothes with wet paper towels sort of an animal house with suspenders the book also depicts salomon underlings as selling undesirable securities to unsuspecting customers be very wary , suspicious , is the point , mr lewis counseled larry king s audience a spokesman for salomon , robert baker , said the book was an amusing caricature treacherous executives barbarians at the gate and a less successful book published by new american library on the same subject , true greed , by hope lampert depicts some of wall street s most prominent executives as even more treacherous deal makers named in both of these nonfiction books are shown as conniving and manipulative , more consumed with their own agendas than the goals of their clients readers are left with an overwhelming sense that the 25 billion acqusition of rjr nabisco occurred not because it was worth that much , or because it made economic sense , but because it was the inevitable climax of a battle royal of egos in an interview with mr burrough , tom brokaw , the nbc news anchor , asked the coauthor of barbarians if he had ever heard any of the principals say something like , wait a minute , we do have an obligation to those people who live in places in north carolina and atlanta , ga , and who depend on this company , really , for their daily paycheck and maybe for their financial future mr burrough replied , in fact , the evidence shows that the workers were the last thing anyone was concerned with while some of those who are depicted in the books say the accounts are largely correct , others insist the portraits are exaggerated other side of the picture
tokyo , april 27 a flurry of recent trade accords between the united states and japan appears to have arrested a deterioration in the two countries' relationship but the sense of relief in tokyo is diminished by deep worries about the future the reason is that none of the agreements are expected to make a large dent in america s 50 billion trade deficit with japan , according to both japanese and american officials and trade experts japanese officials said they were pleased with president bush s decision not to cite japan this year for unfair trading practices under super 301 of the tough 1988 trade law , which calls for sanctions against those cited but they remain anxious about what may lie ahead one reason is that the yen s steep decline in relation to the dollar in recent months is widely expected to jeopardize the gains made in the negotiations by lowering the price of japanese products overseas and increasing the price of american exports to japan indeed , the deficit worsened last month , after some improvement in the last year new troubles feared the concern in japan , therefore , is that the trade frictions may have lifted only temporarily , and that deeper tensions are bound to return we have not entered any kind of new era because of these agreements , said a senior japanese negotiator just as we have been pestered by the american trade people day after day and week after week , so we will be pestered again our endurance is down to the barest of threads when the united states trade representative , carla a hills , cited japan last year under congressional pressure , it caused enormous strains with tokyo japan at first refused to negotiate on the issues cited by mrs hills , but eventually it did so , reaching an accord this week on the last of three major items on the american agenda , wood products japan agreed to streamline certification procedures and building codes the wood products accord built on two earlier , but smaller , agreements providing increased access for american satellites and supercomputers altogether , the accords are far below 2 billion in trade volume , a tiny fraction of the trade deficit a spurt in imports indeed , although american exports to japan have risen in recent years , american imports particularly automobiles , consumer electronics and machinery have risen twice as fast japanese officials say they feel lingering bitterness at the way they had to negotiate with the united states under the threat of sanctions , a principal tool of the super 301 clause japan viewed the super 301 action as coercive , unilateral and illegal mrs hills was understood to have been advised by many american negotiators not to use it again this year the united states ambassador , michael h armacost , said this week that he thought more progress could be made now in a quieter atmosphere , free of recriminations over unilateral threats by washington but he also acknowledged that foreign pressure , known as gaiatsu in japanese , does seem to produce results it is undeniably apparent that much of the movement has come near these deadlines , mr armacost said japanese politicians and bureacrats contend , however , that american pressure cannot work again in the future japan will contest the legality of super 301 in international trade forums and refuse to negotiate 'increasing irritation' within japan there is increasing irritation among the japanese people visavis the united states as a result of the latest talks , said takujiro hamada , a member of parliament my constituents are asking , 'why should japan do that much \? ' it is a matter of concern how much japan has done may be subject to debate in one breakthrough , japan agreed recently to revise its copyright law to protect foreign recordings made before 1978 but american negotiators say that the biggest lobbyist for this change was a japanese businessman akio morita , chairman of the sony corporation , which now owns cbs records in another recent accord seeking to reduce socalled structural impediments to trade , tokyo pledged to spend more on public works projects , ease regulations that protect japan s small stores , lower japanese land prices , crack down on collusive business practices and undertake other structural changes to improve access for imports but trade officials say that the accord will be difficult to put into effect and that it may not lead to more sales of american products the trade problems lying ahead arise from new demands for american access to japanese markets in semiconductors , construction contracts , telecommunications equipment and for a new product called amorphous metal now for the details the immediate problems seem now to have been sorted out , mr armacost told a news conference on thursday but we 've got to fill in a lot of very important details as everyone knows in government work , the devil is usually in the details japanese economists say , for instance , that the basic monopolistic behavior of business cartels , considered by americans to be unfair , is considered by japan to be both fair and legal it s going to be very difficult to change , in a major way , our bilateral balance of trade , said kazuo nukuzawa , managing director of keidanren , japan s most powerful industrial trade association the danger is if there is little or almost no reduction in the trade figures , and the united states links this result with japanese sincerity or insincerity in implementing the structural changes
as the american racing season staggers to its final battle site saturday in the breeders' cup at belmont park , the heroes of the campaign are casualties criminal type , sunday silence , easy goer and golden pheasant , the best of the older males , all have retired from the racing wars with injuries the best of the young warriors , the 3yearolds summer squall and housebuster , are mending from recent wounds even the next generation has already suffered the lost of eastern echo , the unbeaten 2yearold who broke down after just three starts in a season of fallen heroes , though , a trio of heroines has emerged to lead the sport s richest day for the first time in the sevenyear history of the championship racing series , the most talented , prominent and popular runners on the sevenrace card are three fillies and mares rather than the colts and horses who usually dominate the show their age , experience and credentials vary widely , but their common theme is excellence they are meadow star , a 2yearold filly who is unbeaten and virtually unchallenged in six starts go for wand , a 3yearold filly of almost freakish brilliance , and bayakoa , a 6yearold mare with extraordinary durability and tenacity they are such compelling runners that their presence alone may make the seventh cup an aesthetic success all of them are virtually sure to be honored with eclipse awards next february meadow star as the nation s champion 2yearold filly , go for wand as champion 3yearold filly and bayakoa as champion older filly or mare they may well be the strongest such trio of female champions since 1974 , when ruffian , chris evert and desert vixen won those respective divisional titles all have already transcended the divisions they have so thoroughly dominated , and are more often compared to the best fillies of the last two decades than to their immediate rivals there is talk about all of them as possible candidates for this season s horse of the year trophy , particularly go for wand none of them , though , has successfully challenged males this year , something done by the four other fillies who have earned that title busher in 1944 , twilight tear in 1945 , all along in 1983 and lady s secret in 1986 go for wand and meadow star have run faster and more impressive races than their male contemporaries this season , but the question of whether they are the best 3yearold and 2yearold of either sex will remain a point of speculation at least until next year both are likely to take on males next year in challenges that could be the highlights of the racing season meadow star against colts in the triple crown races and go for wand against top older males in major handicap races on saturday , go for wand and bayakoa will race each other for the first time in the 1 million breeders' cup distaff at a mile and an eighth , the most keenly anticipated showdown between fillies in cup history the dramatic 1988 distaff , in which personal ensign remained undefeated in her final career start with a stirring rally to edge winning colors , may well have been the best race of the decade , but there was less excitement going in personal ensign already had beaten winning colors at a shorter distance , was backed down to 1to2 , and widely considered a shooin go for wand may be an oddson favorite saturday but her handlers know this is the toughest spot of her career when billy badgett , her trainer , was thinking about running her against colts in the 3 million breeders' cup classic , a plan he ultimately rejected because of the large field expected for that race , one of his reasons for considering it was because bayakoa might be as tough as any of the males this year go for wand , though , has been acting unbeatable lately she has won five straight grade i stakes races the mother goose , test , alabama , maskette and beldame in a style that has left even conservative rival horsemen linking her name with greatness those victories have included a blazing display of speed in the sevenfurlong test and a powerful show of stamina in the mileandaquarter alabama , but her beldame last time out was the best of all she raced the distaff distance of a mile and an eighth in 1 4591 , believed the fastest clocking ever recorded on the dirt for a filly of any age go for wand s human and equine connections are a blend of old and new royalty in the sport her sire , deputy minister , is a young stallion who already has sired another twotime filly champion , open mind her trainer , billy badgett , has been out on his own for only five years but was a longtime apprentice to the masterful woody stephens and is near the top of any list of the sport s best young trainers go for wand s dam , the cyane mare obeah , was a champion racemare and her owner , mrs jane dupont lunger s christiana stable , is one of the sport s most venerable outfits bayakoa is more of a bluecollar heroine born oct 10 , 1984 at the haras principal , a stud farm about 100 miles from buenos aires , this daughter of consultant s bid \( a grandson of bold ruler \) became argentina s top 3yearold filly and miler in 1987 she was then sold for 300 , 000 to frank and jan whitham , who own cattleprocessing companies in wichita , kan , and turned over to ron mcanally , the californiabased trainer

konspira solidarity underground by maciej lopinski , marcin moskit and mariusz wilk translated by jane cave afterword by lawrence weschler illustrated 261 pp berkeley , calif university of california press 2495 this remarkable book , put together in the first years of the ultimately triumphant polish conspiracy it documents , is a pioneering work of historical witness maciej lopinski , marcin moskit and mariusz wilk merged medium and message as they dodged the police in 1982 , 1983 and 1984 to interview the fugitive leaders of solidarity s evolving underground , seven men on the run who had evaded the dragnet of martial law when it dropped on dec 13 , 1981 in the early hours of that morning , as the tanks rolled out , most of the top leaders of the free trade union movement were detained the union offices were ransacked and padlocked money , records and mimeographs were confiscated it appeared that solidarity had been decapitated and that , as in budapest in 1956 and prague in 1968 , the might of communist totalitarianism had once again crushed an opposition movement , in this instance the most sustained and democratic opposition force to coalesce in eastern europe yet eight years later the movement emerged totally victorious , without any blood on its hands , to steer poland s stillcontinuing passage to democracy , and to pave the way for communism s broader retreat and collapse how did this happen \? as konspira makes clear , a large measure of the credit belongs to the seven men whose taped hopes , fears and analyses trace the evolution of a successful strategy of resistance through cunning and luck they had escaped arrest , and at first none of them was even aware the others were still at large after weeks of putting out careful feelers they found one another , and within months had formed the temporary national commission , a loosely knit high command of solidarity s underground groups that , in proclaiming itself , thumbed its nose at martial law and challenged the military regime that had imposed it it was the initial members of this high command men who gave way to yet others when they were eventually arrested who were sought out by the authors , all journalists close to solidarity they interviewed the leaders separately , with the first session coming just six months after martial law was declared , and the last 16 months later like their subjects , the authors had to work with great vigilance their taping and transcription were interrupted and delayed because of internment and interrogations still , by the end of 1984 , konspira was printed by poland s burgeoning clandestine press , and became one of the earliest best sellers of the underground civilization that the book s fugitive heroes were then shaping now , a fine english translation by jane cave brings the story to foreigners they are unlikely to read it as an inspirational primer , the way so many poles did when it first appeared but even for the less engaged , the book raises fundamental issues of how evil and oppression can be effectively confronted in a technological age what is to be done when barricades , raised sabers and poetic rallying cries cannot deter the tanks of brutal state power \? what exactly should citizens do when the sounds of jackboots echo down hushed , darkened streets \? none of the seven figures had any clear plan of resistance at the outset , beyond knowing that by evading arrest they had assumed grave responsibility candidly and poignantly , they discuss different approaches wladyslaw frasyniuk , the wroclaw mechanic , wants to prepare for a general strike zbigniew bujak , his warsaw counterpart , disagrees , saying that any strike would be crushed he pins his hopes on a longterm strategy , seeking to build networks of committed people , first by organizing financial help for the families of detainees some want a strong central command at the top , while others want as much local autonomy as possible for the small clandestine groups that are arising in every part of poland ultimately , they agreed on a command structure just cohesive enough to demonstrate to the world and to any doubting poles that the spirit of solidarity was thriving links were established , meanwhile , with benefactors abroad , and from below came hundreds of initiatives , ranging from underground publications to networks that provided safe apartments and counterfeit documents as important as the positive steps taken by these leaders , all in their early 30 s , were the many pitfalls that they avoided konspira shows how suggestions of sabotage were debated and discarded , and how alliances offered by quixotic plotters claiming to have arms were spurned in the end , a 20thcentury conspiratorial model emerged that made it possible for hundreds of groups of people to put out thousands of illegal publications , broadcast radio programs , produce theatrical shows , create and distribute videos , collect dues , monitor rigged national elections , provide legal assistance for prisoners , develop a foreign policy to rival that of the state in short , to establish more and more islands of free life within a totalitarian sea one such island was konspira it ought to be read , studied and celebrated as an important part of the process of nonviolent change to which it attests and perhaps translated into chinese

washington , sept 5 after meeting with mr levy , mr baker said the two men had agreed that we should not link the situation between israel and the palestinians with the situation in the persian gulf , as some have suggested president hussein and the soviet foreign minister , eduard a shevardnadze , have suggested some type of conference to settle both the iraqi occupation of kuwait and the israelipalestinian conflict mr baker thanked israel publicly for maintaining its low profile in the persian gulf crisis , as the united states has requested as it works closely with saudi arabia to assemble and maintain an arab coalition against iraq tensions alleviated the gulf crisis appears to have removed much of the tension that has affected relations between the bush administration and israel for the last 18 months this is in part because attention has been diverted from the palestinianisraeli question , the major source of disagreement between the two countries equally important , with american officials aware that military action against iraq might be necessary , they want to make sure that there is close coordination between the united states and israel both as a guarantee against any unilateral israeli action and as insurance that they can count on israel s support in the crunch mr levy said i go back to israel with a good feeling about the commitments to the needs of israel israel is indeed keeping a low profile not because israel is not an important factor on the scene , and not because there is no danger lurking or threatening israel but because israel stands firmly with the united states and understands what great tasks it is undertaking israel s request for money officials said that mr levy had raised the questions of israel s debt and its desire foro a 400 million housing loan guarantee from the united states as it tries to absorb thousands of immigrating soviet jews but officials said mr baker did not offer to wipe out israel s 46 billion military debt to the united states , as president bush has proposed to do with egypt s 7 billion military debt as for the housing loan guarantee , which has already been approved by congress , mr baker and mr levy discussed the assurances that israel would give washington that none of this money would be spent in the occupied territories while both men said they made progress on these assurances , they did not resolve all of the outstanding issues and until they do the guarantee will not be issued on the stalled peace negotiations , the administration official who took part in the talks said mr baker s message to mr levy was that one of the best ways for israel to counter saddam hussein politically , and to prove that he is not the wave of the future in the middle east , is by demonstrating to arabs and palestinians that there are credible alternatives to his confrontational approach to dealing with the arabisrael issue the palestinians have to have a reason to want to join the process if they want to join the process , the official said a real plan on the table that last point was added by mr baker , the official said , out of a recognition that no palestinians may be willing to talk to israel the palestine liberation organization chairman , yasir arafat , initially threw his support behind mr hussein , and many palestinians in the occupied territories have also hailed the iraqi leader mr baker argued to mr levy , though , that israel should not be excused from making sure that a credible peace plan is on the table to attract palestinians who decide that president hussein s approach leads only to a blind alley , the official said the palestinians have got to be ready to step up to the plate , the official said , but the israelis have to make sure that they have a credible and believable pitch to hit photo foreign minister david levy of israel , who met yesterday with secretary of state james a baker 3d to discuss a credible arabisraeli peace process \( george tames for the new york times \)
managua , nicaragua , aug 29 at a shady hilltop complex overlooking lake managua , francisco franco espinoza went for a walk this week the moment was made enjoyable by a morning breeze , which eased managua s tropical heat and it was made noteworthy by something even more basic mr franco s new right leg , which was fabricated and fitted just a few steps away it s the best , said mr franco , a 31yearold former sandinista army lieutenant , admiring the detailed rubber foot and poundedaluminum calf and thigh , which he first tried out last month i could walk from the moment i put it on the legacy of war maimed by a contra sharpshooter in the mountains two years ago , mr franco is one of thousands of nicaraguans who have suffered major amputations as a result of combatrelated wounds he is typical of a generation of handicapped veterans whose productive lives have depended on expensive rehabilitation and complex artificial limbs but now he has become one of the first recipients of a new , locally made prosthesis that doctors hope will let nicaraguan amputees avoid years of frustration and expense in receiving new limbs and help speed the country s recovery from a decade of violence and civil war brought here by a physician from the united states , the new device is an artificial foot created from simple materials like wooden blocks and the rubber patches used in repairing car tires the design , adapted from one invented 10 years ago in jaipur , india , usually requires none of the complex moving parts and expensive fittings required for more sophisticated artificial limbs international experts say that the result is a remarkably durable yet lifelike device that holds out new hope to the thousands of nicaraguans left incapacitated by the war and they envision nicaragua as a test center for plans to expand the use of the device , known as the jaipur foot , to the rest of latin america and other impoverished regions torn by war and hampered by inadequate medical care simpler device was needed i used to see the same people waiting for prostheses every time i came here i can still remember the faces , said dr kevin m cahill , the new york physician who first suggested the use of the jaipur foot in nicaragua in 1987 the backlog was just mounting and mounting , and it was obvious that we had to find a simpler and faster method of returning these people to their communities dr cahill , the director of the tropical disease center at lenox hill hospital in manhattan , said he had suggested the jaipur foot after seeing it demonstrated in india , where it had gained widespread acceptance for its low cost and durability the project was then begun with a grant of 100 , 000 from the hamlyn foundation , a british charitable trust with additional funds from the united nations development program , the indian government and other donors , a nicaraguan medical team including one doctor and three technicians was sent to india for three months last year to learn the process of manufacturing and fitting the jaipur foot a similar indian team visited nicaragua last month to oversee the first fittings of the device , which nicaraguan specialists say is ideal for their patients people ask us why we have brought technology like this from a country that is so poor and so far away , said dr marcos salas cruz , the chief of orthopedics at managua s central military hospital , who was one of the nicaraguan team that visited india it is because the indians know the kind of problems , the kind of circumstances our patients face 2 , 500 amputees since '79 since the sandinista revolution in 1979 , doctors here say , at least 2 , 500 nicaraguans have suffered the amputation of major limbs for these victims , life often becomes a wrenching series of hospital stays and long waits for artificial limbs that rarely fulfill their purpose even when prostheses are available , doctors say , they are generally unsuited to the kind of rough rural conditions that most victims live in , and too expensive to replace when they become ruined by mud , rust or hard use in rocky terrain although a small factory for fiberglass prostheses was donated and set up in managua several years ago under the auspices of the international committee of the red cross , its artificial limbs are less durable than the jaipur foot , and experts say its output of four to six limbs a month is too low even to provide enough replacements for patients who have already received prostheses by contrast , doctors say the jaipur foot , which requires no imported materials other than sheets of raw aluminum , can be fabricated in high quantities and at prices that are eventually expected to fall as low as 25 a limb doctors hope it will give nicaragua the capacity not only to treat its own patients , but to serve patients from surrounding countries , including el salvador , where years of civil war have also left thousands of people with amputated limbs water and mudproof the molded , fleshcolored foot , which is covered entirely in vulcanized rubber , is impervious to mud and water and lasts up to five years , compared with less than one year for most other prostheses in contrast to other devices , it is designed so that the wearer can go barefoot an essential feature in poor rural settings this is a real example of southtosouth cooperation that works , said miguel d'escoto brockmann , who was foreign minister in the sandinista government and is now chairman of the local foundation that was set up to administer the jaipur foot project and it not only works , it is better than anything else you can get although most patients thus far are former members of the sandinista army , mr d'escoto said the artificial limbs would be provided to all amputees without inquiry as to their political beliefs or their participation on either side in the war he said the cost would be paid entirely by donations , with no charge to patients medical officials have also planned an international conference in india next month that will consider the potential application of nicaragua s experience to angola , mozambique , afghanistan and other thirdworld war zones but for nicaraguan amputees like 20yearold aquiles cortez lopez , the value of the jaipur foot needs no discussion there is no pain , no problem , said mr cortez , a former sandinista soldier who received the device last month to replace a foot that was shattered by a contra mine in 1988 i can walk photo a new type of artificial foot being made

call me , ishmael we 'll do lunch ishmael , i protested , is but a creation of my restless pen i am sure right have it your way any man writes a threepound book , i 'll call him whatever he wants i make it a policy never to disagree with a writer till the script is in listen , ish , i 'll have my people call your people , we 'll take a meeting i'm heading into the valley now , so reception s about to static exploded on the line i could envision sid s mocha rolls plunging down a precipitous slope into the valley of san fernando suddenly an alien voice filled the ether , shouting , hey ! any you guys on my line interested in quality storm sash \? an hour later , i received a call from my agent , al detocqueville weintraub sid had authorized him to fedex me a ducat on mgm grand air , had engaged a minisuite at one of the tony new hostels with names that sound like french colognes i was on my way not a moment too soon , either , for 10 years in the customs house with no action had turned my life to something resembling suet pudding imagine , if you will , the damage done by a regimen of unrelieved tedium to a mind such as mine , accustomed to scouring the benthic abysses of the human soul envy was the hag that brewed my ink my days were filled with listening to the salty tales of raffish lascars who stormed into my puny office with bales of exotic commodities like cinnabar \( they called it cinnabar , though i had my doubts , for when they would sneak a pinch of it and surreptitiously place it beneath their hats , after a few seconds they would burst into a chorus of sit down , you 're rockin' the boat \) oh , there had been a few paltry options taken on some of my works over the years , and now and then some fading player in search of a golden globe nomination had actually filmed a truncated version of one or the other , but none had ever borne fruit by which i mean enough of the long green to secure me a decent twobedroom in a building with a health club , and maybe the first few payments on a keogh plan now , thanks to the literary sensitivity of a man i had never met sid fennel of the fennel entertainment group , an investment partnership formed by convicted felons and the second sons of arab sheiks i had hope i recall precious little of the flight into the setting sun the first two hours were spent repelling the advances of a serving wench in a merry widow and sequined pumps , who insisted on forcefeeding me fish eggs and cold duck after a brief and troubled nap , during which i suffered my recurring nightmare of being compelled , stark naked , to serve canapes to the academie francaise , i passed the remainder of the time watching a film about an adolescent who , by uttering a shibboleth , magically transforms himself into a skin lesion on the face of the leader of the soviet union and thus brings peace to the world i wondered would sid fennel have the temerity to suggest butchering my classic oeuvre to pander to illiterate bumpkins for the sake of a quick buck \? never , i decided whatever else he was and intimates had used such diverse terms as maniac and cruller sid was , he assured me , a respecter of artistic integrity i was met at the airport by a blackcaparisoned chauffeur holding a placard on which had been scribbled in lip gloss , apparently the word melville he was a strapping lad , broad of shoulder , keen of eye \( there was but one , the other having been sold , he was to tell me later , to finance lessons in interpretive dance \) as he hoisted my sea bag and escorted me to an automobile designed solely to violate the mann act , he said , melville melville that name rings a bell did n't you used to be somebody \? if only i muttered , and climbed aboard sid had said we would meet at first light or noon , whichever came first , and so , after consuming a roomservice order of mineral water and a tuna melt the tab for which came to more than i had earned since 1851 i tucked myself into sheets as soft as maidens' hair and drifted off we met for brunch at la puanteur , purveyors of entrails to the stars the maitre d' , imperiously androgynous , greeted me with the same enthusiasm he would have accorded to a gravy stain on his waistcoat , and escorted me to sid s table sid fennel was a small man who resembled nothing so much as a bass he had recently had a hair transplant \( or else enjoyed recreational trephination \) , and his scalp looked like a hardused country lane over which a few scraggly saplings had fallen at random we ordered , then exchanged a few moments of small talk about the practical applications of cold fusion the food came , and conversation flagged as sid , like a starved panther , assaulted his order of braised pancreas on a kaiser roll at last , he sat back and , like a bellows , expelled a gust of fetid air and said , goodnews , badnews time i beg your pardon al may be a ball of slime , but i love him he s my amigo he pressed , i caved , he got you 50k for the underlying rights worldwide in perpetuity , plus a first draft , two sets and a polish no back end , but never mind with a gross player in the game , the back end s funny money anyway is that the good news or the bad news \?

the boston hoax , tonight s edition of the other side of the news , at 9 on channel 13 , begins with a dramatic twominute excerpt from the cbs evening news in october viewers heard the halting voice of charles stuart , calling for police help from his car telephone , telling of a latenight attack on him and his pregnant wife , carol then came the sight of their bloodied bodies mrs stuart was soon to die , and mr stuart was left with a gunshot wound in the abdomen he described their attacker as a black man in a jogging suit and even identified a suspect a few weeks later , as evidence accumulated that he himself may have killed his wife , mr stuart jumped to his death in boston harbor the story was a big hit on the night that mr stuart s apparent suicide was reported , the 11 pm newscasts of boston s three network affiliates attracted 80 percent of the city s viewers tonight s discussion focuses on the way that boston s television stations and newspapers reported the case this hour ca n't touch on all the touchy issues the event raised , but under fred w friendly s vigorous questioning , it does show the gap between the journalists' view of their daily labors and that of their critics three critics join six newspaper and television journalists at the big oval table newman flanagan , the district attorney who was in charge of the stuart case , blames the sensational stories on the simple desire to sell newspapers dr alvin f poussaint , a psychiatrist who is no stranger to television talk shows , maintains that the treatment by the national press as well as by local newspapers and television stations reflected the nation s racism dianne wilkerson , a lawyer for the naacp , also draws attention to the differences in the way crimes against whites and blacks are covered the reporters and editors , black and white , who handled the case , say their choices owed less to the workings of the unconscious than to the demands of daily journalism ken chandler , editor of the boston herald , which sells mostly on newsstands and which carried the picture of the bloodied couple on its front page , justifies his decision on grounds of news appeal here was a guy trapped in the car , watching his wife die to the suggestion that so inflammatory a picture might have made a fair trial difficult , he says , we 're not in the business of suppressing news greg moore , the city editor of the boston globe , and emily rooney , the news director of wcvbtv , both of which gave the case abundant attention , say they did not run the picture because it was too graphic and an invasion of privacy whatever one thinks about the use of the picture , that sort of professional disagreement cannot make a dent in the charge of allpervasive racism attributions to the unconscious are virtually invulnerable to rebuttal , which may account for much of their appeal in the world of psychiatry , claims of innocence can be interpreted as proof of guilt one may , however , speculate about the question that dr poussaint reasonably raises would any newspaper have put the story on page 1 if the apparent victims had been black \? was the implicit judgment here , as he argues , that a black life is not worth as much as a white life \? after all , as ms wilkerson says , none of boston s many black homicide victims had made it onto the front pages although if every murder in the inner cities made page 1 around the country , the naacp could be counted on to lead the protests but the stuart case , as the journalists here keep insisting , had many other elements going for it than just the whiteness of the couple the drama of the husband gasping his pleas for help as his wife was dying , their youth , her pregnancy , the prematurely delivered baby an irresistible story it is hard to imagine the editors resisting it if the stuarts had been black as the days went on , however , the color and , perhaps no less important , the presumed class of the stuarts did come into play , as did feelings about who commits crimes these days headlines called them the camelot couple , a sample of a familiar tendency by press and television to treat murder victims as paragons helpful neighbors , brilliant students , with futures full of promise a common sort of kneejerk eulogizing that can be counted on to squeeze audience sympathy the reporting , as acknowledged here , turned a little sloppy , especially when it came to the alleged assailant viewers are shown a report on wcvbtv about the discovery of a jogging suit belonging to the suspect that is light on attributions assumptions and rumors found their way into news reports , and the vaunted skepticism of journalists was late in making itself felt they became part of the show david ropeik , a reporter for wcvbtv , says by way of defense that the incredible event drove the story no doubt but that is only a way of saying that newspapers and television were pandering to the nightmares of much of their audience a loving cleancut upwardaspiring young white couple attacked by a black predator it was even scarier than the scene in the bonfire of the vanities that it resembled and that called up similar fears perhaps , as dr poussaint seems certain , the appeal was to the racism of the audience more certainly , the event owed much of its power to the pervasive anxiety over crime in the streets newspapers and television , caught up in a hot issue , heightened that anxiety even as they catered to it such are some of the thoughts stirred up by this latest contribution by the columbia university seminars on media and society , aimed at helping viewers understand how the deliverers of news do their job and why they sometimes fail to do it as well as they might if the coverage of the stuart case had been as smart , tough and fair as this hour , the reporters and editors involved would not have found themselves so much on the defensive why they did what they did the other side of the news the boston hoax , a media and society special report directed by david deutsch produced by michael quinn and abigail pogrebin for columbia university seminars on media and society at 9 pm on channel 13
along the coatrackclogged sidewalks of seventh avenue in manhattan , the garment industry took out its handkerchief and dabbed its sweaty brow and talked last week about federated stores inc , the renamed american retailing operations of the campeau corporation the manufacturers , bankers , and accountants of the industry were relieved when federated , which owns bloomingdale s and other department store chains , entered chapter 11 bankruptcy on monday now the garment trade can return to a more normal pace of business , at least for a while , many people said things had slowed to a walk and everyone thought the world would come to an end , said herbert grossman , 62 years old and the head of herbert grossman enterprises inc , a women s apparel maker at 512 seventh avenue it s nice to know that the world only came to half an end trouble in the retailing business is more general than federated alone , said lissa l baum , regional manager for chemical bank the main customers in her garmentdistrict office , at broadway and 39th street , are apparel manufacturers whose annual sales range from 5 million to more than 800 million everyone here agrees that there are simply too many stores , said ms baum , the 34yearold daughter of a coat maker there s going to be a shakeout the strong will survive , and the weak will drop out , but ultimately the remaining players will be stronger to protect themselves , apparel makers should continue to limit their exposure to department stores , ms baum suggested , and expand to specialty stores they should also more closely monitor the creditworthiness of all stores , she said to a large degree , ms baum said , that is already the case , as factoring companies , which finance the shipment of goods from manufacturers to retailers , have curbed the credit limit of some stores , especially those of federated , since it declared its debt troubles last fall none of chemical bank s garment district borrowers did more than 10 percent of their annual sales with federated operations , ms baum said she also finds that some clients , who usually sell expensive men s and women s clothing to stores like saks fifth avenue and nordstrom s , are considering selling to j c penney , which is trying to shed its moderatepriced image , as well as to montgomery ward s and sear s in all her discussions with clients , there is one thing that ms baum does not go out of her way to mention her nationality she is a canadian , like robert campeau , the head of the troubled parent of federated ms baum , a native of montreal , said everyone up in canada is embarrassed it s a matter of national pride the number crunchers at 525 seventh avenue , eliahu tahari , a garment district electrician turned successful dressmaker and designer , sees the fall of federated as rooted in the rise of number crunchers , whom he calls computerheads instead of buying merchandise that would bring in customers and drive up sales , mr tahari said , department stores like federated s ordered apparel simply on the basis of what had sold previously in order to meet predetermined sales targets in an impulse business like fashion , that is a recipe for disaster , he said buyers sometimes do n't even look at the dresses , said mr tahari , who is 38 they just fill out the orders the finance department is running the department store they do n't have a merchant mentality anymore , they have a computer mentality ridiculous last week , he could not cash several hundred thousand dollars of federated checks in time the money is frozen under the bankruptcy proceedings only 7 percent of tahari ltd s 50 million in annual revenue involved federated operations feelings are confirmed he was saddened by the bankruptcy declaration of federated but said its troubles point to a changed future when the rollsroyce of the industry gets in trouble , it just confirms everyone s feelings about the the future of the retailing business , mr tahari said there has to be more specialization in quality , customer service and listening to the customer department stores have to stand for something , the way nordstrom stands for a place where the customer is king when g william miller was named chairman of federated on tuesday , some people in the garment industry grumbled that the former treasury secretary and textron chairman , lacked retailing experience but bud konheim , president of nicole miller , a 22millionayear women s apparel maker , was unruffled sitting in his office at 498 seventh avenue , mr konheim , 54 , and the fourth generation of his family in the trade , said it s a lot like when eisenhower was named president of columbia university what does eisenhower know about education \? but he is a terrific figurehead so bill miller ca n't possibly learn the difference between moss crepe and tissue faille , which are dress materials , but he does n't have to he just has to be a terrific figurehead and let everyone run their operations let marvin traub be marvin traub and run bloomingdale s mr traub is the chairman of bloomingdale s the squeeze is on at 40th street and broadway , gary d herwitz , a partner at the accounting firm of mahoney cohen paul company , which caters to the garment trade \( they rely on us as rentachieffinancialofficer \) , is not as sanguine as others on fashion avenue spring orders for merchandise , which are usually shipped this month , seem to be slow in coming from retailers , he said the relationship between apparel manufacturers and department stores has changed , said mr herwitz , who is 34 retailers are slower and slower in paying manufacturers for the goods they buy , he said , adding , they 're turning the accounts payable department into a profit center because manufacturers must pay for labor and raw materials long before a dress or a suit is made , their margins are being squeezed , he said , although he does not know of any garment district company that has been seriously hurt the federated bankruptcy proceeding is a serious matter , mr herwitz said , but other department stores intent on pumping up sales quickly seem to be slow in making firm plans for the spring line , as well you do n't want to commit on merchandise without confirmed orders , he said so 1990 is going to be a difficult year photos herbert grossman , head of herbert grossman enterprises inc , a women s apparel maker on seventh avenue , said everyone thought the world would come to an end because of federated s financial problems \( pg d1 \) eliahu tahari , a dressmaker and designer , said he was unable to cash several hundred thousand dollars worth of federated checks because the funds were frozen under bankruptcy proceedings \( nyt john sotomayor \)
lynwood , calif , sept 29 last february , william leonard was stopped by police officers who apparently thought he was armed , was ordered to place his hands behind his head and , as he tried to kneel , was killed by 33 bullets fired into almost every part of his body his 18yearold daughter watched this account has emerged in a lawsuit against the los angeles county sheriff s department and the city of lynwood as one of the most glaring examples of alleged police misconduct the civil rights lawsuit , filed tuesday in federal district court in los angeles , lists 43 incidents , including killings , shootings and beatings that it says were perpetrated by deputies at the lynwood sheriff s substation mostly against minority victims in this workingclass city of 54 , 000 people lynwood , like other small cities in los angeles county that do not have their own police force , contracts for the services of the county sheriff s department for local law enforcement lynwood is about 10 miles south of downtown los angeles a spokesman for the sheriff s department declined to comment on the case and said he did not know if any of the officers it cited had been disciplined or were being investigated lawyers who filed the suit say none of the officers has been disciplined these lawyers contend that the incidents , which included two shooting deaths , several broken bones , dozens of beatings , and chokings to the point of unconsciousness , are not unique to lynwood there are many officers who have taken it upon themselves to be the law enforcement agency , the police officer , the judge , the jury and sometimes the executioner , said george v denny 3d , the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in addition to seeking unspecified monetary damages , the suit requests that the lynwood sheriff s substation be put under court control it s clear that the sheriff of los angeles county and county officials cannot or will not assert the control that s needed , said patrick o patterson , a lawyer with the naacp legal defense and educational fund in los angeles , which is representing the plaintiffs together with the police misconduct lawyer referral service the mayor of lynwood , robert henning , expressed support for the sheriff s department and the deputies assigned to his city , which pays about 4 million a year for their services i think we have one of the best lawenforcement agencies that money can buy , said mr henning it s possible that out of all of this , we will find that someone has made an error in judgment , but i'm not going to condemn a whole organization simply because someone may have had a confrontation with the law in announcing their suit , several plaintiffs displayed photographs of their bloody faces , missing teeth , lacerations and bandages the suit lists more than 70 people as victims , including sandi leonard , william leonard s daughter , who displayed a picture of her father miss leonard , who tearfully described the events leading to the death of her 43yearold father , said she hoped the suit would result in an investigation although mr leonard was a nonhispanic white , most of the victims are black or hispanic their lawyers say minority and lowincome residents are more likely to be the victims of police brutality and misconduct they tell their deputies to go out and crack heads if necessary to make their presence on the street known , said mr denny darren thomas , the primary plaintiff in the case , said he had been choked and beaten and subjected to racial slurs after being arrested by lynwood sheriff s deputies for drinking beer in his front yard 'i just prayed' when mr thomas , who is black , asked the officers why he was being arrested , he said , he was choked twice to the point of unconsciousness while handcuffed , then revived with kicks and jolts from an electronic stun gun there was nothing i could do except just hope they would n't kill me like in so many cases , said mr thomas , who added that he did not fight back i just prayed that i would live through it
johannesburg , aug 22 factional fighting in black townships around johannesburg raged into a 10th successive day the police reported 100 more deaths today and overnight , raising the tally of dead beyond 500 in the 10day period the fighting continued in townships east and west of johannesburg despite an appeal for peace yesterday by the government and the leaders of two of south africa s tribal homelands , kwazulu and transkei the violence has prompted suggestions by political commentators that efforts to mold a new political order in south africa are imperiled 'great stress' for transition some antiapartheid commentators say they believe that the violence is putting the notion of a peaceful transition from apartheid under what one strategist with the african national congress called great stress fighting first flared last week as a blend of tribal , political and social rivalries crystallized into warfare township residents say the fighting pits members of the zulu and xhosa ethnic groups and supporters of inkatha , the conservative zulu organization , against backers of nelson mandela s african national congress the newest fighting east of johannesburg , in the township of vosloorus , was apparently set off by counterattacks against zulu migrant workers who had driven adversaries out of single men s hostels there last week similar clashes were reported overnight from kagiso township , west of here benefit seen for right wing as the bloodshed continued at levels unparalleled in south africa s long history of civil strife , commentators , and political experts said the main beneficiary of the fighting seemed to be rightwing white conservatives seeking to undermine president f w de klerk by persuading his white followers that his policies of negotiation and conciliation led only to mayhem and chaos the star , a major afternoon newspaper published here , carried a cartoon the other day depicting andries p treurnicht , leader of the rightwing , white conservative party , in feline guise as the cat that got the cream from the violence hostility between groups within black politics , the fighting has placed the african national congress and mr mandela in difficulty both the government and chief mangosuthu gatsha buthelezi , the chief minister of kwazulu and leader of inkatha , have urged mr mandela to meet chief buthelezi to talk peace but congress strategists argue that a meeting between mr mandela and chief buthelezi could divide the congress because of the deep hostility many of its followers bear toward the chief after three years of violence in natal province between partisans of the two groups that has claimed thousands of lives additionally , such an encounter could implicitly acknowledge chief buthelezi s claim to equal stature with mr mandela in negotiations on the country s future a status supporters of the congress reject because of chief buthelezi s position as the leader of a socalled homeland created by the policies of apartheid yet , by avoiding the encounter , mr mandela could open himself to charges that he is putting party politics above the loss of human life the violence has largely coincided with chief buthelezi s effort to transform inkatha from a zulubased cultural organization into a political party and to try to extend its influence outside its traditional base in natal however , none of the chief s adversaries has produced evidence to support their contention that he ordered the violence to obtain a place in negotiations on the country s future that have been conducted thus far between mr de klerk and mr mandela de klerk foresees meeting president de klerk said in a statement tonight that he believed highranking members of inkatha and the african national congress would meet soon to try to end the violence it remained unclear from conversations with congress officials if this meant mr mandela would meet chief buthelezi archbishop desmond m tutu of cape town , the anglican primate of southern africa , who cut short a visit to canada to return to south africa today , was asked by reporters if he would seek to mediate between the two men we need to be extremely careful , he said , because in the present climate a meeting just taking place which does not bring about the desired results could be quite disastrous in his statement tonight , mr de klerk said it was of vital importance that the congress and inkatha meet at a high level soon and said the situation demanded strong leadership from all sides fighting appears to widen as the debate unfolds about how the violence should end , the fighting itself seems to be widening in scope initially , it pitted hosteldwellers associated with inkatha and the zulu tribe against others associated with the congress and the xhosa tribe both ethnic groups number several millions the congress and some witnesses to the fighting have accused the police of siding with inkatha a charge the police and the government deny police officials say that their strategy is to contain zulu migrant workers within their hostels while preventing attacks on them by their adversaries in reality , this means that the migrants' adversaries have borne the brunt of police teargas and shotgun attacks possibly as a result , in the last two days , the police themselves have come under incrreasing attack with petrolbombs and other weapons in vosloorus today , police said they were attacked with assault rifles and petrolbombs at a police station when police opened fire with teargas and the attacking crowd fled , a police spokesman said , two sovietdesigned ak47 asault rifles were abandoned in soweto today , assailants lobbed a hand grenade into a police vehicle , killing one officer , police said later , the police said they had arrested a trained guerrilla fighter in connection with the attack photo zulu migrant workers armed with spears standing over the body of a friend who was killed in factional fighting in

for quite some weeks now , visitors to new york have been asking , what s new in the museums \? and what have they heard , all too often , from host and hostess alike \? oh , nothing much just the permanent collection so they decide that it s quite all right to give the museums a miss yet it is by the permanent collection , in the end , that every great museum is judged loan shows come and go , but the art that tells us who we are , and what we have made of ourselves , is the art that stays in town forever \( unless , that is , someone decides that now is the time to sell it \) every time we pay a call on those permanent collections , we check on the art but also and this may be even more important we check on ourselves if the art looks just the same as it did the last time round , there s something wrong with us there is also the fact , now more than ever topical , that in a huge miscellaneous museum like the metropolitan , or like the brooklyn museum , world events can give the art a whole new spin at a time when the middle east is with us day in and day out , the tiny alabaster head of alexander the great in the brooklyn museum has a whole new slew of meanings for us it is what it always was a tiny souvenir \( no more than five inches high \) of the great macedonian leader who had his way in greece , in the balkans , in persia , in syria , in egypt , in central asia beyond the oxus river and in northern india the brooklyn head does not present him as a stylized master of army after army , but as an informal and still very young man with his liquid eye pupil and iris are deepcut his disarrayed hair and his casual turn of the head , he has an irresistible presence we recognize him as a leader , but we also see in him the man who reportedly drew a line in the sand when he was just 24 years old , and marked out the future city of alexandria , in which hellenistic and jewish cultures flourished side by side we may also speculate that this particular little sculpture was made in the first century ad and owned by a moneyed egyptian who had it set in a metal diadem that stood for the rays of the sun daydreams of this sort do not either condone or \( still less \) diminish the dangers of what is now going on in the middle east , but they help to site them in a larger , older and more exalted context in battle , alexander the great was about as terrifying as a soldier can be , but he also knew the merits of conciliation and diplomacy and disinterested learning even more to the point , these days , are the islamic collections in the metropolitan museum of art had they been set up as a museum of their own , they would be as well known as the bargello in florence or dumbarton oaks in washington but in the met they have big competition at most a happy few turn to the left as they walk from the elevator toward the andre meyer galleries and what do the others miss \? to begin with , they do n't get to peer into the room , dated 1707 , that was once part of a town house in damascus it gives us literally , for once , an immediate orientation that orientation is owed to the hooded and filtered light , the anklehigh sofas , the sight and the sound of water on the move grandeur of proportion also plays a part that room is a complete environment , and one that speaks for an ancient metropolitan civilization that villainies may sometimes have been plotted in that penumbra cannot be excluded but there is something almost hypnotic about the calm , the order and the measured quotidian ritual of life in that house elsewhere , we are gently nudged toward a longer , subtler and wiser view of the islamic world than is now current the nudging is most often done in terms of objects that , though as a rule quite small , speak directly to us isfahan , for instance , has for some years been off limits to american travelers but the early17thcentury tiled mural from the royal gardens there has a calligraphic ease , a pristine white lightness and an unemphatic wit that win us over at once looking at the iznik dish of the same period , which shows us a group of bonewhite animals , all alert and all cunningly askew , we catch ourselves thinking that the background to their cavortings is made up of the most beautiful green in all art , past or present islamic art could excel on the grandest scale \( this critic regards the seventhcentury dome of the rock in jerusalem as one of the four or five most beautiful buildings ever built by human hands \) but in the met it has above all a confidential note never does the noonday glare intrude , and when we come to the leaves from the early16thcentury shahnameh \( or book of kings \) , we might almost think ourselves back in the former turkman library in tabriz it was in tabriz that iranian princely patronage brought the shahnameh into being , between 1515 and 1535 visitors to the met are free to settle into the individual chairs that are set out , one to each of the sheets as they sit there , they have the kind of oneonone experience that overwhelmed the young shah thamasp when he pored over the pages that had been painted for him by the best artists of his day wild were the fancies in question , and startling the color , and crisp the detail
what is the difference between polenta and cornmeal \? none they are exactly the same polenta , the italian term for cornmeal and for the cornmeal mush made with it , is derived from an ancient roman dish of the poorer classes , called pulmentum when corn arrived from the new world in the 16th century , it was substituted for cheap grains like millet that had been used to make the dish like the polenta that fed the peasants of northern italy , in america cornmeal sustained the early settlers and eventually , in the form of cornmeal mush or grits , became a staple in the rural south yellow and white cornmeal were widely used in baking as well today the fashion for italian provincial dishes has made polenta one of the many stylish starches on the american table fine restaurants serve it similarly , the interest in american regional foods has spurred a demand for cornmeal dishes like grits , cornbread , hush puppies and spoon bread at home , having some cornmeal on hand guarantees a quick and tasty side dish to serve with meat and poultry it can be prepared polenta style , like cereal , and simply seasoned with herbs or it can be cooled , cut into squares and reheated on the grill some spice and cheese give it an extra savory touch the polenta can even be made with milk and cream instead of broth or water , flavored with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms and baked unmolded , it then becomes an elegant first course or a side dish that s especially delicious with game herbed polenta total time 20 minutes 4 1 2 to 5 cups chicken stock 1 1 2 cups yellow cornmeal salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon minced fresh sage or 1 2 teaspoon dried 2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley 1 4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese 1 bring fourandahalf cups of stock to a simmer in a heavy saucepan add the cornmeal very slowly , stirring constantly the easiest way to add the cornmeal is to take handfuls of it and allow a very fine stream to pour from your slightly open fist when all the cornmeal has been added continue cooking the mixture , stirring from time to time , for another 15 minutes 2 season to taste with salt and pepper and stir in the butter and herbs serve at once the polenta can be held for up to about 20 minutes if you add the additional halfcup of stock and cover it reheat it gently , stirring constantly , then serve 3 serve with a generous dusting of the parmesan cheese yield 6 servings grilled polenta , santa fe style total time 20 minutes 2 tablespoons corn oil z cup chopped onion 1 fresh jalapeno , finely minced 4 cups water 2 teaspoons salt 1 1 4 cups yellow cornmeal y cup shredded cheddar cheese 2 tablespoons melted butter 1 butter an eightinch square baking dish 2 heat the oil in a large , heavy saucepan add the onion and the jalapeno and cook over medium heat about six minutes , until the onion is tender but not brown stir in the water and salt and bring to a simmer 3 slowly add the cornmeal to the simmering water in a thin stream , stirring constantly this is easily done by taking handfuls of the cornmeal and allowing it to pour into the pan from a slightly open fist 4 continue cooking the mixture until it is quite thick , about 15 minutes longer remove it from the heat and fold in the cheese spread the mixture evenly in a baking dish and allow it to cool to room temperature 5 shortly before serving heat a grill or broiler cut the cooled polenta into six equal parts remove them from the pan and brush them on both sides with the butter grill or broil the polenta until heated through and lightly seared on both sides serve at once yield 6 servings baked polenta and mushroom timbales total time 50 minutes 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms , finely chopped 1 cup milk 1 2 cup heavy cream 1 2 cup yellow cornmeal salt and freshly ground black pepper pinch sugar 2 tablespoons minced sundried tomatoes 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter 6 eggs , well beaten 1 butter six halfcup ovenproof ramekins preheat oven to 350 2 heat the oil in a heavy skillet , add the mushrooms and saute over high heat until they are lightly browned set aside 3 bring the milk and cream to a boil in a heavy saucepan remove it from the heat and add the cornmeal in a very thin stream , stirring constantly taking handfuls of the cornmeal and allowing it to stream into the pan from a slightly open fist is the best way when all the cornmeal has been added , stir until the mixture is thickened and very smooth 4 season to taste with salt and pepper stir in the sugar , sundried tomatoes , sauteed mushrooms , chives and melted butter stir in the beaten eggs 5 pour the mixture into the molds and set the molds in a pan with enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the molds bake for 30 minutes 6 unmold the timbales and serve them warm as a first course or to accompany roasted meats yield 6 servings drawing

grow more caring and more concerned , but perhaps more crotchety they may still be greedy , but they will once again pretend not to be so , two weeks into the 1990 s , our last decade before the millennium has been preprogrammed by trend watchers , advertisers , and futurologists not to mention the usual complement of pundits , psychics and science fiction buffs accustomed as americans have grown to marking their history by the moods of their decades , cultural historians and marketing experts say the next 10 years have come stripped to their vital trends like none before you 've just

i'm already sick of it as academic investigators trace it , the reasons for the deluge of decade hype seem to begin with the relatively weak sense of history in a country only 213 years old , and to end with the realization that the millennium is just 10 years away adding to which are booming industries of trend spotting and futurology to feed untold numbers of advertisers in growing stacks of magazines and evermultiplying television channels 'industry of fortune tellers' you have a growing industry of fortune tellers think tanks , futurists , the trend people and once people start

paarl , south africa , feb 11 when nelson mandela made his walk to freedom today , he did it with the same simplicity and command of occasion that made him a leader among millions of south african blacks when his imprisonment began more than 10 , 000 days ago at 4 14 pm on a sunwarmed day 27 years , six months and one week after his arrest on aug 5 , 1962 mr mandela stepped from the car that drove him to the last guard post at the victor verster prison from there , smiling gently , he passed under a raised barrier and flicked his right hand quickly out from his body in greeting he then raised his right arm several times in the bolder , black nationalist salute , his left hand holding the hand of his wife , winnie , and walked to the point where the prison entrance road abuts the highway running through the undulating wine country of the western cape 'no easy walk to freedom' it was a walk of perhaps 70 yards , through a corridor of policemen , and as he made it , mr mandela said not a word , at least none that could be heard by any in the crowd of 5 , 000 blacks and whites chanting his name but to those who have come to know mr mandela in the only way that was possible under the total ban that the south african government threw around the black leader in prison through his speeches and writings of a generation ago there was no mistaking the symbolism involved in beginning his life outside jail on foot about the time in 1961 when president john f kennedy was spending his first summer in the white house , mr mandela , then about the same age as mr kennedy , used a phrase that became the title of a book of mr mandela s speeches and writings the book has been passed hand to hand in dogeared copies among south africans , who were forbidden until today under censorship laws and statutes governing political prisoners to own any book by or about the black leader there was , mr mandela said , no easy walk to freedom for south african blacks after three centuries of white domination and repression dignified and resolute the nelson mandela who made his own walk to freedom today , after more than 22 years in the fortress prison on robben island , in the galeswept mouth of cape town harbor , and five more years in a series of other prisons , had hair that had turned to gray he looked at least 30 pounds lighter than he had at his last public appearance , in june 1964 when , with the physique of the heavyweight boxer he had been in his youth , he stood in the dock at the rivonia trial in johannesburg and acknowledged that he was guilty as charged of sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government but in other respects , the 71yearold black leader who emerged from prison today to the ecstatic salute of millions of his fellow countrymen and of much of the world seemed unchanged from the man whose closing address in his own defense in 1964 has become one of the central documents in the south african struggle as always before , he was erect and dignified , immaculately dressed in a darkgrey suit tailored for him in cape town during his closing weeks in prison and above all , he was resolute resolute in his opposition to any accommodation with apartheid , and just as resolute in his insistence that blacks in south africa have always preferred a peaceful settlement with whites to one rooted in violence no black man in south africa has had as wide an audience as mr mandela had tonight when he stepped to the microphone on the steps of cape town s victorian city hall , watched live by tens of millions of television viewers in countries including the united states , australia and japan , and , in a delayed but uncensored broadcast , on south africa s governmentowned television service it was an occasion mr mandela used to the full , beginning , in a strong , unquavering voice , with the first word he had uttered in public amandla ! meaning power in the xhosa language , the rallying cry of the black resistance since the speech at his trial need for armed struggle to anybody who wondered whether mr mandela had compromised during his three years of secret talks with the government , the black leader gave a blunt answer as in 1964 , he offered no compromise on the principle of majority rule , calling for the creation of a democratic , nonracial and unitary south africa perhaps most jarring to many whites , he said that the factors which necessitated the african national congress s resort to guerrilla attacks in 1961 , under his own leadership , still exist today , so that the congress had no option but to continue he also demanded what he called a fundamental restructuring of the economy , a phrase many whites will take to signal an intention to nationalize mines , banks and major industries but along with those strictures , mr mandela showed the same strong preference for a peaceful solution , the same appreciation for whites who are prepared to join blacks in dismantling apartheid , and the same confidence that his cause will triumph that he showed at his trial
washington , aug 2 the house today overwhelmingly approved legislation that would let airports levy a new tax on airline tickets of up to 12 on a round trip to help pay for improving and expanding the airports the tax , proposed by the bush administration , is the centerpiece of a bill that would authorize 177 billion in spending over the next two years to upgrade and operate the nation s aviation system and ease the growing delays at airports around the country approval of the bill came on a 405to15 vote earlier , by a vote of 252 to 171 , the house defeated an amendment that would have barred the airport ticket tax the tax faces considerable opposition in the senate , which has not yet acted on its version of the legislation with congress scheduled to depart for a monthlong recess at the end of this week , final action on the bill will not occur until sometime in the fall supporters of the levy asserted that since none of the proceeds would go to the treasury s general revenue , it was not a new federal tax but rather a user fee imposed at the discretion of airports but opponents , noting that congress has barred such airport levies since 1973 , said the public would not be fooled break of the dam on tax talk before you start washing your hands of this affair , remember that congress now prohibits airports from charging this fee , said representative douglas h bosco , the california democrat who sponsored the amendment aimed at blocking the passenger facility charge a couple of months ago people were talking about taxes in hushed tones but since the president s lips moved , we now hear a new tax being discussed every day this will be the first one we approve , 1 billion on consumers part of the money the legislation would approve for airport operations , maintenance and improvements would come from the airport and airway trust fund , which is financed by the existing 8 percent federal tax on airline tickets as well as by taxes on aviation fuel but the trust fund has a surplus of 76 billion , and house opponents of the new tax argued that it was outrageous to ask airline passengers to pay added ticket fees when money already earmarked for airport expansion and improvement was unspent promise to spend funds the bill s sponsors say they have assurances from committees responsible for appropriations that most of the trust fund surplus will be spent over the next five years to pay for airport improvement projects , including modernization of the air traffic control system after that , they said , the fund surplus would be only about 11 billion lawmakers on the house and senate committees that oversee aviation have complained for years that the surplus has been allowed to accumulate so that congress and the administration could use it to help mask the size of the federal budget deficit it s no secret that for years capital improvements at our airports have been grossly underfunded , said representative norman y mineta , a california democrat who serves on the house public works and trasportation committee s aviation subcommittee but consumers should not be asked again to pay for improvments when the moneies they 've already paid are idling away in the office of management and budget s version of a swiss bank account the house bill authorizes 85 billion to be spent over the next two years for aviation safety and security programs , which would allow for the addition of 300 safety inspectors and 495 air traffic controllers representative john porter , an illinois repubilcan , said his constituents would not complain about user fees for airport improvements what they complain about is overbooked flights , delays and safety compromises , he said broader policy reflected the debate on the taxing provision in many ways reflected the broader problem congress is facing on budget policy as it struggles to respond to longneglected domestic needs while trying to reduce the swelling federal deficit it also suggested that lawmakers might be willing to accept the political pain of approving tax increases if they could argue that the increases were dedicated to specific purposes in additon to proposing the airport user fee , the bush administration has called for increasing the current 8 percent federal tax on airline tickets to 10 percent that proposal , along with increases in gasoline taxes and new fees on stock transactions , are among many taxing options under consideration by white house and congressional budget negotiators in their search for ways to cut 50 billion from the deficit in 1991 no major airports have been built in the united states in the past 15 years , and sponsors of the legislation estimated that it would cost 10 billion a year to keep pace with growth in passenger traffic federal funding alone will not be sufficient to meet the needs of airport development , said representative glenn m anderson , the california democrat who heads the public works and trasnportation committee if you do not like sitting and waiting in crowded airports , you should not vote to block this fee photo since the president s lips moved , we now hear a new tax being discussed every day , said representative douglas h bosco this will be the first one we approve , 1 billion on consumers \( stan barouh \)
there is something extraordinarily uplifting about a bustling new york steakhouse the animated camaraderie of urban warriors back from corporate combat , the snappy pace of the staff , the aura of

least those men with a fondness for duck decoys , ornithological prints , brass lanterns , weather vanes and other americana by day , the upstairs dining room is bathed by sunlight filtering through skylights it is nice to see waiters who are over 27 years old and not aspiring to be the next kevin costner , and this place is full of such unassuming veterans for a place that churns out more than 700 meals daily , smith wollensky maintains a comfortable pace and soundproof ceilings keep the din lower than at many midtown bistros with 15 tables in his book the physiology of taste , jean anthelme brillatsavarin noted that in medieval times it was believed that a man s appetite was in direct proportion to his importance , and that a man to whom was served no less than the whole back of a fiveyearold bull was served his drink in a cup almost too enormous to lift by such measure , smith wollensky is a den of kings the steaks are grand , cooked as requested , but not always with the intensity of flavor one would expect from a place that dryages its own meat filet mignon au poivre is a blackened gilbraltar , mildly peppery , more notable for tenderness than for flavor similarly , the cajun rib eye , a special one evening , had no more punch than the timid filet au poivre , although the meat itself was pleasing the thick broiled sirloin has more character , darkly encrusted and with some hint of beefiness from aging other variations include sliced steak wollensky , with onions and mushrooms , and an occasional special called colorado rib eye , which is said to be aged for three weeks to give it a more pronounced flavor no one at my table could perceive any difference , though one of the most succulent veal chops i have had in a long time is served here , as are fat , rosy lamb chops hash browns are de rigueur , our waiter said , and they are good , nicely crisped and well seasoned not so the slightly greasy onion rings thick silverdollarsized cottage fries are an alternative the deepfried zucchini sticks are not bad , but they make for heavy going with either of the potato dishes and vegetables spinach or asparagus were devoid of seasoning smith wollensky

americans are now working longer and harder than at perhaps any time in this century we have to in order to compete with asians and europeans in the new global economy but while our work force is making great changes to meet the challenges of the worldwide competition , our school system is still largely mired in the ways of the past the result is that american students are , for the most part , faring poorly in learning competition with asian , russian and european counterparts unless american education improves , the economicdriven life style that we have enjoyed will continue to decline america will lose stature in the world as a desirable place to live , and multinational corporations will desert us for areas where skilled workers are more readily available the link between a better educational system and better economic conditions for our country is undeniable we need a more literate , clearthinking and trainable population if we are to continue to enjoy one of the world s highest standards of living all evidence , however , shows that the people graduating from our school system and entering the work force are ill prepared to handle job requirements a recent survey of business owners conducted by arthur andersen company shows that employers have great concern about finding qualified help when it comes to hiring technical workers , 47 percent of the companies in new jersey that responded to the survey said it was extremely difficult to find qualified people , while 36 percent nationwide responded similarly the survey also indicated that it was not much easier for employers to find semiskilled workers in new jersey , one of the most industrialized states in the nation , the illiteracy rate is astounding it is estimated that there may be as many as 800 , 000 adults who lack basic reading skills it is no wonder that our state s job growth prospects are dimming also noted in the survey was a great deal of dissatisfaction by corporations with the new jersey school system only 12 percent said it was good and 52 percent said it was poor to make up for the gaps in public education , companies are spending more and more money on remedial training for workers resources that should be going into research , new products and new markets are being siphoned off to pay for the job that public education should be doing historically speaking , this is an ominous change in american life perhaps never before have we asked so much of our education system the american way of life that we cherish so much was born in the industrial revolution of the mid19th century it was during that time , historians tell us , that america s economic efficiency was a direct result of our nation s commitment to education it was during that time that literacy in the united states became more widespread than in europe not coincidentally , it was also at that time that the indomitable american spirit of innovation led to new inventions and new processes that would make the american work force the best in the world in the battle cry of freedom , a book on the civil war , the historian james m mcpherson said that new england led the world in education facilities and literacy in the mid19th century more than 95 percent of new england adults could read and write in 1850 threefourths of the children 5 to 19 years old were enrolled in school nearly fourfifths of the american population was literate in the 1850 s , compared with just twothirds in britain and northwest europe and onefourth in southern and eastern europe without counting slaves , the literacy rate in the united states at the time reached 90 percent equaled only by sweden and denmark it was no wonder that america became the mecca for industrialization americans in the mid19th century recognized the value of education and committed themselves to it now , we still value education , but we do n't seem to want to commit ourselves to insure that we excel at it in new jersey and throughout most of america , the school day and year are relics of our agricultural roots children are educated now , in the postindustrial era , as if they were still needed to do summer planting and other chores on the farm the school year in new jersey is still just 180 days , a far smaller number than in japan , where the average student attends school 240 days a year undoubtedly there is far more for students to learn now than 50 or 60 years ago but the education hierarchy is not providing students with more time needed to master more information the average child in new jersey spends 5 hours 29 minutes a day in elementary school and that increases to only 5 hours 55 minutes in high school , when undoubtedly the students could easily handle more learning time innovation is the key to our state s and nation s economic future if we cannot solve today s problems , we will slip and america will become an alsoran in the world economy once prized for its success and innovation , the american school system has slipped dramatically innovation has been replaced by huge education bureaucracies that are resistant to change since becoming a new jersey assemblyman , i have offered numerous pieces of legislation affecting education , but none , i think , is more important than my proposal for the local elementary assistance program , or leap leap is simply a challenge to school districts to develop innovative and courageous plans to upgrade education at the elementary school level i want to see teachers and administrators stretch themselves and their students to their full potential , and to see if , for once , we can get the education bureaucracy to stop worrying about teacher contracts and start devoting energy to developing programs that will challenge students to learn faster at the recent new jersey school boards convention in atlantic city , i laid before that group a challenge to start improving education by coming up with a workable plan to extend the school year by

philadelphia , march 16 crack can overwhelm one of the strongest forces in nature , the parental instinct , specialists in drug addiction say as a result , some of them say , the united states is giving birth to a new underclass of disadvantaged youth like none seen before the maternal instinct gets blocked out because the only thing that matters is the addiction , said kate vandegrift , director of new image , a residential rehabilitation program here for women and their children the program , for homeless addicts , tries to reverse personal priorities , providing therapy , lessons on being a parent and time for 18 women and their 24 children to renew or create a loving bond sharon hoyle , a resident , wept for joy the other night at her daughter janine s 10th birthday party a tangle of balloons , flashing cameras , wriggling children and proud mothers only months ago , because of crack addiction , these same women were letting their children wither and in one case die from neglect on this night a year ago mrs hoyle got high on crack instead of giving janine a party or even a birthday cake i am proud of myself , mrs hoyle said i love you , janine told her mother rise in cases of children children s advocates blame the crack epidemic for more and more of the 22 million cases of child abuse and neglect that are reported to childprotective services each year a surge in the number of children reported to have died of abuse and neglect is also linked to crack the deaths rose by 36 percent , from 899 in 1985 to 1 , 223 in 1988 , the most recent year for which statistics are available , according to the national committee for the prevention of child abuse social service workers say many cases of child abuse never make it into official reports leslie b mitchel , the committee s senior research analyst , said in the early 1980 s , when we talked to childprotective agencies we used to hear that 30 to 40 percent of the reported child abuse and neglect cases involved substance abuse , and much of that was alcohol abuse now we are hearing anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of the cases involve substance abuse and much of that is crack cocaine some authorities on child abuse say that crack , like any addictive drug including alcohol , is just one symptom of a bigger social problem there is no place for children in the crack world , said dr marsha rosenbaum , a sociologist , but it s not crack so much as the other circumstances of poverty that lead to neglect and sometimes abuse dr rosenbaum and an associate , sheigla murphy , has begun interviews with 125 women who use crack in san francisco other specialists in treating addiction say crack threatens families more than other drugs do because it is widely available and has a stronger appeal to women than other drugs like heroin it does not have to be injected , and a single dose is inexpensive crack accelerating abuse dr elizabeth rahdert , a research psychologist in the division of clinical research at the national institute on drug abuse , said we know that it chemically impairs people s functioning so they ca n't make decisions , ca n't take responsibility for paying the rent or seeing that there is food on the table for their children we know that the drug is a powerful stimulant that creates high volatility , makes people lose control , become very tense and jumpy all of these things can lead to not thinking before you act , striking out , more rapid abuse addicted mothers are often single parents , and this can add to the stress of the family situation nine out of 10 men leave women addicted to drugs , said ms vandegrift , new image s director conversely , only one out of 10 women leave addicted men , she said an estimated 19 million men and 1 million women , almost all of childbearing age , use cocaine , according to the 1988 national household survey of drug abuse those figures , based on interviews with 8 , 814 people over 12 years of age by the national institute on drug abuse , include 282 , 000 men and 203 , 000 women who use crack stereotypes are dashed and crack use among women seems to be cutting across economic lines and in some cases dashing stereotypes surveys in pinellas county , fla , by dr ira j chasnoff , president of the national association for perinatal addiction research and education in chicago , indicate that slightly more pregnant white women in private clinics than pregnant black women in public clinics test positive for cocaine in urine samples nationwide , dr chasnoff estimated , as many as one baby in 10 , or up to 375 , 000 a year , are born with some illicit drug in the blood and particularly because of what crack does to these children and their parents , experts say , there is greater risk of abuse and neglect crack addicts are more susceptible to all stresses in the environment , and children become stressors , said dr rahdert of the drug abuse institute when you have infants and children fetally exposed to crack , they may be easily excitable , hyperarousable and do more crying so if the child is impaired and the mother or care giver is impaired , the situation is even more explosive and dangerous
louie louie may not be beethoven s fifth symphony but the bynow mythic cult adulation accorded this threechord rock archetype invites a brief comparison to beethoven this may seem a tad farfetched , but bear with me an uncontested artistic masterpiece like beethoven s fifth owes its status in the pantheon to two possible factors formalists believe that its worth lies inherent within it , instilled there by beethoven s genius , and that its subsequent reputation is merely the just accolades accorded by a grateful posterity the dominolike effect of a mighty compositional cause others argue that the work s reputation owes something \( few would go all the way and say everything \) to momentum , wherein the admiration of beethoven s contemporaries was merely echoed and augmented down the ages into an irresistible consensus and it owes something else to chance beethoven capturing the revolutionary , heroic spirit of his age and the music becoming a theme song for such heroism from generation to generation , not least in its opening fate motive being equated with the allies' victory signal in world war ii most reasonable people would choose a position in this ageold debate somewhere between those extremes the success of a masterpiece derives partly from its inherent worth , but also partly from the more unpredictable , volatile interaction of the work , its public and the zeitgeist so now let us consider louie louie after some prodding by bob greene in a 1988 column about the song , its composer , richard berry , opted for no comma prompted by rhino records' release late last year of volume 2 of what will probably become a best of louie louie series , since volume 3 is already promised \( threatened \? \) at the end of the volume 2 liner notes volume 1 came out in 1984 at this late date , 35 years after its composition , 27 years after the kingsmen , a deservedly obscure bar band from portland , ore , made it a national hit , and 12 years after it was chosen , reportedly by john belushi , as the centerpiece for the film animal house , louie louie lives on as america s primordial \( in more ways than one \) party anthem , the quintessential signature tune of rock as goodnatured sloppy excess its closest competitor is probably wild thing , but it s a distant second it is tempting to think that at every moment of every day , somewhere in the rocking world , a new band is launching into yet another version of louie louie that is partly because if a band can play anything , it can master the rudimentary technical fundamentals of this song but it s more because of its accrued associations of bacchanalian revelry , its malleability to a variety of approaches and its comfortable familiarity the first two rhino volumes offer 20 versions of the song , including that of the kingsmen and a recording by mr berry himself the selections range from versions that competed with the kingsmen in the song s eruption onto the national charts from the pacific northwest \( rockin' robin roberts , paul revere and the raiders \) to gutsy british pubrock \( the closest to the kingsmen account in spirit being that of the kinks , from 1965 \) to implausibly mellow song stylists \( the sandpipers , pete fountain \) to los angeles punk bashing \( eddie and the subtitles \) to russian rock sung in russian \( red square \) to the rice university marching owl band to the impossibles' hallelouie chorus , which is just what the title implies it s all genuine fun , even if certain aspects of the rhino compilations give one pause the albums were inspired by various california disk jockeys' louie louie marathons , which generated more than 300 separate recorded performances of the song mr greene , in his column on the song for esquire , says mr berry estimates there are more than 400 versions , and that some claim more than 1 , 000 next to those figures , a mere 20 looks kind of mingy one can also gripe that neither of rhino s two albums lasts longer than 30 minutes all 20 performances could fit easily onto a single cd , with room for several more none of which dampens one s enthusiasm for the song itself , or for rhino s archival efforts , or for the improbable affection in which this song is held by rockandrollers everywhere one can ferret out signs of societal decline in this admiration perhaps only troglodyte america , as a writer put it in last sunday s arts and leisure letters column , would have the debased taste to elevate to the pantheon a composition so defiantly dumb \( there were serious efforts made recently to proclaim it the state song of washington \) then again , it was n't so much mr berry s popsy original as the kingsmen s sloppily suggestive performance that made the song sound dumb their record owed much of its success to overwrought speculation about the lyrics' supposed salaciousness mr berry claims his words were n't salacious at all the singer is just a lonely jamaician sailor pining to a bartender \( louie \) about his girlfriend back home and that the kingsmen , however much they slurred the words and distorted his intended bouncy cheerfulness into heavyfooted barband rock , sang those words as he wrote them but as we know to this day , a little controversy sells a song better than most anything else one would like to think that somewhere buried in the basics of mr berry s song lies some sort of archetype , some rockandroll essence that the people in their wisdom discerned even if pundits and mr berry himself did not so maybe , just like beethoven even if it sounds a tad different , there is inherent esthetic value here , susceptible to appreciation and analysis by even the most hardhearted formalist but maybe the ultimate measure of an artwork s worth is the recognition accorded that inherent value by an adoring public photo the kingsmen , who made the song a national hit 27 years ago \( michael ochs archives \)
white plains the board of legislators reached a milestone last week as it approved the last of the three westhelp housing projects that county executive andrew p o'rourke had hoped would serve as a catalyst for community assistance to the homeless only three municipalities mount vernon , white plains and the town of greenburgh participated in the program , which was conceived by andrew m cuomo to help homeless families rejoin society while providing shelter for them but neither proponent saw the westhelp effort as anything but an unqualified success what we sought to do with westhelp was establish a model and to dispel the myth that local communities would n't cooperate , said mr cuomo , the son of gov mario m cuomo we challenged the conventional wisdom that no government would come forward because nobody wanted housing in their communities we found there are local officials who will accept the homeless if they are presented with an intelligent and workable plan longterm benefits praised mr o'rourke said that as the westhelp units come on line , they will be seen by local officials as replacing other types of housing that used to be available through federal programs he added that these new apartments will help improve longterm housing stock because the westhelp units revert to the communities one of westhelp s selling points is that the host community pays nothing for construction of the ushaped complex of twostory garden apartments , although the land may be municipally owned then after 15 years , the complexes are turned over to the municipality for use by elderly residents or city employees , who often cannot afford typical rents in westchester even as the spotlight began to shift from westhelp s twoyear struggle to provide interim relief for the county s homeless , the stage began to fill with other proposed solutions , moving from the transitional housing model to the more persistent problem of permanent affordable housing new ideas are proposed the new ideas are diverse , from an experimental program that places the homeless in permanent housing under closely monitored circumstances , to the county s filing a lawsuit against the state for failing to establish reasonable allowances for shelter perhaps the most ambitious plan to help solve the homeless problem will be unveiled this week , when mr o'rourke announces the makeup of a housing implementation commission , a 15member group of experts with experience in building mr o'rourke will also outline the tasks he wants them to fulfill , including the consturuction of 1 , 000 transitional units and 5 , 000 additional units of permanent affordable housing , not necessarily limited to the homeless the new thrust is action , implementing what the homeless commission came up with in its studies , mr o'rourke said the disbanded commission cited faults in county government , including an unwillingness at several levels to deal with homelessness there will be some rehab , some new construction , and we will be designating county land for some of the housing the fact that westchester is producing 300 units under the westhelp program is a remarkable accomplishment westhelp s first completed venture , a 46apartment complex on a quiet street in mount vernon , opened last december and has placed 16 families in permanent housing so far the second complex , for 108 apartments in a wooded area of greenburgh , has been approved by the board of legislators and construction is under way the final project , approved last monday , is the most elaborate in the program , consisting of two structures one is the purchase and renovation of the coachman hotel in downtown white plains to accommodate 110 homeless families , according to mr o'rourke 36 families on mamaroneck avenue the other is the construction of a more typical westhelp complex , this one for 36 families , on busy mamaroneck avenue , also in white plains the coachman , a oncestylish hotel on the post road , one block from mamaroneck avenue , already serves as a homeless shelter the debate that led to final passage of the white plains proposals extended over a period of weeks and underlined the frustration that both supporters and opponents of housing plans for the homeless have come to express in dealing with the problem 4 , 500 homeless in county westchester s homeless population is estimated to be 900 families , including 1 , 800 children , or a total of 4 , 500 individuals , many of them simply unable to pay prevailing rents , according to social service officials the opposition of legislator edward j brady , the thornwood republican , to the greenburgh westhelp project led to an internal struggle that ended in his ouster as chairman of the board in the debate over the coachman proposal , he said he had voted for the white plains project last year when mr cuomo said we could buy it for 4 million or 5 million now we 're told it will cost 24 million , mr brady said england had its great train robbery , the federal government has its savings and loan scandal and westchester has its coachman affair are we going to buy a hotel that an entrepreneur bought not many years ago for 800 , 000 , and put only 80 , 000 down \?
to the editor it was welcome to read of manhattan borough president ruth messinger s attendance at the east village s tompkins square park wigstock celebration in her sept 27 letter and her invitation to all to return each labor day for this annual event the event is welcomed by area residents and has become a larger success with each passing labor day what is quite disappointing , however , is that the borough president , as well as the mayor and city council member miriam friedlander , have completely failed to respond to the unacceptable conditions in tompkins square park every other day of the year at present a permanent encampment of 50 to 60 hardcore heroin and crack addicts resides in the interior sections of the park parks department workers report finding 20 to 40 used hypodermic needles on a daily basis in this the only new york city park that is not closed in the evening children using the recently renovated and otherwise outstanding playgrounds witness this contingent shooting up , smoking crack and at times fornicating during any hour of the day the borough president and the mayor have allowed these conditions to flourish , apparently fearing that any actions they take might be interpreted as antihomeless these concerns have not stopped the city from clearing similar tent cities from under the borough president s office , from riverside park and under numerous highway overpasses and piers such evasive leadership is a disservice to area residents and to homeless addicts living in the park real solutions are needed apparently , tompkins square park , a 10 1 2acre facility , has been chosen by our progressive administration to stand as a safety valve for the city s policy of removing the homeless from all other public places this is completely unfair and is destroying this community children are forced to grow up in totally unacceptable conditions , small stores are failing and the enforcement of laws has passed into oblivion the city has many problems , none of which will be solved by sacrificing tompkins square park my grandmother came to the lower east side from a communist country and my mother still lives here i have lived here all 33 years of my life and presently work in a local day care center , where one of our students was pricked with a used hypodermic needle found while playing in the park i am raising my children here as difficult as tompkins square park s present status makes that task we are hardly the yuppie scum so frequently depicted in the press accounts regarding the park my family and i would like to be able to use the park and be able to invite people , including the borough president , to tompkins square park every day of the year , not just labor day ! elizabeth acevedo new york , sept 28 , 1990
garberville , calif , aug 9 in the first use of activeduty troops to fight marijuana growing in the united states , a contingent of about 200 army soldiers , national guardsmen and federal agents have spent the past two weeks raiding clandestine marijuana gardens in the rugged terrain of the king range national conservation area the residents of southern humboldt country have responded with protests , complaining that the military convoys through their towns , the blackhawk helicopters over their homes and the camouflaged and armed guardsmen prowling the woods have made the war on drugs too much like real war in the operation , which ended today , the guardsmen and agents from the bureau of land management and the drug enforcement administration destroyed 1 , 200 plants producing potent sinsemilla marijuana and seized five tons of equipment used to maintain the remote guerrilla gardens no arrests of suspected marijuana growers were reported outdone by sheriff s department many residents and local lawenforcement officials say the twoweek campaign achieved paltry results at the cost of violating civil rights and environmental protection laws and bolstered an outdated image of the area as the center of america s illegal marijuana production this is so frustrating when the federal government comes in and spends enough money that would keep my operation going for three or four years , said sheriff david renner of humboldt county his team of five deputies , cooperating with the state s sevenyearold campaign against marijuana planting , destroyed over 3 , 000 plants in one day this week if the feds have the money for this kind of operation , sheriff renner said , they ought to give it to local law enforcement that is more effective and is truly responsible to local citizens their results speak for themselves , and they are not good sheri bell , a spokeswoman for the bureau of land management , which organized the federal effort , said the operation was designed to return the king range conservation area to its natural state and make it safe for public use we want to send a clear message that we will not tolerate illegal drug activity on public land , she said we want to reclaim king range for the people who own it ms bell said the government hoped to use the effort here as the model for similar actions on public land in other states where marijuana is grown calififornia presented the first opportunity for an operation of this magnitude with the help of the military , she said , though she acknowledged that the bureau had not received complaints about marijuana growing in the conservation area it is difficult to come up with a meaningful cost of the operation for example , the national guard said it spent 400 , 000 but emphasized that the money would have been spent in any case on other training exercises lawsuit and demonstrations the campaign has already prompted a civil lawsuit filed by some county residents seeking to bar the use of army troops for the domestic enforcement of antidrug laws and seeking to restrict lowflying helicopters over private homes a hearing was scheduled to be held friday in federal district court in san francisco county residents also demonstrated at the entrance to the campaign staging area , about 20 miles west of here they carried signs reading stop us military terrorism and waved american flags and giant plastic bubble wands , all to the accompaniment of the garberville marimba band while some area residents argue that many of the protesters favor the growing and use of marijuana , many protesters say they oppose drug use , including alcohol , but feel that the military tactics are an unnecessary escalation of the drug war life in the emerald triangle in the early 1970 s , this rural area of roughandtumble loggers and timber workers became a mecca for hippies and backtotheland homesteaders fleeing urban areas by the early 1980 s , the growing of marijuana on remote areas of private and public lands had become so bold and widespread that this town of about 1 , 500 people had been transformed into something from the wild west , the unofficial capital of the emerald triangle , as the growing areas of southern humboldt , trinity and northern mendocino counties quickly became known growers armed with automatic weapons with boobytrapped gardens became the central image of the area but much of the marijuana production has been eradicated as a result of local and state lawenforcement efforts that began in 1983 in the early 80 s california ranked first in the nation in marijuana production , according to federal drug enforcement administration statistics it has now fallen to sixth , with missouri ranking first but garberville residents say they believe the federal government chose their community as the first domestic target for a campaign of militaryassisted eradication because of the area s lingering image this has come just when things had settled down and this whole dope issue was going away , said ray raphael , a teacher and local historian who has written several books about the area it s like bringing up this old image people are upset about the area being trashed in the minds of the public they feel the government is out to get their whole culture tackling tough terrain but military officials say it was essential to involve troops and helicopters in the campaign because of the rough terrain
washington , jan 22 benjamin hooks , executive director of the naacp , said today that his organization would investigate the arrest of mayor marion s barry jr in response to widespread concern among black americans that the case was racially motivated mr hooks said he was concerned that the arrest of mr barry was part of a pattern of harassment of black elected officials by lawenforcement authorities but he said he had no evidence to prove that , and stressed that neither he nor the national association for the advancement of colored people was accusing president bush or his administration of any wrongdoing the bush administration , clearly sensitive to the political pitfalls surrounding mr barry s arrest , denied that it had played a role in the barry investigation administration officials also said the white house had not directed television appearances and newspaper interviews over the weekend in which the federal prosecutor , jay b stephens , portrayed mr barry s arrest as having a purgative effect on the political life of washington mr stephens , the united states attorney for the district of columbia , suggested that he might look favorably on a decision by mr barry to resign as mr stephens considers whether to press further charges against the mayor white house officials said they have stayed out of the barry case both because they did not want to interfere with a criminal investigation and to avoid any involvement in a case with such political overtones the white house and other federal agencies have been more involved in the problems of washington than previous administrations , largely because of mr bush s expressed concerns about the nation s narcotics problems have been intertwined with the soaring drug and murder rates in the capital national strategy soon after taking office , mr bush elevated the drug problem in the city to a position of prominence in his national strategy to combat drug abuse as that effort showed little tangible success over the months , the federal drugabuse chief , william j bennett , has criticized mr barry for not doing enough to combat drug abuse in his city mr bush and the republican party have been promoting a political rival to mr barry , maurice turner , a former police chief mr turner switched party allegiance last year and is now seen as the republicans' first real hope of breaking the democratic grip on washington s municipal government none of this adds up to a direct connection between the white house and a barry investigation , and there is no evidence that there is any such connection but mr stephens s comments last weekend and the remarks by mr hooks today brought to the surface an underlying current of suspicion among black americans who have accused republican administrations of using the justice department to prosecute black officials for political or racial motives democrats have also accused republicans of using corruption investigations as a tool for undermining democratic control of major cities mr hooks discussed mr barry s case in a telephone interview and in a brief appearance before reporters at the white house after he met with mr bush to discuss the federal investigation of recent bombings directed at federal judges and naacp offices in the south we have not come to the conclusion that the barry case was harassment , mr hooks said in the interview but we have to ask the question of why were they after him so strongly for six or seven years when there was no discernible evidence of malfeasance or nonfeasance out of all the hundreds of thousands of people who are alleged to use drugs in the district and a mammoth campaign is waged against one person , he said that person happens to be a black elected official of great prominence , so you have to ask , 'why is it that this person apparently is selectively picked out as the object of wrath' 'follow the evidence' attorney general dick thornburgh said federal investigators follow the evidence wherever it leads , regardless of position , race , party affiliation or other identifying factors in the strongest possible terms , he said , i want to emphasize that our policy is not targeted toward any race or any party , but is aimed at bringing to justice any public official who abuses his or her public position for personal gain mr stephens , a former deputy white house counsel under president ronald reagan who was appointed united states attorney for the district of columbia in march 1988 , has regularly briefed senior officials of the justice department of his investigation of mr barry and notified mr thornburgh in advance of his arrest mr stephens and other federal prosecutors have been working under a directive from mr thornburgh that stressed white collar crime and drug abuse as their two top priorities and the barry case fit into both but david runkel , mr thornburgh s spokesman , said the attorney general did not direct mr stephens to investigate mr barry other officials said there was no directive from the white house to investigate mr barry marlin fitzwater , the white house spokesman , said today the white house had not been briefed on the investigation or notified in advance of the planned arrest prosecutors in mr stephens s office briefed senior justice officials throughout the investigation , which began in january 1989 , and advised them of plans for the arrest mr thornburgh was informed of the arrest in accordance with justice department policy , and did not object , mr runkel said photo benjamin hooks , second from left , executive director of the naacp , said his organization would investigate the arrest of mayor marion s barry jr in response to concern that it was racially motivated mr hooks and

the national football league announced yesterday that its embattled drug adviser , dr forest tennant , had asked to be replaced by april 1 dr tennant made major contributions to the development of the league s drug policy , paul tagliabue , the nfl s commissioner , said in a statement the program implemented by commissioner pete rozelle in 1986 and modified for subsequent seasons has proven to be very sound tennant s integrity and competence had been questioned recently in reports by wjlatv in washington four days before the super bowl , roberta baskin , the station s consumer reporter , said that tennant s labs in west covina , calif , had poorly managed players' urine samples , with anonymity not being protected , and that there had been a disproportionate number of positive drug results for black players her report accused tennant of covering up positive results for three unidentified white quarterbacks an article in sports illustrated last july had arrived at many of the same conclusions concerning mismanagement 'no mistakes' i 've been in professional sports for seven years , tennant said last night by telephone from his west covina office you know how many times i 've been in court \? none no mistakes were ever made the reasons for leaving are that the board of directors of my clinics and i have analyzed the situation i do n't want to be a lightning rod or lodestone to people opposed to what i do last week , baskin charged that in 1988 , tennant had falsified the drug tests of tim richmond , a leading nascar driver , who was suspended but then subsequently reinstated after taking a second test richmond eventually sued nascar , the ruling body for stockcar racing , and the case was settled out of court richmond died of aids last year according to baskin s report , nascar had hired tennant solely to test richmond , whose lingering illnesses were believed to be drugrelated on thursday , nascar said it no longer had any relationship with tennant , who said the richmond drug test was the only one he had performed for nascar a matter of credibility after baskin s first report on the doctor , tagliabue was asked if the league s drug program was flawed and what its future was i cannot confirm that he will be in that role into the 90 s , tagliabue said i am concerned about the credibility of everyone in the nfl and will review everyone , including our doctors working in the drug program i am now searching for minority doctors who would be a part of the testing program it is one way to strengthen and broaden the program but the league had also continued to defend tennant , who is the executive director of community health projects , a group of 27 drugtreatment clinics tagliabue declined to be interviewed when asked whether the recent reports had led to tennant s departure , jay moyer , the nfl s executive vice president and counsel , said the timing is unfortunate but if he had resigned at any time after the super bowl story , it would have seemed that way the league did not announce a successor

working for the japanese inside mazda s american auto plant by joseph j fucini and suzy fucini 258 pp new york the free press 1995 jump start japan comes to the heartland by david gelsanliter 262 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 1995 one out of every four passenger cars produced domestically is manufactured by a transplant , a foreign , generally japanese factory sited in the united states in the 10day period ending may 20 , 1990 , vehicle sales of the big three general motors , ford and chrysler fell by about 900 a day compared with the same period last year , while transplant sales rose by about 2 , 000 a day lee iacocca wails the transplants are murdering all of us the british journal the economist has suggested that detroit s big three are as good as dead right now , and that the sooner they give up the ghost the better ironically , the transplants are here as a result of detroit s desire to check japanese competition fearful that quotas would shut them out of the american market , japanese auto makers decided that if they could not export their product they would export their production in doing so , they were once more aping the united states when europe and japan began to protect their postwar infant industries , american corporations hurdled the barriers by setting up transplants over there now the japanese \( and europeans , too \) are doing unto us as we did unto them that the japanese are here , then , should come as no surprise what is surprising is that they have been able to outplay the big three on the latter s home turf and that the americans are falling ever further behind two books working for the japanese by a husbandwife team , joseph j fucini and suzy fucini , on a mazda transplant , and jump start by a philadelphia journalist , david gelsanliter , on toyota , nissan and honda transplants try to tell why the invaders seem about to dethrone the once impregnable detroit dynasties neither book spends much time on design or quality , traits commonly perceived to be the japanese forte instead , the authors concentrate on culture , the distinctive japanese culture that makes it possible for a mazda plant , for instance , to turn out as many cars as an american plant and to do so with a work force that is 15 to 20 percent smaller than those of its american rivals mr gelsanliter applauds such performances , and sees this as the wave of the future in auto production the fucinis abhor the process as inhumanly oppressive , and darkly hint at minirevolts in the making but both relate management methods to the culture of japan culturally , japan is an extended family , ethnically homogeneous \( a biogenetic entity \) , while the united states might be called an intended family , demographically heterogeneous \( a geopolitical comity \) the former is collectivist and hierarchical the latter is individualist and egalitarian although neither is purely either , each is sufficiently different from the other to spawn its own managerial methodology in the factories , the contrary cultures express themselves as jit and what i would call jic for the japanese just in time and for the americans just in case under jit , there is no room for error and , the fucinis would add , no time to breathe under jic , allowance is made for human error and humane needs when an american worker , undergoing training for jit , asks about sick days , the answer is , you 're not supposed to get sick here and if he or she does , according to the fucini account , the stricken one is treated like a healthy worker the average workweek in the mazda plant is 60 hours when workers enter the plant in the morning they do not know when they will be leaving in the evening should a worker come up with a timesaving device , as encouraged to do , an additional chore is given the eager beaver to fill the unused minutes these and similar practices are characterized by mr gelsanliter as japan s attempt to reintroduce the protestant work ethic to the united states the fucinis see it as a return to the days of productionline tyranny , where the worker is a chaplinesque cog in a soulless machine though none of the authors say so , the japanese regimen is surely rooted in japan s overcrowded society 123 million people \( half the population of the united states \) crammed into an ungenerous land area the size of montana there is no room for error or internal bickering if a leader makes an error , he commits the modern equivalent of harakiri by retiring in disgrace elevenyearolds have been known to commit suicide for failing to earn the expected grade by the same token , a japanese worker in an auto plant , guaranteed lifetime employment , owes his or her life to the company and is expected , like an american athlete or ballerina , to go on with the show no matter the pain or the price in this spirit of socalled community , japanese management preaches consensus , a word that means different , almost opposite , things to americans and japanese here , it means an agreement reached among peers , even if the boss is recognized as primus inter pares in japan , language and custom preclude any such egalitarianism every pronoun carries an explicit declaration of where the speaker stands on the social scale in relation to the person who is being addressed every greeting is confirmed with bows whose depths indicate the rank of the parties in the japanese family called the company , the boss is papa
san francisco , april 9 a new treatment can significantly reduce the death rate of patients who go into shock from bacterial infections , potentially saving tens of thousands of lives each year , a research report to be released this week shows the results appear to be an advance on findings reported in september for a similar drug in addition to the significant benefit to public health , the results could be a boon for centocor inc , the biotechnology company that has applied for permission to market the drug centocor , in malvern , pa , has been about six months behind the xoma corporation of berkeley , calif , in the race for what could be the next major drug produced by biotechnology but xoma s drug reduced the death rate only in patients treated early , before the infection had brought about the shock that often leads to death a partial summary of the results indicates that centocor s drug had reduced mortality among patients in shock it will have a substantial impact on the credibility of centocor , said mark j simon , biotechnology analyst with robertson , stephens company in san francisco but other analysts cautioned that it was difficult to evaluate the results until they were fully reported centocor officials have said they expected strong results , and the company s stock has risen significantly in the last three months these drugs will be the first important ones for both centocor and xoma analysts say combined sales of the drugs , which could both be approved by the end of this year , could reach several hundred million dollars a year medical authorities estimate that about 400 , 000 cases of such bacterial infections occur each year in the united states , mostly among hospital patients , and result in 50 , 000 to more than 100 , 000 deaths the most common type of infection involves gramnegative bacteria , which produce powerful poisons known as endotoxins either the bacteria themselves or the toxins can leak into the blood because of surgery , abdominal wounds or contamination of tubes inserted into blood vessels that usually leads to a fever and could result in septic shock both xoma and centocor have developed socalled monoclonal antibodies aimed at neutralizing the endotoxins monoclonal antibodies are specific forms of the agents the body usually uses to fight infections but while xoma s antibodies are made in mice , centocor s are made from human cells these drugs are not a treatment for the toxic shock syndrome associated with tampons the results of the clinical trials involving centocor s drug will be presented may 5 at a meeting of the american federation for clinical research in washington an abstract of the paper will be published tuesday in the journal clinical research the description provided by the journal said the study involved 200 hospital patients with gramnegative bacteria in their blood of that group , 49 percent of the patients treated with the placebo had died by the 28th day after treatment while only 30 percent of those treated with the antibody had died , a statistically significant reduction in mortality of 39 percent among those who had advanced to shock , the mortality rate was 42 percent lower for the group that had been treated with the antibody than for the control group the summary does not say whether this result was statistically significant none of the patients developed antibodies against the drug or had a serious allergic reaction to it the test of xoma s drug found a reduction in mortality of 46 percent after 14 days , but only for those patients who had not yet advanced to shock dr patrick j scannon , the president and director of science at xoma , said it would not be proper to directly compare the studies until more details are known of the centocor work he said centocor s analysis appeared to apply only to patients in whom the bacteria were actually found in the blood but doctors cannot wait a couple of days to see if there is bacteria in the blood , he said moreover , he said , centocor s definition of shock might have included patients not as sick as those xoma defined as being in shock
miami the central mission of us intelligence is to gather and evaluate data on the economic and military strength of the soviet union in comparison with the us we are now discovering how the cia has botched that assignment throughout the 80 s , our analysts clung to the notion that the soviet economy was more than half as large as our own , and that 15 percent of its budget was devoted to arms that was the bedrock estimate on which most other projections and our own defense planning was based a handful of outside experts began to dissent from the official view in 1985 led by henry rowen of stanford \( now with defense \) , charles wolf of the rand corporation , the russian emigre igor birmin and the swedish economist anders aklund , the dissenters drew on startling gorbachev admissions to arrive at a wholly different conclusion growth had stopped in the soviet union as the 80 s began this meant that its economy had shrunk to less than a third the size of ours , and the percentage of soviet national product spent on armaments had become an unsustainable 22 to 25 percent \( each dissenter came up with a different percentage , but all differed from the cia on the essential points that the soviet economy was disasterbound unless drastic arms cutbacks began right away \) when this disagreement was bared in this space two years ago , director of central intelligence william webster not an uptight fellow invited a couple of us to an ontherecord lunch at langley i outlined the views of the new thinkers and called for appointment of a team b the cia economists politely held their ground as we left , i stole a cia ashtray and left behind a new york times mug director webster called it a fair exchange in more ways than one the discussion was duly recorded in a column the cia economists' contrary views were expressed in a letter to the editor from the staff of the joint economic committee of congress , which has become a cia publications outlet here we are in 1990 one side operated on shoestrings , the other on billions which proved right \? the answer is evident in the cia s catchup analysis the soviet economy stumbles badly in 1989 is the title of director webster s recent report to his joint economic receptacle it is as if the decadelong decline long ago divined by the unappointed team b had mostly taken place in the past 12 months the agency belatedly discovers that the soviet union is in near crisis and might soon be pushed over the edge into sharp deterioration its assessment of the pressure on mr gorbachev reads like a rehash of judy shelton s 1989 the coming soviet crash with an update from wellesley prof marshall goldman s excoriation of gorbanomics in the latest foreign affairs magazine a few days after this cia epiphany , a trio of reformist soviet economists came over to tell an american enterprise institute conference headed by nonteam b s nicholas eberstadt how it really is oleg bogomolov , who serves in the congress of people s deputies , said that soviet military expenditure was 20 to 25 percent of gnp , contrary to the cia s lowball 16 percent viktor belkin , also a gorbachevite , said that soviet output was about onefourth that of the us , not nearly the half that the cia still estimates these soviet economists disagree with the official figures put out by their establishment , just as our outsiders dispute cia estimates however , the cia is hustling over to the conclusion reached by the outsiders about the economic crisis forcing the soviets to reduce arms spending to avoid admitting egregious error , the cia will gradually revise its underlying estimates in future years to jibe with present conclusions does n't this huge miscalculation cry out for oversight \? economic intelligence has none the senate intelligence committee defers to a joint economic subcommittee on these matters , and its dovish chairman , jeff bingaman , is putty in the hands of the cia in the national security council , the posterior coverage of the misguided evaluation is handled by former spook robert gates and the president s foreign intelligence advisory board is being limited to technological kibitzing as the bay of pigs was to intelligence operations , the extended misreading of the soviet economic debacle is to intelligence evaluation yet this fiasco is ignored and concealed even as the future cia mission must be redirected toward realistic assessments of economic and scientific strength
after the los angeles lakers came down harder on the knicks last night than any other opponent this season had , stu jackson , the new york coach , uncharacteristically came down on his team even harder instead of meeting with the members of the news media , as he has done , win or lose , in the previous 37 games this season , jackson , whose team lost by 11897 at madison square garden , made a strong statement berating the club he then returned to the dressing room , refusing to answer any questions obviously , i 'd like to make this very brief , jackson said out there tonight obviously we got beat by a much better basketball team i thought our effort and execution of what we had to do offensively , i would term as highschoolish we did n't play very well i can say quite frankly that i'm very proud to coach these guys individually but right now we are not very good there are a lot of things we need to straighten out fortunately , it s the midway point of the season and we have some time to do it the knicks' fourth consecutive loss , with the 21point deficit , was their worst of the season they were beaten by 15 points by the celtics in boston on dec 6 the knicks will now play their next three games on the road against the utah jazz , the denver nuggets and the boston celtics 'will show the character' this will show the character of our team , trent tucker said , referring to the trip we 'll either come together and turn it around or we 'll take a nosedive none of the knicks would elaborate on the reasons for their coach s anger their play spoke loudly , though , as they failed to get back on defense or execute their plays it was only the second home loss for the knicks in 19 games but the lakers , whose 299 record is the best in the national basketball association , had a lot to do with it , playing the game the way it should be played offensively and defensively the lakers went into the game worrying about patrick ewing and did a better job than any team so far this season in containing the knicks' 7foot center they put two and three men on ewing every time he got the ball and dared the knicks to shoot from the outside the knicks did and missed they shot 43 percent from the field ewing managed to get off 16 shots before jackson removed him early in the fourth period few of the shots were on the inside , where he is most effective more were from the outside he made only 4 and had 12 points it was the second consecutive game in which ewing , the league s third leading scorer , had been double and tripleteamed by the opposition the chicago bulls did it sunday and ewing completed only 5 of 17 shots with 16 points this is no time to jump off the boat , ewing said we have to keep this in perspective they did everything they needed to do they came out of the gate fast and we just dug too deep a hole to come back when i got the ball , it seemed like they had five guys on me that was the idea our strategy was to put two or three men on patrick and let some one else beat us , said magic johnson , who was needed for only 29 minutes to do his damage with 13 assists and 11 points ewing hit 1 of 7 shots in the first quarter , after which the knicks trailed by 3016 he was 2for13 at halftime , and the lakers led , 5741 it was not that the knicks were not getting their shots but they were taking them from too far out , and when they missed , the lakers were there to rebound the ball with a c green grabbing 14 , the lakers outrebounded the knicks , 5037 , in the game the lakers also got most of the loose balls because they fought for them and the knicks did not jackson tried most everything to get the knicks out of their doldrums , but nothing worked , not even by playing rod strickland 26 minutes and mark jackson 15 jackson was 0 for 5 with only 3 assists but then the knicks , who were led by charles oakley s 15 points , had only 22 assists byron scott , who had been a slump until he scored 12 thirdquarter points in the lakers' victory over the detroit pistons on sunday , led los angeles with 18 photo patrick ewing of the knicks passing off as he was hemmed in by the lakers' magic johnson , left , orlando woolridge and vlade divac in the second half \( nyt g paul burnett \)
like dozens of his black fraternity brothers gathered in a hotel on detroit s waterfront , greg ferguson worried about the end of a way of life he had just come to know after weeks of physical and mental tests , he became a member of omega psi phi fraternity last year because of sweeping changes being made this fall in the way black fraternal organizations will chose and induct their members , mr ferguson may literally be the last of a line over the years , the omegas , as well as some of the other seven major predominantly black fraternities and sororities around the united states , have developed a reputation for permitting their pledge practices to become peculiarly abusive , crossing a line into what is commonly referred to as hazing for decades , violence and humiliation have been part of pledging , for fraternities and sororities of all colors in recent years , hazing has also sometimes proved fatal a troubling convention yet mr ferguson , a 21yearold junior at tuskegee university in alabama , is troubled by what he learned at his fraternity s national convention in detroit late this summer all the black fraternities and sororities have endorsed a plan , starting this semester , that would not only abolish hazing but also remove the possibility of it by ending the generationsold tradition of pledging itself we want to remove any and all opportunities for someone to misunderstand , said darryl matthews , director of marketing and membership for the alpha phi alpha fraternity none of the major black fraternal groups will further tolerate even the slightest attempt to harass prospective members , physically or psychologically , he said violators could face expulsion from the groups , he said all this troubles mr ferguson how can you accept somebody wholeheartedly into your sacred group who does n't pass your tests , whatever they may be \? asked mr ferguson , the omegashaped symbol of his fraternity branded into his muscular left bicep he compared the rigors of pledging to that of a tribal rite of passage some african boys endure before they are deemed men by the village elders what they are trying to do is change the whole fraternity , he complained ways to humiliate the decision to end pledging comes as hazing has been coming under increasing attack by parents and college administrators and the national leadership of the black fraternal groups has been looking for ways to polish the tarnish off their traditional image of scholarship , leadership and service in the last 20 years , pledging for thousands of black college students has come to mean voluntarily being kicked , slapped or struck with oversized wooden paddles painted in the fraternity s colors and coat of arms along the way , there have been broken bones and teeth , torn flesh and bruises of body and spirit a tennessee state university student died of alcohol poisoning in nashville after being forced to drink through the night of his initiation a morehouse college student with a congenital heart defect died after being struck and harassed during a prepledge session in atlanta there is no reason that belittling an individual should be the criterion for membership into any organization , said daisey wood , president of the national panhellenic council , an umbrella group for more than 800 , 000 blacks who belong to the country s eight major black fraternities and sororities we have seen abuse and death and lawsuits that were literally draining the national organizations' ability to exist back to their roots ms wood said that in lectures and seminars across the country she reminded black fraternities and sororities of their roots we were founded because white people would not allow us in their fraternities and sororities , she said what we needed in the early 1900 s was something to bond us together initially , we were student groups looking for camaraderie and networking and a sense of belonging she suggested that some members began to attach too much importance to how one got into the organization , rather than what contribution the groups could make for weeks , sometimes almost an entire semester , black pledge periods have required that prospective members shave their heads , eat dog food , walk through campuses in regimented lines and carry painted bricks , boxes and wooden shields at all times they are to defer to the whims of their big brothers or big sisters in one case , a big brother insisted that half a dozen students wash his car in a snowstorm in another instance , during hell week , students were blindfolded and told to run around a field with all their might , guided away from trees and fences by the voices of their big brothers an origination in rage \? no one seems able to say exactly when hazing became a distinguishing aspect of black fraternal life ms wood said she thought it began in the 1960 s during the modern civil rights movement people were feeling things they could not understand or explain to themselves , she said , adding that some young blacks were filled with a rage that turned inward
baghdad , iraq , sept 5 so many people would like to talk to you , she continued i would like to talk to you but bad things would happen people disappear a time for silence in the old part of the city , in the maze of alleys of the traditional marketplace , merchants offering spices and candles and bolts of cotton and silk fell silent when a shopper s questions shifted to subjects broader than the asking price and the best price in the crowded passageways , filled with fragrant scents and the hum of treading , murmuring legions , a man in a turban and his far more prevalent counterparts in sport shirts and slacks rarely made eye contact with an american reporter sometimes though , silent men would lean close when a merchant spoke to the reporter and more than once roughlooking men stared when notes were jotted on a tiny slip of paper this week , a middlelevel goverment official was rambling on about the greatness of the hussein regime when he noticed that notes were being taken and stopped short do n't put my name down , he blurted they would kill me the hanging days in baghdad , that kind of statement is not hyperbole a diplomat with long experience in baghdad cautioned reporters against trying to talk to iraqis on the streets it may be the last thing they do in their lives , he said diplomats , who are generally kept at arms length from the secretive government , said they did not know how many executions occurred annually in iraq but they said mondays and thursdays are designated as hanging days in the prisons last spring , an arab journalist working for a british newspaper was accused of spying and was hanged by iraq baghdad , which has risen up from the desert , is a visually discordant city in tones of beige , covered with blocklike , sandcolored houses and lowstanding apartment buildings and dotted with new steel and glass towers mosques with beautifully tiled domes and minarets are scattered in every neighborhood and five times a day the wail of the muezzin calling believers to prayer echoes across the city there seem to be no rules about billboards and signs some buildings and ironwork balconies are plastered with metallic squares and rectangles announcing this law firm or that dentist in flowing arabic script streets crowded with cars stately rows of bushy date palms and shaggy eucalyptus trees provide shade over much of the city , which these days is unvaryingly clutched in daytime by dry , uncomfortable heat , well beyond 100 degrees in the evenings , when it is cooler , iraqis like to gather at little lanternlit cafes on the banks of the tigris and share platters of fresh fish grilled over open pit fires iraq holds the world s second largest reserves of oil after saudi arabia , and the boulevard that follows the meandering route of the coffeecolored tigris through the city is crowded with latemodel japanese cars and orange and white taxis and the occasional big red doubledecker bus , looking as if it had strayed from london stores along the main business streets and stalls in the modern arab market are filled with french and english perfumes and aftershaves but iraq s own shoes and stiff , rough fabric suits are being sold here rather than fancy and expensive designer things from abroad iraq may earn a lot of money but it cost more than 100 billion to battle iran for eight years and the nation has accumulated a foreign debt of 60 billion still , the socialistoriented government recently finished a big hospital building program and there are several universities free education and free health care are among the innovations of mr hussein a cause for pride a lot of iraqis actually like saddam hussein , a diplomat said he s improved life for many people and he s taught them to be proud they won a war now they 're defying a superpower it looks like they can do anything they want as a nation and no one can stop them baghdad does not look very much like a city preparing for war there are no tanks on the streets and not many soldiers the few in sight , wearing black berets and carrying sovietdesigned kalashnikov rifles , are generally posted around the edges of strategic traffic circles some soldiers strolling among the shops today said they had taken their usual periodic leave , suggesting that the armed forces are not on their highest level of alert the signs of war show best on the roofs of some tall and important buildings in the heart of the city they bristle with antiaircraft batteries there are antiaircraft emplacements along the river , too , and at the saddam international airport the city is sprinkled with pictures of mr hussein every office and nearly every home has a portrait and he pops up all over town in dark business suits , steel helmets and military parade dress with ribbons and awards stacked across his chest in the jauntiest of the photographs , he is shown in the lobby of the ministry of information wearing a tropical straw hat and white sport shirt and looking as if he had just come off a cruise ship in nassau 'martyr warriors' honored in the basement of a fanciful four to fivestory turquoise dome that stands split open to the heavens in tribute to iraq s martyr warriors is the saddam hussein museum , which holds displays of childhood pictures , old army uniforms and the details of his life at one of the more striking war monuments , a larger than life bronze iraqi airman stands triumphantly atop the actual wreckage of an iranian jet fighter that was shot down over baghdad during the long war across a courtyard , a portrait of president hussein , this time in beret and dress blouse , smiles at the pilot there are four arabiclanguagae newspapers in baghdad , one englishlanguage daily , two television channels and a handful of radio stations all are run by the government and none let much news get past them to the people of iraq the nightly news is broadcast in arabic , english and french in identical 10minute segments for each language but they are difficult to catch because they do not always come on the air at the same time
stefan edberg , the world s new no 1 tennis player and for the longest time the most prolific shrinking violet on the men s tour , swiveled and swayed on the first tee of the fresh meadows country club last week as he got set to play host to a celebrity golf tournament edberg , who had never before been an emcee and appeared on the verge of having second thoughts about this debut , looked as if he were seeing a ghost and not a green on the horizon but there he was , with a nervous smile plastered to his face , three television networks in tow , and more than 50 , 000 to be raised for a children s charity at north shore hospital when you 're the best in the world , there s nowhere to hide , said edberg s agent , ivan blumberg , who has been tempted to do a doubletake while watching this most reticent and uncontroversial of sports stars make a slow , smooth segue into tennis s most visible role but if winning wimbledon and becoming no 1 in the world does n't make a person confident , not much will , blumberg said edberg has slipped into the role of the world s no 1 player and found that it fits him like a pair of pajamas he is , for the first time in his professional life , completely comfortable with himself encountering nothing in the mirror to inspire pessimism , he is taking a novel turn at being his own biggest fan his tennis and his brow are wrinklefree even the limelight seems less intrusive at selective moments , he has let down his guard , made a spontaneous quip , allowed a smile to crack the stony exterior his longtime coach , tony pickard , calls the mask he has won 11 million this year , and is the topseeded player in the united states open , which begins today , and his stint as king of the mountain has already brought a new perspective all those aggravations of tennis celebrity that once cut into him like so many voodoo pins the promotions , the autograph sessions , the handshakes , the chitchat , the interviews seem manageable now he 'll never be a backslapper or a soulbarer , but he has discovered that he does n't have to turn his back on the public after match point in order to relax maybe i did n't believe in myself enough before , he said of his altered outlook i'm not trying to create a new image for myself , i always try and keep it simple , but i am learning how to enjoy certain things a little more which is not to say that edberg , who describes himself as a worrier , has turned juggernaut overnight for edberg , the prospect of making a public display of his golf skills was so daunting that he went off to hilton head for a crash course in making par on the rainy day before it , still anxious about his swing , he needled pickard about accompanying him to a driving range each time there was the merest pause in the showers pickard , however , was n't about to let his protege catch pneumonia in pursuit of a pretty tee shot so when his moment on the tee finally arrived , edberg , with the same furrowed brow he takes onto the tennis court , promptly shanked his drive out of bounds and out of sight over a nearby roof all that was missing from the moment was the tinkle of breaking glass but the emcee did n't falter and did n't fail his foursome he did n't smile , either , but gaping grins are n't edberg s style i'm not out there to smile is an edbergism that crops up often in postvictory news conferences edberg also did n't try to snap his driver over his knee the only time he ever attempted to inflict harm on a tennis racquet , it refused to break i was 13 or 14 and i lost a match and got so mad i took my aluminum racquet and smashed it against a concrete wall , but it did n't hurt it , said edberg he then tried , unsuccessfully , to drown the racquet in the shower this time he calmly palmed the ball tossed to him by his companion , annette olsen , and peppered his second attempt straight down the fairway to a smattering of applause we were playing a scramble format , but we actually used a few of my shots later on , he said the other day at the norstar hamlet challenge , where he assumed a more familiar role as the topseeded player in a tournament he won yesterday i was supposed to enjoy hosting the golf , and i really did , he said , sounding somewhat surprised being no 1 , besides coming as an immense relief , has brought its attendant obligations , none of them favorable to a player with the personal habits of a recluse and the oncourt manner of a vaudeville straight man it s like when you 're playing cards and you do n't want anybody to know what you 're thinking , it s keeping your poker face , he said with a smirk of contentment at producing an adroit metaphor in the past , the 24yearold swede labored to stay away from the limelight , playing out his own version of tennis s j d salinger i do n't want people knowing everything about me , said edberg , whose home base is a london penthouse where olsen keeps things orderly and does the cooking when even a trip to a restaurant seems like too big a concession i'm not out to create an image for myself i like to keep things simple edberg admits he does n't clean , does n't like clutter , and only cooks under duress he would rather play a round of golf or squash , or take in a movie , than linger over a meal

dancedrama other than the kind customarily identified with antony tudor s ballets was the order of the evening on thursday when american ballet theater presented its first alltudor program of the season the announced bill at the metropolitan opera house included the leaves are fading and the season s first view of dark elegies and gala performance but an hour before the curtain went up , ricardo bustamante suffered a back injury at the met and was unable to go on in a major role in dark elegies the ballet was replaced by tudor s jardin aux lilas , which was passionately led by leslie browne and kevin mckenzie , superbly attesting to what adrenalin can do when no rehearsal is possible they had not danced the ballet together in years in the best showmustgoon tradition \( three corps members were called in from home and principals in the other ballets were rounded up for roles they danced earlier in the month in jardin \) , none was a better sport than ross stretton , pressed into service again in tudor s original part as the man she must marry in jardin the catch was that mr stretton had given what was announced as his final performance as a dancer on tuesday night as prince desire , partnering cynthia harvey , who was making a debut in ballet theater s current production of the sleeping beauty had he not stepped into what is basically a partnering and dramatic part in jardin , mr stretton would have left new york audiences with the image that defined his dancing at its best by type and temperament , mr stretton is a danseur noble he was trained in his native australia , and joined ballet theater in 1981 the eloquence of his line made him a model of a classical dancer , but the princely bearing he showed off again on this occasion also served him wonderfully in george balanchine s neoclassical ballets at the end of the sleeping beauty , miss harvey received a huge bouquet and laid it at mr stretton s feet while he turned and bowed to the company , in which he will now serve as assistant to the directors miss harvey , dancing securely with this kind of partner , made an impressive showing in this version of beauty , staged by sir kenneth macmillan her experience in polishing the role of princess aurora with the royal ballet in britain , once directed by sir kenneth , was obvious parts of her performance appeared studied or overcoached , as in the rose adagio , but it was the right kind of coaching this aurora was fun , imbuing the musical climaxes with an exultant phrasing when necessary and more persuasive as each act progressed if mr stretton was the troubled idealist prince in the vision scene , mr bustamante , a new prince on wednesday afternoon , came across fascinatingly as a worldweary decadent in act ii and danced in act iii with the fiery classicism that distinguishes his style christine dunham led the ballet for the first time in new york city as aurora and was basically miscast less an allegro dancer than a lyrical one , she offered a workmanlike performance that needed more suppleness and fluidity as a whole , the production has become more dramatically coherent , bringing into relief several delights among them are the little boys in the entourage of carabosse , the wicked fairy , who rock with glee at her revenge and then fight to avoid being blinded by the lilac fairy , the bringer of light the children are aaron forste , anthony dunlap , eric otto , steven ruane , richard collins and james carmichael in the tudor program , mr mckenzie and amanda mckerrow offered a rapturous performance in the leaves are fading , an everrich choreographic outpouring to dvorak the prokofiev gala performance from 1938 now looks somewhat obvious in its parody of ballet conventions tudor was satirizing the ballet of his time and today s dancers , unlike the stars of the past , are at a disadvantage miss browne was funniest of all as the scenerychewing russian ballerina , susan jaffe was fine as the marblelike italian diva and claudia alfieri , new as the french dancer , was nicely coy ethan brown and johan renvall were their hapless partners everyone is unhappy in jardin aux lilas , where tudor , hearing the surging emotion in a chausson score , married off a young woman to an older man while the latter s mistress and the heroine s lover were abandoned martine van hamel , as mr stretton s mistress , joined mr mckenzie and miss browne as the lovers for a performance that was off and running from the start miss browne flung herself from a pirouette toward mr mckenzie s arm when he had barely stepped out of the wings everything was on edge , in the best sense photo cynthia harvey and ross stretton in the american ballet theater s production of the sleeping beauty \( american ballet theater \)

a measles epidemic at the university of maine in orono has caused a division i hockey league , hockey east , to relinquish boston garden as the site of its tournament next friday and sunday the semifinal and final games will be played at campus sites instead the tournament began with firstround games at boston college , maine , providence and boston university although none of the maine players is ill or has been knowingly exposed , the problem is one of crowd control if secondseeded maine , for example , was to play on topseeded boston college s home ice for the championship on march 11 , spectators might have to be limited to those 34 years of age or older and those who have proof of measles inoculations such an arrangement at the vastly larger boston garden would be difficult to implement
prague in this , the most hopeful of prague springs in 22 years , life moves at a giddy pace , even if toward uncertain destinations the revolution of recent months has brought changes everywhere , and changes have created choices where none before existed it is curious theater , watching a country so unfamiliar with rights and opportunities taken for granted elsewhere one current debate is over a new name for the country and whether it should join czechs and slavs by one word , a hyphen or a conjunction while outsiders react with amusement , citizens here are enthralled by the freedom to discuss and decide vera caslavska finds herself in a similar predicament these days , faced with options once only a dreamer could have imagined should she remain in her current position as an adviser to vaclav havel , the playwrightturnedpresident serve as czechoslovakia s new ambassador to japan , or accept the nomination to be president of the national olympic committee \? puts her country first which is most important for czechoslovakia \? caslavska , once czechoslovakia s greatest olympic gymnast , asked the other evening , with genuine uncertainty i must do what is best for my country caslavska stood in the middle of rudolf s gallery , a glorious reception hall of goldleafed walls , high ceilings and crystal chandeliers in prague castle , for more than 600 years the seat of government she was a guest of the president s press secretary , michael zantovsky , at a reception for local and foreign journalists given all that followed her olympic triumphs in 1964 and 1968 , the setting was as unlikely as her new opportunities at the 1964 games in tokyo , caslavska was a littleknown 22yearold from prague who stunned the gymnastics world by winning the allaround competition , plus two other gold medals and two silvers in april 1968 , six months before the next olympics , in mexico city , she joined hundreds of other prominent czechoslovak dissidents in signing the manifesto of 2 , 000 words , a document that grew out of the prague spring of 1968 , which repudiated postwar soviet intervention in czechoslovakia a warning , an escape when soviet tanks rumbled through the streets four months later , the signatories were designated as criminals of the state and hunted down at the time , the olympic gymnastics team was training in moravia what happened next , caslavska said , she has never before disclosed a friend warned her that she might be imprisoned if the authorities found her so he helped her escape into the tiny town of sumperk in the jeseniky mountains , where she stayed for three weeks she grew disconsolate , aware that the soviet gymnasts , her fiercest rivals , had already traveled to mexico city to adapt to the climate and altitude she , meanwhile , was stuck in sumperk , with the most rudimentary of training opportunities i was hanging on trees and tumbling in the meadows in front of the cottage , she said as the games approached , she rejoined her teammates by permission of the authorities in mexico city , she won the allaround , three other gold medals , and two silvers telling her story a day after her final event , she married a czechoslovak 1 , 500meter runner , josef odlozil , and returned home to start a family and complete her autobiography but she found that the government had not forgotten she had signed the manifesto she could not get her autobiography published , no doubt because 140 pages were devoted to how czechoslovakia s sports system worked and how government officials treated athletes and sports administrators in time , she had it published in japan , but without the sections deemed unacceptable by the czechoslovak government authorities on jan 3 , 1970 , she began another fight she asked the sports minister , antonin himmel , for a job with the national girls' gymnastics team he refused , saying come back next year this is not a suitable time yet for five years , every jan 3 , she appeared in the same office , asking for the same job for the fifth year , i was supposed to apply again , but i knew it was necessary to change my way of negotiations , she said so i dressed in an aerobics suit , high at the neck , very tight i am quite a conservative person , and it was hard for me to dress like that , but i had to look for my courage mr himmel looked at me and measured me with his eyes he asked me 'vera , what have you got on \? are you crazy \? ' i answered him 'no , but i was supposed to come back on the third of january , and apply for work , and now i'm here , dressed for work and i'm not leaving until you give me a team and a gymnastics hall in which to work' he was not able to decide such a thing alone he called all of his advisers into the room a full 20 men stared at me they finally decided i could get a team , but it had to be done in a very secret way denial sought and refused to save face with their superiors , the sports authorities allowed caslavska only to work with the current coaches she would not be allowed to travel outside the country in time , the authorities offered to loosen their grip if she would deny publicly that she had signed the manifesto she refused her absence from view lasted another five years , until 1979 , when czechoslovakia was trying to improve economic ties with mexico the mexican president , jose lopez portillo , remembered her from the 1968 olympics , and asked the authorities if caslavska would be permitted to come to mexico to work with young mexican gymnasts i do n't want to say i was exchanged for oil , caslavska said , with a laugh but she was allowed to go , and spent the next two years there even after her return , however , the authorities tried to keep her hidden on a 1984 visit to czechoslovakia , the president of the international olympic committee , juan antonio samaranch , asked to see her and emil zatopek , the distance runner who won three gold medals at the 1952 helsinki olympics samaranch was told that zatopek was ill and that caslavska had family problems a year later , samaranch returned and insisted upon presenting zatopek and caslavska with the olympic order this time , the authorities relented , and from that point on , they were unable to deny her existence any longer she was allowed to join the european gymnastics union as a representative of the country and become a fulltime coach with the national team preparing for the seoul olympics a year later , when the communists were ousted from control of the government , she began serving as an adviser to president havel on matters of health care , human rights , physical education and sports she recently represented president havel in japan , where she spoke to 150 business executives in an effort to generate more business for czechoslovakia when she returned to czechoslovakia , the possibility of going back to tokyo as ambassador came up she also knows how disorganized czechoslovakia s sports system has become before , everything was run from the state central committee for sports now , each individual sports federation is on its own the national olympic committee wants caslavska to be its president she is almost overwhelmed with the options such choices the afternoon sun sparkled off the goldleafed walls in rudolf s gallery of prague castle someone quite officiallooking tapped caslavska on the shoulder could he have a word with her \? of course , she said but what a time to choose photo vera caslavska in 1968 \( associated press \)

what brought janet malcolm and jeffrey m masson together eight years ago was a common fascination with sigmund freud and the history of psychoanalysis for more than 40 hours they talked of freud as well as freud s daughter , disciples and dogmas for dr masson , a former psychoanalyst who lives in berkeley , calif , hearing from a journalist of ms malcolm s renown was a fantasy come true , as he later put it for ms malcolm , the encounter formed the basis of a twopart series in the new yorker and later a book , in the freud archives ultimately , though , the impact of the malcolmmasson association may be as much on journalism and law as on the history of psychoanalysis , particularly now that the united states supreme court has become involved this week the high court agreed to consider whether to reinstate a 10 million libel suit dr masson filed against ms malcolm , the new yorker and the book publisher , alfred a knopf , six years ago , shortly after the new yorker articles appeared in that suit , which a lower court dismissed in 1987 , dr masson charged that ms malcolm attributed to him remarks he never uttered these quotations , he asserted , made him look egotistical , irresponsible , sexually promiscuous and dishonest ms malcolm said she had made only minor changes in what dr masson told her matter of manipulation the malcolmmasson case raises , at least in the abstract , the question of just how common manipulation of quotations by journalists may be it also poses the questions , never squarely addressed by the high court before , of how far an author can stray from verbatim quotations , either to clean up syntax and grammar or to change substance and whether fabrication is evidence , in and of itself , of the recklessness that public figures must prove to win libel cases in upholding the dismissal of dr masson s suit last year , the federal appeals court in california held that while language that is wholly the product of the author s imagination may show such recklessness , an author may under certain circumstances fictionalize quotations to some extent in an interview this week , dr masson said ms malcolm had quoted me over and over again as saying things i not only never said , but do not even believe he added she s entitled to dislike me but not to make me dislikable via words that she puts into my mouth because she believes that at one point they were in my unconscious she plays shrink and i do n't even like shrinks playing shrinks ms malcolm said the small changes she made were the kind most journalists make with the words of most sources to turn speech into prose if you publish exactly what people say , you 're doing them a disservice , she said writer denies fabricating but she asserted that dr masson said everything she attributed to him and that she had fabricated nothing it would never occur to me to invent anything , she said this whole case is so bizarre to me because i happen to be a compulsively careful writer her lawyers , from the san francisco firm of cooper , white cooper , argue in court papers that dr masson is simply smarting from selfinflicted wounds stripped to its essence , this is a case in which petitioner blames a serious writer and responsible publishers for accurately reporting his own illadvised words , they state the masson suit is one of two imbroglios on journalistic ethics that involve ms malcolm in two new yorker articles last year , she accused the author joe mcginniss and , implicitly , all reporters and journalists of misleading and manipulating those they interview nowhere in those articles did she refer to dr masson s complaints about her own work ms malcolm s earlier articles in 1983 detailed dr masson s dismissal as projects director of the sigmund freud archives in london that dismissal , he contended , was based on his iconoclastic views of freud , which he first detailed publicly in two articles in the new york times in 1981 eight passages at issue in one of eight passages at issue in the lawsuit , ms malcolm quotes dr masson as claiming that his onetime colleagues at the archives thought of him as an intellectual gigolo in another , he purportedly boasted of hoping to expand the archives beyond a scholarly center into a place of sex , women and fun in a third , he allegedly predicted that after the publication of his book on freud , his fellow analysts would deem him the greatest analyst who ever lived though each of those subjects arose in 40 hours of interviews that are on tape , the specific quotations do not ms malcolm contends they were made in portions of the interview that were not recorded , and appear in her written notes dr masson counters that the notes themselves are fabricated , a charge ms malcolm called ludicrous no court has yet ruled on any of these claims instead , shortly after the suit was filed in 1984 , the firm now representing ms malcolm and her publishers successfully moved to dismiss the case on the ground that even if he could prove ms malcolm put words in his mouth , dr masson could not prove libel for the past six years , then , the case has remained largely in the realm of legal theory and hypothesis rather than of facts
philadelphia the transition is one of the most startling in philadelphia to go from the domed neoclassical hall of the original franklin institute to the vibrant atrium of the museum s justopened futures center is not only to move from old to new but also from static to dynamic , from formal to relaxed , and from sumptuous to sleek the 72 million futures center , which opened last month , is a combined exhibition hall , domedscreen imax theater , and videoequipped lecture hall , all built around a central atrium together these facilities add roughly 90 , 000 square feet to this venerable science museum , and they change its identity completely the franklin institute , which prides itself on having been the nation s first science museum with participatory exhibits , had grown somewhat stodgy over the years its most celebrated exhibits a human heart so gigantic that visitors can walk through it tracing the path of the blood , and a real , 60 , 000ton baldwin locomotive that visitors can ride as it lumbers back and forth on an eightfootlong indoor track were still drawing crowds but much of the place seemed tired beside a newer generation of science museums awash in video screens and microchips a decade ago one could well conclude that , much like philadelphia itself back then , time seemed to have passed the franklin institute by the transformation is the result of an unusually happy collaboration between an energetic museum administration and knowing architects the institute s chairman , charles andes , and its president , joel bloom , felt strongly that something had to be done to restore the franklin institute to the leadership position among science museums that it had once enjoyed the architects , robert geddes and michael kihn of the philadelphia firm of geddes brecher qualls cunningham , came to the table with no preconceived notions about how to do this and were willing to evolve a program for a new science museum in cooperation with the institute s staff the one thing everyone agreed on was that the original building , a sprawling neoclassical structure of 1933 by john t windrim , should be respected its monumental columned facade with a great flight of steps on logan but this room , for all its glory , also said much about what was wrong with the building intended to be in the center of a fullblock complex , it was actually a littleused dead end , since much of windrim s building was never built construction stopped abruptly during the depression , and the franklin institute that had stood on logan square since 1933 was only an lshaped portion of the vast square structure that the architect had envisioned the memorial hall was an awkward space , visited only by those who were lost , confused , or desirous of paying franklin homage the museum s addition changes the nature of this space dramatically , as it changes the nature of the existing galleries in the old building , even though none of these old spaces have been significantly altered but now they are parts of a larger whole the addition knits together the disparate sections of this old building and , in so doing , strengthens them encouraged by the museum s administration , which feared that continuing the classicism of the windrim building in an addition would send too cautious a message , the architects designed a crisp , modernist structure , a play of geometries in masonry on the outside , an exuberant mix of hightech and industrial architecture on the inside it was a stylistic decision based on an idea that is not necessarily valid , since classicism can provide a sympathetic setting for all kinds of functions , and when used inventively need hardly symbolize conservatism indeed , given the strength and quality of the original building , breaking architectural rank might have seemed needlessly arrogant yet the architects did break rank here , and with enough success to serve as a reminder that architecture is never made by rules and formulas , and that there are ways to respect an old building that do not involve imitating it the critical thing here was not style but planning and organization the new structure is set behind the old building , inside the l of its two wings , and thus is not visible from either of the two major streets that surround it its interior layout , however , both respects the original building and works splendidly for the newly conceived functions of the museum all the new spaces the mandell futures center \( the collective name for the galleries \) the huge , multiscreen imax theater , called the tuttleman omniverse theater and the hall , called the musser choices forum are reached through the central atrium , which also contains a cafe and a museum shop and provides access to the older section s exhibit areas as well this atrium is a marvelous room , a true town square under a roof to emphasize its quality as public space , there are steps that can be used as amphitheater seating , and special events like science demonstrations and mime performances are held within the space entry to the space is free museum admission is only collected when visitors move beyond the atrium the design , with a floor of gray terrazzo and bright red metal ramps lining the side walls , has a bit of the air of deconstructivism to it , but here these slicing geometries have been rendered so benign , so cheerful , that they have none of the cold and dour selfimportance that we often associate with that trendy style playing off against the red ramps is a bright yellow central column , leading up to a skylight , placed roughly in the middle of the atrium directly on the central axis of the original building it s a kind of hightech version of a classical column , there to remind us both of the differences between windrim s architecture and mr geddes and mr kihn s and also , by virtue of its placement , of the similarities many of the side walls of the exhibit areas are glass , so visitors can see into the exhibit areas from the atrium on a typical day the atrium floor and the bright red ramps are full of crowds and movement , and the whole room pulsates with a kind of earnest energy the exhibitions cover a wide range of current issues , from environmentalism to computers the real advance here , though , is an elaborate interactive computer system that permits visitors to gain additional information on any subject shown in an exhibit , respond to questions , play simple games , or receive information about other exhibitions and facilities in the museum visitors can program the computers , which are located throughout the exhibit areas , to provide information at any level from preschool to adult and the computer system , for its part , provides the museum with instant market research by recording what kinds of visitors are most interested in each exhibit the success of this project comes in some contrast to the rough going many other philadelphia cultural institutions have been having it s easier to raise corporate money for a science museum than an orchestra , perhaps , and it s surely easier to make a science museum lively and appealing to a wide public without compromising standards than to do the same thing in an art museum but none of that diminishes the value of what the franklin institute has managed to achieve moving in one step from being almost a cultural backwater of this city to its center of energy photo the atrium of the franklin institute s futures center pulsating with earnest energy \( jack manning the

a few days ago , the society announced some results of that drive the andrew w mellon foundation has donated 25 million 15 million to increase the endowment for the preservation of the society s permanent collections and 1 million toward operating costs the dewitt wallacereader s digest fund has given 18 million for public programs , including education , and 700 , 000 for the permanent collections the annie laurie aitken charitable trust has given 500 , 000 to preserve the works in the library at the same time , contributions from trustees increased fivefold to 11 million in 1988 and 1989 and have been coming in at a slightly higher rate in the last year , said juliana sciolla , the society s vice president for external affairs new york state has also promised 400 , 000 for the library in the next three years and so far no works of art have been sold visitors will immediately sense a place different in spirit from the dour institution that was there before not for many years , for example , has the society undertaken an exhibition as ambitious as paris 1889 american artists at the universal exposition , which opens today in the last few months , the european paintings donated by thomas jefferson bryan more than a century ago were cleaned and installed in their own gallery on the fourth floor in what was one of the more desperate attempts by the previous administration to solve its financial problems , the society at one point considered selling bryan s collection , and so , even more than the paris exhibition , the presentation of these paintings is a signpost of the institution s transformation at the same time , a selection from the society s outstanding collection of hudson river school landscapes , along with an assortment of portraits and genre scenes , have been refurbished and rehung this was not simply a matter of hammering hooks into a wall and adjusting the lights the society has taken pains to integrate documentary material with the art and , as best as possible , to put on view a range of works , accompanied by extensive explanatory labels , that give some sense of the city s ethnic and cultural diversity on display are paintings depicting blacks and american indians , an edition of the first translation of the bible into an american indian dialect , and a copy of the first published poem by a black author these may be , for the most part , small gestures , but they are not without significance at a place like the society and there is more in the next two months , a show of photographs of new york city by charles gilbert hine will be installed in a new gallery designed for the display of works on paper , while the luman reed collection , which includes many of the society s most important paintings , will , like the bryan collection , be brought together in a gallery of its own this culminates a fiveyear plan to put the complete reed collection on view for the first time most dramatically , the jewish museum , whose home on fifth avenue is undergoing a largescale reconstruction , in january takes up a twoyear residency on portions of the first and second floors of the society as part of an unusual cooperative venture that the society hopes will bring thousands of new visitors through its doors last year , the number of visitors increased to 50 , 000 from an alltime low of 38 , 000 in 1988 , and in the next year the society , which plans to undertake its first fullscale advertising campaign , hopes to reach its goal of 200 , 000 visitors for an institution that for decades had shown scant interest in the public it ostensibly served , all of this comes as nothing less than an extraordinary change of affairs now 300 , 000 has been raised to conserve and catalogue a trove of architectural drawings that has been gathering dust more than 125 , 000 has also been raised for why history \? , a series of lectures , panel discussions and other events that address in one form or another the issue of multiculturalism and about 700 , 000 has been raised to cover the cost of housing paintings , decorative objects and sculptures in secure , climatecontrolled storerooms around the city that will , within several months , be made open to the public by appointment \( there is not enough space in the already crowded society to house all these works \) none of this is to suggest that the society has emerged from the deep financial hole it dug for itself during decades of poor management results of the most recent audit are not yet available , ms sciolla said , but she said she was confident that the deficit had been significantly reduced from a 37 million shortfall in 1988 still , she admits , the society faces annual deficits of at least hundreds of thousands of dollars on a yearly budget of about 8 million and most of the endowment of roughly 123 million is restricted to support of the permanent collection and may not be used to cover operating costs whether exhibitions like paris 1889 are the sort to attract large numbers of admissionpaying visitors remains , of course , to be seen the show , which brings together about 60 of the paintings that represented american art at the paris world s fair in 1889 , was organized for the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts by annette blaugrund , who is now senior curator of paintings , sculpture and drawings at the society it is , by the nature of the subject , full of the sort of academic paintings that were popular a century ago among artistically conservative officials who selected works for the fair , but that have long been gone out of favor works like e a bell s lady in gray or harry humphrey moore s glimpse into the pleasure quarters are only two among many surpassingly mediocre paintings in the show there are also a few splendid images , like thomas eakins s portrait of a war veteran , william gilbert gaul s dramatically lighted charging of the battery and kenyon cox s graceful landscape flying shadows they have been supplemented by french academic art , including two canvases from the society s collection by jean leon gerome and william adolphe bouguereau , which illustrate some of the sources for the american artists paris 1889 may ultimately be of essentially historical interest , but in its breadth and seriousness and its attempt to make use of the permanent collection , it underscores the impression that the society is finally in capable hands more to the point , it is the most immediate demonstration of the society s new mission to transform itself from a kind of private club into an institution that truly serves the public with one of the great libraries in new york and more than two million works of art , the society was for decades a great underused resource there is now the promise , at least , that it will become one of the city s most engaging cultural centers photo james carroll beckwith s 1886 painting william walton , from the exhibition paris 1889 american artists at the universal exposition , which opens today at the newyork historical society \( the century association \)

its wall street competitors may be suffering laying off thousands , reporting huge losses and even collapsing altogether but at morgan stanley company the tune is strikingly upbeat i have never been more optimistic about the future , said lewis w bernard , a managing director who is the firm s chief planner morgan stanley is not only enjoying record profits , it is also quietly building what analysts say is the prototypical investment bank of the 1990 s one that increasingly trades and invests for itself as well as for its customers the change in morgan stanley s focus represents not only a search for profits but also a sharp break with the traditional role of the investment banker as a middleman to corporate clients , serving customers and collecting fees to see morgan stanley make this aboutface is particularly dramatic , said samuel l hayes 3d , a harvard business school professor who specializes in investment banking they were the quintessential relationship banker to be sure , other big investment banks , like salomon brothers inc and cs first boston inc , have also moved to trade and invest more for their own account but none have done it as forcefully and as profitably as morgan stanley last year morgan earned 443 million , giving it a 28 percent return on capital , the highest percentage in the industry among publicly held firms it did so not just by advising on scores of mergers , or by selling stakes in industrial companies that its merchantbanking division had acquired businesses for which the firm is well known it also made money by trading for itself in moreregulated , lessefficient markets overseas , and by identifying new services not readily available elsewhere that it could provide at a low cost , like clearing and settling securities transactions overseas where morgan stanley seems to differ from other firms is in its singleminded pursuit of profits , and its willingness to forgo services that some customers might want but are not willing to pay sufficiently for morgan s strategy may be shaped by the fact that employees own more than 50 percent of the firm s stock they really look very carefully at their own bottom line , said michael w blumstein , a securities industry analyst at cs first boston and i would attribute that to the fact that it is their own money morgan executives make no apologies for this stance , which they view as thrust upon them by the realities of the marketplace razorthin commissions and intense competition from newcomers like banks and foreign institutions have made many of morgan s traditional businesses unprofitable at the same time , some of the firm s customers have become so sophisticated that they have duplicated many of morgan s services commissions now provide just 10 percent of the revenue for the firm , down from 17 percent in 1987 , while trading and investing for its own account , instead of for customers , provides about 40 percent of revenue at firms like shearson lehman hutton inc and merrill lynch company it hovers closer to 22 percent , while at salomon it has been over 50 percent , according to samuel g liss , a salomon analyst wall street firms are becoming increasingly dependent on their principal activities , be it in trading or merchant banking , mr bernard said balking on services as an unabashed richard b fisher , the firm s president , told an industry group late last year , we will sooner or later stop providing services whether it s research or liquidity or firstrate sales service or what because we simply ca n't get compensated for it a number of morgan s competitors , by contrast , acknowledge privately that through much of the 80 s they either did not know how unprofitable some of their businesses were , or they knew but were uncomfortable in taking steps that might anger or antagonize clients morgan stanley , by contrast , shocked the financial community last year by telling 45 percent of its institutional customers , which used the firm to buy and sell stocks but were not generating enough commissions , that it would no longer provide free research or use its own capital to provide liquidity for stock trading a traditional wall street function fund stirs criticism and the 225 billion merchantbanking fund it raised in the mid1980 s to buy companies outright still raises hackles with corporate clients , some of whom now find themselves competing with companies run by morgan stanley on behalf of its investment partners customers said they understood the pressures forcing wall street firms to move in this direction , but they expressed concern about the longterm consequences there is a general trend toward moving capital in a brokerdealer to where it gets the highest return , said stephen b timbers , chief investment officer of kemper financial services in chicago he said , though , that what scares the dickens out of me is the prospect that he may wake up in 1993 and find that there are only three people i can call to do a 500 , 000share block trade
frank o'neill s roman circus \( simon schuster , 1995 \) may not be everybody s dish it may be too introspective , too literary , too novelistic give it a chance brilliantly written , with superb characterizations , plenty of action and a felliniesque social setup , it is to most books of its genre what a henry james novel is to a horatio alger story it is a tale about many things arab terrorism in italy , the resumption of a love affair between a cia man and an italian princess , the red brigades , a twisted \( in body and mind \) italian intellectual , the fading aristocracy in italy mr o'neill knows and loves that country , down to the finest nuances of locale and character he also gets into the terrorist mentality , and his matteroffact analysis of what goes on in an assassin s mind is positively chilling there is also a sympathetic look at the italian police and their problems in dealing with the massive american presence in italy there are many characters in roman circus , but five are of supreme importance the forces of evil are represented by the intellectual and his partner , a killer from libya opposed to them are the american agent and a police captain all the action eventually swirls around the princess what we get is a complicated mesh of relationships , ending with a shootout but what would be conventional in most hands turns out to be different and absorbing in mr o'neill s he is a splendid stylist , urbane and polished , with a wide variety of background material to fall back on everything in the book reveals the work of a sensitive , wellstocked mind and an ability to shape a deft phrase he felt within his own shoulders the sprouting wings of a sublime , iridescent lie and did not know whether he dared to fly with them there is humor also the characterization of an american ambassador with absolutely wacky ideas about how to present american values to the italians is satire on a high level the next 12 months will bring many more novels about espionage and terrorism the betting here is that none will be on the same literary plane as mr o'neill s new book  arab terrorists are present , too , in sword of the shaheen by m e morris \( presidio , 1895 \) this is a fairly conventional , fastmoving book , armageddon division , about russian nuclear armament falling into the hands of arab terrorists and their plan to destroy part of the united states the russians at first are not unhappy with the scenario but when they realize what is going to happen world war iii , among other things they link up with american security forces to try to stop the threat lots of downtothewire action , with clean enough writing  somewhat flawed , but never less than interesting , is the god project by stan lee \( grove weidenfeld , 1995 \) its plot has to do with a secret cia project hidden from congress and the new president himself elements of science fiction are present here but what basically is on the author s mind is a look at the entire american power structure he postulates a liberal president beating the odds and squeaking in with no real mandate how can he get his program through congress \? mr lee takes the reader through the ways in which a president must maneuver , give a little , take a little , pacify the opposition , compromise and even surrender some of his ideals to realize his biggest dream in this case , disarmament there are some very funny things en route mr lee s sensibility , with his black humor , often suggests that of kurt vonnegut there is one set piece in which the president talks with various american leaders bank presidents , politicians , the clergy , industrialists all think america s woes can be cured if their own private interests are taken care of the flaws of the book stem from the author s obsession with describing for his readers politics as actually practiced in america he continually breaks up the flow of the story to introduce this or that nugget and while the nuggets are wonderful in their way , they are testimony to getting across a pet idea rather than furthering the story line no matter mr lee s ideas are cogent , his style is bracing and he has us cheering for the new president and the team he has assembled the most attractive and unusual of this group is a nebbish with a freak memory that is , he is a nebbish to begin with he ends up something else  stephen leather s thriller the fireman \( st martin s , 1695 \) is an import that tells us a great deal about how journalism is practiced in england , even if the action is mostly in hong kong a british journalist is notified that his sister has committed suicide he flies to hong kong to find out what happened the police insist on suicide the journalist knows better , and so do you and i at the end an oriental deus ex machina takes care of matters it is a contrived ending , with what amounts to a least likely suspect to an american reader , the only really interesting parts of the book are the observations about newspaper reporting thrown off by the central character as described here , reporters for the lower kind of british newspapers live in a grubby , dogeatdog world in which sensationalism matters much more than truth they are all boozers , and they quickly burn out even the worst american newspapers are aunt nellies compared with the cutthroat savagery rampant in british journalism at least , if this account is to be believed
george steinbrenner , principal owner of the yankees , has spoken recently of rebuilding the team with young players from within the organization there are already four rookies on the yankee roster , and steinbrenner has promised more can the yankees really rebuild with homegrown talent \? yes , but not overnight , an analysis of the yankee farm system suggests the talent in the yankee system is without a doubt above average , the yankee director of minor league operations , mitchell lukevics , said recently yankee minor league teams last year compiled a 391309 record \( a 559 winning percentage \) , the secondbest in the minors behind the chicago white sox farm system , and the publication baseball america ranked yankee talent ninth among the 26 major league teams in its annual rankings but the talent is unevenly distributed , with weaknesses in critical skill positions the most promising pitching talent is not yet mature so there will be no quick fix producing for others minor league people within and outside the yankee organization say , however , that if the yankees are willing to adopt a threeyear planning approach , there is enough solid talent to fashion a contender the yankee farm system has actually been quite productive in the last decade but the system s products have chiefly benefited other teams , a result of a series of trades of young players for aging veterans fred mcgriff , willie mcgee , greg gagne , tim burke , jim deshaies and doug drabek , all current major leaguers , were once yankee farmhands none of the players received in return are still with the yankees the extent of minor league instruction may be one reason the yankees have been able to produce a steady stream of talent gary denbo , manager of the yankees' prince william \( va \) cannons , noted that most teams in the class a carolina league have just one coach the cannons have three coaches in recent years , the yankees have also tried to give young players a greater sense of stability by shuttling them less frequently between leagues a lode in outfield young yankee talent is deepest in the outfield indeed , a battle for roster spots is looming as an exceptional crop of outfield talent matures for example , two columbus clippers players , kevin maas and hensley meulens , tore up class aaa pitching all spring meulens , 23 years old , who was with the yankees for eight games last season , batting 179 , has been successfully converted from a third baseman to a left fielder and is among the class aaa leaders in home runs \( 19 \) and runs batted in \( 64 \) russ meyer , a coach who worked with meulens at albany in class aa , said meulens had worked hard to refine his skills he has also struck out 90 times in his first 89 games maas , a first basemanoutfielder who has excelled at all minor league levels , had 13 home runs in 190 times at bat at columbus before joining the yankees on june 28 since then , he has played in 12 games , hitting 303 , with 4 homers and 10 runs batted in among the homers was a key threerun shot earlier this month in a victory over the minnesota twins eyes on columbus a step behind meulens and maas is bernie williams , 21 , a switchhitting center fielder at albany who has power from both sides of the plate last year , the albany club finished in front by 19 games with a 9248 record and ran away with the eastern league championship although two players from that team \( jim leyritz , now playing with the yankees , and tim layana of the cincinnati reds \) have already reached the majors , columbus has inherited much of the other talent , and has the best record in the class aaa international league all the young starting pitchers at columbus are legitimate prospects , although none are overpowering after going 121 , with an earned run average of 207 , with albany last year , steve adkins , 25 , a 6foot6 lefthander , has recovered after a slow coldweather start at columbus his best pitches are a downbreaking knuckle curve and a deceptive straight change , both effective in setting up an ordinary fastball if adkins gets his knuckle curve over , he s going to win wherever he pitches , meyer predicted adkins is 85 with a 298 earned run average eiland gaining notice control is the strong suit of dave eiland , 24 , who was 00 in three games with the yankees in 1988 , and 13 with them in six games last season , with an earned run average of 577 this year at columbus , he is 103 with an earned run average of 357 eiland , lukevics said , changes speeds masterfully , puts the ball where he wants it , and gets groundball outs lukevics said eiland was probably the first pitcher in line for promotion willie smith is the type of pitcher who terrifies batters large \( 65 and 225 pounds \) and often wild , smith , 23 , unleashes fastballs at up to 95 miles an hour , but needs to throw more strikes his potential and frustration are reflected in these numbers 18z innings pitched , 27 strikeouts , 18 walks the yankee system is flush with hitting prospects at third base , although none rekindle memories of graig nettles with the glove indeed , at the infield positions and at catcher the yankees have many intriguing but incomplete players the columbus keystone combination of carlos rodriguez \( best hands i 've ever seen , said gary allenson , a manager in the boston red sox system \) and andy stankiewicz is superb defensively but neither player has yet shown superior offensive skills good prospect at second mitch lyden , a catcher who was promoted to columbus yesterday , has fine power \( 17 homers this season at albany \) but he has been injured so often , his future may not lie behind the plate closest to a complete player is the second baseman pat kelly , also at albany kelly , 22 , is a deft pivotman who , allenson said , plays with a spring in his chest can a youth movement be sustained in the bronx \? minor league managers and scouts emphasize that no youth program can succeed without patience and discipline , management virtues not generally identified with the yankees but those virtues will be essential if the yankees decide to make room for youngsters by unloading veterans to get full value for established players , the new york front office will have to wait patiently until a contender is desperate to fill a hole and then insist on legitimate youthful talent in return photo hensley meulens of the columbus clippers has successfully completed a move from third base to left field and is among class aaa s leading hitters \( associated press

zion , ill from the outside , the microseal corporation looks like any other small factory on the fringe of chicago but inside , there is an experiment under way that could well change the nature of the accounting profession the fastgrowing producer of documentstorage systems recently decided to rent its chief financial officer from arthur andersen company , the big accounting firm the threeyear contract , begun on jan 11 , is apparently the first of its kind for a big accounting firm for arthur andersen , it adds a promising new line of business to a group of specialty operations including assembling paperwork for trial lawyers and helping corporations compile data to comply with tighter environmental laws that has become a fast growing part of the big chicago firm big rise in revenue expected last year , the specialty contract work done for clients accounted for 140 million of andersen s revenues , up 45 percent within five years , the group could be contributing revenues of 500 million , arthur andersen executives predict but more important , innovations like the program at microseal are a sharp break with the traditions of the accounting profession and the change has been criticized in some accounting circles the conventional role for the independent accounting firm is that of an outsider , whose staff comes in at yearend to audit a corporate client s financial statements yet at microseal , where a 27yearold arthur andersen manager , brian esker , is acting as the company s chief financial officer and three microseal clerks have joined arthur andersen s payroll , the accounting firm has become an insider because arthur andersen now prepares microseal s financial statements , government rules preclude the firm from reviewing the books , as it had done for three decades 'redefinition of auditing' most other accounting firms view andersen s move askance it s very aggressive , said micheal boberschmidt , a senior price waterhouse partner , who doubted other firms would quickly follow andersen s lead they 're certainly on ground that none of the others are with respect to how aggressively they 're going after services that are heretofore outside the scope of public accounting but stretching the conventional boundaries of the profession is precisely the mission of andersen s top management , which sees it as an ambitious redefinition of auditing , says lawrence a weinbach , the firm s chief executive indeed , the microseal experiment is typical of the way andersen s new management team the three top executives have been in their jobs less than 12 months has gone about building the business in light of last fall s breakdown of merger talks with price waterhouse seeking business that may grow andersen is best known for having built andersen consulting , a 144 billion information and technology consulting practice that is the world s largest but it has also worked steadily to identify and develop businesses that could generate tomorrow s growth its six fastgrowing specialty contract businesses are the result of that spade work their 140 million in revenues represented 72 percent of last year s 194 billion in revenues that came from everything the firm does outside its andersen consulting division the new services are generally marketed to andersen s nonaudit clients and have not yet come at the expense of many longtime audit relationships in fact , andersen still leads the industry in terms of wins versus losses , according to the trade publication accounting today it reported that andersen snared 52 new public audit clients and lost 35 last year for a net gain of 17 , while bdo seidman , the nextbest businessgetter in the survey , had a net gain of 9 still , andersen s search for new business is understandable , given industry trends since most domestic companies are already spoken for , wooing new audit clients is a difficult chore and exerts pressure on pricing at the same time , the risk of being sued by investors for a bad audit has soared necessity of innovation it s a different world , said gary peterson , who heads andersen s fledgling contract financial management business , which includes accounts like microseal s the maturity of the audit business is causing standard attest work to drop off so if you 're going to continue to grow you have to do things like this andersen s top management had an added reason to push innovation having just overhauled its method of compensation to please its consultants , top management wanted to keep the firm s accountants motivated with our auditors watching our highperformance consulting unit for the last decade , we needed some substance to get them to believe in themselves and believe that the audit market was n't a relic , said richard l measelle , the managing partner of andersen s audit , accounting and tax business unit our people did n't see that they were just out there crunching numbers andersen s contract management unit was one of a stream of new product ideas , many of them resulting from brainstorming sessions that 800 of the firm s audit partners have attended over the last two years other suggestions were a bit more offbeat minting andersen currency , starting an andersen cable channel that would broadcast business news round the clock , and opening andersen university , a graduate training center for chief executives an idea ahead of its time

an american former hostage who arrived at john f kennedy international airport last night described confinement in iraq as a daytoday struggle for survival , scrounging for food , and fighting depressing scenarios the imagination constructed i think in a situation like that perhaps your mind is your worst enemy and you tend to create scenarios , some of which could or could not happen , and , yes , one of those scenarios is that we would not get out , said john thompson , a 44yearold construction engineer who had survived a number of days spent in diplomatic safehouses in baghdad he was one of five americans who arrived aboard a royal jordanian airlines flight from london the hostages were met by hugs and cheers of relatives and one , marine sgt mark ward , of middletown , nj , was greeted by a large banner strung across a secondfloor railing of the international arrivals building , which read , welcome home , mark we missed you the marine , who was stationed at the embassy in kuwait and was freed because his father , david , was ill , walked out of the terminal hugging his fiance , nazlie otto , to a long light limousine which had a yellow ribbon tied around a rear aerial someone popped a champagne cork he drank and was toasted by friends and relatives , and then stepped to a microphone and said to members of the press who had gathered , george , referring to president bush , keep up the good work , and it s good to be back none of the hostages spoke of being treated harshly 'very confined' lloyd graham , 48 , of houston , an expediter for a construction engineering company , said the colleagues he left behind felt very very confined , very distraught mentally he added , we were not abused in any way larry murray , a construction supervisor , also from the houston area , said of the last days in iraq , that they kind of ran together mr thompson , who had been working on baghdad s master plan for the last four years , said , we tried to establish a routine for ourselves we had to scrounge the best we could for what food supplies were available he added , i think i and my other fellow guests were concerned with daytoday survival and coping with situations as they occurred mr graham said he was elated to be home , a feeling that all of the hostages expressed but he also spoke for all of them when he said , the celebrations are n't going to start until all of our friends and colleagues are at home and when mr thompson was asked what advice he would give to those that were left behind , he said softly , hang on
port st lucie , fla , march 29 the job market on the mets took a pair of plunges today when three roster slots were eliminated and 10 rookies were demoted as victims of the mean arithmetic of baseball s short spring in both areas , the mets did n't have much choice and did n't create any surprise the roster slots were eliminated when a dispute broke out between the 26 clubs and the players' union over how to implement their agreement of two weeks ago under the agreement , the clubs were allowed to open the season with expanded rosters of 27 , instead of the customary total of 24 but when they argued over the details , the expanded rosters were wiped out along with three temporary job openings on each team more bad news followed when the mets later made their first cuts of the spring and sent 10 of their young candidates back to the minor leagues the cuts involved six pitchers , a catcher , an infielder and two outfielders , none of whom had expected to make the varsity but all of whom were shortchanged by the 32day lockout all teams in same boat every club s in the same situation , manager davey johnson said it probably works to our advantage over some other clubs but that s why it s really critical now to extend some people , especially my starting pitchers we 'll go north with fewer people after a shorter spring johnson could afford to stay cool because he has six starting pitchers of distinction plus a powerful lineup but the mets , after winning their first three exhibition games , showed him today that there s no sure thing in baseball they split the squad to give more players more work and promptly lost two games in one afternoon , both by one run in port st lucie , one squad lost to the los angeles dodgers , 54 , although ron darling pitched four good innings in his second appearance of the week and mike marshall continued his power hitting with a triple and home run , giving him six runs batted in in four games in west palm beach , the other squad lost to the atlanta braves , 21 , although bob ojeda pitched three scoreless innings in his second turn of the short spring cuts tough on the young the cutback meant that several players on the fringe of success could also be denied their big chance they probably included jeff innis and wally whitehurst , two young pitchers who have spent some time with the team in the last two years trying to crack a staff that usually has no openings , and keith hughes and lou thornton , a pair of young outfielders trying to make the team another possible victim was phil lombardi , the no 3 catcher , whose fate depends on whether johnson decides to open the season with two catchers or three but that in turn may depend on whether he opens with 10 pitchers or 11 this is lombardi s 10th year in professional baseball , and he has played in only 43 games in the big leagues i heard last night on tv that they were dropping the 27man roster , lombardi said i thought here i go lombardi at least survived the first cuts in the squad , but these 10 players did n't terry bross , kevin brown , mike miller , dave trautwein , julio valera and peter schourek , all pitchers todd hundley , a catcher chris donnels , an infielder , and jaime roseboro and terry mcdaniel , outfielders the cuts left 32 players in camp , with eight more to be subtracted by opening day , april 9 darling , who allowed four singles and one run in his four innings , was asked how he would solve the most intriguing of the mets' job problems how to fit six starting pitchers into a fiveman rotation if i were davey , he said , i 'd hope frank cashen would get rid of one of us and save himself the problem if some guy fell flat on his face , the decision might be based on performance , not on style but that wo n't happen these guys are too talented
when i attended the premiere of reversal of fortune at the recent toronto film festival , i anticipated few surprises the new movie , directed by barbet schroeder , is based on my own book about how my students and i had reversed claus von bulow s conviction for twice trying to kill his wife my son elon , who works in the film business , had come up with the idea of making a movie out of the von bulow story since he was involved in every phase of the project from script revision to casting to shooting and editing i thought i had nothing to worry about i had met with the actor , ron silver , who had been chosen to play me i had even been at the filming of several scenes involving my character i 've also seen myself on the television screen many times , in interviews and in tapes of court appearances while watching myself perform on tv , i have said to friends and family that the aggressive and fasttalking knowitall they 're watching is n't really me it s my tv persona i expected to feel about the same when i watched myself being played in a movie , and i thought i was prepared for the experience but when ron silver s face appeared on the big screen playing me , i had a physical reaction not quite an outofbody experience but a bizarre feeling that some stranger had borrowed my identity and was trying to encapsulate my entire life into several fleeting scenes the opening scene featuring my character had him i ca n't conjure up the first person playing an energetic game of basketball by himself he is interrupted by a phone call giving him the bad news that two young death row clients brothers who had broken their father out of jail , following which the father killed an entire family had lost their appeal and were likely to be executed \( the case is a real one , and the brothers are still on death row \) my character s reaction is to smash the telephone against the pavement when i complained to my son that i do n't throw phones when i lose cases even capital cases my son responded dad , you 've got to get it through your head that the person on the screen is n't you it s your character he continued to assure me , in his best professional manner , that characters have to establish themselves early in the film , and that this establishing scene was intended to convey my energy and my passion for the rights of criminal defendants if we had several hours , we could have demonstrated your passion by recounting your involvement in many other cases , but we had about a minute hence the smashed phone i was n't satisfied that scene does n't show passion , i said it shows a temper tantrum my son tried to explain in a tone that i'm sure he intended as patient , but that i experienced as patronizing that a character in a film has to be shown with some faults early on in the film , so that he can overcome them i know that you never lose your temper , elon assured me smilingly , but the viewing audience has to see you grow , like tom cruise s character in 'rain man' sensing my continuing dissatisfaction , elon counterattacked dad , when you have 20 minutes to argue a case on appeal , do n't you have to resort to dramatic vignettes that are representative of the defendant s persona rather than a full biographical account \? i had to agree with him , especially when he added try to understand how fortunate you are to be a character in a movie based on your book , coproduced by your son and played by an actor who likes you remember your client , leona helmsley , whose unauthorized story just ran on tv or your other client jeffrey macdonald , who was savaged by the tv version of joe mcginniss s book 'fatal vision' somebody could have done that to you elon was right , of course i had little to complain about compared to leona helmsley , who had been caricatured by suzanne pleshette , or jeffrey macdonald , who had been portrayed as unambiguously guilty by a snarling and shiftyeyed gary cole notwithstanding my comparative good fortune , i must admit that i do n't like having been portrayed as a person whose passions manifested by occasional curses in addition to the smashed phone are reserved exclusively for his professional life my girlfriend a mostly fictional character played by annabella sciorra complains loudly that my character has nothing left for the people around him , and my character seems to agree my clients are the people i care about poor guy ! i hope that s not me , although i do have to acknowledge that people who know me only professionally assume that i have nothing left for those i love but the fact is that i reserve my love for family and close friends i asked ron silver who knows how important my family is to me how he felt playing me in a way that he knew was something of a stereotype of the passionate lawyer for whom , in oliver wendell holmes s words , the law is a jealous mistress he responded i'm playing the public alan dershowitz the one people see on tv and in the newspapers i ca n't get to know the private alan dershowitz well enough to play him , and frankly the public is n't interested in that side of you
la paz , bolivia every weekday morning , they line up along the narrow halls and rickety stairs of channel 4 , mostly people wearing the frayed jackets , shawls and ballooning skirts of bolivia s impoverished majority of indian descent while the television cameras roll , they file into the tiny studio to share their woes with compadre palenque they ask his advice or help , involve him in their disputes , and recount their struggles with red tape they may go away with glasses for weakened eyes or a coffin to allow a poor mother to give her dead son a proper burial this is great , massive therapy , like letters to the editor in a newspaper , said carlos palenque , the 45yearold host of open tribunal of the people and the owner of channel 4 and of a radio station a presidential contender for mr palenque it is something more the endless stream of admirers and supplicants has become a political constituency that thrust him in the last year into contention for national leadership in the presidential elections a year ago , soon after mr palenque formed his political party , he finished fourth in a field of 10 , receiving 12 percent of the vote his conscience of the fatherland party , known as condepa , won two senate seats and nine places in the lower house of congress more recently , in the mayoral elections for la paz , he was the leading votegetter , but lacked a majority the combining of votes by other parties eventually deprived him of the office mr palenque describes his party as neither of the left nor of the right we want growth and better living conditions , he said we want bolivia to leave underdevelopment behind colleague goes to congress among those elected to congress from condepa was remedios loza , one of mr palenque s two cohosts on open tribunal she is the first of the socalled chola the women of mixed indian and spanish ancestry whose bowler hats , layers of full skirts and colorful shawls give la paz its exotic flavor to win a seat in the bolivian congress in a country of numerous political parties , where the frontrunner typically receives only 25 percent or so of the vote , mr palenque and his party are viewed as a fastrising political phenomenon that can no longer be laughed off by more traditional politicians political analysts think the only thing inhibiting mr palenque s political advance is the fact that his television program is seen and heard only in la paz and the surrounding andes highlands area , which have about a third of the country s population mr palenque says that he recognizes that limitation and would like to find ways to reach other regions but that he has to make a choice between investing his station s profits in expansion or continuing the social action to which he now dedicates part of the profits plans for an orphanage aside from the several hundred caskets and pairs of eyeglasses that he gives away every year , he is raising money to build a home for 500 orphans people bring us an average of almost a child a day , he said some are lost , others abandoned some people just leave children in the doorway carlos palenque is a small dapper man with a goatee and a deep , easy speaking voice admirers call him a born communicator he was originally a singer and musician playing a guitarlike bolivian instrument called the charango , made from an armadillo and began his rise to local fame after wining a competition across the border in argentina he started his program on the radio 22 years ago and put it on television 12 years ago topics are varied none of the subjects that people bring before his cameras , most without advance notice , seem to catch him without a response the topics range from disputes between students from different high schools to religion to mothers abandoned by their husbands to people wanting to send messages to their missing relatives the honorific by which he goes , compadre , is an affectionate term in spanish that has no direct translation to english it is a form of address that the parents and godparents of a child use in speaking to each other he likewise addresses most of the visitors to his program as compadre or comadre comadre remedios , as the 40yearold mrs loza is known , spends a good part of each program taking telephone calls from viewers and reporting on what they have to say about problems in their neighborhoods with her carefully made up black eyes flashing under her jaunty black bowler , she also translates into spanish when one of the guests speaks only aymara , the main indian language of this part of bolivia how the party arose mr palenque said his decision to form a political party and seek office came about after the government closed his television and radio stations about two years ago because they broadcast a telephone call from one of bolivia s major drug trafficking suspects , roberto suarez mr suarez had called in during a live debate that the stations were presenting about alleged ties between drug dealers and businessmen and politicians in bolivia people reacted to the closing in an angry way , mr palenque said they organized massive marches and demonstrations and we here at channel 4 went on hunger strike until we were allowed to reopen during one of the big demonstrations , the people gave us the authority to organize a political party to fight for national interests , dignity and justice photo carlos palenque , host of open tribunal of the people , interviewing a family at his studio in la paz the show , which gives bolivia s poor a chance to air their woes , has helped mr palenque build a political base \( s rickey rogers \)
an experimental test for lyme disease can identify some cases that escape detection by standard methods , scientists from new jersey and new york have reported the report has created interest among lyme disease researchers , who say they plan further studies in hopes of confirming the findings , but the test is not ready for routine use lyme disease is caused by a bacterium and transmitted by a tick that has been spreading in some areas of the country about 7 , 400 cases were reported in this country last year lyme disease can produce symptoms like a rash with a bull seye pattern , fever , arthritis , nerve paralysis and heart damage most cases can be diagnosed easily from the telltale rash and the standard laboratory test but a puzzling feature is that the test sometimes is negative when the rash is present or symptoms suggestive of lyme disease persist detecting the proteins the report in the current issue of the lancet , a british scientific journal , suggests that proteins normally formed in the body to battle the lyme bacterium can become trapped in a complex immunological web and thus cannot be detected by standard tests but the new test can apparently detect the proteins after steps are taken to break up the web in samples of blood in the laboratory this could be a very important finding , said dr jorge l benach , a lyme disease expert with the new york state health department the test is now being used only for research purposes by the authors of the study , at the university of medicine and dentistry at the new jersey medical school and the health sciences center of the state university of new york at stony brook the team is headed by dr steven e schutzer of the newark school several researchers said that if the findings were confirmed the new test could be combined with standard tests to help identify questionable cases without significant added costs or delays but two experts differed on the prospects of confirmation dr allen c steere , a lyme expert at tufts university school of medicine in boston , said that the findings were provocative and warranted further studies but he said he was skeptical that the findings would be confirmed , expressing concern about possible flaws in the study but dr john b zabriskie , an immunologist at rockefeller university in new york and a leading expert on such tests , said he was high on the study and found no serious flaws in it the number of lyme disease cases in which conventional tests are negative is a matter of heated debate among experts some believe they occur frequently , while others believe they are rare the new test detected the lyme antibody in all 10 cases with the classic rash and negative standard test results the new test was positive in 21 of 22 lyme cases with positive standard tests the new test was also positive in 4 of 12 probable cases of lyme disease with no rash and negative standard tests the test also holds promise for helping to clarify the spectrum of symptoms that the lyme bacteria produce no one knows the full extent and frequency of damage to nerves and the central nervous system by improving the diagnosis of lyme disease , the test could also help provide a more accurate count of cases in this country further , the test could help explain why test results can vary from laboratory to laboratory and even within the same laboratory a possible explanation is that the trapping of the protein occurs intermittently , leading to varying results depending on the presence of the protein dr schutzer said his team undertook the study to determine whether negative standard tests were due to the formation of immune complexes that trapped all the antibody , leaving none available for detection diagrams

washington , march 6 the united states postal service today proposed an increase in all classes of mail that would raise the price of a firstclass stamp to 30 cents and increase costs to businesses for second and thirdclass mailings by billions of dollars a year the postal service , which faces a 16 billion loss this years , expects to raise 7 billion a year in additional revenue from the rate increases the proposed fivecent increase in firstclass mail is the biggest since universal rates were introduced 127 years ago that proposal , along with the other proposed increases , now goes to the postal rate commission , which has 10 months to make a recommendation to the postal service board of governors , which makes the final decision a few rates would decline under the proposal for example , volume advertising sorted by lettercarrier route and weighing no more than three ounces would drop to 96 cents from 101 cents business and consumer groups are already mounting strong opposition campaigns 'customers are n't happy' businesses that advertise and sell by mail , including catalogue marketers , banks , credit card companies , insurers automotive manufacturers and magazines , would face significant increases in costs , our customers are n't happy , said anthony m frank , the postmaster general as he outlined the proposals at a news conference here for them it s a case of too much too soon to be honest , we agree , he added , noting that the proposed increases substantially outpace the rate of inflation in the general economy if the proposed rate increases are approved , they would take effect next february if they do , it would mean mailing costs will have gone up an average of 19 percent since april 3 , 1988 , when the last increase took effect over the same period , inflation is expected to increase by 13 percent , according to the postal service calculations mr frank said the increases are needed to meet rising wage and benefit costs , including new responsibilities for paying some of the costs of retiree health benefit and pension plans that have been transferred from the federal government the postal service employs about 757 , 000 full and parttime workers , making it the nation s largest private employer labor costs account for 83 percent of its 35 billion a year budget businesses see mismanagement but business groups , which did not dispute the postal service s financial difficulties , blamed the problem on mismanagement and a failure by postal service officials to achieve the improvements in productivity that were supposed to result from the introduction of new technology and more automated mail processing systems as mail users we recognize the inevitability of periodic rate increases , but there has been a waste , an enormous waste of postal resources over the past two years , said gene del politio , executive director of the third class mail association , which represents businesses advertising by mail mr del politio said that while his group plans to seek relief from some of the increases in thirdclass mail rates , the rate fight is in many ways a side show to the more important issue of expiring labor contracts with the four major unions that represent the vast majority of postal service workers negotiations to renew the contracts are scheduled to begin in august mr frank said the postal service was committed to keeping its costs at 2 percent below the inflation rate over the next five years in an effort to pay back the amount by which the new increases would exceed inflation postal rate called bargain vincent r sombrotto , president of the 315 , 000member national association of letter carriers , said that even at 30 cents , the cost of mailing a firstclass letter would still be a bargain for americans compared to costs for firstclass mail in other industrialized countries using figures that were also cited by the postal service , he noted , that firstclass postage is 599 in west germany cents and 428 cents in japan robert setrakian , chairman of the board of governors of the postal service , acknowledged that the rate increases would have a significant impact on businesses , but said they would not overburden the average household he esitmated that they would raise the average person s postal bill by about 10 to 11 a year business representatives disputed that assessment , warning that quite apart from the increases proposed for second and thirdclass mail , increases in firstclass mailing costs for businesses would ultimately affect customers as well the american banker s association estimated , for example , that each onecent increase in the nation s firstclass postal rate would cost banks and their customers an additional 50 million annually the proposed increase will encourage large mail users such as the banking industry to reduce the number of pieces they mail , which could result in a loss of revenue for the postal service despite the higher rates , said vincent a liguori , chairman of the aba s postal service committee and a vice president of first chicago trust company of new york mr liguori said banks may find that private

auburn hills , mich , june 5 they lost a 10point lead with less than 7 minutes to play they did not score for more than 4 minutes during the fourth quarter and for the first time during the playoffs , the portland trail blazers lost their composure in a crucial situation how will portland respond to tonight s wrenching 10599 loss to the detroit pistons in the opener of the national basketball association championship series \? the trail blazers insisted that while the pistons took tonight s game , they did not take portland s confidence we tried to tell everybody were n't afraid , said jerome kersey , who finished with 18 points for the trail blazers , but nobody believed us because it s the first time any of our players have been here this is a game we should have had we 're going to come back and play better than this on thursday detroit better be ready adelman takes some blame the trail blazers wilted in the final 7 minutes because they could not stop isiah thomas from scoring , and because they could not score themselves thomas had 16 of his gamehigh 33 points in the fourth quarter , displaying again why he is one of the league s premier pressure players thomas made a 3point jump shot to tie the game at 94all , a 18foot jumper to put the pistons ahead to stay , and another 3pointer to give detroit a 9994 lead with 1 minutes 32 seconds left if he s going to make shots like that down the stretch , we 're going to lose , said rick adelman , portland s coach but i do n't know how many times he can do that once thomas took over , portland abandoned its set offense , forcing shots and making turnovers adelman admitted he made a strategic error by not calling more plays in the final minutes for kevin duckworth , portland s 7foot center duckworth finished with 17 points , but did not score in the final quarter trail blazers are outrebounded we did n't go to kevin until we got behind , and that was a big mistake on my part , adelman said that s my fault , that s not the players' fault i do n't know if they have anybody who can guard him another major concern for adelman was that portland was outrebounded , 5446 the trail blazers were the league s leading rebounding team in the regular season but tonight the pistons were more aggressive , more determined , and more physical than portland the pistons are the league s best defensive team , and they may be the most physical if the trail blazers do not have an answer to detroit s physical play , they will have difficultly winning a game on detroit s home floor the pistons are 100 here during the playoffs we ca n't get dominated on the boards like that , adelman said we would have been up by 15 or 20 points if we had rebounded the way we 're capable of you must box them out you must get them away from the basket we were a little too relazed out there this is the first time the trail blazers have trailed during a series in this year s playoffs none of their players , nor adelman , have ever been to the finals before , while the pistons are making their third consecutive appearance in the championship round the trail blazers insist they have come too far to lose confidence now i have no problem knowing how our players respond , adelman said we feel we should have won this game we 're disappointed , because i thought we were in control of the game but one thing we 've learned in the playoffs is that you ca n't dwell on the previous game i think we 've already shown this is not going to be as easy for detroit as some people thought it was going to be

dallas , june 21 in the mid1980 s the stonebridge ranch , a 6 , 250acre development planned as a sprawling community of milliondollar homes , scenic golf courses and 13 manmade lakes , symbolized the vigor of the north texas economy and the optimism of the aggressive savings and loan that poured an estimated 330 million into buying and upgrading the property the federal government on wednesday agreed to sell stonebridge ranch , 30 miles north of dallas , to a japanese industrialist for 61 million the savings and loan that once backed the development so eagerly was seized by the government 18 months ago , after it was declared insolvent the losses of nearly 270 million will be paid for by the american taxpayer the sale is a striking example of the losses the government is likely to face as it sells off the real estate it has seized from insolvent savings and loans a crucial element in the federal bailout of the industry we taxpayers are n't going to realize anything close to our cost in stonebridge and hundreds of other similar projects , said frederick e roe , a dallas investment manager it s probably typical of what we can expect in the future the short history of how stonebridge ranch absorbed and then lost so much money is a story of the unrestrained ambition of local developers , heedless lending by aggressive savings executives , and the connections between the two groups prominent shareholders in this case , the story includes politically prominent texas businessmen who were important shareholders in the savings and loan that backed the development robert s strauss , chairman of the democratic party during the carter administration his son , richard c strauss , and j livingston kosberg , a nursing home owner and an active fundraiser for the democratic party in texas although their roles have been examined by regulators , none of the three have been charged with misconduct in the failure of the gibraltar savings association and its parent , the first texas financial corporation , or in the losses suffered by stonebridge ranch the new owner of stonebridge ranch , assuming a bankruptcy court approves , is yukio kitano , an industrialist in osaka , who has large real estate holdings in hawaii real estate experts said it was the largest investment by any japanese business in texas real estate mr kitano s agent , george meyer , said his client hopes to persuade japanese manufacturers to put american operations at the site he said that part of the site is zoned for light industry and that the government had kept the property in beautiful condition since taking control of it there s not a blade of grass out of place , he said he said mr kitano visited the site for the first time last week he could see the possibilities , and he just loved it , mr meyer said the area is near a cluster of offices of american corporations the j c penney company is building its new corporate headquarters within 15 minutes of stonebridge ranch sprawling suburban office complexes of large companies , including the fritolay division of pepsico inc , the electronic data systems division of the general motors corporation and texas instruments inc also are nearby mr kitano won the right to buy stonebridge in a competitive auction other bidders included the mobil corporation and h ross perot , the texas computer entrepreneur government defends price for its part , the government says that given today s real estate market in texas , the price was reasonable the sales price we received is a good indication of the market value of the asset , said frank campagna , a government official who has acted as manager of the project the 270 homeowners living at stonebridge ranch have apparently suffered little from the development s financial troubles the sidewalks , roads , golf courses , hiking trails and lakes are already built the development is designed for some 27 , 000 homes and apartments , with the management company selling land to private contractors , who then build homes on the lots since it opened in 1988 , the prices of lots sold to home builders have risen somewhat still , by the time the project opened the development funds were already sunk into the stonebridge ranch and real estate prices had plunged from the levels of a few years earlier a symbol of ambition stonebridge ranch was the most ambitious real estate undertaking that executives and owners of gibraltar savings conceived for the fastgrowing texas economy in the early 1980 s mr kosberg had acquired gibraltar and the first texas savings association by 1983 and soon handed to richard strauss , a realestate developer and member of the first texas board , the responsibility for transforming stonebridge from thousands of blueprints into a gleaming reality the younger mr strauss , fortified with a loan of more than 100 million from gibraltar , outbid mr perot for the stonebridge property in 1984 real estate professionals said mr strauss , who headed a real estate subsidiary that was wholly owned by gibraltar , paid 17 , 000 an acre at a time when nearby parcels were finding buyers at more than 30 , 000 an acre the north texas economy was booming along with the finance , military and aerospace industries , and this prairie farmland far beyond north dallas was considered some of the most valuable in the state
following are excerpts from the text of the decision by commissioner fay vincent in the matter of george steinbrenner commissioner s decision on march 20 , 1990 , my office instituted an investigation of the circumstances surrounding the relationship between george m steinbrenner , iii , the principal owner of the new york yankees baseball club , and howard spira this investigation was precipitated by press reports that mr steinbrenner had paid spira 40 , 000 , culminating a three year working relationship summary of decision i conclude that mr steinbrenner s payment to mr spira in january 1990 , and his undisclosed working relationship with spira and the private investigation of spira s allegations conducted by and at steinbrenner s direction between december 1986 and september 3 , 1987 , constitutes conduct that is not in the best interests of baseball such conduct constitutes a violation of major league rule 21 \( f \) , which is incorporated in the major league agreement to which mr steinbrenner is a signatory my decision in this case derives from two fundamental and , in my view , indisputable premises \( 1 \) an owner of a major league baseball club may not initiate and maintain for months , without the knowledge of the commissioner , a working relationship with a known gambler in furtherance of a private investigation aimed at a ballplayer or an affiliate of a ballplayer and \( 2 \) an owner of a major league baseball club may not pay a gambler for information intended to be used in a dispute involving the owner and a ballplayer in his testimony before me , mr steinbrenner conceded errors of judgment both at the beginning of his dealings with mr spira and at the end with the payment to this individual in essence , then , this decision is largely the result of admitted misconduct by mr steinbrenner , although there is ample evidence from other sources supporting the conclusion i have reached judging candor some may argue that nothing very serious is involved in this case that mr steinbrenner erred but not egregiously that there are worse problems in baseball and that these errors do not warrant a strong punitive response i strongly disagree i sat through the two days of mr steinbrenner s testimony and i am able to judge the degree of candor and contrition present in this case i am able to discern an attempt to force explanations in hindsight onto discomforting facts and i am able to evaluate a pattern of behavior that borders on the bizarre when mr steinbrenner began his association with mr spira and private investigation of mr winfield , he in effect disregarded the office of the commissioner he ignored the proper course of conduct , which was to advise commissioner ueberroth promptly and fully of the overture by spira rather , even accepting mr steinbrenner s version of the facts , he waited several months perhaps as many as nine before partially advising the commissioner s office i find that conduct unacceptable no commissioner can permit or encourage an owner to run his own investigation into serious matters that are within the jurisdiction of this office , and baseball has long forbidden the kind of association with a known gambler that permeates this case furthermore , there is no issue of notice or warning here mr steinbrenner admitted to me that in these circumstances he would not again do what he did in 19861987 he would come to me or to my successor i find the transaction that culminated in the payment to mr spira to have been a serious error of judgment , and i must impose correspondingly serious sanctions as a consequence mr steinbrenner knew that the payment to mr spira was illadvised because all his advisers spoke against it he knew mr spira was or had been a gambler it matters not which and yet he made the payment he knew mr spira claimed he had been promised money or a job or both , and yet mr steinbrenner made the payment , thereby validating the claim that mr spira was being paid for providing information he knew the payment , if exposed , would look bad and he knew , or at least should have known , that , if the payment were exposed , it would bring disrepute to him and therefore to baseball as a result , efforts were made to cover it up no clear intention mr steinbrenner admits an error of judgment but contends he never intended to hurt baseball or to act not in the best interests of our game when he paid mr spira my response to this is twofold first , his intentions cannot easily be discerned from the conflicting evidence before me while mr steinbrenner now claims he was extorted and feared possible violence directed against him and his family , neither of his two principal advisers , philip mcniff and william dowling , testified there was extortion involved in the payment i also note that mr spira , who mr steinbrenner contends provided solid information , claims he was promised future consideration in their first meeting in december 1986 these claims of fear and of extoriton are not credible
when you spend a lot of money for a car , certain things are to be expected you get fancy trim , maybe leather you get performance and , generally , you get hightech electronics and mechanical doodads when you spend a pittance , as we all know , you get none of these things but we are all sometimes wrong , too , as in the case of subaru s minicar , the justy , whose econocar persona carries some very exotic technology indeed the justy was introduced as a twodoor hatchback in 1987 and revamped for 1989 to house america s only constantly variable transmission , known as a cvt , or , in the electronically controlled subaru version , as an ecvt the idea goes back to the late 1800 s and is a neat one , transmitting power through a belt that rides on variablediameter pulleys the advantages are compact size , few moving parts , low weight and an infinite variety of ratios to perfectly match vehicle loads to engine speeds , all without shifting gears years of experimentation meant little , though , in the absence of other highly advanced technology , and as with so many things , it is the computer that has made the cvt a practical invention subaru , produced by fuji heavy industries of japan , came to the united states in the 70 s and has long been something of a technological maverick , what with pancakeflat engines , hillholder manual transmissions to prevent the vehicles from rolling backward on an incline , and the first passenger cars to sport fourwheel drive for 1990 , justy also has been given optional allwheel drive , which means that subaru is the only company to offer both frontwheel and fourwheel drive versions of every car it sells this year , justy also adds a fourdoor to its line , as well as a fun justy that takes aim at the younger subcompact buyer fuel injection now feeds gas to the threecylinder engine , eliminating coldstart and driveability problems and reducing exhaust emissions as a nice side benefit power is up by more than 10 percent , and while there are still only 73 horses under the hood , the tiny engine is one of the few that puts out one or more horsepower per cubic inch actual displacement measures 12 liters , and the engine takes fuel in genteel sips depending on the model , the transmission and whether the car has frontwheel or fourwheel drive , the mileage figures range from 29 , city , to 37 , highway with only three cylinders , the justy is a long way from being a hotrod , but it is reasonably competent on the road larger wheels and tires were part of last year s redo , and the car is no longer bouncy or skittish there are bucket seats up front , and interior room has been increased still , the justy is only 12 feet long , and that makes it perfect for city driving , while the added power makes it usable , if not ideal , for trips fully dressed , the car weighs only 2 , 090 pounds , and acceleration from 0 to 60 mph takes about 12 seconds with the standard fivespeed transmission the ecvt is about a second slower , but the trip is interesting the difference between a transmission with gears and an ecvt without them is like the difference between a threeway light switch and one with a dimmer control the constantly variable transmission uses stepless ratio changes and there is a smooth and uninterrupted flow of power to work its magic , the transmission uses a pair of pulleys and a metal belt that runs in the valley of each pulley one flange of each pulley is anchored to its hub , but the other slides in and out , expanding and narrowing the v , thus moving the belt up and down to alter the drive ratios hydraulics , controlled by a computer , move the flanges perhaps even more amazing is the magneticpowder clutch that connects the ecvt to the engine it consists of a drum that is bolted to the engine s crankshaft and that houses a rotor and a cargo of fine steel powder the rotor is connected to the ecvt a magnetic coil is mounted on the drum , and when it is activated by a computer the magnetism solidifies the powder , locking drum and rotor together demagnetized , the powder is once more just dust , and the rotor is free to spin when a driver presses the accelerator , the clutch locks up when the car slows to a halt , the clutch disengages simple , what \? the ecvt option adds 540 to the justy s base sticker of 5 , 866 fourwheel drive costs another 700 , and airconditioning is the other bigticket item at 750 so you can figure that a loaded fourdoor will roll out of the dealership for about 9 , 300 these days , that is what we mean when we talk pittance
washington , april 25 the food and drug administration said today that it had reconsidered its longstanding opposition to the idea of testing for aids in the home and would accept applications for approval of test kits dr paul d parkman of the fda said the agency was already considering one application to market a test that would allow people to draw a blood sample at home , mail it to a laboratory and get the results anonymously over the telephone the agency had opposed the concept of home testing mainly because it questioned the reliability of the test results and the quality of the counseling available over the telephone , he said but dr parkman said in an interview that the recent availability of treatment for those infected with the aids virus , particularly those who have early or no signs of the disease , has made it more important to identify people infected with the aids virus who might be reluctant to be tested at clinics or doctors' offices some concerns still felt the drug azt has been approved to treat acquired immune deficiency syndrome and potentially improve the duration and quality of life of those infected with the virus in addition , other promising therapies are being tested , and numerous drugs are available to treat symptoms of the incurable disease it seemed to us that with the availability of azt to treat patients , we were being too restrictive in dealing with home tests , said dr parkman , director of the agency s center for biologics evaluation and research but we are not entirely convinced that the concerns we had before are not still valid dr parkman said the change in policy came only coincidentally with the settlement of a lawsuit by a company that had proposed a home aids test on april 10 , university hospital laboratories corporation of bethesda , md , agreed to drop a federal suit that sought to compel the fda to accept and review its application to market a test in the settlement , the agency agreed to review the application within 120 days elliott j millenson , founder and president of the company , said he was delighted with the fda s change in policy this means that millions of americans who are reluctant to be tested in conventional settings may get a way to be checked for aids mr millenson said this could help avert inadvertent aids transmission and get infected people to seek treatment what it will contain the proposed university hospital laboratories test kit includes a sterile lancet for drawing blood , filter paper to absorb the sample , a crushproof shipping container for samples , a prepaid shipping envelope addressed to the laboratory , a detailed instruction book and a tollfree phone number to call for results dr parkman said the major concern about home sampling remained the quality of the counseling available over the telephone and how well the ramifications of positive test results can be conveyed mr millenson said studies have shown that people can receive and understand medical results over the telephone he said some doctors already gave patients the results of aids tests this way millions of americans currently get crucial health information via the telephone , such as those who call suicideprevention lines , crisis centers and poisoncontrol numbers , he said 'instant' results opposed the fda said it had sent almost 30 letters to companies and individuals who have expressed varying degrees of interest in home bloodcollection kits , explaining that it was modifying old guidelines that restricted aids testing outside professional healthcare centers and saying it would consider applications for other testing methods dr parkman said the agency was not softening its opposition to home testing kits that would check blood samples and give a result instantly , tests that are theoretically possible although none has been formally proposed there is not much enthusiasm about any test where you would get the result at home without any counseling , he said frankly , i do n't know if we 'd even consider an application for such a test when we talk of a change in policy , we are definitely not talking about this kind of test
jim palmer and joe morgan , two highly deserving and relatively uncontroversial ballplayers , are to be inducted into the baseball hall of fame tomorrow , but the focus of attention for many remains the moral issues of the candidacy of pete rose and shoeless joe jackson in the past week , the credentials of rose his plaque , if he ever gets one , would surely mention that he was called charlie hustle during his 24 years in the game have been debated in light of his recent prison sentence for tax evasion the debate has been a continuation of the arguments set forth after rose was banned from baseball last august by commissioner bart giamatti for acts detrimental to baseball those acts included betting with illegal bookies , and , though not stated in writing but expressed verbally by the commissioner , betting on baseball , and possibly on reds games , when rose was manager of the team and in an article titled , one man out too long , in the august issue of gentleman s quarterly , wilfrid sheed writes in support of jackson s canonization in the hall jackson was banned by judge landis from the game as one of the infamous eight black sox who , as members of the chicago white sox , threw the world series in 1919 the belief here is that rose should be in \( he is eligible for election by the baseball writers of america next december \) and that jackson , despite sheed s engaging argument and the sentimental movie , field of dreams , relating to jackson s ghost returning from that clubhouse in the sky , should remain out a fact in rose s case is that there is no evidence or even the merest suggestion that ballplayer rose ever gave less than his best , let alone threw a game what rose did off the field , in regard to tax evasion , was a matter between him and the government one of the six qualifications on the hall s ballot says that a player will be judged on integrity , sportsmanship , and character if these would be narrowly applied , a bunch of guys would be thrown out , including ty cobb , whose career hits record rose broke , who is said to have sharpened his spikes in order to cut down infielders when he slid into bases sheed notes that jackson , whose career batting average is third in history to cobb and rogers hornsby , is still , after 70 years , being punished from entry into an edifice that did n't even exist when he was banished and because of the iniquitous reserve clause , which was eliminated in 1975 , the underpaid jackson , as well as the seven others involved in the scandal , had no room to maneuver , wrote sheed , no bargaining power whatsoever throwing games was the only form of protest available at the time a primitive kind of doitallyourself strike , in which you used the only thing you had , your baseball skill , to subvert the people who were using you though jackson hit 375 in the world series , which his white sox lost , five games to three , to the underdog cincinnati reds , he did admit that he had a lousy series he also admitted taking 5 , 000 in bribes , and was miffed that he never got the rest of the 15 , 000 the gamblers had promised him but jackson denied , as he saw his legend growing through the years , that he had dumped games yet , in testimony to the grand jury sept 28 , 1920 , that was reported by news agencies and appeared in newspapers around the country , he said i am the left fielder for the sox when a cincinnati player would bat a ball out in my territory , i 'd muff it if i could but if it would look too much like crooked work to do that i 'd be slow and would make a throw to the infield that would be too short my work netted the cincinnati team several runs that they would never have made if i had been playing on the square the argument here is that the hall of fame should be reserved for those who never fixed or attempted to fix a game any of the other business about role models off the field is just so much junk and banality meanwhile , jackson s otherwise lofty records have not been expunged from the record books , nor is he a nonperson in the hall itself there are photographs of him , and even a pair of his baseball shoes rest in a glass case , proving that shoeless joe was actually shoeclad joe jackson may have been an illiterate and sometimes guileless man , but he was not inexperienced he was a spiffy dresser , demanded and got a drawing room for road trips that befitted a star , and was 30 years old and had been in the major leagues for 12 years before the 1919 world series years later , eddie collins , a second baseman on the white sox whom the gamblers knew they could n't get to go along with them , accepted none of the several reasons for excusing jackson and the others they were old enough to know the difference between right and wrong , he said photo pete rose
san francisco most of his 49er teammates had the look of little kids who had been playing in candlestick park s muddy slick grass they had mud on their scarlet jerseys , mud on their golden khaki pants but as joe montana stood in the 49er locker room after yesterday s 303 dissection of the rams , his pants had only a thin smudge along the right thigh \( as if he had dried his passing hand there \) and another smudge along the red stripe down his left leg some tiny splotches soiled his left kneecap but the backside of his pants was as clean as if it had just come out of a washing machine were you knocked off your feet at all \? he was asked i think once or twice , he said early in the game surgeons have been messier coming out of an operating room and that s exactly what joe montana was yesterday , a surgeon with a scalpel in completing 26 of 30 passes for 262 yards and two touchdowns , it was as if he were making incisions in the rams' defense that had baffled randall cunningham of the eagles and had stifled phil simms of the giants but figuratively , the rams could n't touch montana and literally , they hardly touched him now the denver broncos will be confronted with trying to disrupt joe montana s precision and the 49ers' opportunity to be the first repeat super bowl champions since the pittsburgh steelers of the 1978 and 1979 seasons oddly enough , in montana s time as a 49er quarterback , the broncos have won all of the teams' four regularseason games only one involved a 49er team that went on to win the super bowl , a 1613 loss in candlestick park in 1988 before those 49ers straightened out in bill walsh s last season as coach but the broncos , already installed as an 11 1 2point underdog by las vegas oddsmakers for super bowl xxiv in new orleans , might have a better chance of an upset if it were n't for their 40 record over the 49ers since the 1979 season over the next two weeks , the 49ers will tire of hearing questions about why they have n't been able to beat the broncos , even though hardly any of the current 49ers were involved in all four losses just tired enough to add to their original motivation of wanting to win two consecutive super bowl rings as well as the franchise s fourth of the decade throughout the season , most of these 49ers have tried to downplay the idea that they 're obsessed with earning another super bowl ring but their rookie coach , george seifert , has talked about how it s been a quiet battle cry among the players since training camp began and their 299pound offensive tackle , william \( bubba \) paris , acknowledged that during last week s preparations for the rams , his teammates were saying , if we mess up this week , it 'll take us two years to try again another motivation for the 49ers is to win a super bowl , as their longtime linebacker , keena turner said , without bill walsh if only to prove that the players are as important as the coach walsh last week described this 49er team as the best 49er team ever and one of the alltime great teams in national football league history seifert , formerly the defensive coordinator , is only the third rookie head coach to produce a super bowl team the others were don mccafferty with the 1970 baltimore colts , who won , and robert \( red \) miller with the 1977 broncos , who lost for the 49ers , seifert s takeover has been a factor in their being able to thwart the malaise that has leveled so many super bowl champions the next season , a combination of too much overconfidence , adulation and money in short , not enough competitive hunger if bill were still the coach , we would have known what to expect , montana has often said but with a new coach and some new wrinkles in our system , everybody had to spend a lot more time in the playbook just enough subtle changes to make everybody buckle down some changes may have been subtle , but some were substantial especially in montana throwing to so many different pass receivers , as he did yesterday in guiding the 49ers to a 213 halftime lead that all but assured the victory in the process , he hit 18 of 21 passes for 198 yards and two touchdowns , spreading the ball among seven receivers but none of the passes produced more than 20 yards , the distance of his first touchdown pass to brent jones , a tight end uncovered by the confusion in the ram secondary jones , along with john taylor , a swift wide receiver , and tom rathman , the fullback , were inserted into the passing offense this year by mike holmgren , the new offensive coordinator the jets have been granted permission to talk to holmgren about their head coach s job , but not until after the super bowl is over i think if bill walsh were still our executive vice president , he would 've let me do it , holmgren said of the strategy change but it could 've created problems if he were around like the problems ucla basketball coaches had when john wooden was still in the office but when bill went into television , it made it easier we involved other receivers in order to exploit the doublecoverage on jerry rice and roger craig and when we came back to win on the road in tampa , philadelphia and new orleans , the players realized it was business as usual business , in fact , was better than ever as montana s passing rating of 1124 set an nfl season high during a 142 record and with six touchdown passes in this super bowl tournament , including four in the 4113 rout of the minnesota vikings , montana s 31 postseason touchdown passes have established an nfl record , one more than terry bradshaw had even though joe has played so well , bubba paris keeps saying , we still think he has not played his best game yet that s just something for the denver broncos to think about in watching all those films of the 49ers' surgeon with a scalpel
austin , tex , feb 4 the times have been few and far between when university of texas fans could complain about a scarcity of tickets to a longhorn basketball game for that matter , it has been awhile since the southwest conference itself could generate much excitement in the sport but as arkansas prevailed over texas , 10396 , in overtime this afternoon , passion for basketball seemed abundant here and around the swc a capacity crowd of 16 , 231 at erwin center experienced a range of emotions this afternoon as the longhorns , the conference s secondplace team , took on arkansas , the leader without an swc loss , in a wild shootout that featured a scuffle and a coach walking off the court in the closing seconds of the game to protest officiating , then coming back after his team had tied the score streak reaches 11 arkansas , ranked no 3 in the newsagency polls , extended its winning streak to 11 games and all but locking up its second consecutive regularseason conference championship this was the greatest win of my career , bar none , said nolan richardson , the arkansas coach it s just wonderful to come into texas and play a great team and pull off a victory like we did here today but richardson almost certainly made his share of enemies this afternoon when he walked off the court with 13 seconds left in the game , to protest an intentionalfoul call that he believed was sealing a razorback loss with texas leading by 8483 , lee mayberry of arkansas was called for an intentional foul against lance blanks explains his motive the intentional foul is always a tough call , and it s a real tough call to make in a game that s going down to the wire , richardson said i just did n't want the official to decide who won the basketball game asked if walking out or pulling one s team off the court to protest officiating might be considered bad sportsmanship , richardson , who also left the court in a game against texas a m this season , said , a lot of coaches have left the court benford williams , a texas guard , said i felt like he was giving up his players , and giving up on the game but what it did was really motivate them to play harder as a team richardson s departure was met with boos and taunts , which were replaced by even louder cheers when blanks made both foul shots texas retained possession of the ball , and the longhorns' travis mays was fouled with 12 seconds left but he missed the first shot of a oneandone , and arkansas got the rebound mayberry , the country s leader in 3point fieldgoal percentage , wound his way up court , spun left , spun right , and with blanks right on him , fired a 3point shot that hit nothing but net the basket tied the score with four seconds left and , as it turned out , sent the game into overtime coach is retrieved the arkansas managers sprinted to the locker room to bring richardson back to more taunts and boos for the fiveminute extra session the texas coach , tom penders , complained that richardson should have been awarded a technical foul for leaving the court but the officials said that since the arkansas coach left during a deadball foul situation , no technical was called for when coach does something like that , it pumps us up more , said oliver miller , the arkansas center in addition to being a test of the state of the swc , the game was a barometer for how far the longhorns have come since penders became their coach in 1988 last season , his first , the longhorns were 259 and finished second in the conference the previous season , they were 1613 and finished fourth pressure defense decisive tempers flared several times today , and there was a scuffle in the first half , though no one was ejected once the game went into overtime , arkansas s pressure defense , which forced 25 texas turnovers , finally took its toll penders , while unhappy about the loss , said he was satisfied that the conference was beginning to attract attention the southwest is where the big eight was , about four or five years ago , he said there s tremendous interest in basketball now there was n't five years ago
the soliloquy is at least as old as shakespeare , but it was not until the late 18th century that johann christian brandes , a german actor and playwright , invented the monodrama a short solo entertainment often accompanied by a chorus , it was used to lengthen an otherwise brief evening of theater undoubtedly , brandes would have been amazed at the varieties of the genre 200 years later stages of all sizes and plays of every description are inhabited by a single actor or actress performance artists imitators of historical or literary figures standup comics and sitdown monologuists clowns , puppeteers and jugglers , and roleplayers in works by dramatists this season , the monodrama is especially widespread on and off broadway , with eric bogosian in sex , drugs , rock roll , robert morse as truman capote , bob kingdom as dylan thomas , geoff hoyle in an evening of clowning and the monologuist david cale in the nature of things coming up soon off broadway are alec mccowen in a return of st mark s gospel , and len cariou in a oneman play about justice william o douglas and almost every evening there is someone taking the stage , solo , at one of the experimental theaters like performance space 122 , dance theater workshop or the kitchen many monodramas are intentionally comic therefore that label might be considered misleading perhaps another name should be used monotheater , or solo theater when it is at its best , as in mr bogosian s current show , or hal holbrook s mark twain tonight or short plays by samuel beckett , it is theater of a very high order when it is not , monodrama can become a monodrone some of the reasons for the proliferation of the form are obvious it is inexpensive to produce , although in the case of jay presson allen s tru , not all that inexpensive in this oneman play , mr morse is surrounded by elaborate scenery , recreating capote s riverview apartment most oneman shows are portable and can adapt to many environments and a range of theatergoers , although some audiences may hesitate about paying full price to see one person \( value for dollar depends on the nature of the performance \) a selftailored monodrama can be either an actor s dream , promising an annuity \( between other engagements he can tour it \) or an actor s nightmare \( between tours he cannot get another engagement \) almost every performer wants one , but few find a solo show that is remunerative as well as artistically rewarding in writing on the subject of soliloquies in drama , max beerbohm said that talking to oneself has a drawback it is supposed to be one of the early symptoms of insanity while drawing no judgments about the mental state of monodramaticians , one can note that there is an obsessive side to any solo theatrical performance , especially if the play is written by the performer , even more if it derives from his own life in recent years , the sharpest solo plays have been those honed by performers themselves , like mr bogosian , spalding gray , john kelly , fred curchack or michael moschen something more than opportunity must project a performer to work on stage alone , without benefit of buffer , with no one to provide cues or reactions selfabsorption is the key to the oneperson performance the actor must have empathy with his material and he must be able to communicate his zeal to the audience when mr mccowen recalls the story of the gospel , it is as if for the first time he is a reporter back from the front lines his performance must have that air of heightened ingenuousness although ingenuousness would probably be the last word one would normally use in describing mr bogosian , this extraordinarily knowing writer and actor remains open to any unsettling experience it is unlikely that a more pertinent commentary on everyday fears and angers will come along this season confronted by mr bogosian s subway panhandler demanding a handout while promising not to steal or kill , new yorkers are struck by a flinch of recognition the normal reaction when faced with such a character in real life is to pretend to be otherwise engrossed from here , it is a quick march to mr bogosian s other acidulous portraits the smug english rockandroller the fasttalking hollywood operator who makes an art of sleaze , and , most scarifying , the derelict who offers a delirious diatribe on society s selfpollution and the human cesspool of our cities mr bogosian is a direct descendant of lenny bruce \( today bruce might be considered a performance artist \) and among his peers is lily tomlin one basic difference between such monologuists and standup comics is that they are acting they are not telling jokes directly to the audience , as is the case with jackie mason a masterly mimic of men in the street , mr bogosian richly populates a stage with character and language , savoring slang in a manner that would have appealed to h l mencken mr bogosian , ms tomlin and other postmodern monologuists like david cale are at least subliminally indebted to ruth draper , who in the first half of this century was celebrated for her onewoman character sketches , which she acted on an almost bare stage as long ago as johann brandes , the monodrama was a virtuoso piece for one actor , exemplified earlier this season by fred curchack s stuff as dreams are made on in this oneman reinvention of the tempest , mr curchack played all the roles \( and included a tripart dialogue among prospero , caliban and ariel \) , while also manipulating puppets and changing the lighting effects it was a polymorphous performance worthy of a prospero visual puns it is one step from puppeteers like bruce d schwartz to those who manipulate objects in performance they might be called performance fetishists high in their legion is stuart sherman , whose tabletop shows are filled with visual puns and metaphors on occasion , he also operates on a grander scenic scale , while maintaining the essence of his hermetic art , as in his reduction of the work of chekhov , strindberg and others to a single definable image \( cutout trees for chekhov , which , on cue , fall down \) there is an absolute precision in his seemingly dadaist canvas
nicosia , cyprus , june 11 following is the text of the palestine liberation organization statement issued in tunis today , as translated from the arabic by the associated press the new israeli government is a war cabinet and a cabinet of oppression for our people it is also a cabinet for the collaborators the dangers posed by this government on palestinian , arab and international levels is apparent in the program it has announced it is an extension of the previous governments , which have rejected all peace initiatives , for its head is none other than shamir , who has rejected all the international peace initiatives , including the 10point egyptian proposal and the baker plan , despite the fact the palestine liberation organization had responded positively and in a high spirit of responsibility to these initiatives the plo is still committed to all its obligations declared in geneva in 1988 and to the peace process on the basis of international legitimacy and palestinian peace initiatives everybody knows that this is a government of warmongers and extremists to prepare for a war against the arab countries and escalate aggression and expansion in the occupied territories the recent arab summit meeting made it clear that it rejects the state of nowar , nopeace , concentrating instead on the palestinian peace initiative which has been reconfirmed by this and the previous summits with a view to sparing the region catastrophic war with weapons of destruction that are proliferating in our area , be they conventional , nuclear or other kind of weapons hence our concept of peace and prevention of a possible catastrophic war this is the line we still adhere to the plo position remains unchanged we are against any military action that targets civilians , whatever form it may take and whatever the results of such actions we also condemn the israeli crimes and massacres against our workers and children , women and people that increase day by day as a result of protection that the us veto provides to israel , and the continued american support of israel
before his other troubles began to unfold , george steinbrenner sat in a hotel room in boston six weeks ago and announced his decision a risky one , he conceded to make changes now , the youth movement he talked about finally might be taking effect although steinbrenner feared a fan revolt , believing that no one would pay good money to see jim leyritz and kevin maas in pinstripes , none has occurred instead , the yankees have shown life leyritz , maas and oscar azocar the latest of the rookie callups combined for six hits and three runs in the yankees' 53 decision over the kansas city royals yesterday at the stadium and they are still a good draw despite the 1 o'clock start , there were 32 , 246 in attendance azocar , who was summoned from class aaa columbus on sunday , had a single , a double and a home run and is now hitting 800 after two games in his bigleague debut tuesday night , he had a pinchhit single azocar is the sixth rookie to join the yankee roster this season , and his impact has been as great as most of the other firstyear players leyritz had two hits yesterday and is now batting 297 maas is at 300 , and deion sanders , although hitting just 152 , has offered a small spark since moving to the leadoff spot in the batting order on monday they 're going out and playing , and it s contagious , said the yankee manager , stump merrill we had all kinds of opportunities to win this game , and it can get frustrating but they do n't quit merrill is surprised merrill was more surprised , though , by his sixthinning ejection , his first since he became manager on june 6 he was thrown out arguing a call by rocky roe , the umpire at second , after roe initially called leyritz safe on a stolenbase attempt then immediately reversed his decision he called my guy safe , and then he called him out , merrill said he told me that he can reverse his decision i said 'if there was a balk last night , can you reverse that , too \? the kid balked last night how about that \?

eric gregg , the ample umpire , sat down to a diet lunch thursday gregg , of the national league , had gained nearly 200 pounds in the last 15 years and was up to 390 pounds in april that s a goodly amount , even for someone who , like gregg , stands 6 feet 3 inches in a midtown restaurant now , gregg observed the simmering dishes carried past his nose by waitresses i 've seen three different plates , he said , and i want all three of 'em , especially that last one , with the pasta and shrimp he was n't going to eat all three dishes , however , and he donned a pair of brownrimmed glasses to read the menu better this place looks good , he said then he glanced up hey , he said to his companion , is this some kind of setup \? i gotta weigh in today and he laughed but as light as he hoped to make the situation , eric gregg is in a struggle with food , and he understands that his job , not to mention his life , depends on the outcome the national league makes gregg weigh in once a week bill white , the president of the league , told gregg earlier this year that if he did n't lose weight white eventually wants him down to 250 pounds that he would n't get any assignments it was white , along with richie phillips , the head of the umpires' union , and gregg s wife , conchita , who , as gregg recalled , all piled on me , insisting last april that he do something serious about his weight problem they suggested a clinic , the duke university diet and fitness center gregg was resistant he believed he was performing his job as well as anyone else even better than most and did n't have to go away somewhere to control himself umpiring is judgment , common sense , knowledge of the game , he said there are guys who look like arnold schwarzenegger and they ca n't umpire but the league was thinking not only of its image , but also that gregg s poundage hampered his mobility on the field , to get as quickly as possible to the scene of action gregg , however , did n't want anyone messin' with his livelihood i had come too far for that , he said gregg , as he details in his recently published autobiography , appropriately titled working the plate \( morrow \) , written with marty appel , grew up in the bottom , a bleak ghetto in philadelphia , and strove to become only the third black umpire in major league history i always wanted to be somebody , gregg said at the restaurant table , and very few people in my neighborhood even dreamed of getting out when i was 13 , i told my family , 'one day i'm going to be on television' my mother said , 'the only way that 'll happen is if you sit on it' i walked out of the room gregg had two sisters , one of whom still lives in the bottom , while the other died of a drug overdose his brother , ernie , is in prison for armed robbery bart giamatti , the national league president before white , had also urged gregg , who is now 39 years old , to lose weight , which would help to lower his high blood pressure bart said , 'you 're young , you have a wife and four kids who love you none of us wants to lose you that fat is n't healthy , ' gregg recalled i knew he was right , and i said , 'ok , what should i eat \? ' he handed me a blank piece of paper he said , 'that s what you should eat' so i crumpled up the paper and ate it gregg laughed that piece of paper was n't the pizza supreme that he loved , with everything from black olives to pepperoni , sausage and anchovies on it , and it was n't the dodger dog in dodger stadium that is , he said , awesome , or those great hotel cheeseburgers with chips he formerly ordered up late at night , but it was something , and for years gregg rarely passed up anything to eat in 19 seasons as a professional umpire he began in the national league in 1975 , at 205 pounds he had never missed an opening day , and did n't want to break that string but in april , just before the season began , he agreed to attend the duke center in durham , nc he stayed seven weeks and lost 55 pounds he returned to the field june 12 , and is currently in new york for the metsreds series at shea stadium gregg is down to 335 pounds , and although his arms and neck still look beefy , he still , oddly , gives a sense of agility in dieting , he said , it s not how much you eat , but what you eat i eat calories , and spread them out over three meals i'm allowed a minimum of 1 , 800 calories to 3 , 000 max a day he ordered the angel s hair pasta with shrimp , a salad with vinaigrette dressing and a diet soda he placed his white napkin in his shirt and went to work when finished , not a shred of lettuce or a strand of angel s hair remained in either of the two big bowls excellent i'm impressed , he said , dabbing with his napkin at the corners of his mouth and it was only 500 calories well , 600 , tops phoro eric gregg \( associated press \)
connecticut has pulled out more stops than usual for black history month in hartford alone , half a dozen or more shows are scheduled current attractions include a retrospective by the photographer gordon parks , at the state legislative office building a juried show by local black artists , at the pump house gallery in bushnell park , and free man , a documentary about the successful rebellion of a group of africans on board the spanish slave ship amistad and the american antislavery movement , at the connecticut historical society come thursday , the state commission on the arts presents its own selection of black artists , at the showcase gallery two shows share the space at the aetna gallery jacob lawrence s toussaint l'ouverture series and photographs taken by the jazz musician milt hinton jacob lawrence , who is in his 73d year , was born in atlantic city but spent his formative years in harlem , studying at wpasponsored art workshops there before proceeding to the american artists school it was the depression , but for harlem it was also a kind of golden age , and white people came to harlem for the work of musicians , writers and artists , including the portrait photographer james van der zee though he was too young to participate in the harlem renaissance , the young lawrence benefited from it , becoming a star himself with his first series , migration of the negro the series of pictures , first exhibited at edith halpert s downtown gallery , led to lawrence s first major solo , at the museum of modern art in 1944 , after he had served in the coast guard then came a guggenheim fellowship , followed by the first of his jobs as a teacher of art , at black mountain college in north carolina , and , in 1960 , the first of his traveling retrospectives lawrence s ascent was remarkably swift , yet for all the acclaim and honors , it seems to this observer that he has not been accurately appreciated for example , though he was born five years after romare bearden , he has always seemed the elder of the two , and his work , while it appears to have influenced bearden s , has not acquired a comparable cachet both men were affected by cubism and both have focused on black themes , but bearden , being more concerned with art for its own sake , went through several phases , abstract and figurative , before achieving his mature style lawrence , on the other hand , has been a narrative painter from the start , and his approach has changed hardly at all it may be this , coupled with an outlook more moral than political , that makes so many cherish him as a kind of folk artist many of his works challenge this assumption , but except for his harriet tubman series , another early effort , none do so as effectively as the gouaches of toussaint l'ouverture , the former slave who led haiti s revolt against napoleon all but one of the 41 pictures , which were painted in 1937 and 1938 , are in the same range of colors black , white , grays , ochre , dull red , pinks , mauvegray , blue and green the story , told by the artist s captions as well as his paintings , begins in 1492 with columbus s planting the spanish flag on haitian soil two inhabitants stand lassoed , so to speak , by rosaries , and a priest wielding a large cross is at hand next is a scene of a stockade where one figure dangles from a gibbet and others await their turn led by their queen , anacanca , the haitians , who have resisted enslavement , are getting their deserts from time to time , lawrence veers toward allover abstraction one example is the poster commemorating the amistad revolt , a recent commission from aetna that is included in the show others are the gouaches of guns stationed in the jungle belching puffs of smoke , and of soldiers marching in tight formation through long grass france and spain fight over haiti for the second half of the 17th century , but by the 1730 s peace is restored , or so it appears in the scene of the snappily turned out woman , umbrella in hand , shopping for slaves she stands , looking every inch the consumer in a quandary as the salesman points out the great buys huddled on the ground it is hard to decide which is more appalling the almost comic complacency in this picture or the cruelty in the picture of a whitesuited slave master flogging the life out of a bound victim one of the most poignant and beautiful images is that of toussaint s birth , in 1743 alone in her pristine cabin , his mother sits up in bed gazing down at the white bundle in her arms perhaps , lawrence had in mind his own mother , who raised him and his siblings as a single parent as a youth , the hero cuts a modest figure , educating himself , studying abolitionist tracts and , later , working as a coachman it is in this capacity that he helps his owners escape the first major rebellion , led by jean francois then toussaint , joining the rebellion , metamorphoses into a dashing figure dressed in a red coat , white britches and a hat with three white plumes , and mounted on a white horse in the portrait of him as a general , in a plumed hat with a dark uniform an image that can truly be called an icon he has become a leader as charismatic as his nemesis , napoleon , who makes his appearance looking somewhat disheveled in a cobaltblue uniform against a yellow background lawrence has no rival when it comes to expressing emotions through color toussaint l'ouverture won the war and established a black government only to have france , under napoleon , resume the conflict though victorious again , the haitian leader was somehow captured \( as told by the captions , the action gets confusing at this point \) and in 1802 was sent to prison in france in one frame , he stands at the window of his black and blue cell , leaving his food uneaten on the floor in the other , the year is 1803 and the general lies face down on his bed , having starved himself to death where other artists might have thought in terms of billboards , lawrence has conveyed the epic on 41 sheets of paper , each measuring roughly 12 by 18 inches milt hinton was 13 when he got his first violin and 26 when in 1936 he got his first big break as a bass player in cab calloway s band and having acquired a camera about the same time , he began taking it on the road with him the results , annotated with his comments , are an autobiography packed with jazz greats mr hinton takes a damnthetorpedoes approach , seizing the moment without much regard to composition or focus these large black and white images , most of them taken in recording studios , may not be beautiful , but they look true and sometimes dramatic catching tyree glenn and chu berry on a north carolina street in 1940 , mr hinton makes sure that the restaurant sign above their heads that advertises hot dogs and hamburgers for colored only gets into the picture and even when the musicians are taking a break , the sense is of hard but rewarding work in progress louis armstrong , dizzy gillespie , benny goodman , jo jones , lester young , tommy mitchell and doc severinsen are among the performers backstage at the 1971 newport jazz festival ,

washington , may 3 in a narrow victory for marion s barry jr , the mayor s supporters tonight beat back an effort by the city s democratic leadership to keep him from seeking reelection because of his personal and legal problems a resolution proposed by the executive committee of the district of columbia democratic state committee was turned down by a vote of 29 to 23 after two hours of sometimes raucous debate the closeness of the outcome and the fact that the party s leadership had formulated the resolution underscored recent polls indicating that the mayor is in serious political trouble because of his indictment on five misdemeanor charges of drug possession and three felony counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his drug use , and because of his admission that he is addicted to alcohol and several prescription drugs mayor suspended his campaign the mayor did not attend the meeting and could not be reached for comment on the resolution but his office released a letter in which he told the party s leaders that the measure was undemocratic and divisive committee resolutions have little influence on my decision about my political future , he added mr barry had intended to run for a fourth fouryear term before his arrest in january , but he delayed a decision pending the outcome of his trial , scheduled to begin june 4 in the meantime , he is showing up at a wide array of civic and political functions , seemingly doing all he can to keep a high profile opponents of tonight s unsuccessful resolution argued that the party leadership should take no stand on candidates until after the democratic primary on sept 11 'not this committee s place' it s not this committee s place to take a stance or to tell anyone , marion barry included , whether or not to run , said harry thomas jr , a leader of the city s young democrats organization proponents of the resolution countered that it was the duty of the party leadership to take a stand , particularly in the mayor s case , because his legal problems threatened the party s political fortunes we cannot keep the mayor from running , said mildred goodman , a member of the executive committee we can only give the mayor advice on what we believe is in the best interests of the city and the party to date , five candidates have filed to run in the democratic primary polls indicate that none have broken decisively from the pack should he reenter the race , mayor barry could be a serious primary contender , because that contest can be won by a plurality
washington , june 28 the state department and the central intelligence agency have concluded that any loosening of canada s federal makeup as a result of the nation s constitutional crisis would affect a broad range of security , trade and environmental ties between washington and ottawa the reports , completed in the last few days , make clear that there is no immediate threat to the relationship that the united states has with canada , its largest trading partner but they emphasized the effects of fraying canadian unity on the relationship over the long term we 're highly concerned , said a senior state department official who deals with united statescanadian relations we would be highly distressed if canada broke up this situation has major implications for the united states in the long term he was alluding to an array of treaties ranging from security to drug enforcement that extend across the world s longest open border a question of relations strains on canada s unity intensified last weekend with the collapse of guarantees that would have tied quebec more firmly to the rest of canada by granting the frenchspeaking province a special status those strains have led to pessimistic thinking among canadian specialists in washington who are accustomed to working on less volatile issues in none of these projections do american officials view a potentially independent quebec as hostile to washington but they make the point that coordinating crossborder relations between two sovereign states was complicated enough and to have three involved would alter old balances and require complex renegotiations of treaties , agreements and understandings the officials volunteered that they had great respect for quebec s premier , robert bourassa they said they regarded him as a moderate whose views on politics , economics and canada s involvement in nato would be palatable to washington if he were to lead the province to independence or greater autonomy but they said a more realistic problem was that many provinces might follow quebec s example , creating a formless confederation scholars express concern similar concerns were expressed by scholars seymour martin lipset , the stanford university political scientist , noted that 60 percent of the people of quebec favored independence and estimated that there was a one in four chance of quebec s becoming independent such a development , he said , would put canada in the old pakistan situation , in which the country was split in two by a country in between that , in turn , could heighten cultural and political divisions between eastern and western provinces and lead some provinces , particularly newfoundland , to apply to washington for statehood most experts doubt that quebec will leave canada soon none of the reports recommended intervention in the quebec issue , although united states officials are privately urging officials in ottawa and quebec to do as much as possible to hold together whatever happens up there affects us , said charles doran , director of canadian studies at johns hopkins university we do not want to see a weak , embittered , fragmented canada mr doran said a balkanization of canada would complicate commercial relations , especially if private companies based in quebec began asking for government subsidies the stakes are high joseph jockel , professor of canadian studies at st lawrence university , said best case , this is a headache for the united states worst case , we 'll have to deal with several sovereignties on our northern border while it is generally conceded that no change in the relationship is immininent , the stakes are so high that canadian affairs will now become an issue of greater concern among these stakes are issues like the joint management of the great lakes , large flows of investments running both ways , closely coordinated antinarcotics policies , and aerial and naval defense as partners in the norad defense system protecting the waters , air and land in the north , canadian and american armed forces work within a single command structure in addition , american experts believe that canadian hydroelectric power , much of it already coming from quebec , will be critical for the northeastern united states and with the 1988 free trade agreement between the united states and canada working out better than expected , united states officials say , bilateral commerce will be vital to the nation s economic health mr jockel , a canada scholar at st lawrence university , said it was conceivable that the quebec crisis could split canada he noted that bill danderzalm , premier of british columbia , said earlier this week that his province would also consider moves toward autonomy he added that there were also feelings of resentment against central control in saskatchewan , manitoba and alberta willard workman , an officer at the united states chamber of commerce who deals with canada , said he was resolutely upbeat about american trade with canada despite the troubles in quebec we take something of a hit if quebec becomes independent , he said , but added that canada would remain an attractive place to do business he played down speculation that canada might spin apart in the years to come charles colgan , an economist at the university of southern maine , said canadian options for staying together as a country are shrinking but the united states will adapt to what emerges
pilots and flight attendants on many airline routes are exposed to more radiation than most workers in nuclear power plants , new government studies show in power plants the government imposes extensive safety requirements , including education , monitoring and procedures to minimize dose , but no such limits are applied for the flight crews concern over radiation from the sun and the stars for both flight crews and passengers was stated more bluntly than ever in a report made public monday by the department of transportation for airline personnel , the report likens the level of risk to that from working in cabins filled with cigarette smoke the report also noted a higher risk to very frequent fliers on long trips and to women in early pregnancy although scientists emphasize that the effects of low doses of radiation are uncertain and nearly impossible to measure in the population , several conclusions are clear from the report , as well as from the draft of a warning published late last year by the federal aviation administration and from research by experts outside the government aviation officials have rejected requiring protective measures but may do so now the new studies seem likely to spur further action , though airline employee unions are split on the importance of the issue the radiation doses received by the flight crews vary with the altitude and latitude the higher the plane is flying and the closer to the poles , the higher the radiation doses experts say no shielding would stop the veryhighenergy radiation to which air travelers are exposed , but monitoring devices in the cockpit could warn when it would be helpful to fly at a lower altitude to evade the radiation these devices would be useful because the sun s output of radiation varies widely , and a few times each decade the levels rise high enough to be of concern to women who fly just once during pregnancy but even for pilots and flight attendants , scientists say , the additional risk of cancer carried by the radiation exposures in flight is modest as against the overall cancer rate for instance , the transportation department study predicted that among 100 , 000 crew members who spent 20 years flying 960 hours a year on an eastwest domestic route of more than three hours , 59 to 61 premature cancer deaths would occur among 100 , 000 passengers flying 480 hours a year on the same route , or about 9 hours a week , 29 or 30 additional cases of cancer would occur the rate of cancer from all causes would be about 22 , 000 in that group pregnant women told to avoid some trips moreover , dr michael e ginevan of geomet technologies inc , of germantown , md , who made those calculations , said that since the report was completed in december , new findings based on cancer rates among survivors of hiroshima and nagasaki had tripled or quadrupled the expected incidence of cancer from lowlevel doses if i were a woman in the critical period of pregnancy for retardation , i would tend to avoid flights to europe , dr ginevan said scientists say the most critical period is from the eighth week of pregnancy to the 15th week dr andrew horne of the faa s office of aviation medicine said in a telephone interview we think it would be appropriate to educate people , particularly pregnant crew members who may be flying it might be appropriate for some to consider alternate routes or leaves of absence although there is a mechanism the faa could use to warn the pilots to fly lower , during peak periods of solar activity , it has never been put in action exposure can be higher than at nuclear plants on some routes , the annual radiation doses for crews are higher than the averages for workers in a nuclear power plant , medical office or industrial setting where xrays or radiation sources are used , the experts say dr robert j barish of the division of radiation oncology at new york university medical center says radiation levels in a jetliner are occasionally so high that in a nuclear plant they would require signs warning of high radiation and instructing workers not to spend any longer in the area than necessary to do their jobs concern among scientists is rising , because in the last few years researchers have doubled their estimate of the damage to cells caused by neutrons these subatomic particles are prevalent at high altitudes in addition , planes today fly for longer periods at higher altitudes , with less of the atmosphere to shield them from cosmic sources of radiation , specialists say the concorde and corporate jets , which fly even higher than standard passenger planes , are especially vulnerable more and more planes fly between north america and asia or europe over the north pole , where radiation levels are four times those at the equator because of the effect of the earth s magnetic field dr barish said some sort of forecasting was needed , for example , to help pregnant women decide whether to fly on a particular day solar radiation peaks every 11 years , and at a handful of times in the cycle radiation fields are so high , he noted , that the dose on a single flight can exceed the recommended monthly maximum for a fetus
medjugorje , yugoslavia , sept 23 the vatican has warned that churchsponsored pilgrimages to this mountain village are banned , but that has not stopped roman catholic pilgrims from crowding into medjugorje , where the virgin mary is said to have been appearing daily to four young people for the last decade promoted by countless books , brochures and videotapes , medjugorje \( pronounced mehdjoogoreyeh \) has become yugoslavia s hottest tourist attraction , a hardcurrency wellspring whose yearly cash flow even church and government officials are loath to gauge since 1985 , the number of communion wafers distributed annually at st james church here has more than doubled to over a million , parish records show but in a recently published letter , joseph cardinal ratzinger , head of the vatican s office on doctrine , warned that the church forbids official pilgrimages to medjugorje this ban has been interpreted to mean that catholic parishes may not organize tours and that priests , nuns and lay church workers may not officially lead pilgrimages here until the vatican makes a pronouncement on the apparition s authenticity such a pronouncement may be years off private tours organized the cardinal s warning has not dampened the fervor with which st james s franciscan priests promote medjugorje and the messages of peace that the virgin is said to be delivering catholics circumvent the ban by organizing private tours accompanied by clergymen cast as spiritual advisers the franciscans' ardor has rankled the local bishop , who says the apparitions are a franciscanperpetrated hoax propaganda in favor of medjugorje is being rushed in order to place the church and the world before a 'fait accompli , ' bishop pavao zanic said in a statement detailing his personal objections to the reported appearances no one even mentions that which throws doubt on the 'apparitions' once a poor peasant village , medjugorje has taken on the trappings of a bustling beach town , complete with kitsch mongers and bedandbreakfast places the streets are jammed with tour buses , campers , cars and pilgrims 'the greatest propaganda' the majority of the pious public has naively fallen victim to the great propaganda , the talk of the apparitions and the feelings , the bishop said in his statement these people themselves have become the greatest propaganda for the event they do not even stop to think that the truth has been hidden by deliberate falsehood they do not know that not one miraculous healing has occurred that could have been verified by competent experts these are all outright lies , said the rev ljudevit rupcic , a franciscan priest , pointing at bishop zanic s written statement none of the bishop s arguments hold any water when people compare them with the books and studies that have been written about medjugorje , said father rupcic , whose latest book on medjugorje , his fourth , rebuts the bishop s charges the dispute between the franciscans and bishop zanic over medjugorje is just the latest skirmish in a church turf war touched off a century ago when austria occupied bosnia and herzegovina and took steps to establish a catholic diocese in the region , said the rev vjekoslav milovan , secretary of the yugoslav bishops' conference the franciscans have been working with the region s catholics since the middle ages , he said they forged strong bonds with the villagers and resented vienna s push for the establishment of diocesan parishes and the appointment of nonfanciscan bishops , he said ivan dragicevic , one of the four who report seeing the virgin , said that the virgin appears to him in three dimensions standing on a cloud and that on occasion he has even touched her on a recent evening , mr dragicevic and marija pavlovic , another of the four , knelt in a cramped room in the church bell tower and began saying the lord s prayer aloud and in unison to prepare for the vision twice during the prayer they slipped into several minutes of silence and stared up toward a wall where they said the virgin appeared occasionally , mr dragicevic nodded his head and muttered a few sounds after both periods of silence they resumed their prayer at the same point the whole thing is an ecstasy , the 25yearold mr dragicevic said , adding that his conversations with the virgin have lasted 5 to 30 minutes many lives are changed authentic or not , there is little doubt that the medjugorje apparitions have changed many lives my friends thought i was becoming crazy and fanatic , but my heart just pulled , pulled , pulled , said milona von habsburg , a 32yearold archduchess in austria s former ruling family who abandoned a job in a fashionable geneva auction house to do volunteer work in medjugorje the rev theodore cassidy from st joseph s parish in sykesville , md , who has made several trips to medjugorje , said there is so much happening here , so many stories , so many events , that it s hard to put it all together most priests have doubts about this when they first come but i believe it there is an awful lot of good that comes from it , he said you can see it in improvements in family life and people giving up drugs no one has to believe this , but i would encourage people of all faiths to come here , and they should be ready to change photo roman catholic pilgrims have been pouring

st helena , calif normally the introduction of a new chardonnay by a napa valley winery causes no great interest here , especially at harvest time when winemakers are working seven days a week and keeping a wary eye on the weather but when the winery is sutter home , which starts selling its first chardonnay today , vintners from modesto to mendocino have to take notice the runaway success of its white zinfandel blasted sutter home s total sales to 37 million cases in 1989 from just 34 , 000 cases in 1980 sales this year will probably exceed four million cases already more than a onewine company , sutter , based in st helena , about an hour and a half drive northeast of san francisco , introduced its brands of cabernet sauvignon , sauvignon blanc and chenin blanc in 1987 it rapidly became one of the five biggest brands in each of those varietals , which are wines based on a single type of grape it is also the largest red zinfandel brand so when sutter home s proprietors confidently predict that theirs will be the no 1 chardonnay in the united states within two years , they are taken seriously i think they can do it , said paul gillette , a wine industry consultant and publisher of the wine investor , a trade newsletter having built the great brand they have in white zinfandel , they cannot help but succeed in chardonnay striking a chord sutter home is shipping 380 , 000 cases of the 1989 vintage to 17 areas it considers important markets , including new york city it plans to ship more than 600 , 000 cases of the 1990 nationwide next spring when the 1991 vintage is ready , the winery plans to ship more than a million cases the top chardonnay producer now , the glen ellen winery , in glen ellen , will ship about 12 million cases this year sutter home made its white zinfandel into the bestselling varietal even as wine critics dismissed it as a sweet , insipid patio wine but the wine , actually a pale pink color because it is made by fermenting the juice of red zinfandel grapes with the skins removed , struck a chord with the public the company s strong marketing and promotion efforts insured the rest while most of its neighbors were striving to prove that california cabernets could beat the best bordeaux in blind tastings , the trinchero family of sutter home was happy to show that white zinfandel could stand up to beer with a barbecue we believed in white zin from the start said louis \( bob \) trinchero , 54 years old , sutter home s chairman and chief executive we never thought it was a fad but growth in the sales of the company s white zinfandel has slowed to about 4 percent a year , and with sutter home established as a national brand , he said the time seemed right to add other wines we realized we have a presence now , he said there was no reason not to expand beyond white zinfandel 'fighting varietals' sutter home held off on chardonnay because high demand and short harvests in 1987 and 1988 meant there were simply not enough chardonnay grapes available at any price to meet sutter home s needs the winery began buying vineyard acreage suitable to chardonnay , and locked in enough of the abundant 1989 vintage from other growers to enter the market now the first sutter home chardonnay is made with about 15 percent of its own grapes , and will sell for about 5 that puts it squarely in what wine sellers call the fighting varietal category of wines that are packaged in corktopped 750milliliter bottles , but priced lower than typical premium wines these wines came on the market in the early 1980 s when there was a glut of bulk chardonnay , and consumers found many to be good values in addition to sutter home , robert mondavi winery , also of st helena , is introducing a chardonnay in its lowerpriced woodbridge line , and the giant e j gallo winery of modesto is making a major push in chardonnay this fall with sales growing 20 to 40 percent a year , chardonnay has defied the downward trend afflicting the wine business as a whole this is partly because the wine has benefited from the trend toward moderation that has consumers drinking less but better and partly beause bar customers learned how to say , i 'll have a glass of chardonnay , instead of just asking for a white wine aged in stainless steel some industry analysts expect chardonnay sales to continue growing , from about seven million cases this year to double that by 1995 each year more vineyard acreage is planted in chardonnay grapes , but not every soil is wellsuited to the varietal and many of the lowerpriced wines no longer taste much like chardonnay while sutter home s base in st helena is in the heart of the napa valley wine growing region , the grapes for its chardonnay , like others in its price range , come primarily from vineyards farther inland nevertheless sutter home s product has abundant chardonnay character it is fermented and aged in stainless steel rather than oak , so that it has none of the butterscotch and vanilla overtones found in more expensive brands still , the characteristic flavor of the chardonnay grape is clearly there and the wine comes across as light and clean
mozart worship is , on the whole , a healthy thing it testifies to the possibility that vestiges of good sense may still be found in modern society still , it does no harm occasionally to face the truth even he sometimes had to produce music when the fires of inspiration flickered low one such work , der schauspieldirektor , a jocular singspiel known in english as the impresario , served on tuesday evening as the centerpiece of the opening concert of this summer s mostly mozart festival the piece , written for a lavish party thrown by emperor joseph ii at the schonbrunn palace in vienna in 1786 , shared attention on that occasion with salieri s opera buffa , prima la musica e poi le parole \( first the music , then the words \) because much of the original schauspieldirektor consisted of excerpts from current plays and feeble jokes about vain singers , virtually all modern performances are drastically edited and streamlined the englishlanguage version presented by mostly mozart was translated , adapted and directed by andrew porter , the new yorker music critic , and conducted by the festival s music director , gerard schwarz werner klemperer , as the impresario , handled the narration in an aptly arch and imperious style , holding the tenuous production together by sheer professionalism he even contributed a few lines of onkey singing in the vaudeville at the end though here he was topped by the orchestra s principal bass player , michael g morgan , whose surprisingly sonorous voice and insouciance provided one of the night s flashes of real humor after the incongruously powerful and familiar overture , this impresario fell off steeply in interest the two sopranos , sally wolf and frances ginsberg , went well beyond satire into burlesque as they worked to make their rivalry comical the point of dispute , not an uncommon one in opera history , was an argument among the impresario and the singers over fees and billing unfortunately , mozart s librettist , gottlieb stephanie , found little fresh fun in that situation and mostly mozart s updated version could not do much more than raise a giggle now and then as when miss wolf , a light soprano , bragged that one of her best roles was brunnhilde perhaps because the spoken dialogue was heavily amplified to let the english words come through , the two sopranos may have felt pushed to match the microphonic levels they frequently forced their voices into the harsh brightness that avery fisher hall s acoustics easily provokes when voices or instruments are driven at high volume almost none of the singing , presumably also in english , could be understood and no text was provided both sopranos negotiated mozart s high coloratura with effort , as if parodying divas in vocal extremis vinson cole , in the role of herr birdsong , the tenor who tries to mediate between the rivals \( madame heart and mademoiselle silvertone \) , was a steadying presence in the trio one sample of the production s humor mr vinson was awarded an incongruous audition number , dalla sua pace from don giovanni , a work composed a year after der schauspieldirektor he managed to sustain it , if only barely , despite a painfully slow tempo the allmozart program , which began with an admirably precise though rather unbending performance of eine kleine nachtmusik , concluded with the piano concerto no 25 in c \( k 503 \) alicia de larrocha , whose annual presence is one of the decorations of this festival , now in its 24th season , gave a performance notable for its aristocratic restraint and drypoint elegance , an effect underlined by miss de larrocha s choice of a particularly leantoned , brittle instrument although pressed a bit by a fleet tempo in the enigmatic opening movement , she conspired with mr schwarz to remind the listener that in 1786 mozart was up to better things than occasional music calculated to divert the emperor and his guests mostly mozart festival orchestra gerard schwarz , conductor alicia de larrocha , pianist frances ginsberg and sally wolf , sopranos vinson cole , tenor werner klemperer , narrator at avery fisher hall mozartserenade in g \( k 525 \) \( eine kleine nachtmusik \) the impresario piano concerto no 25 in c \( k 503 \) photo gerard schwarz conducting in the opening concert of the mostly mozart festival \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
baltimore until now , perhaps the most maligned entrepreneurs in this city were its tin men , the fasttalking aluminumsiding salesmen depicted in a 1987 barry levinson movie of the same name but if some newly proposed legislation is enacted , the tin men may be displaced by lawyers this month the maryland state senate voted overwhelmingly to require lawyers to include disclaimers in their advertisements , whether in newspapers , on television or matchbook covers if lawyers sell themselves like cigarettes , the legislators seemed to say , their pitches should also carry appropriate warnings the proposed disclaimers mention nothing about heart disease , cancer or emphysema instead , they would simply state , the decision to seek legal services and choose a lawyer is extremely important and should not be based solely upon advertisements or selfproclaimed expertise the bill , which now goes to the state house of delegates , provides that the warnings be printed in at least 9point type slightly larger than what you 're reading on television the disclaimer must appear continuously on the screen maryland would not be the first state to enact such rules they have been on the books in iowa since the infancy of lawyer advertising , and a similar measure is pending in florida but in the hotly contested market of baltimore , where lawyers fight for cases the way gunning s and bo brooks vie for lovers of steamed crabs , the proposal has generated a vicious debate , including charges of elitism and antisemitism the bill is the brainchild of state senator george w della jr of south baltimore none of his constituents have ever complained about the ads , except perhaps over how often they interrupt their latenight movies to listen to mr della , it s more a matter of theoretics and esthetics for instance , there is a commercial run by the firm of saiontz kirk it shows an accident scene with flashing lights and crashing sounds and sirens if you have a phone , you have a lawyer , the ad declares that leaves the impression that you should call a lawyer before you should call an ambulance for your loved ones in the car , mr della said then there are the ads of stephen l miles , who is to baltimore s personal injury bar what victor kiam is to electric razors the most aggressive advertiser of them all , spending more than 1 million a year his most recent ad focuses on his feet , showing them emerging from a car is that him \? a voice asks breathlessly look , that s him ! another says in wonder the feet are shown walking into a courtroom , where a judge asks sternly , are you ready to proceed , counsel \? in fact , he s raring to go do n't just call a lawyer , the announcer declares call former assistant state s attorney stephen l miles that last line , mr della contends , hints that mr miles can push buttons with his old cronies mr miles takes the legislation personally the bill is designed to put me out of business , he says he told the baltimore sun that the bill was total bull and noting that virtually all of the leading lawyer advertisers are jewish , he accused mr della of antisemitism if the nine biggest lawyers advertising in baltimore were n't jewish , i do n't think this bill would have been introduced , mr miles said mr della called that charge way out of line and said mr miles had made it out of total desperation seconding him was the president of the maryland state bar association , herbert s garten anyone who interprets the action as an act of antisemitism is guilty of reckless and baseless accusations that are a disservice to the lawyers of this state , he wrote mr della both mr miles and donald saiontz , of saiontz kirk , hint darkly that mr della is a pawn of the plaintiffs' lawyershating insurance industry , a charge he denies but they also see the paw prints of their fellow lawyers , notably those who do n't advertise and do n't like losing business to those who do ten of the 13 lawyers in the state senate supported the della bill if you were joe chevrolet , and jerry chevrolet down the street was on television every night , you would ask your favorite state senator to undercut him by loading them down with baggage , said mr saiontz , a onetime classmate of mr levinson and , he says , the model for a character in the film maker s earlier baltimore movie , diner if mr della is so concerned about misleading advertising , mr saiontz said , he should include disclaimers in his own campaign ads asked about that , the senator equivocated well , he does n't advertise on television , he said how about placing them in his print ads \? he would , he said , if the law required him to but would he do it voluntarily \? he paused , then said he had no such plans now drawing
forget , for the moment , the difficulty the mets continued to have with pitchers named smith note , but only briefly , that barry lyons , the mets' catcher , actually threw out two wouldbe basestealers , albeit one with an umpire s assistance savor , with only a quick taste , the way the mets won the game in the ninth inning , with the 6foot5inch , 220pound mike marshall scooting down the firstbase line to avoid an inningending double play all of those elements of the mets' 21 victory over the atlanta braves last night were interesting and worth pondering but none compared with the development of the game the pitching that pronounced with the greatest of emphasis that the real dwight gooden has stood up as dave johnson , his manager , said afterward you do n't need to speculate about the injury he s certainly back gooden , pitching eight innings , allowed only three hits , only one after the first inning , and struck out 10 in a most majestic manner the fact that he did not receive credit for the victory was meaningless his pitching contained more meaning than any mere victory could a hop on the fastball his fastball was jumping , an admiring marshall said , having viewed the performance from his vantage point at first base it was riding he was just overpowering you could see the jump on the fastball it got threequarters of the way there and it was n't straight it was jumping up and away from the hitter gooden , who lowered his earned run average from 675 to 476 , could have pitched another inning , johnson said , but it s a little early for that while he was in the game , though , gooden brought back memories of the devastating pitcher he has been in the fifth and sixth innings , for example , with runners in scoring position and two out , he struck out oddibe mcdowell and tommy gregg his strikeout of gregg , with jeff treadway at third base , was particularly reminiscent of the way he used to fire a third strike past a batter when he needed an out in the seventh inning , gooden offered a glimpse of another of his weapons the twostrike curveball that freezes the hitter and drops into the strike zone for the third strike as the hitter watches helplessly he did it to ernie whitt , the veteran catcher , and he did it to jeff blauser , the young shortstop those were the second and third outs of the inning and parts of a string of five successive strikeouts the braves scored their run against gooden in the first inning on a single by treadway , a wild pickoff throw by gooden and jim presley s twoout double the mets finally tied the game in the fifth , but they did n't exactly overwhelm pete smith , who matched zane smith s recent effectiveness against the mets for montreal after the mets went down in order in the first four innings , darryl strawberry , leading off , walked , stole second , went to third on a wild pitch \( which seemed more like a passed ball \) and scored on a fly to right field by kevin mcreynolds after lyons threw out lonnie smith on an attempted steal for a strikeout double play in the braves' half of the ninth , the mets went to work right away on mike stanton mark carreon lined a pinchhit double to left field , then stopped at third as howard johnson blooped a single to left strawberry popped out , and stanton walked mcreynolds intentionally , loading the bases with the infield in for a play at the plate , marshall hit a ball off the end of his bat that looked as if it might sneak through for a single but blauser made a diving stop , turned over and flipped to treadway at second for the second out my biggest priority was to distract him as much as i could , mcreynolds said but his footwork was n't that good at the bag marshall said the play took longer than normal to develop because of the angle and that helped him beat the throw to first the fact that he beat the throw enabled carreon to score the winning run the mets went into the game having thrown out only two of 31 basestealers lyons got mcdowell at third only because charlie williams , the umpire , said he did television replays clearly showed that mcdowell beat the throw bullpen stint for darling bob ojeda , the oddmanout of the mets' starting pitching rotation , had company in the bullpen last night ron darling is missing a start because of the days off in the mets' schedule , and manager dave johnson assigned him to relief duty for last night s game and tonight s game darling started last friday and wo n't start again until next tuesday , giving him 10 days between starts the plan did not delight darling i understand it numerically , he said i understand the reasoning as they tell me an argument can be made against it it s not watertight i do n't feel like i deserve it , but davey is trying to establish an identity here there are guys he s going to go with and go to it looks like i'm not involved
washington , july 15 when judge thomas penfield jackson of federal district court here learned that he had been selected to preside over the drug and perjury trial of mayor marion s barry jr , he said he had two immediate thoughts it was going to be an exciting episode in his judicial career , and he would have to sequester the jury i knew it would receive virtually unprecedented press coverage and stimulate an awful lot of commentary from a number of different quarters , he said in a recent interview to the extent that it can possibly be accomplished , you have to make sure the jury decides the case on the evidence adduced in the courtroom judge jackson s efforts to shield the jury produced an interesting constitutional sidelight to the barry trial and ended up making new law on the limits a trial judge faces in controlling events in the courtroom in an effort to insure that the jurors focus only on the evidence presented to them , judge jackson sought to bar from the trial the rev louis farrakhan , the leader of the nation of islam , and the rev george a stallings jr , leader of a black catholic congregation that has broken from the roman catholic church both men had proclaimed that the barry prosecution was an effort by white prosecutors to topple a strong black leader but a federal appeals court , ruling on an issue that had never been raised in the same way before , said judge jackson could not keep the two men out just because their presence might send a message to the jurors austerity and quips the setback has not seemed to affect judge jackson s demeanor on the bench his businesslike , austere bearing regularly yields to a broad smile as he trades quips with lawyers to lighten the trial s mood he said in an interview that he had no quarrel with what the appeals panel did , but he speculated that the judges might have ruled differently if they had had his experience as a trial judge none of the three judges on the appellate panel has ever conducted a trial i'm acutely aware of the extent to which i govern the lives of the jury , judge jackson said i tell them when they can get up in the morning , when to breathe , what they can listen to and , in this case , where they can live in explaining his decision to try to keep out mr farrakhan and bishop stallings , he said , i did n't want the jury to sense there are people who bear them ill will who are scrutinizing them from the spectator section a reagan appointee appointed to the bench eight years ago by president ronald reagan , the 53yearold judge is described as fair and meticulous by several lawyers who have practiced before him he takes his job very seriously , said one lawyer who has clashed with him and who spoke on the condition of anonymity he is a strong presence during a trial , but like many judges , he is sometimes excessively concerned with controlling what happens in his courtroom to many lawyers , judge jackson is very much the traditionalist whose style owes much to his background as a military officer and his reverence for his father , a prominent member of the washington bar for decades in the barry trial , judge jackson has asked questions of witnesses , as some judges do when they want to speed things or are simply curious rasheeda moore , the former model used to lure mayor barry to a hotel room where he was videotaped smoking crack , referred several times on the tape to jello spectators and reporters wondered if that was a code word for drugs , but neither the prosecution nor the defense had asked her before she left the stand , judge jackson asked her to wait a moment was jello a secret word for drugs \? he wanted to know no , unhunh , she replied she was just talking about dessert presided over deaver trial judge jackson presided over the 1988 trial of michael k deaver , the former top reagan aide who was convicted of lying under oath during an investigation of whether he was involved in improper lobbying of former white house associates he tried to close part of the jury selection process to the press and public , but was told by an appeals panel that he could not do so the judge s reasoning was solicitude for the jurors because mr deaver s lawyers had suggested they would claim that his judgment was impaired by alcohol , the potential jurors were to be queried about their own history with alcohol abuse , and judge jackson wanted that portion of the questioning closed to protect their privacy in a decision that sparked much debate , judge jackson decided against sentencing mr deaver to jail , saying he found mr deaver s lobbying and influence peddling distasteful but adding mr deaver does not , however , stand convicted of any crime of influence peddling , and he cannot be punished for it he was found guilty of lying under oath despite having spent much of his boyhood at his father s law office , judge jackson said it was not ordained that he go to law school after graduating from dartmouth college , he joined the navy and was prepared to spend his life at sea but he found himself drawn toward the law , even working with navy prosecutors after four years in the navy , he went to harvard law school , as his father had done , and then joined his father s firm photo judge thomas penfield jackson of federal district court in washington , who is presiding over the drug and perjury trial of mayor marion s barry jr \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
the fourman police car cruised slowly down a block filled with young men and women laughing , smoking languidly or perfecting their stylized aerobic prancing to the beat of house music from a nearby nightclub the car crept by no one broke rhythm the club was the red zone on west 54th street just hours before the sunday dawn , but it could have been almost any club that caters to an under25 crowd there was no trouble in sight not at the red zone , not at several other manhattan clubs visited saturday night only the usual mixture of loud music , winsome flirting and energetic dance routines but talk to these young men and women , and they sometimes speak of danger as if some clubs were neon cocktails mixed with equal parts vibrancy and violence these are the clubs they try to avoid , they say , places where young gang members congregate , where people wear lots of gold , where there have been fights , stabbings and shootings this darker side has been at the heart of growing public concern about new york s nightclubs that concern was crystallized last week by the killing of a utah tourist and the arrest of eight young men who the police say assaulted the tourist s family to get money to go to the roseland ballroom on west 52d street in manhattan but in recent months there have been hundreds of complaints about noise and violence from residents living near nightclubs across the city new security measures in response , the police have increased patrols at some clubs , and club owners have taken a variety of security measures installing metal detectors , searching patrons , checking age identification more carefully and turning away people who look as if they would rather fight than dance the troublemakers , clubgoers say , are members of gangs with names like thirtysix mob , vandals of destruction and dtc , and sometimes they commit robberies to raise the 15 cover that many clubs charge they join the loosely organized groups , known as posses or crews , for the social life and for protection from other gangs inside the clubs fights , fueled by alcohol , can break out , sometimes over women or over perceived insults to manhood , and sometimes between rival gangs the clubgoers say , however , that the menace has been exaggerated by news organizations and that most of the trouble occurs outside the nightclubs some patrons also suggest that some people are simply uncomfortable around the large groups of black and hispanic youths who frequent the clubs you know where to go and where not to go , said yvette dumenigo , a 19yearold bank teller from middletown , ny , who comes into the city nearly every weekend with friends to go dancing at clubs like the palladium , the sound factory , quick and mars on saturday night she was at the red zone , one of the clubs that have prompted complaints about noise 'the goldchain crew' when asked how to tell who the hoodlums are , ms dumenigo gave the same answer as many other clubgoers by all the gold that they wear two police cars were parked in front of bedrox , a club at 316 west 49th street , early sunday morning , a somber reminder of the undercurrent of tension adam , the general manager of the club , said it was reopening under new management on sept 21 there have been problems in the past with fighting outside the club , he said because of what happened at roseland , that s the reason the police are here , said adam , who does not use a last name they 're afraid the spillover will come here in club language we call them the hiphop kids the goldchain crew it s a crowd that just comes to fight angel garcia , 20 , a store clerk who came to the red zone with his friends benny and israel from the upper west side of manhattan , was skeptical about reports of violence in clubs seeking protection all this stuff about the gangs and the clubs and the violence , i just do n't know , said mr garcia they 're not really gangs , they 're more like just groups that hang out together for protection the trouble is outside usually about girls some of new york s 202 licensed nightclubs have come under increased scrutiny since the sept 2 slaying of brian watkins during a subway robbery the police said mr watkins , a tourist from provo , utah , was robbed by eight members of a queens gang called fts , an abbreviation for a vulgar expression gang members wanted money so they could go dancing at roseland , the police said after the shooting , roseland s management said it was ending its disco nights because of pressure from community groups that had complained about the noise and violence city officials have received 1 , 500 complaints so far this year about nightclubs and discotheques that attract large crowds of youths complaints from neighbors the city s department of consumer affairs has received complaints about 18 clubs in the last six months , all but two of them in manhattan bedrox and the red zone were on the list the complaints are mostly from residents and mostly about noise , parking problems and litter or about being harassed or robbed by patrons maurice brahms , a spokesman for the red zone , said residents who complain are simply unwilling to coexist with a nightclub there is no violence here there is none , mr brahms said the problem the neighbors complain about is noise but in nine visits from the environmental control board we 've had one violation , for a noisy air conditioner early saturday morning , a 20yearold man was killed in a driveby shooting outside the emerald city nightclub at 617 west 57th street in manhattan in 1988 , 14 people were shot in two separate incidents at the club when it was known as the red parrot one club that has stepped up security is the island club at 285 west broadway in tribeca , where patrons must submit to a handheld metal detector and a search of their pockets or handbags before gaining entry inside the club , where a thatched roof covers the bar and palm fronds gaily decorate the wall , the mood was mellow on saturday night , but some regulars said things can get rough outside in june , one person was killed and five were wounded when someone fired through a door into the club it was the third time in the last two years that someone was shot to death at island once people get outside , you have no control over what happens , said michael junior , a 22yearold grocerystore stockman from far rockaway , queens mr junior said he comes to the club every night because his brother works there he said trouble at clubs is mostly caused by teenagers who carry weapons and who feel they must prove their manhood by fighting cliques and posses the younger kids nowadays feel they have to live up to the image of the typical new york teenager to be on the streets , to do crime , mr junior said what we have are cliques , posses you have kids from neighborhoods who hold down their neighborhoods , not allowing any other people from the outside to come in and cause a disturbance because this is our neighborhood nowadays , everyone has a weapon still , there are plenty of people like ms dumenigo , the bank teller , who simply goes out to have a good time she finds all the oldfashioned ingredients of romance and excitement under the modern flashing lights i like the way the people here look and i like the music , said ms dumenigo , who sat with friends overlooking the big wooden dance floor inside the smoky haze of the red zone these places are fun photo violence among young gang members at nightclubs has become a growing public concern a police officer was posted on saturday night outside the bedrox club on west 49th street in manhattan \( lee romero for the new york times \)
shanghai last fall , when a minor official of the communist party wanted to gauge the severity of the campaign against intellectuals , she asked about the writer bai hua is he in jail \? she wanted to know , and when she heard that he had been left alone , she relaxed and said , things ca n't be that bad the scarred past of bai hua , a 59yearold poet and playwright , charts the history of china s literary repression , and among intellectuals he remains a symbol of the persecuted , a writer who suffered because he dared to voice his frustration with society a military writer who joined the revolutionary forces when he was 17 , mr bai was singled out during the antirightist campaign in 1957 , attacked again during the cultural revolution , from 1966 to 1976 , and personally condemned by the senior leader , deng xiaoping , in 1981 since then , mr bai , a gentle man whose smooth face is wrinkled only by laugh lines around the eyes , has been relatively quiet , until he was noticed last may in the front lines of demonstrations on the streets of shanghai in sympathy for hungerstriking students in beijing severity goes with fame' i joined the demonstrations , but so did many other people , mr bai said in an interview it s just that people know me , and when i march , the traffic cop spots me severity goes with fame mr bai also signed petitions , and he chuckled as he admitted that he wrote one himself but he quickly added that his petition stressed nonviolence he said he did not take part in organized activities and did not sign political petitions , which he said was partly why the government had not troubled him so far literature in communist china has always been closely tied to politics , but the leadership s policy toward writers has been at times intimidating , at times ambiguous , drifting between encouragement and denunciation , between greater and looser control by the authorities communist leaders have periodically lashed out at some writers , throwing them into prison , banning their books or holding up their works as examples of poisonous weeds the prevailing winds in 1981 , the liberation army daily published an attack against mr bai s screenplay , bitter love , a story about a chinese painter in the united states who returns to china to serve his country , only to find that his love for his nation is unrequited the military newspaper , which took an interest in mr bai as a military writer , indicted the film for its condemnation of china under communism , and mr deng concurred in a speech soon after the criticism signaled a period of greater control over china s literary world , and mr bai published a selfcriticsm the requirements for literature are very high , mr bai said with a tinge of irony literature must keep with the present politics and policies and social morality what you write may be right today , but what about tomorrow \? in china , popularity often grows as government support wanes , and works that are politically correct rarely win the hearts of the people mr bai s fame soared after official criticism of bitter love , even though the novel , published in 1979 , did not elicit a harsh reaction until two years later bitter love appeared during the height of the scar literature , the works that appeared principally in the late 1970 s and exposed bitter memories of the cultural revolution 'radioactive overnight' in china , bai hua s stock went up when he was the target of the campaign , said perry link , a professor of chinese language and literature at princeton university this happens when chinese intellectuals are criticized by the government officially they become radioactive overnight , but unofficially they get more sympathy than they had before mr bai , neatly dressed in a brown sweater , appeared at ease in the interview , even when asked about the sensitive times of his life his lively eyes seemed to dance as he talked , and he looked aside only occasionally , to glance at a page of notes he had prepared on his black clipboard still , he was more subdued in conversation than his writings would suggest sometimes frank , sometimes cautious , he avoided giving opinions about the democracy movement , saying that in the long term the movement may prove to be a trifle he did not explain the movement , nor would he praise or condemn it mostly , he tried to steer away from the topic , perhaps because so much of his productive time has been lost to moments of frankness time at manual labor he was forced to lay down his pen and work in a machine shop for three years after the antirightist campaign against intellectuals in 1957 , and during the cultural revolution he ended up a manual laborer since the controversy over bitter love , none of mr bai s works have aroused national attention one explanation is that he has kept a low profile the other explanation , less kind and offered by some intellectuals , is that he has passed his peak mr bai , who returned in 1989 from a yearlong writing program in the united states , regrets that he did not learn english in those dry periods a great deal of time was wasted , he said i 've been a writer for 40 years but i have only been productive for a little more than 10 years the rest of the time i was isolated from culture staying out of trouble mr bai said it was the threat of repression , as much as repression itself , that has stifled chinese literature asked to name his favorite young chinese writers , he said he had none because of the political climate , he said , chinese authors often steer away from the large controversies and focus on more personal and sometimes trivial aspects of life outside politics they write about themselves , he said it s simpler they do n't think about what they ought to write they just write about their own mental state and describe their inner feelings you can say they do it to avoid trouble mr bai said that he too was sometimes mindful of avoiding trouble , and that he has held off publishing some of his works to be frank , it is not suitable to bring out certain works for the moment photo bai hua is thought of by his colleagues as a symbol of literary repression in china severity goes with fame , said the poet and playwright \( the new york times sheryl wudunn \)
nearly 10 years after its debut , the electric opening number of william finn s breakthrough musical , march of the falsettos , remains emblazoned in memory a handful of leapfrogging young performers , backed by a jazzy band , charged forward on a red stage at playwrights horizons to sing merrily about the neurotic plight of four jews in a room bitching what followed was just as unorthodox march of the falsettos told of marvin \( michael rupert \) , who left his wife and son for a man named whizzer \( stephen bogardus \) only to lose whizzer and to watch his psychiatrist , mendel \( chip zien \) , move in on his abandoned family mr finn and his collaborator , the director james lapine , told this story in 70 minutes of songs that were far more melodious and touching than titles like my father s a homo and marvin at the psychiatrist \( a threepart miniopera \) might immediately suggest you ca n't go home again , of course , yet right at the beginning of falsettoland , mr finn s bracing new installment of the marvin trilogy that began in 1978 with in trousers , that surge of excitement is uncannily recreated and on the surface , little has changed falsettoland is set in 198182 , right after its predecessor the theater is again playwrights horizons , the director is again mr lapine , the running time is again 70 minutes , the stage remains red , the three terrific lead actors are back in place \( looking no worse for wear \) and , best of all , the music and lyrics still ignite as a mobile red door twirls about another emblem of falsettos the company exuberantly welcomes us to falsettoland , a figurative precinct whose landmarks include homosexuals , women with children , a teeny tiny band and one bar mitzvah for marvin s son , jason \( danny gerard \) that is scrupulously planned but just as it would be tedious for falsettoland to keep mimicking march of the falsettos , so it soon proves impossible an intervening decade cannot be stuffed into a closet while mr finn is blissfully back in full voice after several projects of esthetic drift , that voice has inevitably been tempered by time some of his ethnic humor seems a bit strained even as his sentiments about romance in hard times are more deeply felt mr lapine , perhaps reflecting his postfalsettos broadway success with stephen sondheim \( sunday in the park with george , into the woods \) , seems to be directing with more dazzling assurance than ever , creating a kaleidoscopic world of comedy and heartbreak with only seven performers , that red door and , as before , a few rolling chairs the biggest changes , however , are those that befall marvin and whizzer falsettoland is only a few numbers old when the happy reconciliation of these two lovers is clouded by the hospital observations of their friend dr charlotte \( heather macrae \) , an internist who lives nearby with her lover , a kosher caterer \( janet metz \) something very bad is happening spreading round sings ms macrae s doctor in a voice of unsettling , ethereal sweetness bachelors arrive sick and frightened they leave , weeks later , unenlightened what is happening is so bad that words have lost their meaning , she adds in 1981 , the word to describe what is spreading round had , in fact , yet to spread but mr finn finds his own words without losing the sense of humor that made march of the falsettos levitate , he has written an achingly articulate musical that copes with aids much as its characters do with denial , rage , empathy and even some small hope that what marvin s son , jason , calls a miracle of judaism will come to the rescue never maudlin , clinical or didactic but always , in some hardwon way or another , highspirited falsettoland is a musical of jubilance and courage , not defeat it must have taken exceptional fortitude to write , and it is by turns entertaining and devastating to witness this story needs an ending , sings the chipper company in the opening number there are hilarious passages on the way to an ending none could have foretold jason s extended family , who can turn even a catering debate into a conga line , visits a little league game and sings of watching jewish boys who cannot play baseball play baseball jason and mendel perform a highstepping vaudeville number titled everybody hates his parents in which mr zien s delightfully circumspect psychiatrist reassures his stepson that you grow up , you get old , you hate less even after the curtain dominating douglas stein s sleek set has become a hospital curtain , falsettoland does not surrender its right to a joke the evening builds to a bar mitzvah in the philip roth mode , though in jason s case the ceremony also proves to be the stirring spiritual initiation into manhood that satirical bar mitzvahs seldom are mr finn s more sober songs reflect a cultural sea change from falsettos , in which pretty boys were instructed to check for acne and the death of passion was the only one its young lovers feared there are several fullthroated ballads here , led by unlikely lovers , a soaring quartet of devotion in which the musical s paired homosexual couples vow to be scared together in you gotta die sometime , mr bogardus caps an altogether superlative performance with the ferocious , unsentimental blues of a man in his prime facing mortality when the moment comes for marvin to give in to tears and schmaltz and to take the audience with him mr rupert does so with his characteristic , eternally boyish tenderness in what would i do \? , a song that both mourns and resurrects the adored lover for whom he left his wife and child the soulsearching interludes for the heterosexual characters in falsettoland sometimes seem forced by comparison , especially the schematic anthem , heartily delivered by faith prince , in which marvin s former wife rises too easily to saintliness nor is the relationship between marvin and his son so intimately dramatized here as it was in falsettos this time , mr finn seems to broaden his characters a bit to keep them on their best behavior as if aids really did bring out the nobility in everyone and the consequences spill into his score , which , for all the shimmer of michael starobin s arrangements , could at times use more variety and vinegar such flaws do not seriously diminish the overall achievement , which culminates in a chilling finale that inverts the charged opening number so completely that everything from the performers' emotional and physical gravity to the set s red door to the meaning of playful lyrics \( we 're a teeny tiny band \) is transformed by the disease that has in the interim transformed a society this is where we take a stand , sings mr zien as he welcomes the audience to a new falsettoland where lovers no longer just come and go but live and die fortissimo that stand is a defiant one for music , love , laughter and miracles , jewish or otherwise , in a world where something very bad has been happening for so very long falsettoland conceived by william finn and james lapine music and lyrics by mr finn directed by mr lapine set design

pau , france , july 18 greg lemond lost control of the tour de france for 20 kilometers today , but he and his z teammates rallied to prove the adage that professional bicycle racing is an individual sport practiced by teams how lemond managed to save the day , and probably his second successive victory , illustrates the superb teamwork that has surrounded him he earned that cooperation when he found himself trailing a teammate , the frenchman ronan pensec , by 10 minutes only a week ago , lemond played a team game subordinating his personal ambitions and his role as team leader , he gained widespread respect by riding on pensec s behalf together at the finish now his unselfishness is being repaid at the end of the day , lemond was still second over all , five seconds behind the leader because his team labored so hard for him in the pyrenees , lemond was able to make up seven lost kilometers and finish in the same time as the rest of the leaders they were all 5 minutes 31 seconds behind the winner , dimitri konichev of the soviet union , who is rumored to be planning to join the american 7eleven team next season konichev came into pau one second ahead of johan bruyneel third , 11 seconds back after a muggy day in the mountains , was steve bauer , a canadian with 7eleven and the wearer of the overall leader s yellow jersey for 10 days early in the race none of the riders ahead of the leaders are contenders for the final victory the threeweek race ends sunday in paris awaiting next time trial lemond , who is from wayzata , minn , is sounding extremely confident of victory speaking of saturday s time trial , or race against the clock , which is expected to be the showdown , he said of himself and the leader , claudio chiappucci , if i lose , i'm going to have a very , very bad day and he s going to have the best day of his life both nearly took place today lemond s scare occurred when the rear tire of his bicycle punctured at kilometer 77 of the 150kilometer race , which coursed over two mountains between lourdes and pau before he could get going again , he had lost 1 minute 6 seconds to chiappucci then eric boyer and jerome simon of z caught up to lemond after a team mechanic had replaced the wheel far ahead in a breakaway , two other z riders , gilbert ducloslassalle and atle kvalsvoll , were told by their team manager to stop and wait for lemond to reach them when he did , the fiveman group stormed up the final kilometer of a climb and down the other side of the 3 , 635foot peak a shared task taking turns at the front to set a faster pace than one man could alone and letting the others draft in the slipstream and save energy , the chasers caught chiappucci in about 25 minutes this was no more than any team is expected to do for its leader but z did it with extra zeal , and not only because of the prize money it will share if lemond wins the race it was in the mountains where lemond benefited and where he gave on the climb to l'alpe d'huez a week ago , for example , when he finished second and pensec was far behind , lemond would not work with a leading group to improve his finishing time manager is pleased he gained back only 48 seconds of the 10 minutes by which he trailed he might have made up minutes easily , at the cost of helping pensec s opponents gain that time , too greg proved he s a team player , his team manager , roger legeay , said the french press and public hailed him , a leader making 15 million this year , for protecting a french teammate making a third of that who is simply not in lemond s class but who was wearing the yellow jersey other riders and team managers agreed greg worked for me , and now it s my turn to work for him , said pensec , who has since fallen to 10th place it s like a football team , lemond said you have players , and you have to use the players to your advantange it s not just shortterm
salem , ore , july 8 republican and democratic challengers in congressional campaigns across the country are seizing upon the savings and loan crisis as the issue they say will make many incumbents vulnerable this year in dozens of races for the house of representatives and senate , candidates in both parties are preparing advertisements and position papers to make local issues out of the incumbents' ties the nation s most costly financial debacle rather than debate whether a republican administration or a democratic congress was responsible for the crisis , the challengers are trying to bring the subject home to local voters by reminding them of the cost of the savings bailout to taxpayers , estimated at more than 200 billion over the next 10 years while nationally the democrats are trying to blame the republicans for the costs , so far this has been a districtbydistrict war incumbents usually enjoy great political advantages over their challengers , but this seems to be an issue that could be damaging to many any of the dozens of members who accepted even modest campaign contributions from savings institutions , or did nothing in congress to prevent the crisis , are susceptible to attack but the house member who may have felt the most heat is a republican denny smith , a fiveterm congressman from this city in the willamette valley south of portland mr smith was already considered vulnerable he was reelected in 1988 by only 707 votes out of more than 222 , 000 cast he has been on the defensive since december , when the oregonian , the state s largest newspaper , disclosed that as a director of a savings and loan here that later failed he urged federal regulators in the late 1980 s not to seek damages from his institution or any other for poor management or negligence strategists in both parties say that while there is no evidence that mr smith broke the law , his case is particularly serious because of his personal involvement with a troubled savings and loan institution slipping the issue in mike kopetski , the former democratic state legislator who almost beat mr smith in 1988 , sees the savings debacle as the issue that can put him over the top in the rematch this november traveling across this district of logging towns and affluent suburbs , he often slips the savings debacle into his speeches before a local chapter of the national organization for women on friday , mr kopetski steered discussion from abortion rights by suggesting that social services were endangered because the savings and loan bailout was costing so much talk about how this scandal happened , he said the congressman from the fifth district was calling the regulators and saying , 'get off my back because i'm sitting on one of the boards of a savings and loan' it will be the hardworking middleclass families who will have to foot the bill mr smith insists he did nothing wrong and points his finger at overzealous bank regulators the funny thing is , i never took any money from an s l , he said i never took any free trips to the bahamas if i had to do it all over again , the things i did with the s l , i would do it again , except maybe i would be more aggressive to protect my people against regulators two lists , many names mr smith s is just one name on lists of lawmakers each party is keeping for those it believes can be defeated on the savings and loan issue these go far beyond the keating five , the united states senators who intervened with federal regulators on behalf of the failing savings and loan of charles h keating jr , who was a major contributor to each of them none of the five is up for reelection topping the republicans' list is representative frank annunzio , a chicago democrat who is the chairman of the banking committee s subcommittee on regulation he is being attacked on several fronts , from his votes on savings and loan issues to accepting a 3 , 000 contribution from mr keating in illinois , mr annunzio s republican opponent , state senator walter dudycz , plans a news conference monday to accuse the veteran congressman of giving free rein to hundreds of individuals to gamble with the life savings of millions of working men and women mr annunzio was so infuriated by republican efforts to go after him that he told the chicago suntimes as god is my judge , i never have seen charles keating , talked to him or corresponded with him i got a stinking 3 , 000 from him that i never saw other democrats whom republicans consider vulnerable include senator bob kerrey of nebraska , for receiving , in the words of a news release by national republican officials , a questionable loan from a failing savings and loan institution representative jim chapman of texas , for receiving contributions from corrupt texas s l figures , and representative doug barnard jr of georgia , for not voting in committee for a plan in 1987 to make s l s pay the interest on borrowed funds among leading republicans under attack is representative charles \( chip \) pashayan jr of california , who accepted 26 , 000 in donations from mr keating or his associates two others are representatives bill lowery of california and john hiler of indiana , who have received large contributions from savings and loans institutions common cause , the washington lobbying group , has also tried to use the savings and loan scandal in its effort to get stricter campaignfinance laws last week , the organization ran newspaper and radio advertisements in 18 states , with this pointed message for members of the house and senate s l interests gave members of congress millions taxpayers were ripped off for billions and congress has done nothing in oregon last week , common cause members attended several public appearances of mark o hatfield , the state s senior repulican senator , accusing him of helping to defeat campaign finance legislation in 1988 'mccarthylike implication' after placardwaving common cause members followed him to a medical school groundbreaking in portland on friday , mr hatfield responded angrily in an interview , accusing the group of spreading a mccarthylike implication that somehow hatfield s in this s l scandal the senator , who is seeking a fifth sixyear term this year , said he did not believe the savings and loan issue would succeed in defeating incumbents referring to the 166 billion bailout bill passed last year , mr hatfield said , who can use it , when the democrat and republican leadership supported it \? running scared while there is little objective evidence of how the issue is playing in specific races , it clearly has representative smith , a former pilot who owns a chain of small newspapers in this region , running scared he expects to spend significantly more on this year s race than he did in 1988 , and he is sending hundreds of thousands of personalized letters to constituents in an unusual move for an incumbent this early , mr smith has sought to blunt the criticism by attacking his challenger in newspaper and radio advertisements they say nothing about savings and loans , but describe mr kopetski as far too liberal on taxes , crime and other issues mike kopetski is very hip , very liberal , very irresponsible and very , very wrong , they declare mr kopetski said the advertisements show he s desperate the balding , bespectacled challenger added , even my wife said , 'mike , you 're not hip' mr smith sometimes sounds surprisingly resigned , as if the issue were impossible to overcome the 52yearold conservative said recently he never had a psychological attachment to being in congress , and added , if i lose the seat because of a misrepresentation of what i did with savings and loans , so be it photos denny smith , right , a fiveterm republican congressman from salem , ore , during a recent campaign visit to a frozen foods plant his personal involvement with a failed savings and loan may make him

next tuesday the bronx will hold two special elections to fill state legislative vacancies special elections rarely generate much excitement , but since the winners will have an automatic advantage if they run in the fall for full terms , voters would do well to take note of the campaigns and vote state assembly , 73d district this is an undistinguished contest among three disappointing candidates vying to replace jose serrano , who has moved on to congress none of the candidates have demonstrated the leadership qualities their troubled south bronx district needs as the democraticliberal nominee in a heavily democratic district , david rosado is the favorite over alice paul , the republican , and ruben diaz , the conservative and righttolife candidate it is hardly encouraging that mr rosado , now working in real estate , was long aligned with ramon velez , the south bronx political leader who carved a controversial empire out of antipoverty programs bronx voters can hope that if elected , mr rosado will grow in the job state senate , third district this campaign in the north bronx , to fill the vacancy created by the death of state senator abraham bernstein , has turned into an unexpectedly energetic race between two of the four candidates jeffrey korman , the democratic designee , and howard yaruss , an insurgent democrat running on the reform party line mr korman , a stalwart of the bronx democratic organization and an aide to the party s county leader , has held staff jobs with the state assembly for 14 years mr yaruss , a young lawyer new to politics , promises more independence and could bring some idealism to albany s desultory politics he merits support
after four recent visits to la cote basque , still one of new york city s most sumptuous dining spots , i came away with several lingering memories one is of an awestruck young couple \( my guess was high school prom age \) trying to act so worldly as they struggled with the allfrench menu and puzzled over the surfeit of silverware it was one of those terrifyingly wonderful evenings they surely will never forget another is the timeless charm of the dining room with its seaside murals , red leather banquettes and profusion of fresh flowers a third is a splendid bottle of meursault enjoyed one evening you may notice that food is not one of the top three impressions , a fact that is disturbing the cooking these days at jeanjacques rachou s 32yearold restaurant is pleasing overall , sometimes uplifting , but too rarely memorable since last october michel fitoussi , who has had a varied career since his days at the palace in the late 1970 s , has been running the kitchen while mr rachou tends to the dining room la cote basque has never been a place to go for culinary revelation its strength was its faithful execution of classic french cuisine in this era of gastronomic freeforalls in this role , however , it seems to have slipped a notch a wideranging sampling of the current menu found that while a little more than half of the dishes continue to uphold french tradition proudly , the rest are flawed a 500plus average may keep a baseball team on top of the league , but not a restaurant a striking example is la cote basque s oncesplendid assortment of cold shellfish with vegetables on two recent occasions , the crabmeat was ice cold and tasteless the lobster was pleasing , but the garnish was more appealing to look at than to taste vegetables here are a problem across the board , but especially with entrees , where they often have the limp appearance of having come from a steam table among the recommended starters is a ballotine of salmon , studded with lobster , carrots and peas , and surrounded by pretty turned cucumbers and sweet peppers in a sparkling parsley sauce another good choice is roasted sea scallops , a special , which are set over tart sauteed endives in a lemony herb butter sauce and one day the chef proposed delicious quails stuffed with forcemeat , mushrooms and caramelized onions , with a clean , sharp sauce of lingonberries and madeira one preparation i have enjoyed over the years is the regally presented casserole of shellfish in this case scallops and lobster in a light gingerspiked , creamthickened shellfish stock it was well cooked this time , but unbalanced , tasting mostly of ginger it takes a large crew of captains and waiters to run this sprawling ship , and the experienced professionals here have it down to a poised routine several captains are knowledgeable about the wellstocked wine list and can be helpful , at least among reds , of which bordeaux is best represented \( at fairly elevated prices \) a restaurant of this caliber , however , should not omit the vintages of whites like meursaults , chablis and all alsace selections la cote basque has always turned out pictureperfect classics like grilled dover sole a la meuniere , roasted chicken with herbs , and rack of lamb and it still does cassoulet is still a winner , too crusty , rich but not too heavy , and replete with buttery duck confit , garlic sausage and pork a hint of cinnamon and cumin in the sauce does wonders for rosy lamb medallions , which come with raisinflecked couscous venison , though , came out gray and bland , although the peppery sauce with roasted chestnuts was invigorating fans of sweetbreads should be satisfied with the big , firm and wellbrowned version here , accompanied by a sturdy sauce of veal stock , mushrooms and cauliflower overall , seafood was less successful a special of three fillets snapper , salmon and sea bass arrived well cooked , but the salmon and bass needed seasoning so , too , did the insipid mound of pasta in the center , garnished with chopped tomatoes another time a salmon steak , said to be cooked with thyme , came out devoid of any seasoning only the good hollandaise saved it one evening when the kitchen did turn out a fine grilled snapper , perfectly cooked and flavorful , the deepfried parsley promised on the menu was missing this is a good place to sample a classic skate a la grenobloise delicate skate wings are cooked to perfection and enhanced with brown butter , parsley , lemon and capers one area in which la cote basque has not lost pace is desserts individual apple tarts are superb , especially with vanilla ice cream ringed by a coulis of apricots and calvados souffles are heavenly , too , whether made with grand marnier or seasonal fruits , and ile flottante comes under a dome of spun sugar that resembles a bird cage another visual stunner is the green apple of lacquered sugar that holds whipped cream flavored with applejack brandy la cote basque , which received three stars in 1986 , is still one of the grandest of the oldguard french restaurants , and regulars who know the menu can have a transcendent experience there others run a small but significant chance of being disappointed and that is not the definition of a threestar restaurant two stars seems more fitting for la cote basque today la cote basque  5 east 55th street , 6886525

to write about jazz singing since not even the most carefully hedged definitions of jazz cover everyone s perception of what the word means and because the overall perception of jazz keeps shifting every 10 or 20 years jazz singing is open to the same kind of quibbling the central point of his book jazz singing is an examination of jazz s effects on popular singing so , to trace the development of jazzderived popular singing , he includes not only unquestionable jazz singers \( louis armstrong , billie holiday \) but also those whose status is questionable \( perry como , doris day \) and a few who do n't even pretend to be jazz singers \( andy williams \) the general outline of this development , as mr friedwald follows it , starts with armstrong and bing crosby in the 1920 s and reaches peaks in the work of holiday and ella fitzgerald , billy eckstine and sarah vaughan , mel torme and anita o 'day , frank sinatra and peggy lee , tony bennett and rosemary clooney , and , peering ahead , cassandra wilson and bobby mcferrin with the possible exception of the last two , these are all familiar names but mr friedwald s analysis of their styles and how they developed , as well as his critical comment on the recordings , make his brief essays on them somewhat more than just biographical rehashing the real meat of the book , however , comes in his advocacy of lesserknown singers who have played crucial roles in creating what jazz singing has developed into there is marion harris an incredibly big star in the teens and 20 s and quite easily the best white singer of this prehistoric period , he asserts in whom tin pan alley found the perfect performer for its dozens of numbers with the words 'jazz' or 'blues' in the title he notes that in the early teens cliff edwards was accompanying silent movies strumming his ukelele \( he was known as ukelele ike \) and scat singing , which he called eefin' because the term scat singing had not yet been invented there is a fascinatingly abbreviated saga of annette hanshaw , the louise brooks of jazz , as mr friedwald calls her she was born wealthy no twobit manager ever cracked the whip and tried to svengali her into sounding like everybody else she became a star through her records , starting in 1926 , by using the musical idiom of the 20 s in what mr friedwald terms a creative modern way although she had virtually no ambition , despised being a celebrity and was terrified of audiences , in her eight years of recording she made the period s most consistently excellent series of female vocal records outside the blues idiom she retired permanently at the age of 28 and lived happily for 50 more years without singing mr friedwald reminds us of the idiosyncratic charisma and strong rhythmic style of al bowlly , a singer born in south africa of greek and lebanese descent , who is known to americans primarily through his records with ray noble s brilliant english orchestra in the early 1930 s and he stresses the seminal position of connee boswell and the boswell sisters in laying the foundation for the best of the jazz vocal groups that followed them mel torme s meltones and the trio of lambert , hendricks and ross as he moves through the years from these early jazzinfluenced singers , mr friedwald continues to fill out the picture with singers of special quality who spiced up each era teddy grace in the late 1930 s , the blackest white singer who ever lived , the madly inventive scat singer leo watson and particularly lee wiley he calls wiley the most naked of all singers , who put up none of the usual barriers between her heart and her audience neither by the inner strength that armstrong , crosby and vaughan used nor with the sharpedged wit of the blues that came from billie holiday , nor the rhythmic strength that carried mildred bailey and connee boswell he finds in wiley s voice similarities to bix beiderbecke s cornet of the 1920 s and , through beiderbecke , to lester young and the cool school of the late 1940 s , as well as indirectly through young to holiday not surprisingly , wiley s final and best album , west of the moon , is a key element in mr friedwald s declaration that the late 1950 s was the richest period in the history of vocal jazz it was a time , he notes , when the giants associated with that era were doing what he considers their greatest work \( he cites frank sinatra s only the lonely and mel torme s mel torme swings shubert alley \) , when newcomers like carmen mcrae and betty carter were making significant debuts and when several major artists of the 30 s like wiley were creating their most satisfying efforts jimmy rushing s jazz odyssey of james rushing esq , armstrong s satchmo a musical autobiography , crosby s bing with a beat and boswell s parallel to wiley s autumnal triumph , connee boswell and the original memphis five in hifi covering such a broad range of singers does not allow for much individual depth , but mr friedwald avoids the pitfalls of simply making lists he has a style that keeps things lively , although the wiseguy elements that help to make it lively can become irritating but in tying together the various facets of jazz singing , he has given deserved attention to many singers who are on the verge of being forgotten photo billie holiday \( don hunstein , 1957 \)
cuttyhunk island , mass before 10 pm , we were over the rocky rough and tumble of sow and pigs reef off the western end of this little island that for more than a century has been regarded as one of the east coast s striped bass hot spots every once in a while , the moon appeared in a rift in the heavy clouds , revealing the distant heaving belly of the sea and the choppy , broken water of the rip that we were fishing on the falling tide we were aboard captain george isabel s 29foot dyer , the linesider , and within five minutes after we lowered our swimming plugs over the side , stripers were being caught and released , a total of nine by midnight the fish , which averaged about 14 pounds , were all a few inches under the state s legal minimum length , 36 inches , for the species the swimming plugs we trolled on wire line were running about 12 feet down , just above the bottom i cannot be more specific about those plugs because captain isabel swore me to secrecy , and being a guest of his clients , the members of the greater cuttyhunk island striped bass club , i would be a churl to do otherwise my fishing companions were peter spengler , john sheedy and ray kingsley , all of new york city , and dick seclow of westport , conn from time to time that night , another 29foot dyer , the aggravator , skippered by joe correia , materialized alongside , then slid away into the night anglers aboard the aggravator were sherman adler and dave pauker of new york city , dick pauker of westport , conn , george surasky of woodstock , ny , and barry richard of lake ronkonkoma , li all except richard and i were club members the club members on the aggravator did a bit better , catching 12foot bass , two of them keepers the club has 16 members , a marvelously disparate group of corporate executives , advertising and public relations specialists and consultants some semiretired bonded by their love of cuttyhunk , the striped bass , and affection for one another although the club officially came into being early in the last decade , some of its founders , including spengler and bob liddel , had been fishing together out of cuttyhunk several years before they could n't have chosen a better location not long after the civil war , men of substance , many of them from new york city , formed posh striped bass clubs on such places as cuttyhunk , the westernmost of the elizabeth islands on pasque , another of the elizabeths , and at squibnocket on the neighboring island of martha s vineyard club members usually fished from stands anchored to boulders that extended out into the surf evidence of these stands can still be found at cuttyhunk and squibnocket , and the clubhouse of the original cuttyhunk group is now a private home the reputation of the elizabeth islands as a mecca for striped bass anglers was enhanced by the 73pound striper that charles b church caught in 1913 while drifting a live eel alone from his oarpropelled skiff in quick s hole , the opening between pasque and nashawena islands that links buzzards bay and vineyard sound that record lasted for more than half a century because of uncertainty about the strength of the line church used , the international game fish association gave the title to a slightly smaller fish , 72 pounds , caught by edward kirker off cuttyhunk in 1969 in july 1981 , bob rochetta caught a 73pounder from a boat off montauk , li , and in november of that year tony stetzko took another of the same size from the surf on cape cod those records held until al mcreynolds caught a 78pound , 8ounce fish off atlantic city in 1982 the modernday cuttyhunk club members fish for bass two weekends a year , during the full moon phases in june and september , and gather for a dinner in midwinter in new york city spengler s house on cuttyhunk serves as headquarters for the group when the members are on one of their fishing excursions when i arrived there last week , the aroma of burning apple wood greeted me sherman adler was on the deck smoking two large fillets of striped bass normally , he would have used bluefish , but none had been caught a full mount of a big striper hangs on one of the walls of spengler s cuttyhunk digs , and also displayed is the trophy cup that field and stream magazine presented to church in recognition of his catch there is even a stained glass rendition of a striped bass in a picture window , and a metal striped bass weathervane is mounted on the ridge both of these are the work of george surasky , who is also a violinmaker that evening before going fishing we devoured adler s smoked striper , which was mild , moist and superb we then repaired to the allen house , the island s major hostelry , for dinner a marvelouslydelicate cioppino and a loaf of dark bread spiced with rosemary , baked by spengler , preceded the main course of baked striper the choice of wines you bring your own to the allen house was firstrate , so good , in fact , that i momentarily regretted my decision , made some years ago , to eschew fermented potions the following morning at breakfast at the allen house i was startled when dick seclow asked me if i would like a bagel he reached under the table and produced a brown bag laden with bagels that he had obtained in new york a few days before under normal circumstance , the club would have had three charter boats at its disposal those operated by isabel and correia , who are policemen on the mainland 10 months of the year , and roland coulombe s jig m up , also a 29foot dyer coulombe is a cuttyhunk resident who turns to carpentry in the off season his boat was waiting for a new engine isabel s address is 94 statler avenue , somerset , mass 02725 , telephone \( 508 \) 6795675 or 9711388 correia s address

nunes , a resident of the island before being ferried back to the vinyard , i joined spengler , surasky , pauker , richard and captain isabel for a few hours of morning trolling leadheaded jigs adorned with white nylon hair and sweetened with strips of red pork rind were the daytime lures the day was sultry and thick fog sometimes limited the visibility to a hundred yards or so \( one might add that the linesider and the other boats are equipped with loran , depth finders and radar \) we caught and released nearly a dozen bass , two of them just a whisker under the minimum length limit in their three days of fishing this june , club members caught 93 bass for a total estimated weight of more than 1 , 200 pounds photo captain george isabel with a 13pound striped bass caught by george

the judson memorial church has for decades been a home for offbeat art exhibitions and music , theater and dance productions that reflect the spirit of its greenwich village neighborhood this year , the church is celebrating its centennial with a varied schedule of events , including revivals of three shows by one of its former ministers , al carmines mr carmines , who has moved uptown to the rauschenbusch memorial church , is a prolific composer with eclectic tastes his 1971 quasioperatic musical comedy , the journey of snow white , was presented at the judson memorial church \( 55 washington square south \) through last night in this amusing fantasy , mr carmines freely embellishes the fairy tale in his version , queen i snow white s mother predicts her death in a melancholy purcellian recitative but before leaping into the grave , she persuades the king to marry queen ii while not overtly evil , as wicked stepmothers go , queen ii is unusually attached to her mirror \( a character here \) , and the queen turns on snow white only when the mirror voices a preference for the younger woman when queen ii discovers that snow white is living in the woods with the seven dwarfs \( actually , there were six in the performance on sunday evening , the seventh singer having sustained an injury \) , she commissions three witches to kill her instead of a single , charming prince who can wake snow white with a kiss , mr carmines sends three an opera singer , a cowboy balladeer and a rock star who acts like a young elvis presley none of them rouse her , and the rockandroll prince s aria is lewd enough to get him ejected by the dwarfs in the end , the full court and the ghost of queen i turn up , and snow white is rescued by the mirror , who has decided that he would prefer to be human the mood of the work is suggested in some of the aria titles the two oddest are love is our epistemology , sung by the dwarfs , and the impression on our retina has gone , sung by the woodland creatures but there are serious notions beneath the layers of overt silliness mr carmines takes his tongue out of his cheek long enough to show the power of love as a transforming force , and his finale is a gorgeous choral paean to free will the work s musical side has its charms as well , one being mr carmines s organized approach to eclecticism , in which parodied styles are intrinsic to characterization snow white s agile , sugary music would be at home in a lehar operetta queen i hops between moody baroque settings and a bright cabaret style queen ii and the mirror are more straightforwardly theatrical , and the king s music bears traces of gilbert and sullivan the menu also includes the diverse arias of the princes , a blues tune from a witch and mr carmines s best moments , the exquisitely harmonized choral writing that turns up intermittently the production by russell treyz is endearingly homespun , with nan childress s robust piano playing , and steve hull s flute , clarinet and saxophone lines serving as the orchestra mary ann lee s lithe soprano and wide range is perfectly suited to snow white s music she was supported ably , if vocally more modestly , by the two queens \( ann harvey and robin manning \) , the king \( robert sevra \) , the huntsman \( fred einhorn \) and the large community of animals and dwarfs other notable members of the cast were karl heist , who as the countryandwestern prince yodeled his way through his aria to his own guitar accompaniment david edwards , who contributed a fine tenor parody as the operatic prince robert mcnamara , as the rockandroll prince , and karen cooper smith , as the witch who sang the blues
phoenix , jan 7 senator dennis deconcini began last friday with a relentless , 75minute news conference , answering one question after another about the intricacies of the lincoln savings and loan association failure and his action on behalf of the institution s chairman , charles h keating jr then mr deconcini turned himself over to the lessthantender mercies of talk radio , to the suspicions and inquiries of jim from phoenix and any other arizonan with a telephone and the inclination to grill his or her senator the show s host set the tone what are you guilty of \? he asked the arizona democrat , who plodded into a methodical defense with days like that , arizona has grown numbingly familiar with the case of the five senators accused of trying to exert improper influence on federal regulators on behalf of mr keating , a highrolling phoenix developer who made generous campaign contributions to all five both of arizona s senators , mr deconcini and john mccain , a republican , are in the group , which also includes john glenn , democrat of ohio donald w riegle jr , democrat of michigan , and alan cranston , democrat of california the five are the subject of investigation by the senate ethics committeee , the stuff of headlines , talk radio and incessant debate costly ad campaign is begun you do n't know what to think right now , said dave lincicone , the bartender at american legion post 1 in phoenix , where a question about the five senators can even tear some men away from the football game charles pine , a former democratic chairman , said , it s a subject of conversation almost everywhere you go with his news conference on friday , mr deconcini , a former prosecutor who was first elected to the senate in 1976 , began a drive to salvage his reputation five years before his third term expires , mr deconcini is starting a 190 , 000 advertising campaign on television and in newspapers to defend his conduct in the keating affair he is paying for it with personal , not campaign , money i'm not doing this for '94 , said mr deconcini , who is a member of a prominent landowning family that is old by arizona standards his father settled here in the 1920 s i'm doing this because i feel very strongly about my reputation and my family name he says he has not even decided whether to seek reelection in 1994 , although some republicans , smelling vulnerability , say they hope he does mr deconcini has taken a particularly heavy beating because of allegations that he was one of the most aggressive of the five , repeatedly pressing federal bank regulators on mr keating s behalf he says he did nothing illegal or unethical and that he simply went to bat for a constituent and a major arizona employer , before the institution s troubles were fully apparent fall of 'a rising star' keating was a rising star , said a rueful mr deconcini , citing the prominence of a man whose business s failure may cost the taxpayers 2 billion mother teresa had blessed him senator mccain , who was in south korea this week , has also made the rounds of news conferences , regrets and explanations here democrats and republicans debate over which of the two senators is in more trouble mr mccain , for example , must stand for reelection in 1992 , giving him less time to recover still , the bipartisan nature of the scandal has created what bruce babbitt , the former arizona governor and democratic presidential candidate , describes as a weird calm it s been a long time since you had a political scandal that s really juicy in which a republican checkmates a democrat , he said all of the activists are desperate to attack , and none of them will recall campaign in the wind there has been talk of a recall campaign against both senators ed buck , a republican businessman who spearheaded the recall drive against gov evan mecham , said he was considering such an effort but has not decided mr buck , who is active in politics , said he was first seeking commitments from both senators to a variety of campaign reforms mr deconcini has maintained that there was no connection between the funds raised and my actions on behalf of mr keating but in an interview on friday night , he argued that the current system of financing campaigns was seriously flawed having to raise all this money is a bad thing , mr deconcini said , subdued as he drove through the arizona night it s a bad thing he said he had long supported public financing of congressional campaigns i 've made speeches that said it s going to take a crisis to get campaign finance reform , he said maybe this is the crisis photo senator dennis deconcini of arizona is one of five senators linked to the lincoln savings and loan affair \( paul conklin \)
pearl river charles searles and oliver johnson are american blacks , robergeau duverger is from haiti and all three are showing their work at the blue hill cultural center unless a 1988 exhibition by contemporary chinese artists can be counted , this is the first show based on ethnic identity that the center has staged in its sevenyear career and one hopes it will be the last mr searles , a sculptor , is the best known of the group , having exhibited in philadelphia and other major cities and having also executed commissions for public sculpture in newark and new york city as well as philadelphia he assembles structures out of shapes cut from beams and sheetsof wood , painting them in solid colors and patterns some of the works are archways tall enough to admit a figure freedom s gate no 2 is an asymmetrical example where the proscenium is white , decorated with small black and red oblongs and has an indentation filled with red slats on either side edging the shape is a parabola of black lined with red , and acting as a kind of keystone is a shield shape striped black and white and surmounted by a crest of red and yellow slats there are wall pieces that look like battle trophies the victor is a concave black shield superimposed on a red field that is shaped like the flayed skin of an animal and studded with short gilded dowels fire eater is a cluster of flat forms suggesting arrows and boomerangs there are also smaller pieces standing on pedestals or the floor that have intimations of figures painted or dressed for tribal ceremonies these are hardwon associations , however whatever atavism mr searles experiences , he keeps it and his emotions under strict control the first order of business is craftsmanship and rigid discipline maybe too rigid , because in the end the work develops an allpurpose character a searles construction could stand anywhere , giving optical pleasure to all and offense to none not that art has to offend or incite to make a point but mr searles seems unduly concerned with keeping his soul under wraps and leaving no clues as to his train of thought whatever the official artist to the university of pennsylvania s penn relays does , mr johnson will hold that office for the next 10 years this is an artist who has gone out of his way to avoid formal instruction , preferring to learn from the old masters and photography the pastel portraits of joe louis and dizzy gillespie and the pencil study of ray charles are virtually copies of photographs , down to the flash glare in mr gillespie s eyeglasses unlike mr searles , mr johnson makes no attempt to conceal his sources , although in the painting of three little girls standing in the sunshine he has applied a veneer of decorative impasto these competent images represent the artist s flashy side but there are others done from life or at least not dependent on photography one is the painting of a young black man in cap and long overcoat standing on a porticoed stoop the title is just looking and the youth may be doing just that , although the somber house with its closed windows and heavy black front door hardly invites esthetic interest , much less casual visitors this social comment is by far the best of mr johnson s efforts because it is evidently the result of reality observed first hand the scene of a cat laying claim to a newspaper on the lap of a woman could have been taken from a photograph but it , too , has a reason for existing mr johnson seems torn between indulging his facility for its own sake and the comparative drudgery of capitalizing on his own ideas given his natural talent he could risk some formal instruction if only to increase his confidence and to learn the climax of a highlight is warm in tone , not bluish , like the one on the violin in his still life mr duverger gets most of the center s space but is the least focused of the group whether his acrylic images are brushed in black and cream on paper or delivered onto canvas in emotional colors with some shiny plastic collage , they speak of ambivalence faces emerge singly and in groups from expressionistically applied paint but to no particular purpose , although titles like phantasmagoria and ombres seem meant to encourage the viewer to free associate mr duverger may be in love with the act of painting but he communicates nothing with it regardless of artists' merits or demerits , the visitor is left with the impression that their names were picked out of a hat , and it is not the first time this has happened at blue hill the show remains through sept 30 blue hill is a corporate complex on orangeburg road \( exit 6w on the palisades parkway \) and it is open from 8 am to 5 pm , mondays through fridays , and 9 am to 4 pm

my brother ted and his wife lynn waited , eagerly checking the mail , for the results of their 3yearold s first iq test they had paid the requisite 90 for a nextday mailing but after 10 days , 2 phone calls and promises that it went out days ago , ted sent a messenger to the resource center for gifted children to pick up the scores after all , the stakes were high an excellent score would give their son a chance at the free , firstrate education offered by the hunter college elementary school in new york city they knew it was a real long shot , with about 800 applicants each year for 16 spots but the document from the resource center , which ted and lynn had chosen from a list of testing facilities approved by hunter , made it stunningly clear that there was no hope it read test administered stanfordbinet intelligence scale , fourth edition verbal reasoning sas 120 \( high average range \) abstract visual ability sas 130 \( superior range \) quantitative reasoning sas 122 \( superior range \) short term memory sas 123 \( superior range \) composite sum of sas 128 \( superior range \) behaviors and observation david is a sweet child who was friendly and eager to please however , he had great difficulty focusing and maintaining concentration he was quick to give up and was immature recommendation it is recommended that david be placed in a class for average students tested by f segan , pd what did it mean \? what was sas \? why was there no explanation of the scores \? superior sounded good , but how many categories were above that \? lynn thought of olives jumbo , large , colossal and how she never could remember which were bigger than which ted recalled sitting in the waiting room as francine segan , director of the resource center , administered the test more than once , he could see , she interrupted the exam to answer the front door , leaving the child alone in a back room now this report said david had difficulty focusing ridiculous business , this baby testing the couple put it behind them , and took david to the park next morning , the mail arrived with the errant envelope ted was sure it was a duplicate of what they 'd already seen , but he opened it anyway then he screamed for his wife yesterday s document must have been for another child instead of high average , this report read superior gifted where yesterday david had been merely superior , today he was very superior gifted this one was more like it especially the insightful observation section , which now described david as cooperative , happy and welladjusted with excellent spacial sic skills he scored in the 96th percentile that s our boy ! ted said and lynn read the best part aloud recommendation david should be placed in a class for superior students but what if this report was for another child and yesterday s was david s \? ted got on the phone to ms segan at the resource center there s been a terrible mistake , she said the report you received yesterday was n't meant for you we send that version to the school the one you got today is the right one ted was fast falling down the rabbit hole if both reports are david s , which one is accurate \? he asked the one we send to the school is accurate the report for the parents is more soothing and positive ted struggled to keep his voice level is it your policy to mislead parents about their children s capabilities \? in a dazzling display of missing the point , francine segan shot back , if you 'd been patient and waited for the report to arrive in the mail , none of this would have come up when ted called hunter elementary to report the shenanigans , he was told to put it in writing and that the school did n't know a thing about it he sent a letter that day , but never heard back david is 4 now , his favorite books are gray s anatomy and dr seuss s the sneetches , and he just got the training wheels off his bike drawing
children whose homes and neighborhoods are in disarray are supposed to find stability in their schools unfortunately , they often look in vain they find instead that teachers come and go in rapid succession a third grader in a new york city public school recently told a reporter that his class had already had four new teachers this year , and it made him and his classmates dizzy the complaint reminded me of a conversation i had years ago with dr bruno bettelheim , the noted child psychiatrist who ended his life at age 86 earlier this month dr bettelheim considered even one year with one teacher far too short he would have kept children with the same teacher for at least two , preferably three or four years one reason , he once told me , was that , apart from making the children feel secure , a longterm commitment holds the teacher responsible for the children s progress what if a class draws a lemon \? he admitted the risk , but thought longterm responsibility might make it easier to get rid of lemons dr bettelheim , a distinguished professor of child psychiatry at the university of chicago , worked with severely disturbed children for 26 years in the course of that work , he developed strategies for the rearing and schooling of all children his advice , though often unorthodox and controversial , will influence generations of education reformers parents and educators often found it hard to reconcile apparent contradictions in dr bettelheim s outlook he sided with many of john dewey s and jean piaget s childcentered views but denounced the 1960 s college rebels he scoffed at the term youth culture as an adult misreading of youth pathology dr bettelheim opposed the idea of making learning easy interesting , yes , but not easy if a teacher tells children that the lesson is easy , he warned , those who fail will consider themselves hopelessly stupid and those who succeed will not gain much satisfaction once , in the early 1970 s , a cruel scene in a children s movie upset our 5yearold son the episode caused him nightmares we had come to know dr bettelheim at professional meetings , and my wife asked him about our son s fears he told her not to worry nightmares are the way his fears are released instead of being kept bottled up inside just talk with him about them , he said he felt the same way about scary fairy tales in his book , the uses of enchantment the meaning and importance of fairy tales , he rejected worries that those stories might terrify youngsters he wanted children to experience the struggle against evil , followed by a happy ending and for today s children who often lack the security of an extended family or a wellordered community , dr bettelheim felt fairy tales provide images of heroes who have to go out into the world all by themselves and ultimately find inner confidence dr bettelheim s observations of children in elementary schools from 1971 to 1978 were distilled in his book , on learning to read the child s fascination with meaning , coauthored with karen zelan , a highly respected psychologist dr bettelheim focused on the way children are taught to read he was furious about the lack of meaning in the materials given to them a child who is made to read 'nan had a pad nan had a tan pad dan ran dan ran to the pad ' and worse nonsense , he wrote , does not receive the impression that he is being guided toward becoming literate , because what he is being made to read is obviously not literature he also deplored a trend toward letting pretty pictures make up for dull texts , arguing this taught children to value pictures more than words in his classroom visits , dr bettelheim listened to the children at first , they hesitated to criticize their teachers and their schools but once they developed trust in the elderly visitor , it was as if a sluice gate had suddenly opened and a flood of angry criticism poured forth concerning the books they had been required to read , he wrote with venom they spoke about 'all these sweet little kids' in the stories a girl in fourth grade said to general agreement , in none of the stories does anybody ever say his true opinion , so how could we \? dr bettelheim urged teachers and parents to stop preaching to children about the practical value of learning what makes a child eager to learn to read , he said , is not the knowledge that reading is useful , but a fervent belief that being able to read will open a world of wonderful experiences bruno bettelheim was angered by an education establishment that he thought put its own interests ahead of children s needs he believed in hard work with the prospect of success he listened the children s voices spoke to his intellect and his heart , but he was not softhearted when i taught children , he said , i always told them , 'this is difficult , but if you work hard , you can learn it' photo dr bruno bettelheim , a noted child psychiatrist , who ended his life at age 86 earlier this month
houston , april 25 under siege by environmentalists for more than a year , lawrence g rawl , the chairman of the exxon corporation , won a measure of support today as a series of environmental initiatives were overwhelmingly rejected at the company s annual shareholders' meeting shareholders belonging to various environmental groups , including friends of the earth , the national wildlife federation and an organization of alaskan fishermen , were vastly outnumbered by the company s supporters and were often booed or shouted down during the meeting , which lasted 3 hours and 45 minutes rosemary king , a retired exxon employee and a stockholder , said , exxon has put forth the greatest effort she suggested that environmentalists dissatisfied with the company s handling of the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska should store your car , stop flying airplanes and walk or ride a horse in the winter snow or summer heat but the gathering of 1 , 850 stockholders fell silent when three women living near exxon refineries and chemical plants in texas pleaded with mr rawl and the company s 14 other directors to address the untold suffering they said was caused by toxic wastes exxon employees had dumped in their neighborhoods in recent years 'damaged beyond repair' i want to beg you to have waste reduction , said gloria chaplin , an environmental advocate who lives with her three children near the nation s largest petrochemical refinery , which exxon owns and operates in baytown , tex when i moved there in 1979 , i did n't know what toxic waste was , she said in a trembling voice now , she continued , my children s bones break easily and their noses bleed whenever they get near paint we have been damaged beyond repair i ca n't believe all of you would want to hurt other people mr rawl , who presided over the meeting , said he was unaware of the hazardous waste problems in communities near exxon sites in texas all i can tell you , he told mrs chaplin in a sympathetic voice , is i will look into your situation the exxon shareholders voted down six proposals that among other things would have committed the company to detailed reviews and public disclosures of its handling of toxic chemicals , created a committee of directors devoted to environmental issues and required it to disclose the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from its plants and adopt a plan to reduce them 'we are very encouraged' none of the proposals received more than 10 percent of the more than 900 million shares that were voted at the meeting but brent blackwelder , a vice president of friends of the earth , said the proposals had drawn more support than many environmentalists had anticipated we are very encouraged by this and will continue our effort to make exxon environmentally more responsible , he said in an interview the environmentalists called on mr rawl to resign and said the exxon valdez oil spill on march 24 , 1989 , had led to a growing incidence of alcoholism and abuse of children and spouses in communities near prince william sound the exxon chairman seemed to go out of his way at the onset of the meeting to accommodate his critics , but later ridiculed some and angrily rejected the protests of others in one instance , he said he would consider a proposal from jay d hair , president of the national wildlife federation and an oustpoken critic of exxon s handling of the alaskan spill , to meet privately with him to assess exxon s efforts in alaska i 'd like to be reasonable with you on a beach in alaska , mr rawl said exxon resigned from the federation s corporate council last summer after mr hair publicly assailed exxon s efforts in alaska in the opening minutes of today s meeting , mr hair assailed the company s optimistic portrayal of its cleanup program in alaska , which was presented in a sixminute video that featured local residents , environmentalists and exxon employees the exxon chairman also showed flashes of temper when a fisherman from prince william sound , robin dexter , said the company should use doublehulled tankers as a measure to reduce odds of future disastrous spills in the region , even at the cost of 120 million a ship , mr rawl cut him short , saying thank you very much you 've had enough time double hulls are rejected mr rawl said federal law prohibits exxon from using foreignbuilt tankers to tranport oil from one american port to another he said exxon would face huge costs compared with other oil companies if it were forced to replace its tanker fleet with doublehulled vessels made in the united states he said the doublehulled tankers conoco inc recently said it would use will be purchased from korean shipyards at 50 million a vessel and will be used by conoco to transport oil to foreign ports from operations in the gulf of mexico mr rawl also used the meeting to announce that exxon would soon sell a cleaner gasoline in 40 cities and towns along the gulf coast and eastern seaboard , including new york city exxon is the sixth oil company to announce a cleanerburning gasoline , and its program will be the largest photos lawrence g rawl , chairman of the exxon corporation

khrushchev on khrushchev an inside account of the man and his era by sergei khrushchev edited and translated by william taubman illustrated 423 pp boston little , brown company 2495 nikita khrushchev fascinated westerners throughout his 11 years in power , from 1953 to 1964 he was entertaining and maddening , charming and threatening , and never boring but when he was overthrown in october 1964 , he immediately became a nonperson maligned by the brezhnev leadership , with no possibility of defending himself , he was left to live out his days in obscure , frustrating retirement characteristically , however , this irrepressible man got in the last word by dictating his memoirs in the late 1960 s and smuggling them out of the country despite intense police surveillance those memoirs , published in the west in the 70 s , told us more than we had known about soviet history but they left us still in the dark about many aspects of khrushchev s policies when he was in power , about the personalities and viewpoints of those associates who deposed him and about the mechanics of his overthrow these large omissions simply whetted the appetite of observers eager to learn more about the way power has been wielded in the soviet union since stalin s death only under mikhail s gorbachev has the curtain begun to be lifted one result of glasnost is this informative memoir of khrushchev , written by his son sergei \( and ably translated by william taubman , a specialist on soviet politics at amherst college , who also provides useful footnotes \) sergei khrushchev does not try to hide his affection for his father , or his anguish at the man s political fate at the same time , he strains admirably to be objective and balanced to admit the limits of his knowledge and to concede his father s limitations much of this portrait will be familiar to those who have read other books on khrushchev and while most of the narrative about his years in power is too sketchy to add anything to the historical record , some tidbits may force reevaluations for instance , the descriptions of how close khrushchev was to the presidium member frol kozlov , and how much khrushchev hoped that kozlov might succeed him , contradict most western analyses , which have depicted kozlov as a political rival or threat to khrushchev but khrushchev on khrushchev is only in part a personal evaluation principally , it is a fairly wellwritten suspense story , in which the reader , though aware of the ending , is nonetheless gripped by the process of getting there the real drama is in the book s lengthy description of the conspiracy to depose khrushchev , the fascinating portraits of leonid brezhnev and other conspirators who are less widely known and the account of the ways in which khrushchev s successors tormented him and his family some of these insights have already appeared in the soviet press over the past two years but this volume makes those revelations accessible to englishspeaking audiences , and adds a great deal to what has previously appeared how did the plotters manage to depose khrushchev \? in a political system filled with wiretaps and informers , loyal clients and opportunists , how was the cabal able to keep itself secret yet recruit enough key participants to insure success \? how could khrushchev not have heard about it \? and if he did , why did he not turn the tables on his lieutenants as he had done in 1957 , when he foiled a conspiracy by fellow presidium members \? the answers are convincingly disclosed in a chapter that reads like a detective story according to his son , the conspiracy drew in dozens , perhaps scores , of officials , was 10 months in the works and was actually leaked to khrushchev well in advance equally revealing are the descriptions of khrushchev s successors after they achieved power why did they harass him so in retirement , and continue to attack him even after his death in 1971 \? were they simply sadists \? did they want revenge for being slighted during khrushchev s years in power \? were they getting back at the man and his family for having smuggled his memoirs abroad \? some of these motives entered in , but none is sufficient to explain the pattern it is understandable that the brezhnev leadership should fear khrushchev s communications with former associates shortly after his overthrow but why did they make such an extraordinary effort seven years later to turn his funeral into an armed camp with armored personnel carriers , battleready troops , closed metro exits and canceled bus routes \? and why did they later close the cemetery to the public for 10 years \? his son does not attempt a full answer , but he presents mounds of evidence that the leadership genuinely feared what they imagined khrushchev stood for the portrait of an elite fundamentally lacking confidence in its right to rule is unmistakable the cemetery has been reopened to the public under mr gorbachev , and a growing journalistic literature on khrushchev has been appearing in the soviet union the regime has sanctioned this awkward form of rehabilitation in part because khrushchev symbolized what mr gorbachev is now trying to accomplish sergei khrushchev informs us that another volume of his father s memoirs will appear shortly even posthumously , the irrepressible nikita sergeyevich has not been silenced but finally he can rest in peace khrushchev s hat trick we had reached a tentative agreement with little , brown and company to publish the memoirs removed from the text were passages that might constitute military secrets and incidental references to people then in power in the ussr but the publisher was worried that someone might be palming off a fake and why not \? everything certainly looked strange they were afraid of provocateurs and decided to try to verify the authenticity of the material they were getting we were n't in a position to write to them ourselves it would have been too dangerous our colleagues found a solution involving the use of a camera father received two widebrimmed hats from vienna , one bright scarlet and the other black in order to verify that they were dealing with us and not some impostor , the publisher asked us to send photographs of father wearing these two hats when i brought the hats to petrovodalneye , they attracted everyone s attention because they were so outlandish i explained that they were souvenirs from one of father s foreign admirers mama was horrified you ca n't really be thinking of wearing them \? ! and why not \? he said , egging her on why , they 're much too loud , she said , and shrugged i brought him the hats , grabbing my camera on the way father put one on and said , take my picture , let s see how i look so i photographed him wearing one hat and holding the other in his hand the publisher received the picture and knew that they were not being led astray from khrushchev on khrushchev photo sergei khrushchev with his father , nikita , at their summer retreat in petrovodalneye , near moscow , 1971 \( from khrushchev on khrushchev \)
tchepone , laos this paltry cluster of small houses on stilts , a shabby clinic , a modest government office and a new covered market was once the strategic center of the ho chi minh trail or so american and south vietnamese military briefers used to recite during the war that ended in 1975 tchepone was said to be the distribution hub for the vast network of mountain and jungle trails by which north vietnam tried to hide the fact that it was making war in south vietnam violating the neutrality of laos and cambodia , north vietnam channeled a stream of war materiel across its border into laos , and from this village to antigovernment fighters south vietnam , cambodia and laos in turn , the united states , also violating laotian neutrality , rained on tchepone , at the foothills of the annamite range about 30 miles west of the border of the northernmost region of south vietnam , more bombs than it did on any major german industrial city in world war ii over all , more than two million tons , more than the total the united states dropped on germany , were dropped on laos , on whose territory most of the ho chin minh trail ran tchepone became to many american and south vietnamese military leaders what moby dick was to captain ahab the object of an obsessive , destructive quest new villages built today , new villages have been built by the mountain tribesmen ofthe region of the legendary trail , and the old french colonial dirtandgravel highway that runs eastward from the mekong river town of savannakhet to the vietnamese coastal road has been modernized and paved with asphalt by the soviet union and vietnam bomb craters along the roadside have largely silted over and are covered by the rich growth of the tropical flatlands only faint traces of war remain visible from the rapidly deteriorating new road most noticeable is the progressive vanishing of trees , a result of the bombing , as one nears tchepone from the mekong , about 100 miles west , until between tchepone and the vietnamese border almost none of the sparse regrowth stands much taller than a man but leaving the road southward and uphill , on a branch of the trail that laos has slightly widened and grandiosely renamed national route 28 , one enters a landscape that appears scarred beyond nature s capacity to heal for many decades to come b52 carpet bombing to destroy not only what moved along the trail but also the paths themselves and the vegetation that veiled aerial visibility , has left a checkerboard pattern of huge craters , which even 17 years after the last bombs fell seem to gape accusingly at the sky ban saloy is a new village of 176 souls , mainly children , whose houses hover on the brinks of craters perfectly intact , the village looks and probably always will look as if stricken by a plague of pox 'no land without craters' we have to put the villagers near sources of water , explained khamhoung sipaseuth , a senior planner and organizer of new settlements in a program to diminish the seminomadic tribes' destructive slashandburn agriculture , which progressively denudes the mountainsides , and settle them at lower altitudes and anyway , he added , there is no land in this region without craters nhim bounlao , a 45yearold village headman of the mangkong tribe , did not complain about the desolate site he was intimidated , perhaps , by the presence of two officials of the government that persuaded the villagers to move they do not mind living at a lower altitude , he said , but miss their accustomed fruit trees around him , swarms of young children were playing , ducking in and out of craters and avoiding the one visible , halfburied unexploded bomb most were poorly clothed , many not at all pigs grunted from below the stilted houses tobacco and rattan were drying on the ground , against the sides of craters , but not in commercial quantity the village , mr nhim bounlao said , has only one cash crop , the same that they gathered at the old site until they moved last year the product , he said , is scrap metal , largely bomb fragments , but also parts of american planes and south vietnamese helicopters and vehicles the tribesmen sell the scrap to merchants who come periodically from savannakhet and resell their gleanings across the mekong to thailand cluster bombs still kill mr nhim bounlao proudly showed the village s monument to its source of earnings piled near the roadside were some of the remains of an american fighterbomber , ferociously guarded by a female dog that had sought shelter under the scrap for her new litter their covering was a flattened , olivedrab cannister marked dispenser and bomb , aircraft , cbu the initials stand for the cluster bombs , which to this day , prime minister kaysone phomvihane said in an interview , take a toll of victims on impact , the bombs spread many small land mines , which explode when tread upon dr sipsalao phasaisi of tchepone district clinic , a diffident 34yearold man who learned all his medicine through interpreters from soviet and french teachers in vientiane , the capital , said the latest mine deaths occurred last year , when a farmer struck a missile with his shovel he would not have died , he said , except that it took two days to bring him here because of the shortage of roads and transport

storrs , conn giorgio cavallon is the kind of painter that art institutions have a hard time with he was not a revolutionary he did not have the ferocity and ambition of other firstgeneration abstract expressionists , like jackson pollock and willem de kooning he did not have the kind of pictorial imagination that knocks you off your feet with its invention and sweep cavallon who died in december at the age of 85 was a shy , almost taciturn , man who distrusted words , and his work does not need language to complete it throughout his welcome but badly flawed retrospective at the benton museum of art at the university of connecticut in storrs \( through may 20 \) , there is a sense of an artist who almost never allowed himself to be pressured he cultivated paintings over months and years he always seemed to know where he was going , but he never seemed to be in a hurry to get there cavallon loved the slow , firm movement of the paintbrush and the secrets and disclosures of paint , loved what happened when he entered his studio alone and began putting one color here and another there until his gardens , villages and cities of color were complete he painted because he had to , and it often seemed that he did not care whether anyone saw the results like all artists he was responding to voices , but by the end of his life that they were so distant and inaudible to everyone else that he seemed to be painting for himself alone giorgio cavallon 19041989 a retrospective view was originally scheduled for 1991 but was moved up in the vain hope that the ailing artist might be able to see it there are 91 works 58 paintings , 25 watercolors and 8 ink drawings spanning cavallon s career , from the realism of the 1920 s and 30 s , through the explorations of synthetic cubism and mondrian , to the paintings of the last 30 years , in which cavallon managed to give italian classicism a tenuous yet stable modern form cavallon was born in the village of sorio in the northern italian province of vicenza in 1904 his father , augusto , was a cabinetmaker who worked both in italy and in the united states and served in the italian army during world war i cavallon spent the war on a farm , where he passed his days in the fields , tending oxen , scratching drawings in bomb casings , and shapes and patterns in the earth he immigrated to the united states in 1920 and worked as a mechanic in springfield , mass he would also work as a carpenter he moved to new york in 1926 and spent five years at the national academy of design he studied in provincetown , mass , with charles w hawthorne , who , cavallon said , never believed in drawing he believed that if you put the right color in the right place you did n't need to draw he was also a student of the abstract expressionist painter and teacher hans hofmann one of the many european refugees who , like cavallon , began as figurative artists and then converted to abstraction with the faith of a true believer cavallon does not really fit anywhere his feeling for an irregular pictorial grid , for the way the color white can both veil the surface and seem to draw from some deep well behind it , and for a dynamic yet flat space reflects his awareness of fellow firstgeneration abstract expressionists like arshile gorky , de kooning and hofmann yet his work is uninsistent and modest it is neither heroic nor antiheroic , metaphysical nor antimetaphysical except during the last few years , cavallon never seemed to be trying to be poetic his poetry , like that of his italian compatriot giorgio morandi , seems to emerge naturally at the end of the pictorial process rather than direct it from the beginning in his abstract paintings , cavallon had one foot in italy and one in the united states his respect for craft was italian he built his stove , refigerator , sofa and fountain he constructed his stretchers the chalky luminosity and throbbing glow of his color would probably not have been possible if he had not made his own paint the show includes a realistic 1928 portrait of his father and a 1930 italian landscape of soft rolling hills that cavallon kept with him his feeling for geometry and light was rooted in the houses and farmland of vicenza his soft , eloquent brushwork and suffused light suggest venetian art the whites for which he was well known also suggest italy in an untitled 1957 painting from the guggenheim museum , white fills space like steam , smoke or clouds , or like a morning mist over an italian plain a scaffolding of color pushes through the surface like the words and images of a poster whitewashed on a village wall his work was no less affected by new york , where he took small , villagelike blocks of color , moved them around and built them into a pictorial edifice in which architectural compartments and plots of land seem as mobile as a deck of cards or a juggler s balls like city crowds , his shapes shoot forward and pull back , lean against and jostle one another the clusters and clumps of shapes and colors suggest both huddling together and creating elbow space , needing to be with others and struggling to be alone
tirrenia , italy , june 6 during the united states' 21 loss to switzerland on saturday , several american players were hammered fairly hard the team s leading scorer , bruce murray , in particular , had a difficult time as the man marking him seemed more interested in kicking his legs than the ball on one play , the swiss defender conked murray with his forehead this sort of behavior is not unusual in soccer during the 1986 world cup finals in mexico , the south korean team knocked down diego maradona of argentina 11 times the uruguayan team treated him rather rudely , as well four years earlier in spain , claudio gentile of italy spent the full 90 minutes trying to kick maradona , often succeeding he said later , soccer is not for ballerinas as the united states team has prepared for the 1990 world cup finals , which start friday , the americans have shown a remarkable patience toward overly aggressive players for the most part , they have turned the other cheek , in compliance with rules that , in theory at least , forbid maulings and thuggery three physical foes while that may seem admirable in the context of sportsmanship , it raises an important question , as the americans must contend with three physical european teams in the first round of the tournament , czechoslovakia on sunday , italy the next thursday and austria five days after that are the americans mean enough to win \? for now , one can only guess while several of the players promised that the team could generate as much nastiness as necessary , others were n't so sure it s funny , said paul caligiuri , walking off the field after the morning workout in the rain in international tournaments , we always seem to win the fairplay award i think we 're too clean , myself included , said murray as a team , we have to get more aggressive fifa , the world governing body of soccer , would much prefer that all 24 teams in the finals comport themselves in gentlemanly style the lords of the game have gone so far as to instruct referees to call tighter games than usual , a directive chiefly aimed at eliminating the socalled professional foul that occurs when an offensive player has only the goalkeeper to beat , and another defensive player grabs him or tackles him under the guise of trying to knock the ball free with just one referee working each game , it is sometimes a judgment call , and the violated player frequently falls to the turf , writhing in feigned agony , to influence the call in the world cup , a player committing such a foul will be ejected ca n't see everything but so much more goes on during play in the swiss game , peter vermes , a forward and one of the few americans who plays for a european club team , was often impeded by defenders grabbing his wrists and tugging at his jersey , common tactics that are seldom detected by the referee , who generally watches play at the ball and is the only one who can call a foul there is so much people do n't see off the ball , vermes said i'm always wrestling with my guy it s like in basketball , when patrick ewing and charles barkley are fighting like crazy around the box one of a forward s greatest assets is his arms upperbody strength is a great weapon often , aggression , no matter how subtle , is a manifestation of machismo , and a player s early attempts to establish dominance can set the tone for the game sometimes , it happens on the first encounter if he gets me the first time down field , then i have to retaliate , said desmond armstrong , a defensive player it s not dirty , per se it s competitive it s clean it s man to man i have to let you know i'm coming for you as a rule , said vermes , the first time i touch the ball , i get whacked i can either beat him , or the first time he touches the ball , whack him john stollmeyer , a stubby midfielder , is regarded as the closest thing the united states has to an enforcer , a reputation earned by his willingness to make hard , sliding tackles john doyle and marcelo balboa , both substitute defensive players , have shown a similar ability so has tab ramos , a starting midfielder but none of the americans have done so with any consistency recently certainly no professional fouling and most are incapable of raising their overall level of aggressiveness for the entire game bending the rules you ca n't just go out there and clean somebody s clock , said stollmeyer , referring to the rougher tackling but there are guys who get away with it as an american , we try to play by the rules but we also learn to flex and bend them you do n't let other guys get into a dangerous rhythm , whether it s right or wrong with hooliganism such an alarming problem for soccer and a major concern during the world cup , fifa officials seem intent on demanding proper behavior by its participants of course , their vigilance might be tested at any time cameroon , for example , plays argentina in the opening match , and maradona has an inflammation on the big toe of his right foot photo john stollmeyer , left , and brian bliss of the united states team visiting the montenero sanctuary yesterday during a break in training in italy \( associated press \)
summerstock theaters are those places in which young hopefuls in the industry can gain experience and where moreexperienced hopefuls can hone their craft while waiting for that big break summer stock is also the haven in which those respectable actors who will never make the big time can still work in front of generally appreciative audiences who demand nothing more than a break in their vacation routine on long island , the resident stock theater is the gateway playhouse in bellport , where the seasons regularly consist of proven mainstream musicals and comedies this is not a theater that considers new and developing plays , or serious , thoughtprovoking drama gateway has been in operation for 40 years , and its crowdpleasing season this year consists of shows like neil simon s comedy rumors and musicals like hair , anything goes , a chorus line and , currently , a polished production of me and my girl biggest wartime hit me and my girl , which has music by noel gay and book and lyrics by l arthur rose and douglas furber , opened in london in 1937 it was the longestrunning musical of the 30 s and london s biggest wartime hit mgm made a film of the musical in 1939 , retitling it the lambeth walk it has been revived frequently not only in london , but also in america in 1986 , the show was revived again on broadway , with robert lindsay as the star it was an unqualified hit of the season at the gateway , this bubbly musical has lost none of the charm that has made it so enduringly appealing in brief , this is a ragstoriches pygmalion tale about bill snibson , a cockney chap from the streets of london s lambeth section who discovers he is the longlost 17th baron and eighth viscount of hareford his blueblooded relatives will claim him if he learns proper behavior and speech and , of course , if he gets rid of his girlfriend , sally smith the combination of bill and sally adds up to more than two individuals who merely think they are in love theirs is , in fact , a magical pairing and nothing , including great wealth , the elegant temptations of hareford hall , the lure of lambeth or the indomitable will of the duchess of dene can part bill from his girl what gives me and my girl special appeal and elevates it above the mundane is the nonstop series of silly , sweet and generally funny oneliners , corny verbal and visual puns and theatrical pratfalls on broadway , the role of bill snibson was undertaken with great success by mr lindsay and later by jim dale gateway is fortunate enough to have the energetic and talented james young deliver snibson s cockney rhymes , slapstick and burlesque routines mr young was mr dale s understudy on broadway , and his experience has enabled him to polish the role and make it his own a side benefit to summerstock theaters of not being able to afford stars is that shows can be richer because of the ensuing ensemble work in this case , mr young , while being very much the center of me and my girl , does not steal it away from the other performers the musical is allowed to be the sweet bit of romantic nonsense it was intended to be without the lopsided quality that a star can sometimes create robert longbottom , the director and choreographer , has recreated much of the sense of fun and visual excitement inherent in the broadway version numbers like the lambeth walk are literal showstoppers , with the audience joining in the fun to close act i with enthusiastic , rhythmic handclapping the show is filled with dancing ranging from high kicks to soft shoe to tap , all well executed and pleasing to the eye the cast performs with an obvious enthusiasm and eagerness to please , which is as refreshing as a pleasant summer breeze gary marachek , who bears a slight resemblance to james cagney , is marvelous as the droll sir john tremayne , one of the executors of the hareford will sir john and maria , the dour duchess of dene , have the obligation to turn the cockney bill into a lordtothemanor born as the plot develops , it becomes clear that sir john and maria are actually the play s secondary romantic interest maria is played with haughty grandeur by norma crawford ida henry is lady jacqueline , a coldhearted gold digger who intends to lure bill away from sally , or at least until a good spanking from her beau changes her mind the role of the feisty sally , bill s lambeth love , is undertaken by liz mccarthy , who brings to the character an innate dignity and class that makes the play s my fair lady ending quite believable it is a show filled with laughs , sight gags , singalong songs and a spunsugar confection of a plot this production of me and my girl , which continues through july 29 , is bright summerstock entertainment as refreshing as a sip of iced tea while sitting on the deck of a cottage overlooking the water photo of chris lesson with james young in a scene from me and my girl
paris for france , this is de gaulle s year a memorial with subtle gallic undertones of change to adjust to a new shape of europe the emphasis is on nostalgia , grandeur and , just below the surface , nato elaborate displays have been arranged for monday , the 50th anniversary of the appeal of june 18 , when de gaulle broadcast from london that france would continue the fight despite the armistice offered hitler on june 16 , 1940 this year is also the 100th anniversary of the hero s birth and the 20th of his death , so there has been an outpouring of tribute , analysis and proud remembrance de gaulle succeeded in restoring his country s shattered selfesteem , in part by making france the burr of the western world his heritage entered french politics as a sacred command , none more so than the policy of independent defense , proclaimed when he pulled france out of nato s military organization in 1966 president mitterrand declared again last month that it would n't go back but a difference has crept in so long as the military structure remains what it is today , as prime minister michel rocard noted afterward fudging to presage a reversal is also part of de gaulle s heritage , as when the general told french colonists fighting algerian independence , i have understood you suggestive phrases , muted debate , praise of de gaulle s capacity to adapt to circumstances signal a reconsideration of paris s alliance policy now france holds the key to the new problems of remolding nato so that it can survive well beyond the collapsing warsaw pact , encompass a united germany without discrimination and help moscow accept what it cannot prevent the nato summit meeting next month is to review its mission and doctrine as the soviet threat recedes france is among the allies most determined that the alliance continue to exist it accepts none of the soviet suggestions for a new european security system , not dissolving alliances , not german neutrality , and certainly not the french model for germany , a national military outside allied command the logical solution is for france to join the command the main obstacle is the political oath of exclusive national control of defense , though french experts have long conceded in private that it is an illusion , relying on american support and contradicted by all sorts of practical involvement with nato it was even revealed last year , without cries of horror or betrayal here , that the us played a critical role in helping france build its nuclear force de frappe , the keystone of independent defense there are many signs that public insistence on the old policy is as superficial as american opinion against recognizing communist china proved to be when president nixon defied conventional shibboleths and flew to beijing instead of outrage , the reaction after decades was , at last former prime minister jacques chirac , leader of the neogaullist party , has tested the waters most boldly he has put the right twist on the approach de gaulle was rejecting american domination , he said recently , a waiting arrangement for the day when europe would at last be able to take its fate in hand the time has come , he said , for france to take a direct part in the defense of the continent he even suggested including its tactical nuclear weapons and possibly a strategic nuclear agreement with britain but he made clear this europeanization must not exclude the us mr chirac proposed parallel european and american military commands , an awkward idea when it draws down its forces , to the 100 , 000 or so proposed by senator sam nunn , there is no reason the us could n't accept a french supreme commander this is the way to go like so much else that seemed impossible a year ago , it is becoming feasible an alternative to remodeling the alliance is the balkanization of western europe , growing german nationalism , dilution of the european community and a reversion to the catastrophic prewar situation in europe many others are thinking along these lines dissolving alliances may sound peaceable but it is more likely to mean renewal of the idea of national military forces than common security the french will still be prickly they do n't like the idea of a predominantly political nato for fear it would give the us too much say in european community policy or force european support for us decisions elsewhere but invoking de gaulle means they 're moving the us , in planning nato s future , should look for ways to bring france back
washington , april 8 military contractors , threatened as never before by shrinking pentagon budgets , are responding with aggressive lobbying to protect weapons programs worth hundreds of billions of dollars companies are turning to new tactics and enlisting help at all levels , from chief executives to minor subcontractors alliances are forming between corporations and unions lobbyists are even lashing out at their competitors' programs , long an unspoken taboo some lawmakers and other critics say lobbyists are skewing the decisionmaking process by seeking to save their own programs at a time when the diminishing soviet threat makes it necessary to reconstitute the military structure the industry s heightened sensitivity was illustrated last week after an analyst for the heritage foundation suggested that the air force reevaluate two mcdonnell douglas aircraft programs the company retaliated quickly , cutting off an annual grant to the conservative research group in the past , a paper like the one heritage circulated on capitol hill might have gone unnoticed in the boardrooms of top military contractors but the world is being made over , and so is the world of military spending the best way you can describe it is they 're in a stunned panic , said representative marvin leath , democrat of texas , a member of the armed services committee , so they 're doing what everybody would do in a situation like this they 're trying to save their programs the powers of persuasion the 100 registered lobbyists of the top 10 military contractors have honed their persuasive powers for years on lawmakers and pentagon officials , whether at businesslike office meetings or in the more relaxed settings of expensive washington restaurants scores more people not registered as lobbyists perform similar functions many are former pentagon or congressional officials working for contractors or public relations firms while lobbying has always influenced decisions in congress , it has grown more intense now that there is less money to go around lawmakers and outside analysts say that if the bush administration and congress had developed a military spending plan based on new strategic needs , it would determine which programs would be saved without such a plan , decisions to salvage programs , or at least stretch out their lives , may be made for reasons having little to do with military strategy the pentagon and congress have not yet decided how much to pare the 1991 military budget the armed forces are not scheduled to submit their revisions to congress on a fiveyear military spending plan until april 30 'more than ever before' representative les aspin , democrat of wisconsin , chairman of the armed services committee , warned that the longer the administration takes to set priorities , the more the lobbyists will advance pet programs without a strategy , he said , the strongest guiding force may be the aroma of pork m l \( buzz \) hefti , the chief lobbyist here for the alliedsignal aerospace company , a subcontractor on the b2 bomber , said we are all trying to influence more members of congress than ever before each of us knows that some programs somewhere will be cut we all work to make sure that our most important program is not cut lobbyists for military contractors have gone into overdrive , refining their pitches and plying their pressure tactics on research groups and administration officials and the general public through commercials and advertisements they concede the possibility that congress will scuttle a major hardware program yet the lobbyists make a new pitch to congressional offices they argue that their aircraft systems or helicopter programs are still indispensable , perhaps for more popular programs like detecting drug traffickers and now , bashing the opposition lobbyists are also rewriting the old rules under which they praised their projects without criticizing their competitors because the pie is smaller , people are going around and not just selling their own program but talking about the other guy s program , too , said john j stirk , the chief lobbyist here for general dynamics top executives of mcdonnell douglas were infuriated after jay p kosminsky , the heritage foundation s deputy director for defense policy , wrote that the air force should reevaluate its c17 cargo plane and its advanced tactical fighter , both of which are made by mcdonnell douglas the company gave heritage a 30 , 000 grant last year this year it gave nothing in a letter a few days ago to heritage , walter e diggs jr , the mcdonnell douglas vice president for civic affairs , explained the change of heart it is our view that we must maintain a defense capability second to none , whatever one concludes about the reversibility or nonreversibility of change in the soviet union the heritage foundation has reached a different conclusion and recommends resources and programs that we consider to be inadequate to meet our requirements still the opinion was feared
miami , june 9 despite an unceasing search to find physical evidence of drug dealing by gen manuel antonio noriega , disappointed american officials say they have found almost no documents so far that conclusively prove general noriega trafficked in drugs american officials say they expected to find a damning paper trail of incriminating documents among general noriega s private and official papers , most of which are thought to have been seized by american troops that invaded panama last december the reagan and bush administrations long depicted general noriega , who faces two separate indictments accusing him of drug dealing and money laundering , as a big drug trafficker the general has pleaded not guilty and is not expected to come to trial until next year in an effort to assess the government s case against general noriega , interviews with more than 15 current and former american intelligence and diplomatic officials , as well as several former members of the panamanian government , were carried out in four countries over the last two weeks a 'dear tony' message so far , the most damaging physical evidence against the general appears to be a letter discovered last month by panamanian investigators , rather than by american soldiers rogelio cruz , the attorney general of panama , said it was found in a bank safedeposit box belonging to general noriega s wife american and panamanian officials say the letter was written to general noriega by a convicted american drug dealer , steven kalish the 16page letter , written in english , begins , dear tony it purports to discuss how to deal with colombian cocaine traffickers the letter is signed brown and includes the admonition , please keep this letter in strictest confidence because i never want to see it in the united states use of diplomatic passport the officials say mr kalish used the code name brown while he dealt drugs and laundered profits with general noriega they say the general provided mr kalish with a panamanian diplomatic passport under the name frank brown that he used to travel in and out of the united states while transporting millions of dollars in drug profits to launder through panamanian banks prosecutors say they expect mr kalish to testify against the general the government also has apparently secured the testimony of enrique a \( kiki \) pretelt , a 47yearold panamanian jeweler who said in a plea agreement accepted on friday in tampa , fla , that he had helped launder drug proceeds with two convicted tampa drug smugglers a fourth silent partner in their business was general manuel noriega , the agreement said under the agreement , mr pretelt promised to cooperate , testify and turn over any relevant documents but other than the letter signed brown , a sixmonth review of tens of thousands of captured documents has turned up no evidence of drug dealing by general noriega , according to three american officials closely informed of the painstaking review of documents by several american agencies we 've found no smoking gun in the documents , said an american official in panama noriega was smart enough not to put anything on paper with few if any incriminating documents in hand to add credence to the testimony of unsavory witnesses , justice department officials say they are turning their attention to a review of deposits and withdrawals for bank accounts controlled by general noriega and his associates the officials say they are trying to correlate dates and amounts of the movement of monies through the accounts with the testimony of witnesses who claim to have deposited drug profits in those accounts for the general while that review goes on , american officials have been criticized for the way they have handled a warehouse full of documents captured in panama frank a rubino , general noriega s chief defense lawyer , said in an interview that it was likely that american intelligence agencies had sanitized the documents of embarrassing material but justice department officials say they have been given access to all documents , which are under the control of the united states army but when pressed , officials from the pentagon , state department and justice department said it was possible some documents were destroyed or removed during the chaotic first days of the invasion if that happened , it was not intentional , they said we have heard a bunch of rumors to that effect , but we have not been able to substantiate any of them , said charles s saphos , chief of the justice department s division of narcotic and dangerous drugs mr saphos said he had no reservations whatever that all captured documents were available to prosecutors , and that none had been purposely concealed or removed trying to guard against tampering american officials say they have used former members of the panamanian army to help identify and organize some documents some panamanian officials have called that a risky step that could allow former military officials to tamper with evidence senior american officials said the documents were under guard

new york city s relatively paltry selection of quality restaurants on the waterfront has been substantially enhanced with the recent arrival of the hudson river club , a handsome and comfortable dining room facing new york harbor with the statue of liberty and ellis island off in the distance the food can be as inspiring as the setting the hudson river club is one of the newest restaurants in the imposing world financial center , which also houses offices , shops and a spectacular glassenclosed public atrium at midday , the complex buzzes with the financialindustry crowd after sunset , though , janitors seem to outnumber visitors the challenge facing the hudson river club is to lure diners this far downtown at night after four samplings of the regional american menu by waldy malouf , a chef who was recruited from la cremaillere in banksville , ny , i 'd say the odds are better than ever that it can be done the hudson river club , designed by philip george \( he also did le bernardin \) , is a long , threetier space in light oak paneling with brass accents , subtle fabriccovered banquettes and handsome art from the hudson valley school befitting a place that caters to discreet bankers and brokers , conversations are well muffled at a recent lunch , the room was filled with darksuited wall streeters , many with beepers , cellular telephones and handsize computers on the tables mr malouf s cohesive and wellrounded menu emphasizes foods and wines from the hudson river valley a fine example among starters is the magnificent pumpkinapple soup , a fine balance of earthy and sweet , garnished with croutons , crumbled bacon and cinnamon another personal favorite is the domeshaped fritter of lump crabmeat encased in golden potatoes and slices of toasted almonds the most refined and fought over appetizer at my table was the ethereal sea urchin custard three halved urchin shells filled with the powerfully oceanic roe whipped with brandy , cream and egg , garnished with a white butter sauce and caviar a pretty salad of lobster , mixed greens , turnips and green beans , however , suffered a common problem the kitchen was so concerned with the salad s appearance that the dressing was unevenly drizzled over for effect , not flavor the pheasantandvenison terrine with cranberry relish , on the other hand , is mildly gamy , moist and exceptionally well seasoned like most new restaurants , the hudson river club is having difficulty getting its service crew shipshape some of the waiters seem to be in a fog we had to ask for water four times at lunch and little details like winepouring , tableclearing and knowledge of food are hit and miss the restaurant makes an admirable effort to introduce regional american wines at fair prices , from not only california and the hudson river valley , but also such diverse places as texas , the pacific northwest and michigan it would be helpful , though , if someone on the staff would take the initiative to describe some of the lesserknown wines to customers among the superior main courses are perfectly cooked salmon wrapped in a webbing of thin fried potatoes with a bright parsleyanddill sauce a meaty roasted veal shank embellished with orange rind , rosemary , baby turnips and carrots \( i just wish a marrow knife were provided \) , and succulent squab , moist and distinctive , with a sauce enriched with foie gras mr malouf s cooking is impressive not just for its cleanly orchestrated flavors , but also for his attention to complementary textures and flavors no two dishes have the same garnish one of the highlights of the current menu is roasted chicken that is coated with a mixture of crushed walnuts and maple syrup it is then deboned and served with pan juices along with a potato basket holding celeryroot puree surprisingly , the juices are only faintly sweet with maple flavor , and the assertive celery root is a perfect foil veal steak cut from the loin is superb , too , wrapped in caramelized leeks and served with winter squash and potato pancakes a few of mr malouf s creations seemed conceptually flawed a thick cornmeal coating on sea scallops obscures their flavor , and a sauce of hard apple cider with sliced apples further muddies the waters a filet mignonshaped tuna steak as thick as an almanac the faddish way to prepare tuna these days was , as is so often the case , unevenly cooked dry outside , mediumrare in the middle i have not seen any banana plantations along the hudson river , but that would not stop me from ordering a dessert of banana mousse under a lid of crinkled phyllo dough with mango sorbet and sliced bananas steamed gingerbread is outrageously good , garnished with slices of ripe pears and a light caramel sauce other rousing options are maple custard with orange and apple slices , apple tart with an excellent buttery crust and walnut ice cream , and lemonmeringue tarts it is probably just as well that the hudson river club is getting off to a slow start at dinner , for the service staff needs some seasoning but with word of mr malouf s cooking spreading fast , the grace period should be shortlived hudson river club  250

manila , june 2 as the philippines gets ready for a new round of talks on the future of the united states military installations , many americans living here are bracing themselves for increasing antiamerican violence , which in the last year has taken the lives of eight americans in the latest effort to protect americans , hundreds of philippine troops staged a show of force today against communist rebels after united states officials ordered troops at clark air base in angeles , about 50 miles northwest of manila , to stay on base about 500 troops and policemen brandishing m16 rifles and carrying anticommunist banners motored through the streets of angeles and nearby neighborhoods , where many rebels live and operate on friday , united states officials renewed restrictions on the 23 , 000 troops , defense department civilians and military dependents at clark air base , one of the six united states installations in the philippines officials cited an undisclosed security threat to the area , where communist rebels killed two american airmen last month the tight security measures , which include a strict curfew at clark and nearby subic bay naval station , came as the communists have begun an intensified campaign to harass and intimidate americans here in an effort to force the united states to give up the bases the treaty that allows the bases to operate on philippine soil expires next year , and negotiations are under way between the two governments to renew the lease agreement the heated political debate over the bases has focused attention on the american presence in this former colony , where the united states is both resented and revered recent opinion polls have noted a marked increase in antiamerican sentiment and growing nationalism at least a dozen members of the 23seat senate , which would have to ratify a new bases treaty , have publicly expressed opposition to the bases , and even conservative politicians with onetime proamerican views have switched sides although the communist rebel attacks have focused on united states military personnel , many other americans living here are increasingly feeling uneasy about their own safety united states embassy employees , american aid officials and business executives have been instructed to take extraordinary precautions , including riding in bulletproof vehicles , taking different routes to work and varying their normal patterns on may 26 , the state department issued an advisory warning the 140 , 000 americans living in the philippines that they faced an increased risk of terrorism as the bases talks approached , and the defense department raised hazard pay for military and civilian personnel stationed in this country interviews with american citizens living here , none of whom wanted to be identified , illustrated some of the apprehension they feel about the growing animosity against americans fear 'under your skin' you do n't consciously articulate the fear to yourself , but it s there , said an american woman who lives in an exclusive manila suburb it s sort of under your skin the wife of an american businessman said she had put extra locks in her house and hired an additional security guard she also says she avoids markets and other crowded areas just because i have a white face and blond hair another woman whose husband works for the united states embassy is so cautious that she refuses to go out of the affluent , wellguarded enclave where she lives an american aid official said , i have an account at the bank of america , but i'm not going there anymore' a retired american businessman who runs an electronics company here says businessmen are not targets yet , but he refused to be identified for fear of being put on some sort of hit list residents cite the low attendance at last week s memorial day ceremonies for americans as another sign of fear and attendance at big parties and functions organized by americans has also dropped because of the threats
shanghai on what is now an expanse of rice paddies and dilapidated buldings , china has begun a massive project to build an asian financial capital and prove to the world that it is still open for business the plan calls for turning the neglected eastern part of shanghai into a special foreigninvestment zone that would include a free port , branches of foreign banks and hightechnology developments on land leased for up to 70 years to foreign capitalists the first stage alone would cost 10 billion the government regards the plan as the nation s prime development program for the rest of the century and beyond in any discussion , officials refer to east shanghai as exhibit no 1 in the argument that the nation s policies have not changed since before the crackdown on prodemocracy forces in june 1989 if the project succeeds , it will undoubtedly have an enormous impact not only in reviving shanghai , midway down the pacific coast , but in redirecting the economic focus of china from the pearl river near hong kong in the south to the yangtze river cutting through the center of the nation home to 35 percent of china s people , and 8 percent of the world s population but some chinese officials and foreign specialists are skeptical that the project will get very far it s a castle built on air , said a chinese journalist who has highlevel contacts with officials here and in beijing an official who works in the communist party apparatus is a bit more delicate perhaps it will succeed , but it will take a very long time indeed , east shanghai s timing could scarcely be worse in terms of soliciting investment european businesses are absorbed by the opening of eastern europe american and japanese investors are still skittish only taiwan is an expanding source of foreign investment , but most taiwanese plans involve opening relatively small factories in fujian and guangdong provinces in southern china rather than in shanghai moreover , most taiwanese investors are interested in transferring laborintensive manufacturing from their island to cheaplabor areas of the chinese mainland but east shanghai is trying to attract hightechnology and skilledlabor operations foreign investors are crucial because the government is now planning to allocate only about 14 billion of the 10 billion that mayor zhu rongji says he needs in the first five or 10 years to build east shanghai shanghai itself is planning to allocate 1 billion over the next five years , and government banks are expected to lend several billion dollars more but to make the sums add up , billions more in foreign investment will be required partly because of the shortage of money , and the need to invest initially in infrastructure that will not have an immediate payback , some chinese economists have doubts about the entire project they suggest that the money would be better spent on modernizing shanghai s existing factories or on a smallerscale project for east shanghai that would be cheaper and more manageable while ideas for developing east shanghai have been kicking around for the better part of a decade , the government formally approved the master plan in april to tumultuous attention in the national news media mr zhu is now in the united states on a threeweek tour in which he is expected to solicit investment in the region an ardent backer of economic change who is sometimes mentioned by foreigners in china as a potential chinese gorbachev , mr zhu , who declined to be interviewed for this article , is the highestlevel chinese official to visit the united states since the crackdown east shanghai is separated by the huangpu river from the bustling rest of the city while the main part of shanghai is the biggest and perhaps most cosmopolitan city in the nation with memories of its precommunist role as an asian capital of finance and sin east shanghai is mostly farmland , with a bit of industry along the banks of the huangpu some in the area hope that the east shanghai project will finally get the entire city moving again , after four decades of decay even in the dozen years since china opened to the outside world , shanghai s industrial growth rates have lagged well behind those of the rest of the nation so now the government is inviting foreign investors to help reshape the nation s most populous city shanghai has an estimated 15 million people , including illegal immigrants and officials say they are optimistic that foreigners will oblige this is the intersection of the richest river in china and the west coast of the pacific ocean , said sha lin , chief executive of the east shanghai development office it will also be the intersection of the chinese economy and the international economy , and so many companies want to invest here and make it a window on the world mr sha , a 53yearold scientist who lived in the united states for two years in the early 1980 s , has a staff of 63 crowded into a twostory building on the east side of the huangpu river
washington , oct 17 an internal investigation by the interior department has found that the government s program to protect endangered animals is so mismanaged that hundreds of threatened species face extinction without any federal effort to save them the inquiry by the department s inspector general identified 34 species of animals and plants that have been declared extinct in the last decade in part because they had received inadequate protection under the endangered species act the fish and wildlife service , an agency of the interior department , is responsible for enforcing the act in a final report on the investigation the inspector general , james r richards , said the wildlife service has not effectively implemented a domestic endangered species program , and we question whether accomplishment of the program as it is presently structured and funded is feasible the endangered species act is at the center of one of the most heated environental debates in years , pitting the fish and wildlife service against the timber industry in the pacific northwest over the fate of the northern spotted owl federal scientists say the rare owl is dying out because of heavy logging of its ancient forest habitat findings termed accurate even though the inspector general s sept 27 report is a harshly worded indictment of the fish and wildlife service , the service has conceded the accuracy of many of the report s findings in a letter to the inspector general , richard n smith , the deputy director of the fish and wildlife service , said , the service acknowledges the overall theme of the report a lack of sufficient resources to effectively accomplish the goals of the endangered species act according to an estimate cited in the report , the wildlife service would need 46 billion to carry out the law properly and to rescue the hundreds of endangered species yet , the report says , only 33 million has been alloted this year to administer the endangered species act it is obvious that the service s mission cannot be fully accomplished at present funding levels , the report said formal designation required a central finding of the investigation was that the fish and wildlife service has failed to place hundreds of species of animals and plants on the list of endangered species even though there was substantial evidence to believe they are threatened without a formal designation as a threatened species , the report said , the animals and plants are not entitled to receive the special protection required by the endangered species act if they do n't get listed they do n't get protected , said harold bloom , the interior department s assistant inspector general for audits it s that simple the report found that about 550 species have been formally identified by the fish and wildlife service as endangered , which means they are in danger of extinction , or threatened , which means they will probably be in danger in the future but an additional 600 known and 3 , 000 probable endangered or threatened animals and plants have not been listed , the report said in its letter to the inspector general , the fish and wildlife service acknowledged the backlog in listing endangered species it attributed the problem to a shortage of personnel and dollars necessary to complete the scientific research and bureaucratic reviews required under the law lack of resources cited mr bloom said the investigation showed that the endangered species program was hampered by bureaucracy and a lack of resources they have a huge mission , and they do n't have near enough resources to do it he added , if they keep progressing at the snail s pace we see now , there s a good chance that many of those 3 , 600 other species will become extinct over the years the list of 34 extinct species ranged from wildflowers to fish to gophers and mice the largest animal on the list is the montana woodland caribou according to the report , the species were declared extinct over the last 10 years without ever having received full benefit of the protections in the endangered species act mr bloom said none of the 34 species had ever been listed as threatened or endangered by the fish and wildlife service when extinction occurred in what appeared to be an effort to deflect any possible criticism that the bush or reagan administrations were responsible for the demise of the species , the wildlife service said in its letter to the inspector general that extinction for nearly all of these species occurred long before 1980 it also denied that the montana caribou should be on the list the species is not extinct , the letter said we simply do not have a listable 'population' now , and cannot confirm that one ever did exist the report comes as the endangered species act is under attack by a contingent of lawmakers and timber industry lobbyists for months the bush administration has tried to find a solution to the furor over the northern spotted owl , which was declared a threatened species last june scientists have said that a comprehensive plan to save the owl , as required under the law , would require a 50 percent reduction in the timber harvest in washington , oregon and northern california , forcing more than 20 , 000 loggers out of work over the next decade a lack of adequate plans the inspector general s report found that even when the fish and wildlife service has properly listed a species as endangered , it often fails to devise an adequate plan to save the animals or plants under the law , the government can be required to purchase and preserve the natural habitat of an endangered species at a cost of millions of dollars the service has diluted its overall effort so that few species have received sufficient attention to allow their full recovery , the report said the estimate to recover all presently known endangered species could be as high as 46 billion versus current annual resources available for this task of 84 million according to the inspector general of the interior department , these are the 34 animal and plant species that have become extinct since 1980 without having received adequate protection

name and tears and other stories forty years of italian fiction edited and translated by kathrine jason 231 pages graywolf press 1795 reading this lively collection of short italian fiction published in the last 40 years or so , the thought occurs that censorship and adversity can sometimes serve a creative purpose , challenging authors to do their utmost to circumvent a government s artistic watchmen this notion can apply not only to dictatorships but also to democratic countries with censorial officials during the years of fascism , italian writers and film makers were closely supervised to make sure that il duce and the corporate state were not offended novelists had to use code language and symbolism in their stories movies being more visible , directors could n't get away with much under mussolini but once freed of government scrutiny , there was an explosion of powerful neorealistic films open city , the bicycle thief , bitter rice , shoe shine in the postwar years similarly , unfettered novels carlo levi s christ stopped at eboli , giorgio bassani s garden of the finzicontinis , elio vittorini s twilight of the elephant , alberto moravia s woman of rome , natalia ginzburg s family sayings revealed suppressed truths and new social attitudes ignazio silone , writing in exile in switzerland because of his antifascism , was able to have his major novels fontamara , bread and wine and the school for dictators brought out for the first time in his own country some of these wellknown italian authors , whose work has been published in the united states , are included in name and tears and other stories others have not appeared before in english translation this selection of 31 stories \( some are excerpts from novels \) , written by 26 authors , is edited and translated by kathrine jason , who has also provided helpful background facts on the contributors her book is a good introduction to modern italian literature and should turn interested readers to longer works by some of these authors ms jason provides a sampling of regional and surrealistic writing , traditions that go back to the works of luigi pirandello and italo svevo earlier in the century the most amusing story in the collection , the discovery of america , is written by none other than the author of the name of the rose and foucault s pendulum umberto eco wrote the story in 1963 , long before his two bestselling novels helped to revive interest in modern italian fiction the story proves that mr eco was no overnight discovery and that his field of semiotics gave him a leg up because he was pulling the reader s in designing his novels the discovery of america is a satire about italian television correspondents who imitate the pretentious style of american anchors the time is 1492 and six italian correspondents are covering columbus s voyage to the new world by satellite linkup between milan , the canary islands , and the universities of salamanca and wittenberg most of the time , they keep passing the microphone to one another of course , there s an expert on hand , a prof leonardo da vinci , to explain the technical aspects of the expedition for the audience when leonardo offers to show viewers his anatomical drawings , the italian anchor cuts him off and switches to the next correspondent in the end , television is covering not columbus but itself sicilian writers are unusually well represented in the collection , nearly all indebted to pirandello , their most famous countryman in the invaded man , gesualdo bufalino imagines an ordinary mortal who has turned into an angel in the missed marriage , giuseppe bonaviri tells of a brother s abortive effort to find a suitor for an unmarried sister in arrival in the city , vitaliano brancati writes about a baroness , virility and a casual encounter in a rented room leonardo sciascia , the best of sicily s writers in recent years , has a story called parlor game , one of his metaphysical mysteries about a marriage in disarray , that appears under a different title , end game , in his book , the winedark sea \( carcanet press \) among the italian authors represented in the collection whose novels have been translated into english are italo calvino , natalia ginzburg , tommaso landolfi , alberto moravia , vasco pratolini , mario soldati and elio vittorini , whose story , name and tears , gives the book its title ms jason notes that this short piece served as the preface and title of the first edition of vittorini s conversation in sicily , which was written under the constraints of fascist censorship in 1937 this background is necessary to understand the story s somewhat vague quality it would be wiser for the reader to turn to conversation in sicily itself \( published in a vittorini omnibus by new directions \) , a major italian novel about a grown man s return to his roots and the surprising discovery he makes about his parents apart from umberto eco , this collection indicates that modern italian fiction is living on its laurels it has suffered terrible losses in the last few years with the deaths of primo levi , italo calvino and leonardo sciascia and some of its major writers , like alberto moravia , giorgio bassani and natalia ginzburg , do n't seem to be producing important new work it s time for another italian renaissance photo umberto eco

boston , jan 12 the tangled stuart murder case has been a nearobsession for this city s news organizations for the past three months , but the character and tone of their reporting coverage have prompted charges that the press has been racist , incompetent and reckless the complaints have come from diverse sources , including blacks , law enforcement agencies , academic press critics and other journalists , and the criticism has changed as the bizarre case has unfolded it s a frenzy and out of control now much more than it was early in the story , said jonathan m klarfeld , director of the print journalism program at boston university and a former boston globe reporter but many news executives vigorously defend the performance of their organizations i really do n't see the racist aspect , said john s driscoll , editor of the globe , who added that he thought news organizations had generally covered the perplexing story responsibly and appropriately , and that a clever , convincing villain misled them and the police the boston press was initially accused of racial bias , mainly by those who thought the press gave disproportionate and sensational coverage to the oct 23 murder of carol stuart husband dies and story changes on the basis of her husband s account , the killing was depicted as the murder of a pregnant white woman by a black robber when she ventured from her home in suburban medford into the city prominent blacks and others protested that crimes against blacks prompted far less media attention and outrage then on jan 4 , the victim s husband , charles , was found dead , apparently a suicide the authorities identified him as the likely killer , and the press was branded as incompetent for not having reported more aggressively and skeptically many boston journalists concede that they had been aware of rumors and inconsistencies almost from the start about the husband s account , but at least partly because of the seriousness of his gunshot wound , this doubt was not reflected in news reports until after his death critics have also said that the city s news organizations allowed themselves to be manipulated by law enforcement agencies for instance , during the investigation , two black men were identified at different times in news reports by anonymous police sources as the primary suspect , though there was no direct evidence against either one critics say this is a tactic investigators sometimes use to advertise for evidence since mr stuart s death , critics say news organizations have gone to the other extreme , spewing a torrent of information about the case based on anonymous sources in what many see as a desperate overcompensation for having been fooled boston is now awash with conflicting versions of what happened and why , as each news organization freely quotes its own unnamed sources account of motive is disputed for instance , the globe last week quoted anonymous sources , in a frontpage article under a twoline banner headline , saying that the slaying was committed for money , including a prudential insurance policy for 480 , 000 , to start a restaurant the boston herald s unnamed sources derided the restaurant motive , and prudential denied there was any insurance policy the herald quoted anonymous sources saying that a local hospital treated mr stuart for cocaine addiction both the globe s sources and the hospital said that was nonsense those who have otherwise lambasted the press have generally praised the city s newspapers and television stations for also extensively airing the controversy raised by their own performance at issue for journalists are some enduring questions of how to fulfill their obligation to be both skeptical and sensitive , especially in reporting on so emotional and explosive a subject also at issue is the relationship of news organizations and law enforcement agencies during a highprofile criminal investigation and beneath such professional concerns is a more murky problem some critics wonder whether news organizations in boston and other cities are out of touch with the poor citizens of their communities , especially the black citizens , and suggest that this ignorance is reflected in a perhaps unconscious racism that shows itself in situations like the stuart case dramatic call to police from the start , everyone concedes the situation could hardly have been more dramatic , especially as it occurred in the aftermath of a rash of other innercity shootings at about 8 35 pm on oct 23 , a police dispatcher received an emergency call from charles stuart , calling from his car telephone after having been shot in the stomach my wife s been shot i 've been shot , mr stuart gasped when the police arrived , they found mr stuart s 30yearold pregnant wife , carol , mortally wounded in the head and mr stuart near death from his wound mr stuart told the police he had been shot by a black man near mission hill , a racially mixed area the robber had shot the couple after mistaking mr stuart for a police officer , he told the investigators the news reports were voluminous and dramatic
three afternoons a week , about 25 children living temporarily at the coachman hotel in white plains , come to its homework center after school five years ago , the coachman was an ordinary hotel , but now the people who live there are n't ordinary guests there are security guards at the front desk , instead of reservations clerks the carpet is worn and shabby , the walls are soiled , and two microwave ovens are on a table in the lobby there s no park nearby , so mothers and babies sit outside by the parking lot the coachman hotel is home for the homeless at the homework center , two rooms off the lobby that had been used as offices , volunteer tutors help the children with their schoolwork many volunteers are retirees , or employed people who can take a few hours off others are high school students and former teachers i 've been helping out at the center for more than a year we offer the children snacks , a quiet place to work , and grownups who can give them undivided attention ideally , each child would be tutored by one volunteer , but there are never enough of us \( for information on volunteering , call 8355331 \) and yet , most days , a great deal gets accomplished the children read stories , draw pictures and do math they work on puzzles , play word games and learn how to measure distances we 've gotten supplies from schools , religious organizations , officesupply companies and private contributors everything is kept in file cabinets , along with progress reports about the children last week , a volunteer noted , a sixthgrade boy got his first library card working at the coachman gives me plenty to think about what does the word , homework mean to a homeless child \? why do federal government policies provide money only for temporary housing , not for anything permanent \? and if this hotel is meant for temporary housing , why are most of the children i knew last year still here \? i asked one boy where he lived before yonkers motel , he told me that was temporary , too when the children arrive at the center , they toss their coats on chairs and head right for the snacks they 're not always ready to begin work after all , they 've just spent a full day in school , and many have traveled a long way to get here some of the children come in taxicabs from schools in peekskill , yonkers and other parts of the county others go to school in white plains , and they travel on school buses , just like the other kids but instead of being dropped off at their homes , these children go to the coachman it s no surprise that some days , they ca n't sit still they 're restless and impatient , and they pester each other by the time 5 o'clock arrives , everyone is exhausted even so , this time is never wasted if one child learns one thing , then it has all been worth it how was your day \? a volunteer asks a first grader , as she sips apple juice and munches on a graham cracker the little girl sighs and says , it was ok her hair is braided into intricate fine rows , but her shoes are too big for her feet she shows the volunteer some worksheets and they sit down together to work on the floor , four children play scrabble with a high school student another volunteer places two very young children on her lap , and reads them a story other children drop in for a while , to see what s doing if there were more volunteers to show an interest in them , i'm sure these children would stay i was once homeless , a high school volunteer tells a 9yearold boy my house burned down a few years ago we lost all our things my cat died , too it was awful my house burned down in mount vernon , the younger child replied now i go to school in white plains but i do n't like it i ca n't see my friends i know what you mean , the volunteer said i was very angry for a long time my family and i had to move into a motel it was horrible there i had a lot of anger but then i realized that school was the best part of my day and that s where i put all my energies he s a senior now and in the national honor society last year , his family found another home things do work out , sometimes it s been said that people become homeless because of drug abuse , alcohol problems or simply because of something they have done it s painful to think of these things when i look at the children of the coachman they are not responsible for any of their problems in fact , they are very good kids dealing extremely well with a terrible situation some of them have serious learning difficulties , but others are very bright will they be able to climb out of this mess some day \? can we help them put all their energies into their schoolwork as the high school volunteer has \? it would be wonderful if none of us had to come here anymore , if all the children were in real homes again , and this hotel were filled with tour groups and wedding parties it s almost 5 pm we 're getting ready to close supplies and projects are put back into the cabinets where are you going now \? a small boy asks me as we 're walking toward the door i swallow hard and answer well , i'm going home drawing
i just came back reeking from the milliondollar shed that s what we call the garden shed at the back of the yard in honor of what it cost to have it fixed up to house a lawn mower and some rusty pruning shears in decent style what i am reeking of is cat , so naturally , in addition to reeking , i am foultempered i 'd gone back there to haul out three plastic bags of garden cuttings for tomorrow s trash pickup , and right now i do n't need any environmental zealots , thank you , denouncing me for using plastic bags instead of turning those garden cuttings into rich , yummy mulch thanks to last summer s vast outlays for chipping , crushing , grinding and mulching machinery we already have alpine peaks of mulch we hear of ugly suspicions that we are planning to run a mulch business in violation of the neighborhood s residential zoning before i went to the milliondollar shed to lug the stuff out , the neighborhood cats decided they had better spray the three bags with cat perfume this would guarantee that any human who trifled with the bags could be easily detected by the cat police and marked for liquidation , i suppose , when the cats come to power i was unaware of walking into their trap neglecting to exercise my powerful nostrils , i hoisted the bags over a fence , rubbing them against my jeans in the process then i went into the house for applause , crying , who says i never do any work around this place \? instead of embracing me in gratitude , loved ones recoiled i inhaled speculatively , then recoiled with them lacking all the perfumes of arabia , i have tried sweetening my hands with dishwasher detergent the jeans are hopeless they have to be buried and , with our residential zoning , burials are probably as illegal as running a mulch business still , i take comfort in the immortal words of eddie fisher count your blessings how lucky that i was n't wearing my brand new italian slacks with the brand new baggy look from milan , the slacks that made envious sons guffaw at first sight and ask if the old twopants suit was making a comeback in a onepants model at least the cats did n't get my chic slacks it delights me to think how this must gall those cats eat your livers , you rotten cats ! all you ruined was a pair of blue jeans blue jeans ! hah ! blue jeans , it might interest these swinish felines to learn , have gone out of fashion anyhow except , of course , when you want to modify the elegant look of an italian silk jacket and matching ascot waistcoat with the casual look created by a wellbattered set of blue jeans the cats who abuse me are not our cats we had cats for many years , and the cats that we had also had cats , which had cats during those years cats did not bother me we kept them out of doors they must have gone to the neighbors to do their worst i did n't even know what they were capable of until the evening on which we had invited eight of the most important human beings in the world to dinner and noticed , 90 minutes before hhour , that the parlor was suffused with an astonishing stench nothing could be done , short of burning the house down none of the guests seemed to notice the odor on the other hand , none of them ever spoke to us again my wife , wise in pet lore , explained the facts of cat life to me i did n't want any excuses it was clear to me what had happened one of our cats had done this to our parlor to show he was miffed about not being included among the dinner guests that cut it with me , and we let attrition gradually render us catless these cats infesting the milliondollar shed belong to the neighbors , the very neighbors , no doubt , who would set the law on us if we put a for sale sign on our mounting mulch i do not hate cats i admire the grace of cats , and their cunning , and the skill with which they compel cat lovers to toady to them if the cats do eventually take over , you can bet it will be the cat lovers who supply the guns for them , seize the palace , man the firing squads and , finally , on orders from the king of the cats , hurl themselves happily from high precipices onto jagged rocks in the meantime , my cat policy is peaceful coexistence these cats that terrify the birds from the garden and perfume the milliondollar shed are cats that go too far i have been practicing with a slingshot and am expert from 30 paces at hitting the cement rabbit hiding in the viburnum one more spraying , el gato , and it s showdown time
it was still morning in texas , still quietly empty in the visitors' clubhouse at arlington stadium there were hours to go before the game would be played that day , but dave winfield was already dressed , and he was in a contemplative mood it may have been the music that played through his headphones barely a half day after belting two home runs against the texas rangers , he was back in front of his locker , listening to jazz winfield has played the game for 16 seasons and appeared in more than 2 , 000 games , but he still finds pleasure in every moment , from the pregame rituals to the game itself he has yet to tire of it there had been questions about his comeback with the yankees , but the 38yearold outfielder may have put them to rest on the recent sixgame trip five consecutive losses the swing was tortuous for the yanks , who are burdened by a fivegame losing streak as the seattle mariners arrive at the stadium tonight , but winfield thrived , hitting two home runs off charlie hough , adding two more hits sunday and sending his batting average to 333 , second only to don mattingly among the regulars on the team more than that , perhaps , he has come to realize again how much he still enjoys performing it s how you approach the game , he said you might see a guy come to the ball park and hear him complain about the travel and the schedule , and that seems to be the first thing to go i still enjoy the camaraderie , the challenges , which you do n't get in everyday life when you start losing that , everything else goes with it return to form but in the short span of time he has been back , winfield has appeared enthusiastic again he runs hard on routine grounders , is slowly reacquainting himself with playing left field and has apparently located the swing that left him 1 for 29 in spring training and had raised doubts he explains away his unsightly training camp by saying mentally , i do n't put everything into it i'm not going to exhaust myself down there i know how to focus my spring but clearly , after missing a year following back surgery , it caused questions although none of them came from winfield i 'd planned on having a month of spring training , and i had to rush everything , he said i tried to push hard , but it s not my style to do well down there when the season comes , i lock in he does it this way every at bat , i take very seriously after a lot of years , i'm like a gunslinger , and these young kids think , 'if i can get him , i can build a reputation' maybe i'm just putting it in that category , but it helps me to think of it that way if there was concern it did not come from bucky dent , the yankees' manager , who allowed winfield to work at his own deliberate pace in the spring 'quality athlete' he s a quality athlete , dent said he plays with great intensity , he plays the game hard spring training is different from the season when the lights come on , it s like you 're playing for real with his start , winfield has allowed himself the small pleasure of thinking ahead he can play five more years , he said , maybe more he will eventually try his hand at first base to prolong his career but he is n't sure exactly how long he will go it s like an economist who the heck knows \? he said that s why they quit using those guys i think i 'd like to go that long and he says that he has gotten better with age the last season he played , 1988 , he had one of his best overall seasons a 322 average , 180 hits , 25 home runs and 107 runs batted in his two homers saturday gave him 205 as a yankee , moving him past roger maris and into seventh place on the team s career list consistent player they made me different than they made other people , winfield said i 've had my best years in my 30 s you hear people say , 'i wish i knew then what i know now' well , i 've learned things every year that have helped make me consistent every year , every game , you never take things for granted he knows that there are those in the organization , specifically the team s principal owner , george steinbrenner , who would revel in his failure this season , his 10th and probably last with the yankees he simply says , i wo n't do that but neither will he shout emphatically that he is back all the way it is only the beginning of the season if i'm not back now , i'm close , he said if i'm hitting 310 or 320 at the break , i 'll tell you

hartsdale social work has become the career of choice for a growing number of students in the county the deans of two graduate schools recent undergraduates but also by adults changing fields besides its oncampus site in manhattan , the columbia university school of social work operates a division serving 250 students on the campus of the state university of new york at purchase the graduate school of social service of fordham university has divisions both at the university s main campus at lincoln center in manhattan and in tarrytown , where 400 students attend classes on the campus of marymount college the faculties of both schools divide their time between the manhattan and westchester sites a varied student body naomi gitterman , assistant dean of the columbia branch at purchase , and marc miringoff , dean of fordham s division in tarrytown , say that students engaged in fulltime master s degree programs in social work include former lawyers , teachers , dance therapists , nurses , firemen and police detectives many students also attend the schools part time women still predominate in this traditionally female field including those beginning careers after raising children but there is a growing number of men , according to the deans many men and women having left business fields say they no longer identify with corporate values , said amy miller , a certified social worker and the assistant to dr miringoff the students are preparing for the wide range of jobs that social work is known for providing services to the elderly , the mentally and physically ill , the emotionally troubled and the disadvantaged in addition , graduates may find work in policymaking positions on community or organizational levels learning while earning roni bernstein , a columbia student in purchase who had pursued a doctoral degree in psychology , said she was much happier studying social work because of the opportunity to work in the field while studying , she said , she is picking up valuable practical hints while earning money the best experience is being out there doing it and working with the supervisor , said the north white plains resident , who said she would focus on psychotherapy when she graduated socialwork programs generally require extensive fieldwork experience as well as academic course work one private agency popular with students for fieldwork placement is westchester jewish community services , a nonsectarian organization based here that offers a wide range of services at 23 locations in the county how an internship works interns are placed with the agency for the school year the students then work under personal supervision two to three days a week , providing psychotherapy to children , adults and families or aiding geriatric or disabled clients in a variety of settings besides meeting weekly with their own supervisors , interns attend weekly staff meetings at the agency with psychiatrists , psychologists and social workers and participate in the staff training sessions that are held four times a year the students also are invited to take field courses offered by the agency mrs bernstein is serving as an intern at the community services agency , as is ginny einhorn , also a columbia student , who travels to the county each day from her home in new haven mrs einhorn said that she had always wanted to work with the elderly and that now that two of her three children were teenagers , she was pursuing the chance to be helpful and feel good about it one thing socialwork students learn , however , is that wanting to help does not automatically make someone helpful marilyn krantz , a clinical social worker with westchester jewish community services and the agency s coordinator of student social workers , said you empower people , as a social worker , said marjorie miller , also a clinical social worker with the agency , who supervises a group of student interns because social workers provide many kinds of services to clients , from getting the heat turned on to psychological counseling , mrs miller called them project directors mrs miller also runs a support group for recently separated and divorced women at the agency s hartsdale headquarters she previously worked in special education and ran a nursery school , switching to social work in the mid1980 s when she realized that her students' families always needed to be worked with , needed more skills a weekly exchange a group of interns meets with mrs miller once a week to discuss their concerns because she supervises none of them personally , the meetings enable the students to vent their feelings in a nonjudgmental atmosphere her current group six fordham and columbia students \( another group meets with a different supervisor \) is made up of women spanning several decades in age issues at a recent meeting ranged from handling conflicts with the parents of children in therapy to getting group discussions going among reluctant clients mrs einhorn , who works at the agency s renee pollack home care and geriatric center in white plains , said that the group of elderly women she met with regularly did n't want to talk about any heavy topics at the same time , mrs einhorn said , the women wanted to cooperate with her since they knew she was a student how could she respect their wishes yet help these elderly people who were living apart from their families deal with the painful issues confronting them \? with mrs miller s guidance , the students explored the nature of the elderly group s resistance and the dynamics of group interaction the supervisor noted that by listening carefully and making use of clients' questions a therapist could lead a group beneficially into deeper waters relying on colleagues the giveandtake continued for an hour and a half , as the interns gave each other practical suggestions as well as moral support one of the purposes of these meetings , mrs miller explained afterward , was to teach the students how to rely on their colleagues when they are out of school dr miringoff said socialwork graduates had no trouble finding work in the field i have not heard of one person out of about 100 who graduated from fordham at tarrytown last year who did not find a professional job in social work , the dean noted he added that about half those jobs were in westchester the entrylevel salary for a social worker with a master s degree is miringoff said the private agencies offering clinical services here are probably more developed than in any place in the new york , connecticut and new jersey area photo marjorie miller , a clinical social worker with the westchester jewish community services , supervising a meeting of graduate social work students who

fairfield , conn this is a tale of old money and how it got to be that way it brings to mind the 19thcentury reformer henry george , who asked , how many men are there who fairly earn a million dollars \? in 1914 , several men who had earned their million , including oliver gould jennings of standard oil , decided they wanted a private golf club here they purchased 100 acres along long island sound , but that was n't enough to make 18 holes so they went to the town and engineered a realestate deal that must rank with the sale of manhattan fairfield gave these men 58 acres of waterfront property in exchange for a 200year lease at 1 a year why town fathers did this remains murky as fairfield s first selectwoman , jacky durrell , says , who knows what went through their heads \? but thanks to the town s benevolence , the country club of fairfield , a private club restricted to 360 members , enjoys one of new england s loveliest vistas these deals have a way of getting under the common man s skin and every decade or so , a politician yells , what s going on here \? since the 1980 s , a key skeptic has been samuel lazinger , a town board member mr lazinger , a lawyer , is jewish and in many ways typifies new fairfield , which now may be as much as 20 percent jewish why is there a private restricted club on town land \? he asks as far as i know there are no jewish or minority members mr lazinger would rather break the lease than wait for 2114 norwick r g goodspeed , the club president , says the latest uproar is the usual ado about nothing he points out the lease has 124 years and the club has no intention of giving back land it s the 3d , 4th , 5th , 6th , and 14th holes as for admissions , he says , original members were basically yankee anglosaxons we are not restricted i ca n't tell you exactly how many jews we have i certainly know of two my daughterinlaw is jewish blacks \? none applied mr goodspeed says there is little turnover members' children get priority we 're going through a transitional time , he added , noting that two of 21 board members are now women besides being first selectwoman , mrs durrell is a club member with her husband , richard , a past publisher of people magazine she s in a sticky spot i never thought of it as a place that discriminated , she said we were invited to join in the mid1950 s we were n't anybody dick was making 11 , 000 and someone said if you 're in advertising at life you should join we were sponsored by roy larsen , time s president maybe that was the key mrs durrell notes that minorities do visit i know bryant gumbel played at the club the president of nbc , robert wright s a member and brought him there have been complaints that mrs durrell was biased on the townclub issue for four years she has abstained at town meetings it gets more complicated in 1985 , with the issue hot again , the town conducted a title search on land leased to the club the search , going back to 1904 , indicated the town may not own the land it may have belonged to the perry family the club then jumped into action , getting perry heirs to sell any claim on the land for 50 , 000 this raised more questions than it answered if the perrys' claim was real , why would they sell land now worth millions for so little \? if the town had not owned it , what did the 1914 lease mean \? a million memos were issued , until a board meeting three winters ago , when thomas steinke , town conservation director , stood and said , i do n't feel the club owns what it claimed he said he had been working on this in his spare time since 1975 and would be done in a few years he had gathered data from all over , including the colonial records bureau in great britain he would not hint at his findings until he was done he has been mum since all await his report , due soon not many could get away with this , but mr steinke is a man with the bearing of gary cooper in high noon a totally ethical workaholic , says mrs durrell he s been communicating with france and england he s talking about shifting sands he s not content to go back a century to trace ownership , he s going back to the beginning of time the town tried to compensate him for his research , but he wo n't take money he wo n't be compromised , said mrs durrell a brief visit to his office confirmed this asked if he would finish by fall , he said , i do n't know asked his focus , he said , different factors that i find may impinge on the question asked why he had n't billed the town , he said , did n't think it was necessary during a fat lull in the interview , he said , you 're going to write i'm inscrutable , right \? right
wic \( women , infants and children \) is something of a miracle among federal nutrition programs it s never been accused of that infamous reagan trio of offenses , waste , fraud and abuse and there s considerable proof that it , like the other nutrition programs , has saved lives and dollars but new york state s wic program is about to suffer a funding cut such a cut might be a shortterm benefit for the state budget it could add up to longterm disaster for future state health costs the wic program provides diet supplements and checkups for poor pregnant nursing women last year it aided 385 , 000 new yorkers it used federal funds , rebates from a company that makes infant formula and 39 million from the state this year gov mario cuomo has recommended 37 million , a drop even though the price of wic commodities is going up that would mean cutting the rolls to about 351 , 000 needy people that fewer poor women and babies wo n't benefit from a very welltargeted food program is reason enough to regret the cut but there s an even stronger reason to hope that more money can be found for wic many women who are otherwise reluctant to seek prenatal care are attracted to wic because of the diet supplements to qualify , they accept the medical checkups they badly need as many as half the pregnant women in some neighborhoods get late prenatal care , or none the carrot provided by the wic program is downright golden
antigua , guatemala , june 16 president violeta barrios de chamorro s threeweekold cabinet was exasperated , ready to give up at a meeting on may 11 , one member after another recounted a daunting list of problems some complained that there was barely enough money on hand to buy pencils others that their ministries contained members of the opposition sandinista front who were undermining almost every decision with rare unity , the cabinet agreed , the country was ungovernable and then things got worse flexing their welldeveloped political muscles , the sandinistas made good on their promise to rule from below and organized a nationwide civilservice strike that brought the country to a halt for six days in midmay nicaragua seemed on the verge of anarchy but on friday , her 50th full day in office mrs chamorro flew here for her first regional summit meeting buoyed by a series of political victories that have helped to dispel the gloom that had begun to settle over nicaragua and undermine her government 'over the hump' while mrs chamorro must still navigate many political and economic shoals , including a crumbling economy , rampant inflation , and an entrenched and hostile bureaucracy , she has begun to create a working administration she s gotten over the hump , said a western diplomat who is a friend of the chamorro government it s been a zigzag path , but she s gotten around the corner there s an unusual genius here the president s first success came late last month , when she persuaded 16 , 000 contra rebels to fulfill their pledge to surrender their arms to united nations troops and end their 10year war against the sandinistas in return , mrs chamorro set aside a reserve for the rebels in the sparsely settled southeastern corner of the country she also earmarked an estimated 47 million of the 300 million aid package recently approved by the united states congress to smooth the contras' return to civilian life large political dividends former president daniel ortega saavedra accused the government of giving away the store but it appears that the demobilization will cost her remarkably little and will earn large political dividends it has already paved the way for the announcement on friday , with sandinista assent , of a onethird cut in the 60 , 000member army , whose officers and rankandfile are mostly sandinistas in addition , she ordered the armed forces to collect thousands of weapons distributed to civilian supporters immediately after the feb 25 sandinista electoral defeat that should provide another lift to the demilitarization and reconciliation program mrs chamorro has learned to give with one hand while taking away with the other she settled the civil service strike by agreeing to double wages and suspend a decree that gave her government wide powers to dismiss workers sandinistas try to make point sandinista unions and many political observers saw the concessions as an opposition victory this government has had to recognize that we are a belligerent force , jose angel bermudez , secretary general of the prosandinista national employees union , said after the strike from this point on , it will have to take our position into account in retrospect , reports of a government defeat seem premature the salary increases were eaten up by inflation in the ensuing weeks and the governmentcontrolled legislature returned some of the power mrs chamorro conceded by passing a bill giving the president greater freedom to reorganize the bureaucracy on the whole , she s risen to the challenges , a european diplomat said she started by relying too much on decrees but she s begun to learn how to pull other handles lingering tensions amid signs of conflict within sandinista ranks , the president s 14party coalition has begun to come together for the moment at least , the fighting within the coalition has declined , even though there are lingering tensions over the fact that mrs chamorro s inner circle is composed entirely of personal friends , with none of the established coalition parties represented but the sandinistas remain a potent , wellorganized political opposition the reductions in the army will be much less severe than mrs chamorro had led many to expect the vast majority of those due to be discharged will come from the reserves and the militia , a chamorro adviser acknowledged in addition , mrs chamorro still must create a loyal and competent government bureaucracy except for the most senior officials , the vast majority of civil servants are sandinistas they have the power to sabotage much of her program but any attempt to replace them undoubtedly will provoke further labor strife and set back efforts to foster reconciliation and her economic program , which includes sharp price increases on many essentials , will begin to bite in the coming months that leaves mrs chamorro caught in a bind that has bedeviled her administration from the first moments that it took power how to reconcile a divided society while moving a subsidized economy into private hands , all the while trying to lessen the influence of the strongest opposition party there are dark days ahead , a european diplomat said the belttightening inevitably has an effect on popularity until , with a little luck , you get through to better days
to the editor against the background of dramatic upheavals in the world s political condition , it may seem pedantry to object to the casual perpetuation of an ancient myth in your feb 13 article about egypt s attempt to create a new library of alexandria you state that the alexandria library assumed great fame until , in 48 bc , the romans came and sacked the place and much of the library burned in 48 bc julius caesar was indeed visiting alexandria , partly to decide the dispute over whether the young king ptolemy or cleopatra , his sister , should rule unchallenged in egypt as cleopatra s campaign to influence caesar into favoring her cause appeared to be succeeding , the regular egyptian army , loyal to ptolemy , rose up , and caesar found himself besieged with only his relatively small army to defend him he realized that the reinforcements he sent for would be in certain danger from the large egyptian fleet docked in the harbor of alexandria because he did not have the resources to seize and man the fleet , he ordered it burned the fire quickly spread from the burning ships to the wooden buildings surrounding the dock area , but it certainly never reached the stone and marble buildings \( at two sites \) that housed the famous library if any books were burned , they were books stored in the warehouses near the docks , perhaps awaiting shipment to rome no books in the library burned caesar was a scholar , a writer and lover of books he would surely have grieved the accidental destruction of the great library yet in caesar s own account of the siege of alexandria in book iii of his civil war he says nothing seneca , writing about 90 years after the event does , for the first time , allege that 40 , 000 books were burned at alexandria at some time even assuming he is referring to caesar , this number is only a small fraction of the library s estimated holdings most ancient authors make no mention of any destruction of the great library by fire with eastern europe in metamorphosis , with nelson mandela free , one may understandably ask what does it matter whether or not julius caesar caused the destruction of the great library at alexandria \? to that question there are none but facile answers but long after today s momentous events fade from all but recorded memory , queries about the alexandrian library and its destruction will still be made and never be fully answered and that will be a good sign , for so long as human intellectual curiosity remains alive , there s hope for the species michael c lang new york , feb 21 , 1990 drawing
moscow , sept 29 in her life s routine of waiting in food shops , nina novikova likes to let her mind drift back to the old days , so she can picture the sugarplum consumables that once were , and imagine she is sated amid the daily hordes of her fellow hunters and gatherers oh , i remember when there was an entire steer hanging there and we would point to the parts we wanted , miss novikova said , gesturing above the watchful crowd at the perova neighborhood state store as if an actual side of beef had materialized but the crowd , like much of the soviet nation , was only waiting with nothing much in sight late this week , there was a presidential order indicating that mikhail s gorbachev was bolstering the central controls that have failed the stores and further delaying the prospect of freemarket change and slippers , i remember soft , wide slippers , the woman said , ignoring the kremlin cornucopia of words on friday as she lingered by a longempty refrigerator counter for the latest rumors of goods that might appear briefly from the back room rumors of sugar just that the stores where most soviet citizens do endless shopping are like that now , waiting halls where patience withers between sporadic offerings of limited products there is no doubting the shoppers as they affirm that this time is the worst in 30 years in stalin s years , the stores had everything , a muscovite said i remember when the glassandtile tanks in the fish stores actually held live fish the classic words that titillate the western mind about this nation famine and coup remain irrelevant to the lassitude and skimpiness that is the daily gray truth of soviet life most soviet citizens are neither starving nor rebelling , but their future beyond the certainty of tomorrow s wait remains unknown today the rumors of available sugar proved false , even though shoppers held three months of ration coupons guaranteeing the commodity there was not a lemon to be found in the city , shoppers agreed but a few bragged they had found eggs , so very rare these days , in a store that had only a threehour wait for 10 eggs bread \? yes there was bread and milk today , but tomorrow , who knows , for the precise shortages seem to be in rotation 'please , give us meat ! ' miss novikova s group had word of a pending offering of bologna from the back room they are so angry , said a clerk who peeked out at them , her white smock and brightred hair suggesting for an instant fowl to go with miss novikova s nonexistent steer there is no food because they are not working , they are just waiting , the clerk said , in a twist of old communist logic , before shutting herself back inside young lady , meat , please , give us meat ! came one of the shouted pleas as the clerk retreated , heedless across the way , another crowd waited more than an hour for grapes , and a third gathered even longer around the bleak , empty meat counter on the strength of the departing clerk s word that he might be back finding the commodity theives for complaining like this , i may be arrested and get to eat in the labor camps , miss novikova said , pointing out that all the candor of glasnost cannot put sausage on the table but of course we have such a free country now miss novikova spent what is for her a typical day of five hours in the several shops that she stakes out amid the crowds of moscow shoppers she first shopped for the right rumors , then shouldering into the right lines and finally snatched philosophically at whatever good materialized the humor of the lines , at least , is succulent a belly laugh is stirred by the latest news of the big police sting operation against commodity thieves who come to moscow stores and truck embargoed goods to other regions a store with short lines trucks were stopped by police raiders unleashed in melodramatic waves on the city s ring road they came up with neither criminal nor crumb col mikhail shestopalov of the police said , there is n't anything to take out of the city the food shortages are reducing the city s daily diet of sex fantasy , according to the most popular humor magazines they have published cartoons of young men chasing past a nude woman after a chain of toothsome hot dogs , and of a negligeed woman secretly lusting after a side of beef while her lover muscularly preens for her in truth , there is enough of a freemarket mood in the city these days to allow the opening of onceforbidden pornographicfilm emporiums with long lines of male shoppers outside , rare moscovites silent about the wait a fiveminute walk from the kremlin , the lines are short and fast moving where nine members of the pozhidayev family run a family grocery store on lenivka street free market 'already here' yes , a friendly family store has sprouted in a nation where mercantilism was lobotomized and friendly store identities reduced to numbers the family charges slightly higher prices than state stores do for a limited supply of vegetables rare horseradish today that they assiduously scout from private and state farms they sell in the western way rather than the soviet fashion of multiple lines for ordering , paying for and obtaining purchases there are smiles in that store for such a kremlin neighborhood convenience , raisa gorbachev might be advised to pack in her designer wardrobe the ubiquitous voiska the justincaseof foldable shopping bag carried by the hunters and gatherers of soviet society who never know when they might spot something in the threadbare shops the free market is already here , igor pozhidayev , the grocery proprietor , said he noted that the store , a leaseholding experiment , has thrived for three years with modest profit and considerable entreprenurial pride for the family it is the politicians in the kremlin who are lagging behind us , he said , belittling the endless debate mr gorbachev is leading so agonizingly about the free market , as if it were not already arriving piecemeal 2 days' pay for a meal cucumbers are disappearing ! nikita pokpovsky , one hunter and gatherer , announced out on the sidewalk , properly concerned over that slavic staple and salt ! people always have new reasons in this country to panic buy , and now the reason is they think the free market is coming soon , he said , citing what seems to be fast fading into another wild rumor mr pokpovsky , who is retired , seemed slightly weary but far from despairing as he leaned on his cane in another day of cruising the shops for his clan , a highly useful and crafty contrbution of this nation s older generation for occasions when price is no object , muscovites go to the fully private markets , where prices float upward alarmingly and scarce meat can be had at 10 to 12 times the cost in state stores , which have none anyway the makings of a single family meal can take two days' pay , yet more and more they are becoming marts of necessity in the deepening food crisis , heightening mainstream inflation i do not panic because this is moscow and they can not quite let us die , said tatyana yershova , a shopper waiting and finally smiling through all this we just give up more of the time of our life photo oh , i remember when there was an entire steer hanging there and we would point to the parts we wanted , said nina novikova of a state store in moscow \( francis x clines the new york times \)
mayor david n dinkins yesterday named nicholas deb katzenbach , a former united states attorney general , to head a study group to recommend a strategy for fighting drug abuse mr dinkins also named arthur l liman , the lawyer who was special counsel to the senate select committee that investigated the irancontra affair , to head a sevenmember committee on appointments to screen nominees to certain city boards and committees the objective is to provide a foundation for the city s antidrug stratgey over the next four years , mr dinkins said of mr katzenbach s appointment he said the study group would recommend treatment and education ideas and report back to him by may 1 the city will provide office space , but a private consortium has raised 150 , 000 for staff members and consultants mr dinkins has been under mounting pressure to fill about a dozen critical posts in his administration but none of the vacant commissioners' jobs at agencies like the housing , welfare , correction and sanitation departments , and the health and hospitals corporation , would be affected by the screening committee announced yesterday mr dinkins has said he hopes to fill those jobs as soon as possible we have such a lot of work yet to do , as has been observed by some , he said with a smile , referring to criticism about the pace of appointments and complaints by some hispanic supporters that he has not named enough hispanic people to important jobs mr dinkins had also been under pressure to name the committee on appointments , so it could screen nominees to bodies like the city planning commission , the landmarks preservation commission and the conflict of interest board , all of which require approval by the city council mayor edward i koch issued an executive order establishing the committee , with five members , as a check against corruption in the wake of the municipal scandals several years ago but all its members resigned effective dec 31 , when mr koch left office mr dinkins issued a new executive order yesterday to continue the committee dinkins aides have said they had candidates for some of the boards but did not want to identify them because the appointments committee was not in place now the boards have vacancies , mixed with holdovers from the koch administration sometimes with tangible effects on decisionmaking on monday , for example , the planning commission , which has two vacancies among its seven seats , failed to approve zoning changes sought by a private developer for a highrise project proposed for the brighton beach section of brooklyn the commission voted 3 to 2 in favor of the changes , but that fell short of the four votes needed for approval mr dinkins had not taken a position on the development but he said yesterday that if the appointments committe had been in place , it already could have been considering names for such vacancies under mr koch , the panel was headed by the lawyer floyd abrams it is modeled on the mayoral screening panel that recommends appointees for judgeships for each vacancy , the committee recommends at least three candidates for the mayor s consideration he agrees to pick one of the three , or to ask for additional nominees hispanic objections addressed besides mr liman , a partner in the law firm of paul weiss rifkind wharton garrison , the committee includes victor alicea , the president of boricua college and a commissioner of the new york state energy research and development authority after the announcement at a news conference in the blue room of city hall , a reporter asked mr dinkins if mr alicea would be his last hispanic appointee it was the harshest of several similar queries to the mayor in recent days i suppose others standing in my position would resent the question and suggest that you were being less than candid in the fashion in which you put it , mr dinkins said so i 'll just answer the question you asked the answer is no on monday mr dinkins noted that he had named a puerto rican woman , sally hernandezpinero , as deputy mayor for finance and economic development , and carlos m rivera , also puerto rican , as fire commissioner the city s highestranking elected hispanic official , borough president fernando ferrer of the bronx , said yesterday that people had expressed concern to him over the number of hispanic appointees but he said that some of the criticism had come from people who did not even support mr dinkins and that the mayor had not yet made all his appointments the proof of the pudding is going to be at the end of the process , he said so i do n't think it s terribly productive to comment on numbers now investigation chief approved meantime yesterday the city council approved unanimously without debate mr dinkins s nomination of susan e shepard as the city s commissioner of investigation one of her first duties will be to appoint a special outside counsel to continue inquiries begun last year into mr dinkins s handling of some of his financial activities while he was manhattan borough president , including a transfer of stock in a broadcasting company mr dinkins said the executive director of the drug study group would be dr lucy friedman , who will take a leave from her job as head of the victim services agency , a private , cityfinanced group that counsels crime victims herbert j sturz , a former deputy mayor and founding director of the vera institute of justice , will be an adviser mr katzenbach , who lives in princeton , nj , and is now in private law practice , said he expected the group to recommend a wide variety of things for the mayor s consideration the mayor s announcement said one issue the group would review was how to move step by step toward a system of drug treatment on demand at more treatment centers but he said he could not give a timetable for when such treatment would be available or just how the city could afford it in addition to mr liman and mr alicea , the other members of the committee on appointments are dr june jackson christmas , professor , columbia university s college of physicians and surgeons ronald t gault , director for public finance , first boston corporation nathan leventhal , president , lincoln center dr kenneth ong , assistant director of aids center , st luke sroosevelt hospital center martha t wallau , vice president of eastdil

there is little doubt that the deep slump in demand for offices and highpriced apartments has caught new york city real estate developers off guard , but different developers have been stung in different ways while many are struggling with too much space and too few tenants , not all face the gargantuan financial pressures looming over donald j trump the worst off , like david and jean solomon , young builders who invested heavily at the peak of the 1980 s boom , put up large office towers without commitments from tenants to fill them among their troubled properties is a 35story , 13millionsquarefoot building at 1585 broadway , between west 47th and 48th streets those less hurt by the slump , like lewis rudin , are members of longestablished real estate families who approached the market conservatively they tended to take on just one project at a time , sticking to proven commercial locations and obtaining traditional bank financing the rudin family s holdings are worth at least 15 billion , and include a 35story office tower at the corner of broadway and west 52d street newcomers hurt the most those who were newcomers to the process are taking the brunt of the downturn , said john r white , the chairman emiritus of landauer associates , a real estate consulting firm but i ca n't imagine there is a single wellknown , longterm new york developer who wo n't survive this slump one reason is that demand for new offices , although weak , is not dead and gone several large companies , including the sony corporation of america and the bertelsmann publishing group , are known to be in the market for large blocks of manhattan office space there are going to be pockets of disaster and pockets of joy , said maurice solomon , manager of the midtown manhattan office of julien j studley , a commercial brokerage most severely affected are investors who fueled the city s surge of conversions of rental housing to cooperative apartments in the early 1980 s residential developers are also being squeezed , and are facing bank foreclosures on some projects even so , some still thrive through luck or acute judgment here is how six city developers are faring larry a silverstein showing bruises , but surviving larry a silverstein is a bruised combatant in the manhattan real estate slump , but is a survivor so far we are in a market that is generally faced with oversupply , the developer said , and the thirst for new product is n't there mr silverstein , the 59yearold president of silverstein properties , made his biggest imprint on the skyline in late 1986 , when his firm completed 7 world trade center , a 47story , twomillionsquarefoot tower just north of the world trade center the building immediately ran into trouble when drexel burnham lambert group , which had signed on to lease all of it , was rocked by an insider trading scandal and backed out mr silverstein s problems worsened a year later , when the stock market crashed in october 1987 in november 1988 , he was able to lease half of the space in the building to salomon brothers inc but even now , 20 percent of the space in 7 world trade center is vacant on other projects in the city , mr silverstein worked with partners , and his developments mushroomed in the late 1980 s with two fellow developers , william zeckendorf jr and melvin simon , he renovated the former gimbels department store at herald square into a s plaza , a onemillionsquarefoot shopping mall they also built park avenue court , a condominium building that is nearing completion over the site of another former gimbels store at 86th street and lexington avenue with financing from the general electric pension fund , he also built the embassy suites hotel , a 460room hotel at broadway and 47th street that is set to open next month in an interview , mr silverstein denied rumors in new york real estate circles that he is pressed for cash and negotiating to turn over part of his equity in 7 world trade center and a s plaza to his lenders he did say that he and the ge pension fund had recently tried to sell the embassy suites hotel to raise cash , but had not received an acceptable bid mr silverstein began acquiring loft space in the 1950 s , bought larger office buildings in the 1970 s and now controls more than 10 million square feet in 13 buildings having decided not to invest in new projects until the city s economy recovers , he has dismissed 10 people from his staff of 110 , including his head of development i do not expect there will be any major new development activity for the next few years , he said david and jean solomon quick successes , then a squeeze david and jean solomon caught the crest of the new york real estate wave a decade ago and moved up from renovating lofts to building big office and condominium buildings but the husbandandwife team , both 38yearold architects , are now struggling to fill huge blocks of space in the severely overbuilt office market in midtown manhattan

washington , may 2 as senate races shape up around the country , officials in both parties say republicans are bucking the usual trend in midterm elections they are in good position to pick up several seats this fall and narrow the gap with democrats some republicans are even hoping and some democrats are worrying that republicans have a chance to retake the senate , where democrats hold 55 seats to the republicans' 45 but most analysts predict a gain of two or three seats by republicans this year , with the showdown for control coming in 1992 it is possible we can get a majority of republicans back in the senate this year , vice president dan quayle told a group of republican state chairmen the other day the democrats are talking about holding down their losses if we do n't get a majority , perhaps we can get a 5050 split and i would n't mind spending the next two years of my life casting every tiebreaking vote for president bush less partisan analysts predict less sweeping , but still important , changes two wellknown monitors of congressional races , charles e cook jr and stewart rothenberg , each of whom edits a political newsletter , both predict republican gains in the senate of one to four seats , in large part because of the party s unusually successful recruiting of strong candidates such gains could have an important impact on the senate , where senator george j mitchell , the democratic leader , already has to operate with a margin that is less than overwhelming the most vulnerable democratic senators , politicians generally believe , are claiborne pell of rhode island , the chairman of the foreign relations committee , paul simon of illinois , tom harkin of iowa , carl levin of michigan and jim exon of nebraska white house looks to hawaii in addition , the death of spark m matsunaga , democratic senator from hawaii , last month has created another opportunity for republicans one of the state s most popular republicans , representative patricia saiki of honolulu , is expected to run for the seat this fall and is given a good chance , despite the state s democratic leanings representative daniel k akaka has been named the interim senator and is expected to be the party s candidate this fall to serve the full four years remaining in mr matsunaga s term to emphasize the importance the republican party places on the push for the senate , president bush invited ms saiki to the white house this afternoon , urged her to run and promised to help democrats concede that they are on the defensive and that their goal now is simply to hold their current majority they insist there are several states where republicans are vulnerable , although independent analysts say that so far none seems as threatened as the democrats the three republicans most often cited as vulnerable are jesse helms of north carolina , mitch mcconnell of kentucky and larry pressler of south dakota the democrats , still locked in primary fights , have yet to pick their candidates in kentucky and north carolina attention on north carolina but national attention is already focusing on north carolina wellknown artists , including roy lichtenstein and robert rauschenberg , have contributed to a democratic contender , michael easley , a county district attorney , hoping he will be the best challenger to mr helms , who has sponsored legislation to bar federal support for works deemed to be obscene in south dakota , ted muenster is challenging mr pressler , who is best known in washington for voting against president bush more than any other republican senator democrats say that in a year when an antiwashington mood is rife , mr muenster , a businessman and an aide to a former governor , is an ideal candidate no great national issue has caused the democratic vulnerability president bush s popularity is of some modest help to republican candidates , politicians say , and the improved farm economy is making it easier for republicans in places like iowa and illinois , two of this year s battlegrounds but many of this year s main topics abortion , the environment and the peace dividend tend to give an advantage to democrats good recruiting by republicans instead of using issues , the republicans have achieved their advantage this year largely through a mundane but crucial bit of politics they have done a better job of recruiting republican candidates to challenge democratic incumbents than the democrats have done at finding candidates to challenge republican incumbents we 've probably had our best recruiting season ever for these midterm elections , said wendy democker , communications director for the national republican senatorial committee , which raises money for and provides services and advice to republican senate candidates republican party officials persuaded eight members of the house to give up their seats and run for the senate democrats see an irony in this the republican failure to dislodge democrats from control of the house has left many republican members so frustrated that they are willing to walk away from a safe house seat for a shot at a senate seat
madrid , sept 11 but in this case , with havana asserting that madrid had joined forces with the united states in trying to undermine the cuban revolution , both the spanish government and public opinion were stunned when the cuban leader himself resorted to fierce mudslinging against spain i do n't think the normalization of relations with cuba , including the resumption of economic aid , can come tomorrow , spain s deputy foreign minister , inocencio arias , said last week unfortunately , these incidents , which in no case were provoked by us , leave a sediment mr castro told spanish television that he was ready to patch things up , but added , we are not a country that can be humiliated or threatened because we have a high sense of honor and dignity that is part of our spanish heritage in reality , even before the first of the asylumseekers entered spain s mission in havana on july 9 , relations between the two countries were already being strained by suggestions from madrid that mr castro start liberalizing his government in the wake of events in eastern europe along with mexico and venezuela , spain even discreetly asked gabriel garcia marquez , the nobel literature laureate , to convey a message to his friend , the cuban leader , that havana risked total isolation unless it made some democratic gestures an elected king \? but last march , during a visit to brazil , mr castro sent a public message back to madrid , scoffing at the idea of elections in cuba by asking rhetorically whether voters had chosen king juan carlos to be spain s head of state his remarks brought a formal protest from spain what appears to have awakened mr castro s suspicions of a conspiracy in the case of the asylumseekers was that 48 cubans entered five european embassies in havana in july almost immediately after albania granted exit visas to 4 , 500 albanians who took refuge in foreign embassies there in contrast to albania , however , cuba said none of its nationals could leave the country unless they sought permission through normal channels further , spanish officials said , cuba ordered nine police agents to force their way into the spanish embassy posing as asylumseekers by the end of july , all the cubans had left the swiss , czech , italian and belgian embassies , but 18 remained in the spanish mission and after cuba accused spain of interfering in its internal affairs by encouraging asylumseekers , spain withdrew its ambassador and suspended an aid program worth 25 million this year verbal exchanges intensified cuba launched a personal attack on spain s foreign minister , francisco fernandez ordonez , while spain s secretary of international cooperation , luis yanez said cuba was a parched field in which any spark could set off a blaze on july 26 , mr castro called spain an accomplice of yankee imperialism recalling cuba s fight for independence in the 1890 s , he also accused madrid of colonialist arrogance by late august , though , the asylumseekers began leaving the embassy spanish officials said that , when genuine asylumseekers left , some police agents followed the last five people left on sept 4 the officials said that while two wanted to be taken to their homes , three suspected agents asked to be dropped off in downtown havana
a major german bank is now the biggest obstacle between donald j trump and a 65 million loan package to rescue his empire , bankers said yesterday bankers negotiating a plan to help keep mr trump out of bankruptcy said several japanese banks that had refused to approve the loan proposal had changed their position , but dresdner bank ag , which holds a 15 million share of a loan secured by the trump tower , was refusing mr trump , who has been largely absent from public view since news spread of his financial troubles , issued a statement yesterday expressing confidence that the banks would reach a final agreement deal called 'very close' the banks we have been working with are very close to coming together in support of a restructuring plan , he said the package , which will include lending the developer 65 million and deferring interest and principal payments on about 850 million of his nearly 2 billion of bank debt , has the tentative approval of mitsubishi trust and banking , sumitomo bank and daiichi kangyo bank earlier in the week , those three , along with dresdner , had refused to approve the new loan arrangement because it required that another lien be put on the trump tower , the developer s fifth avenue skyscraper bankers in the talks said dresdner bank was still refusing to approve the package and wanted the large american banks to buy out its position bankers and lawyers in the talks said that none of the banks would agree to buying out dresdner and that they would allow the deal to collapse rather than buy out any other bank representatives from the trump organization will be meeting with dresdner executives today to try to persuade the bank to change its stance dresdner refuses to budge , one banker said and unless the dresdner bank agrees , this german institution will bring down donald trump part of a syndicate dresdner is part of a syndicate that now holds the 75 million loan that the chase manhattan bank originally made to mr trump against the trump tower each of four foreign banks in the syndicate holds just under 15 million of the loan , with chase holding slightly more the plan for the new loan requires that all the banks with loans secured by mr trump s assets approve the plan most of the other loan syndicates , including one led by citibank and another led by chase , have generally agreed to go along with the plan mr trump failed to pay bankers and bondholders about 73 million that was due last friday if he does not pay the holders of bonds from the trump s castle casino about 43 million by midnight tuesday , he will have defaulted on the bonds and will probably lose control of that casino such a default would threaten all of mr trump s atlantic city casino licenses and could ultimately force him to seek the protection of the bankruptcy court two holders of bonds tied to mr trump s atlantic city casinos filed a class action suit yesterday in a federal court in new jersey charging that mr trump had misled them talk of who would benefit in his statement yesterday , mr trump thanked the banks for their work and also noted that the restructuring of his real estate and gambling empire would benefit his employees and those who do business with him a final agreement would benefit all of us , but perhaps most important are the 25 , 000 employees and thousands of family firms and other suppliers spanning the hotel , construction , development and travel industries that are dependent upon the trump organization , he said mr trump said he was confident that the banks that had not yet approved the package would do so he said he wanted to do not only what was in his own interest but also what was best for the economy of the region
chances are you wo n't share a banquette with sean penn or mikhail baryshnikov at barocco , a minimally camouflaged industrial space in tribeca but you will eat well , and at prices that will allow cab fare home and maybe an off broadway show the fouryearold barocco is a relaxed trattoria that attracts a colorful cross section of downtowners the barebones setting belies some stout yet refined cooking by sandro prosperi , an owner the airy space has a casual bar up front , a high ceiling swathed in warehouse gray , glassblock windows , a peeling wooden floor and white columns that actually have a structural purpose one side door is resourcefully concealed with what looks like an old patterned bed sheet , not the adam tihany approach , but it does the job black banquettes and a cluster of tables in the center fill up quickly after 8 30 pm , and the decibel level soars , so i prefer to dine there early or very late you can get off to a lusty start with either fettunta small bricks of grilled country bread rubbed with garlic and doused with olive oil or bruschetta , the same bread under minced tomatoes and fresh basil minestrone is a motherly delight , thick and boldly seasoned , as is the lentilandpea soup fortified with ham bone perhaps the best starter is the fried calamari , which is light as tempura and well seasoned the kitchen turns out some wonderfully orchestrated pastas , which can be split as appetizers most memorable is the unlikely sounding combination of pappardelle with tender morsels of rabbit and squab , along with black olives and sundried tomatoes in a wellherbed tomato sauce another enticing dish was the fettuccine with firm , fresh artichoke hearts , tomato , pancetta and shredded basil oddly enough , one of the simplest pastas missed the mark penne with tomato , basil and ricotta , which , at least relative to the others , tasted flat and undistinguished the homemade ravioli are a paragon of refinement one is filled with shredded duck , spinach and a touch of sage under a light mixed vegetable sauce a spinach ravioli is filled with ricotta and swiss chard , served with a wellseasoned fresh tomatoandbasil sauce considering the moderate price of entrees , the eclectic highquality wine list could use a few more bottles in the 18 to 23 range among whites , you can enjoy an uncharacteristically assertive vernaccia from terruzzi e puthod \( 18 \) or a bright pinot grigio from livio felluga \( 20 \) two pleasing inexpensive reds are the 1988 merlot from torre di luna \( 18 \) and the 1986 barbera d'alba from riccardo fenocchio \( 22 \) judging from the tables near mine , i would call the whole roasted red snapper a big mover \( the fish may change with market availability \) i sampled it twice , and both times it was moist and fragrant with fresh herbs rosemaryseasoned roasted potatoes and garlicky sauteed spinach made fine sidekicks the last time i had it , i requested that the fish be deboned the waitress replied , no problem , then served it on the bone this kind of thing can happen at barocco , which is not exactly the quilted giraffe when it comes to service the staff gets the food to you promptly but do n't expect much in the way of food or wine counsel , or little extras like wine pouring besides the red snapper , another good seafood choice is raregrilled norwegian salmon with a slightly acidic parsley and caper sauce that is a perfect foil for the rich fish the same garlicstrewn spinach came with it , but this time the garlic had burned , leaving a harsh flavor the chef has an affinity for rosemary , as it shows up everywhere , including the excellent rack of lamb strip steak is richly flavored and well charred , and the simple grilled chicken is moist and subtly flavored with an olive oil and basil marinade the homiest dish of all is the wonderfully mellow roast loin of pork with splendid mashed potatoes and spinach talk about mom food desserts can be excessively sweet , particularly the chocolate napoleon and the ultrarich tiramisu , so i suggest you stick with the textbook creme caramel , poached pears with marsalaflavored whipped cream or the superb raisinstudded bread pudding restaurant critics are repeatedly asked where they would go on a casual night off for a good meal my response usually is , i do n't have nights off but should that day ever come , this easygoing , genuine place would be high on my list barocco  301 church street , at walker street , 4311445 atmosphere airy , minimally disguised industrial loft can be loud service pleasant and competent , but

and the city and state comptrollers the governor is the chairman and appoints three members from the private sector that the three private members felt compelled to see the mayor was a sign of their deep concern about the city s finances and of mr cuomo s willingness , amid the state s own fiscal woes , to use the board as a spur to his ostensible democratic ally , mr dinkins mr cuomo and other officials in albany have already begun to warn that the state s own financial future is so dark that layoffs and tuition increases are likely these bleak warnings appear to be aimed in part at new

city comptroller elizabeth holtzman and state comptroller edward v regan , have also been urging the dinkins administration to act swiftly to reassure investors and the public that the city s 28 billion budget would remain balanced , even in the face of a projected budget gap of at least 14 billion for the fiscal year that starts next july 1 in an interview with editors and reporters at the new york times yesterday , mr cuomo said that we do n't want an fcb takeover of the city s finances , referring to the financial control board a takeover could occur if the city ran a 100 million deficit at the end of the year , was unable to borrow money in the credit markets or to pay the interest or principal on its debts , or if it impaired its credit by violating budgeting and accounting practices required by the state but the governor said the fact that the city was required by law to submit its quarterly budget adjustments to the control board was useful , and added we will use that aggressively by law , the city is required to have a balanced budget what we really want is an uptodate budget picture , he said speaking to reporters at city hall , mr dinkins declined to provide details of the meeting but he said we did have a discussion about the desirability of doing whatever we could do as quickly as we could do it i think there s recognition of the fact that there s certain time required to achieve certain things to point out progress but , he added , we , as we had planned to do anyhow , will sort of give benchmarks , as we go , to point out the progress we 're making the mayor also said , i expressed to them , i hope in a way that s convincing , that i understand the dimensions of the problem and that we will address it timely some participants in the
