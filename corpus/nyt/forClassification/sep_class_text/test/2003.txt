to the editor re 8 designs confront many agendas at ground zero \( front page , nov 20 \) none of the eight finalists for the world trade center memorial accomplish the desired goal of the memorial to address ground zero and the effect of 9 11 none produce the sublime power that architecture is capable of by communicating emotion through formal gestures none can be seen as powerful in the way that maya lin s vietnam veterans memorial is powerful none create an unstated , unambiguous embodiment of what 9 11 means one can create visually powerful spaces with hanging votives , translucent clouds , shafts of light , sheets of cascading water or stark concrete walls that will all make fine memorials but without the sublime connection to time and place , these features ultimately have nothing to do with ground zero it is a shame that the eight finalists managed to create powerful visual spaces that have no real power on one of the most emotionally charged pieces of ground in history scott a dergance denver , nov 20 , 2003
trenton , aug 18 the united states attorney s office is investigating allegations that a former aide to gov james e mcgreevey improperly solicited campaign donations by pressuring business owners who needed inspections and zoning variances from woodbridge township , where mr mcgreevey was then mayor , federal authorities said today rajesh \( roger \) chugh , 49 , helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for mr mcgreevey s campaigns for governor in 1997 and 2001 , according to state records and party officials , and held a job in the administration from early 2002 until this june but earlier this year , fbi agents began examining allegations that mr chugh \( pronounced choog \) , an immigrant from the punjab region of india , solicited contributions by threatening to block building permits for business owners in the little india section of woodbridge the complaints against mr chugh were first reported in the record of hackensack , which quoted two business owners who said mr chugh demanded campaign contributions in exchange for his help with their dealings in woodbridge the paper also quoted several democratic party officials who said they warned mr mcgreevey about mr chugh s aggressive behavior during the campaigns and were troubled when he was hired as a 10 , 000 per month consultant to the state party during the campaign and given an 85 , 000 job as an assistant in the secretary of state s office cathy ellis , the governor s spokeswoman , said today that mr mcgreevey s campaign was careful to scrutinize all contributions solicited by mr chugh she added that the state party briefly suspended mr chugh during the 2001 campaign to review the donations he had solicited but ms ellis said that none of the contributors to the campaign ever filed a formal complaint about mr chugh s activities with any government or law enforcement agency if jim mcgreevey had known of any illegal or unethical activity he would have taken action , ms ellis said he would n't have tolerated it mr chugh has always been viewed as one of the more puzzling appointments mr mcgreevey has made several months after accepting a job in the secretary of state s office , he became the focus of unflattering news coverage because he ran a web site that overstated his r sum and included personal details more often seen in dating service ads , like references to his physical appearance and fondness for candlelight dinners the governor surprised many of his supporters by allowing mr chugh to retain his job , and mr chugh continued to raise eyebrows with his eccentric behavior he occasionally stunned people in trenton by dropping to his knees and touching their feet , a traditional indian greeting but republicans today seized on the news of the campaign finance allegations and the federal inquiry , saying that mr chugh had become the latest in a succession of appointments to raise questions about the ethical standards of the mcgreevey administration this is a question of whether or not a member of the mcgreevey campaign , and later his administration , used tactics of extortion to raise money for governor mcgreevey s campaign and whether or not the governor had any knowledge of these practices , said state senator joseph m kyrillos jr , republican state chairman michael drewniak , spokesman for united states attorney christopher j christie , declined to discuss the matter mr chugh did not return calls requesting comment but officials in the mcgreevey administration , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said that mr chugh resigned in june after news reporters asked the governor s office about court records indicating that a travel business he ran in the mid1990 s had written tens of thousands of dollars in bad checks and was the subject of hundreds of thousands of dollars in liens and court judgments many officials in the new jersey indian community said they had warned mr mcgreevey that mr chugh had been bragging about his ability to handle political problems for campaign contributors pradip \( peter \) kothari , who owns a travel agency in iselin , said he and five other business leaders confronted mr mcgreevey about mr chugh s fundraising abuses in march 2001 , in a meeting that lasted four hours
los angeles , oct 3 what can you do if you are running for governor of california seriously running , that is , with ideas and a platform and you are neither famous nor a flake \? how do you get across your plans to raise revenue , cut spending , protect the environment , revise the building code , reduce class size or the car tax , tackle energy policy and end legislative gridlock \? how do you avoid the mary carey effect , the media s annoying habit of ignoring you once the xrated actress , the thirdrate comedian , the former child star or the guy in the clown suit shows up at a campaign event \? how do you get off the fringe \? for two dozen or so candidates who say they have specific ideas about california s future , the answer suddenly became clear this week you go where arnold goes so they chartered a big red bus and have been tailing arnold schwarzenegger s san diegotosacramento bus tour , feeding off his media hordes like remoras on a shark on the red bus are a cluster of candidates from various parties who have wildly differing points of view but the shared goal of thrusting their ideas into the limelight , even if their moments in the limelight come only in mr schwarzenegger s shadow of the 135 candidates in the california recall campaign , there are 60 to 70 unknowns who have formed a coalition to distinguish themselves from the media darlings and entertainment candidates whose visions of governance are limited , at best of the 70 , more than 20 tried to organize their way out of obscurity this week , through the bus tour planning for the tour involved a flurry of email messages and conference calls among themselves , as well as explicit instructions on how to avoid the mary carey effect this is a disciplined event , ned roscoe , an independent from benicia who helped organize the bus trip , wrote his fellow candidates by email on monday we 're planning to divide and conquer the press going out in paired teams of two or more people with divergent opinions so the mary carey effect wo n't happen everybody is special on the bus everybody listens make points quickly most of the candidates , among them doctors , lawyers , engineers , professors , teachers , entrepreneurs , police officers , firefighters , are willing to admit that they have no chance of winning and one of the richest and best known , garrett gruener , a venture capitalist from oakland who created the internet search engine ask jeeves , dropped out on thursday , endorsing the leading democrat , lt gov cruz m bustamante but others are prepared to fight to the end for the group of candidates on the fourday bus trip , one big challenge was simply figuring out where mr schwarzenegger was going to be , since his point of departure and his precise schedule were closely held information so one coalition candidate , jim weir , a democrat from grass valley who flies his own small jet , planned a flight on thursday in the skies above southern california , where the schwarzenegger bus tour was to begin in a conference call the day before , mr roscoe was talking to jon w zellhoefer , a republican from san jose who , supporting none of the leading republican candidates , became a candidate himself and is point man for the shadow bus tour is jim still flying aerial recon \? mr zellhoefer asked in the conference call oh , yes , mr roscoe said as it turned out , much of this reconnaissance was unnecessary mr zellhoefer , who at times was zooming along the freeways in his silver sedan to track the schwarzenegger entourage , said the candidates had soon discovered that they had a mole on one of the schwarzenegger buses he naturally declined to identify him within the candidates' coalition , which began meeting as a group in august , mr zellhoefer was one of the strongest proponents of the shadow tour we decided to follow arnold and invite the press to follow us following arnold , he said while driving 70 miles an hour north on interstate 5 , heading from san diego to costa mesa and closing in on one of the schwarzenegger buses , the one dubbed total recall and we talked about it , and everybody said , shoot , why not \? ' he said it had n't worked up to this point the way we 'd been trying to do it , so let s try the other way let s try it the arnold way the candidates had already learned that real ideas put forth by unknowns would never steal headlines from the major candidates , but that televisionworthy gimmicks might at one point , they halfconsidered trying to put together a survivorstyle reality show , but decided , mr zellhoefer said , that such yearnedfor attention would put them squarely at the center of the circus , the very thing they were trying to avoid the bus tour , though , seemed like the perfect answer and their plan worked well at mr schwarzenegger s first campaign stop , at the orange county fairgrounds in costa mesa , where they were free to infiltrate the huge crowd while the throng waved join arnold campaign signs , they waved their own among them vote zellhoefer , the intelligent alternative elect gene forte for governor , the attorney buster cheryl blychester , republican lane , the biggest sign , was waved furiously by dick lane , a democrat and retired educator from sunnyvale who has made two unsuccessful bids for congress

half a dozen religious leaders joined david westin , the president of abc news , and others from the network and the press for lunch on the 22nd floor of abc building on 66th street in manhattan late last week mr westin wore a sharp suit , as did some members of the clergy others had dressed casually many were diffident some were quietly furious part symposium and part focus group , the meeting had been convened to discuss jesus , mary and da vinci , tonight s abc news special the show is a woolly and underthought treatment of the religious sophistry in the da vinci code , the bestselling novel by dan brown the producers , along with the show s oncamera reporter , elizabeth vargas , were troubleshooting after the meeting on thursday , they rushed to the editing room to make changes to the show though set mostly in modern europe , mr brown s thriller centers on leonardo da vinci s role in maintaining a secret from biblical times in pursuing what it calls the claims of mr brown s fiction , the abc special , which the group on the 22nd floor had seen before the meeting , bares leonardo s socalled secret mary magdalene , far from being a prostitute , was the rightful wife of jesus mary and jesus had a child and heirs and finally , the heirs , whose existence threatened church dogma , were protected by a clandestine priory that counted leonardo among its members soon after the floor was opened for questions , nikki stephanopoulos , the communications director for the greek orthodox archdiocese of america , whose son is the abc news correspondent george stephanopoulos , complained that the voluptuous , ravenous images of mary magdalene on display in the documentary bore little resemblance to eastern representations of the magdalene \( sexy music by me shell ndegeocello accompanies one sequence of seminude pictures on the show \) as a member of the greek orthodox church , ms stephanopoulos also objected to the show s restrictive use of the word orthodox in an interview , ms vargas uses the word to denote the repressive church hierarchy in the middle ages joseph de feo , policy analyst for the catholic league , then asked the show s producers why they had n't solicited opinions from roman catholics other than the rev richard mcbrien , a priest and theology professor at the university of notre dame who , mr de feo said , is known chiefly for his farout views and his shtick about mary magdalene s primacy among jesus s apostles rudy bednar , an executive producer at abc , responded that the catholic view had been expressed in the documentary by various evangelicals the producers had consulted mr de feo , perhaps bridling at the idea that archprotestants should represent the opinions of catholics , shot mr bednar a look of incredulity as several people mused about whether a married jesus could still be divine the consensus was that he could the subject of the documentary almost seemed to stymie further discussion its logic is of an especially enervating kind like a seatmate on a train who voices ardent ideas about procter gamble s satanism , the abc special is both amusingly audacious and profoundly irritating if you 're not freshly familiar with the invariably eclectic materials under discussion , you can express only general skepticism , which makes you a sucker you 're suddenly in the camp of the uptight orthodox , those joyless suppressors of truth who enjoy none of the pleasures of heresy the more attractive option may be to keep quiet on the other hand , many theories advanced in the abc special are not ultimately endorsed by it \( not all the claims made in the book are true , and some have been made before , but there is some surprising truth , is how ms vargas puts it \) early in the show , too , ms vargas asks a series of questions that begin with , what if we told you , which suggests that the ideas that follow are being proposed so that viewers might entertain them as beliefs and thus be entertained , while not informed this is a curious approach for network news to establish and then halfdismantle its arguments , the show relies on interviews with mr brown , whose novel is simply called a book in the voiceover and who is treated as a historian umberto eco , the italian semiotician and novelist elaine pagels , the princeton professor of religion karen king , a professor at the harvard divinity school robin griffithjones , an anglican rector in london margaret starbird , an independent scholar and daryl bock and jeff bingham , two evangelical scholars in dallas these experts have divergent reputations ms pagels , for example , wrote the gnostic gospels in 1979 that book is still considered the goldstandard explication of the way the gnostics illuminated the power struggles of the early church by contrast , henry lincoln , a chief source for the da vinci code , is an author of holy blood , holy grail , a weird farrago about jesus and the knights templar the juxtaposition of ivorytower erudition and antic amateurism creates odd effects did ms pagels know that her statements would be marshaled in the service of an argument that , at its outer reaches , contends that the pregnant mary magdalene was the holy grail , the lost vessel of jesus s blood \? and further , that the figure in leonardo s last supper , generally taken for the effeminate apostle john , is none other than mary magdalene , leaning away from jesus in a telltale v that symbolizes her femininity \? more important , how did abc manage to persuade this group to come together to use a popular thriller as a pretext for a serious discussion of religious history \? individual motivations seem to surface in the show itself ms king and ms starbird are eager to make a case for the importance of mary magdalene in the early church and , more generally , to elucidate the ways that women have been denied access to power and had their reputations smeared for seeking it in contrast , mr mcbrien and mr griffithjones appear determined to advertise jesus as a sexual man and by arguing that jesus was heterosexual and monogamous married , even they offer a new portrait of him that may be more palatable to some contemporary christians who , following sex scandals in the catholic church , now find the idea of a celibate priesthood unnerving in the view of the priests consulted for the abc documentary , jesus was n't an asexual jewish radical who consorted with a prostitute and a gang of guys , one of whom was an androgyne instead , he was a normal family man jesus , mary and da vinci has , however briefly , provided common cause for feminists and catholics who are discouraged formally , it mixes fable with history in an absurdist way that , while indecent as documentary , can nonetheless activate the intellectual immune system in viewers , implicating them in the drama of historical debate that s an exciting aim for network documentaries on this note , a sensible summation comes from ms king at the end of the hour sometimes religion is presented as something that s fixed and stable when you have to accept it and reject it but the fact is that religious traditions , and certainly christianity among them , are very diverse , very filled with possibilities and we need to take responsibilities for the kind of religion that we make but others at the meeting missed the uplift of the day , and found the implications of abc s show unnerving as the meeting broke up and participants bussed their sodas and plastic plates , one minister grumbled that the last thing he wanted to offer to his congregants was a married jesus conceived that way , jesus s role as consoler of gay people , single people , widows and widowers , as well as the lonely , would be diminished , he said jesus with a wife also implies favoritism , someone else said was n't he supposed to love us all \? photos elizabeth vargas , reporter for jesus , mary and da vinci , on

in june 1996 , a truck bombing killed 19 americans at the khobar towers barracks in dhahran , saudi arabia iran was initially blamed for that attack , with american officials initially saying that at least some iranian government officials were behind the bombing plot in june 2001 , a united states federal grand jury charged 13 saudis and a lebanese man in the bombing , and the indictment implicated iranian officials , although none were identified or charged the united states does not have an extradition treaty with saudi arabia in june 2002 , saudi arabian officials said the kingdom had sentenced some of the people it had arrested for the bombing , but did not say how many , nor specify what the sentences were the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states , which were marked by meticulous planning in terms of how the attacks would unfold , fueled speculation that al qaeda may have been behind the khobar towers bombing osama bin laden had made chasing american forces out of the arabian peninsula which is considered sacred by some extremists because the faith was founded there one of his primary goals subsequent investigations conducted by intelligence agencies in the united states have shown that representatives of mr bin laden contacted agents working for iranian intelligence in the mid1990 s in an attempt to cultivate an antiamerican terrorism alliance it is increasingly believed that the bombing of the khobar towers may have been the work of al qaeda

somerville , nj , dec 15 a nurse with a history of job dismissals was charged on monday with killing one patient and trying to murder another with drugs at a hospital here in central new jersey , and a prosecutor quoted the nurse as saying that he had slain 30 to 40 patients in his 16year career to alleviate pain and suffering investigators said that the suspect , charles cullen , 43 , of bethlehem , pa , made his startling statements about serial killings freely over the weekend he appeared before a judge here on monday and was held in 1 million bail after a colloquy with the court in which he seemed to throw caution aside i do n't want to be represented , i do n't wish to contest the charges , i plead guilty , the solemnfaced defendant blurted out after waiving a reading of the charges firstdegree murder and firstdegree attempted murder , which could lead to the death penalty judge paul w armstrong of somerset county superior court tried to cut him off , noting that pleas were not required at a first hearing mr cullen , handcuffed and clad in a khaki prisoner s uniform , said he wanted to drop his weekend application for a public defender i do n't plan to fight this , he declared , and was led away the case touched off widespread investigations by nine hospitals and a nursing home in new jersey and pennsylvania where mr cullen had worked , and by seven prosecutors in both states who are expected to exhume bodies and reexamine the records of hundreds of people who have died while in the nurse s care while prosecutors said there was no way to know whether the suspect s statements were truthful or accurate , the case appeared to hold the potential to become a gruesome paragon of its genre serial murders by nurses , some in the name of mercy killing , that have stunned the nation from time to time the worst previous case in the united states was that of donald harvey , a nurse s aide who admitted killing 37 people with cyanide , arsenic and suffocation over decades at hospitals in ohio and kentucky although mr cullen had been fired or forced to resign from at least six health care facilities , no complaints about his competence or questions over his handling of patients and potentially lethal drugs were reported to medical licensing boards in new jersey one hospital did make a report to pennsylvania authorities it is not clear what hospitals are required to report in hiring , hospitals are required to conduct much more extensive background checks on doctors than on nurses , but such checks are often limited to looking for adverse information in data banks maintained by the federal department of health and human services information about mr cullen s performance and the dismissals was never forwarded to his successive employers , a circumstance that enabled him to move from one hospital to another with an ease that evidently concealed a pattern of problems officials noted that , even now , mr cullen was fully licensed by the state nursing boards to practice in new jersey and pennsylvania mr cullen , a navy veteran and the divorced father of two children who had worked at somerset medical center here for more than a year until his dismissal on oct 31 , was accused of murdering a critically ill 68yearold roman catholic official , the very rev florian j gall , the vicar of hunterdon county , with an overdose of a heart medication last summer mr cullen was also accused of the attempted murder of a 40yearold basking ridge , nj , woman who suffered from cancer and heart disease she nearly died in june of a toxic dose of digoxin , the same drug given to the vicar the elevated level of the drug was detected and the woman was saved by an antidote , although she died three months later after an extensive investigation by the medical center and by the somerset county prosecutor , wayne j forrest , mr cullen was arrested at a restaurant in bridgewater , nj , on friday mr forrest said he waived his right to a lawyer during interrogations and told the investigators that he had killed the vicar and had tried to kill the woman with drugs he took from a locked cart according to the defendant , his motive in these cases was to alleviate patient pain and suffering , detective daniel baldwin , a county investigator , told the court in an affidavit defendant also stated that he was responsible for the deaths of 12 to 15 patients at the somerset medical center during the time he worked there he added defendant further related that during his 16 years as a nurse he was responsible for the deaths of a total of 30 to 40 patients at various hospitals in new jersey and pennsylvania by the improper administration of various medications to alleviate patient pain and suffering after being alerted by the somerset prosecutor this weekend , investigations were undertaken by prosecutors in six other counties essex , warren , morris and hunterdon in new jersey , and lehigh and northampton in pennsylvania where mr cullen had worked at 10 institutions since 1987

washington , feb 3 president bush sent congress a 223 trillion budget today with record deficits that would speed up billions of dollars in income tax cuts , provide huge increases for the pentagon and offer a modest jump in spending for nasa mr bush s budget forecasts a deficit of 304 billion in the current fiscal year , and projects a deficit of 307 billion for the 2004 fiscal year , which begins oct 1 over the next five years the total projected deficit would be more than 1 trillion , a potentially problematic number for mr bush , who as a presidential candidate vowed that he could both cut taxes and eliminate the national debt in his budget message to congress , the president said his budget reflected his most urgent national priorities winning the war against terrorism , securing the homeland and generating longterm economic growth the budget included no projection of the cost of any war with iraq , which administration officials have said could be as low as 50 billion and as high as 200 billion if there is a conflict , officials said , mr bush would ask congress for the money as an emergency supplement the budget calls for cuts in a wide range of domestic spending , including trims in justice department programs on juvenile delinquency and tribal courts and a halt in financing for the hiring of police officers money for a public housing program and aid to rural schools also would be cut over time , governmentfinanced child care and children s health insurance would be reduced democrats immediately attacked the white house for the deficits and what they called the most fiscally irresponsible budget in decades the president s budget is worse than a bad movie that no one wants to see twice , senator tom daschle of south dakota , the senate democratic leader , said in a statement distributed by his office it s a budgetbusting epic disaster administration officials just as quickly dismissed such concerns a balanced budget is a high priority for this administration , said mitchell e daniels jr , the white house budget director , in a briefing for reporters today it is not the top or the only priority the president s top priority , mr daniels said , was protecting the country from terrorist attack as a reflection of that , he said , the administration was requesting 41 billion for domestic security and 380 billion for defense , an increase of 42 percent beyond what was already the biggest military buildup since the administration of ronald reagan mr bush , in his budget message to congress , attributed the deficits to the costs of the campaign against terrorism , calling it a war we did not choose and a recession that started in early 2001 my administration firmly believes in controlling the deficit and reducing it as the economy strengthens and our national security interests are met , he said mr daniels asserted that the 300 billion deficit , representing 27 percent of the nation s gross domestic product , was not large enough in percentage terms to cause trouble or to raise interest rates an assertion that democrats and some budget analysts called outrageous mitch daniels has proved once again that he is first and foremost a political operative and not a budget director , said robert greenstein , the executive director of the center on budget and policy priorities , a liberal research group i can think of few budget directors in recent history who would have made such astounding statements mr greenstein said that the current deficits , while relatively small , were a threat to the near future , when a tidal wave of retiring baby boomers will tax the ailing medicare and social security systems mr bush s budget , a fiveinch stack of five paperback volumes weighing more than 13 pounds , also details his proposals for increases in education and aids programs it is filled with cheerful pictures of children lining up for school lunches and of a new kindergarten in afghanistan supported by the agency for international development , prompting representative charles b rangel of new york , the ranking democrat on the ways and means committee , to brand it a press release what congress received today is pure pr with color pictures of little children and brave soldiers designed to distract the american public from the truth , mr rangel said the truth , mr rangel said , was that the president s proposed 670 billion economic package , which proposes the elimination of the tax individuals pay on stock dividends as well as the acceleration of planned income tax cuts , was running up the debt for a future generation to pay mr bush s budget sets aside 400 billion over the next 10 years to overhaul medicare , and offers a photograph of the president framed by a large backdrop of a strengthening medicare sign from a recent event but the budget offers no significant new details on how mr bush will change the program it also does not answer the fundamental question , which administration officials have so far declined to answer , of whether the elderly will have to leave their feeforservice medicare plans for health maintenance organizations to get insurance coverage for prescription drugs the nasa budget , normally little noticed by people outside of aeronautics , drew intense attention today the president proposed that nasa financing should grow by nearly 500 million to 155 billion , an increase that white house officials said was in place before the space shuttle columbia ripped apart on saturday financing for the space shuttle program , which included four orbiters until the loss of columbia , would increase to 39 billion from 32 billion ari fleischer , the white house press secretary , said it was too soon to say whether mr bush would ask congress for more money to build another shuttle but mr daniels said that mr bush s budget made it clear that the president was committed to moving forward in space if there is a lesson in the last couple of days , i suppose it is another sad example that more money alone ca n't always avoid very sad setbacks , mr daniels said nasa did come under fiscal scrutiny in the budget for the cost of the international space station now orbiting earth in a volume of the budget titled performance and management assessments , nasa was taken to task for billions of dollars in cost overruns for the station and given a rating of results not demonstrated for the program this assessment indicates that the space station program has improved cost controls but also indicates that it is still too early to tell whether management reforms will continue to be successful , the report said the performance assessment volume is new this year , and is part of a bush management initiative that tries to make government more costeffective the book rates major government programs , giving them grades like effective , moderately effective and adequate , with ineffective as the worst eleven programs received ineffective ratings , among them even start , a literacy program that provides federal grants to states for adult and early childhood education for lowincome families national evaluations show the program to have no impact on the children and parents served by even start , the report said none of three studies have found , the report said , that either children or parents who received services made greater school readiness gains or educational gains than those who did not receive even start services the budget recommended continued financing for children and parents already in the program ,

northampton , mass on tuesday the supreme court will hear arguments in two cases challenging the university of michigan s admissions policies , which award minority applicants extra points the court s decision could change admissions policies nationwide and has prompted a debate about diversity on campus and affirmative action in higher education the supreme court hears arguments next week in the cases that may determine whether racial and ethnic preferences in higher education admissions and hiring are preserved or discarded whatever it decides , the court should be skeptical of one of the most popular justifications for preferential treatment of minority applicants that a diverse student body necessarily improves the quality of education for everyone one of the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken of diversity in higher education indicates that this contention is at least questionable the study s findings show that college diversity programs fail to raise standards , and that a majority of faculty members and administrators recognize this when speaking anonymously with my colleagues , seymour martin lipset and neil nevitte , i measured views of the educational benefit of diversity as it is now incorporated in higher education policy we wanted to know this is diversity truly seen , as the former president of the university of michigan has said , as essential as the study of the middle ages , of international politics and of shakespeare to a wellrounded education \? to find out , in 1999 we surveyed a random sample of more than 1 , 600 students and 2 , 400 faculty members and administrators at 140 american colleges and universities , asking them to evaluate the quality of education at their institution , the academic preparation and work habits of the student body , the state of race relations on campus and their own experiences of discrimination then we correlated their responses with the proportion of black students attending each institution , based on government statistics if diversity works as advertised , we surmised , then those at institutions with higher proportions of black enrollment should rate their educational and racial milieus more favorably than their peers at institutions with lower proportions the results contradict almost every benefit claimed for campus diversity students , faculty members and administrators all responded to increasing racial diversity by registering increased dissatisfaction with the quality of education and the work ethic of their peers students also increasingly complained about discrimination moreover , diversity fails to deliver even when all else is equal when we controlled for other demographic and institutional factors like the respondent s race , gender , economic background and religion , or an institution s public or private status , selectivity and whether it offers an ethnic or racial studies program , the results were surprising a higher level of diversity is associated with somewhat less educational satisfaction and worse race relations among students we also tested for the effects of higher hispanic and asian enrollment hispanic enrollment has little effect on any group s ratings of the educational or racial climate as the proportion of asian students increased , however , faculty members and administrators perceived an improvement in the academic quality of their students thus support for the diversity argument comes with respect to a minority often excluded from preferential admissions programs we also asked students about policies used to increase diversity three out of four oppose relaxing academic standards to increase minority representation , as do a majority of faculty members and an overwhelming 85 percent of students specifically reject the use of racial or ethnic preferences along with a majority of faculty members more telling , 62 percent of minority students oppose relaxing standards , and 71 percent oppose preferences among the most striking findings is the silent opposition of so many who administer these programs yet must publicly support them although a small majority of administrators support admissions preferences , 477 percent oppose them in addition , when asked to estimate the impact of preferential admissions on university academic standards , about twothirds say there is none most dismaying , of those who think that preferences have some impact on academic standards , those believing it negative exceed those believing it positive by 15 to 1 one cannot help but wonder why the public and private views of higher education s leadership differ so greatly it would be useful to have some good studies of that question
on the first tuesday of next march , 11 states , from california to new york , will hold democratic presidential contests , a flurry of voting that party officials say will probably produce a democratic presidential nominee but suddenly , it seems as if the democratic presidential candidate will not have the night alone a court decision to delay the recall election in california , from oct 7 to quite possibly march 2 , the same day as the democrats' big night , has created a new raft of complications , and potential chaos , for the presidential field the candidates are now confronted with the prospect of six months , rather than just three weeks , of competing with arnold schwarzenegger and gov gray davis for national media attention and financial contributions in a state that has proved to be perhaps the best source of campaign cash in the country assuming that the decision is not overturned and that march 2 does effectively decide the democratic contest , aides to the presidential candidates were resigned yesterday to the prospect that the burst of publicity historically afforded the presumptive victor television appearances , magazine cover stories , the national victory lap would be lost in the crush of attention to california beyond that , in the critical california democratic primary itself , the candidates are preparing for what one campaign official described as an unimaginably complicated battle should the court decision stand , they will be competing against not only one another , but also 135 candidates for governor , as well as the pro and antirecall campaigns , for contributions , media coverage and the chance to buy the limited amount of television time set aside for political advertising it is causing havoc for them , said art torres , the state s democratic party chairman this whole recall has eclipsed all the candidates who have tried to make a presence in california and , quite frankly , in other states jano cabrera , a senior adviser to one of the presidential candidates , senator joseph i lieberman , said the campaigns had been counting the days until oct 7 , waiting for the first time this year to have the political field to themselves it s a problem , mr cabrera said with obvious frustration we 've gone from hillary s book to goremightgetin to clark to the california recall the recall should have ended if it keeps going , it s another distraction mr cabrera was referring to the announcement expected today by gen wesley k clark that he , too , was joining the presidential race as a democrat indeed , aides to some presidential candidates said they almost wished that the decision by the federal appeals court would be overturned , reestablishing the oct 7 date , even though there was nearuniform agreement that the delay had lifted mr davis s prospects for surviving the recall referring to the decision , joe trippi , manager of the presidential campaign for howard dean , said we all applauded it now we 're going to have to deal with it if democrats were concerned , republicans yesterday seemed delighted by the latest turn one republican close to president bush s reelection campaign said the continued action in california would force the democrats to turn up the volume just to try to break through , at the very time that republicans will have begun an orchestrated campaign to present mr bush s potential opponents as shrill and negative the only way they can get ink is to do the equivalent of juggling fire , this republican said it creates a cloud which the only way to penetrate is to make your message incredibly strident for now , democrats in washington and california said yesterday , the best guess is that the california contest will enter a relatively fallow period , which might offer a chance for democratic presidential candidates to get at least a bit of the spotlight that , though , seems certain to change about a month before the election or , put another way , right after the new hampshire democratic primary on jan 27 , when the candidates still in the race turn their attention west much of this is speculation atop speculation for one thing , although most campaigns view march 2 as the likely resolution date for the presidential contest , with 10 primaries and one caucus that day , it is at best an informed guess should , for example , any of the democrats win iowa on jan 19 and new hampshire on jan 27 , the democratic contender will likely all but be decided not all the democratic candidates view the california contest as a source of competition , or even irritation steve elmendorf , a senior adviser to representative richard a gephardt , said that the contest had proved to be less of a distraction than he had feared mr elmendorf said that the limit of 2 , 000 per individual contribution allowed for presidential campaigns was not prohibitive in a state with donors as wealthy as california i do n't think it has had that much impact , frankly , mr elmendorf said , referring to the recall the appetite of both the voters and the press to follow this will dissipate rapidly other democrats were gloomier for one thing , democrats are faced with the prospect of six months of competing for contributions in the golden state senator john kerry was scheduled to be there on wednesday to raise money \( and appear with mr davis \) there s still room for the presidential candidates to raise money out here , but as long as the recall is still around , it will definitely compete , said mel levine , a former congressman who is raising money for mr lieberman in california mr trippi warned that presidential candidates would face huge complications come february in trying to find time to buy on california television stations , not to mention trying to break through airwaves saturated with advertisements for the recall candidates on oct 7 , none of us were going to be on the air anyway , so there was no reason to even think about it , he said a bigger problem , several democrats said , would be winning attention , in california and nationally since the recall began , the candidates had all but given up on scheduling big campaign stops in california garry south , a california consultant with close ties to mr davis , said the more immediate problems that the presidential candidates have here and i'm advising the lieberman campaign is the lack of attention , rather than the lack of prospective donors when they come into the state , they do n't get any attention but that poses a whole new kind of problem , mr south said if candidates are not seen campaigning in california , it is harder for them to raise money , since prospective donors are wary of giving money to a candidate who does not seem to be winning attention i keep telling them visibility is viability , he said chart map calendar adding spice to a busy day if the california recall election is held march 2 , it would coincide with presidential primaries or caucuses in 11 states including california nineteen states and the district of columbia will have voted by then map of the united states highlighting those states which are

for the last six months , jonathan miller , the chief executive of the america online division of aol time warner , has pointed to the company s own cable channel hbo as the blueprint for a revival of the shrinking aol service his plan is to sell subscriptions to the online equivalent of mustsee programming like the sopranos that consumers cannot find anywhere else it is an analogy that evokes cringes back at hbo headquarters , where some complain that mr miller is reversing its history , two senior executives said hbo started by persuading cable operators around the country to offer the channel , and only after it was the largest premium channel could it then afford to produce its own shows the difference may seem like some chickenoregg debate , but for aol it is no idle riddle six months ago , aol time warner promised investors that mr miller would produce growth at aol by the end of the year , and this summer his plans will move from theory to practice last month , aol released a new version of its service expressly for users with highspeed connections and began a new national marketing campaign to go with it it has shifted from its original business of selling access to the internet to concentrate on selling access to a panoply of addon programming and communication tools like video sports highlights and personalized instantmessage cartoons , in a search for its own counterpart to a hbo programming hit people are always saying , where is your sopranos' \? mr miller said no one has it yet on the internet and we are n't there yet , but we are going in the right direction whether he succeeds is one of two great unknowns in investors' calculations about the company s future \( the other is the federal investigations into the division s past accounting practices \) senior aol time warner executives have said that if the division fails to show signs of new growth by the end of the year , the company might consider expelling it altogether through a sale or spinoff with only one quarter s results to look at , aol s new game is still too close to call the parent company s results have improved , but mainly because of reduced telecommunications costs so far , executives said , about 90 percent of aol s highspeed customers have come directly from its 26 million lowspeed subscribers , suggesting that it is having difficulty expanding beyond its existing base and will feel pressure to make more money from what it has except for heavy users , lowspeed subscribers generate more profit for aol than highspeed ones and aol s lowspeed customers are slipping away of its 26 million subscribers in the united states who pay 24 a month for lowspeed internet access , about 541 , 000 left in the first quarter alone , many to cheaper lowspeed services or to sign up for faster connection from cable and telephone companies that was the problem that mr miller was hired last fall to tackle to compete for highspeed users , aol had previously tried to sell its service bundled with cable or phone company connections many of those companies had competing services so they were not as motivated to offer aol as cable companies initially were to offer hbo to reduce aol s dependence of the cable and phone companies , mr miller announced in december a plan to start marketing aol as something new no longer just as a 24 subscription to reach the internet , but also as a source for unique programming and communication features that people would pay 10 to 15 a month for , even after paying a phone or cable company as much as 45 a month for highspeed access in other words , building aol by starting with the sopranos in the last six months , aol has assembled a portfolio of online information and services as part of its membership that the company says would cost over 100 a month elsewhere on the web it is a long list including video footage from cnn , abc news , the weather channel , nascar and the major sports leagues aol time warner magazines , like time and people the world book encyclopedia zagat s restaurant guides and an online radio service aol is bringing together programming much the way hbo brought together movies , mr miller said , and it has begun producing musical events , such as a film of a concert by the foo fighters recorded last week the company is adding new services related to its traditional strengths in email and instant messaging in time for mother s day , aol is making available new movingandtalking animated cartoons to send with instant messages and , in an effort to shake its reputation as training wheels for the internet , aol has created new software combining more elaborate email , instant messaging and online search functions under the name aol communicator it is cool and it is sophisticated , and that never existed before at this company , mr miller said aol says it signed up 250 , 000 new subscribers for its highspeed , broadband service during the first quarter of the year , bringing the total to about 920 , 000 that is a tiny addition compared to 26 million dialup members , but aol is just now beginning a marketing push for the service
wall street has almost always greeted suggestions of broad new tax cuts with happy cries yet at two recent meetings to discuss its tax cut proposals , the white house left out the chief economists from about half the nation s top financial firms what happened \? this time around , support for the proposed tax cuts is far from universal on wall street growing deficits and the war in iraq have made some economists uncertain about the economy s need for longterm policy changes and about the government s ability to foot the bill and the white house , according to some economists , is not exactly seeking out dissenting views i think they only call people who agree with them , said stephen s roach , the chief economist of morgan stanley , who opposes cutting dividend taxes now and was not invited to the meetings these meetings are not forums for debate these meetings are a highly politicized effort for the white house to get people on their side president bush s current budget , which asks for 726 billion in tax cuts and would begin to transform the tax code , has left wall street s foremost economic experts divided though the experts can agree on some important assumptions of the white house proposals for example , that ending taxes on some dividends will help investors to allot financial capital more efficiently other aspects have taken them into wellworn debates about how the economy behaves it was not always so the huge tax changes of 1986 achieved almost unanimously favorable reviews , and the tax cuts of 2001 struck many forecasters as well timed and affordable most of the economists' differences on the current proposals depend on theory and evidence , but some suggest that political views have also come into play a potential worry for clients who pay for the economists' advice the white house held two meetings for economists and market strategists , on jan 21 and april 2 the chief economists of j p morgan chase , bank of america and bear stearns attended the chief economists of deutsche bank securities , goldman sachs , lehman brothers and the salomon smith barney unit of citigroup were not invited some lukewarm assessments of the bush administration s proposals among the second group may have had something to do with the slight dividend tax reform is a wonderful thing that i really support 100 percent as a means to improve the efficiency of capital allocation , mr roach said i am for it , but we just ca n't afford it mr roach said he would prefer an economic stimulus for the short term to a longterm plan that implied years of deficits he said he was not surprised that the white house had not called , and he added that he might not have attended , anyway i do not think it s appropriate for someone in my position to be politicized , he said claire buchan , a white house spokeswoman , said the meetings had been intended to include a variety of people from wall street and academia she added , i ca n't say why any single individual would n't be included ethan s harris could , however the bush administration has counseled with economists at various times , said mr harris , the chief economist of lehman brothers basically 90 percent of the people are kind of preaching to the choir , and maybe they have one or two middleoftheroad people they really do n't seem to want to hear opposing views indeed , the white house might not have been looking for basic advice the administration had already made its proposals , so this was not a brainstorming session in which the administration was looking for ideas with which to formulate a package , said john lipsky , chief economist of j p morgan chase , who attended the jan 21 meeting it was more to explain what they had done and why , and to give us a chance to ask questions in the past , presidents' meetings with outside economists have rarely been highly publicized or especially large most conferences have been private and with a select group of frequent advisers the closest predecessor to mr bush s sessions was in september 1974 , when president gerald r ford invited 28 economists to share ideas about the economy but that group was diverse , containing conservatives and liberals of note more recently , in april 1989 , the first president bush met with about 10 outside economists and executives at camp david the group included three former chairmen of the council of economic advisers , all of whom had served under republican presidents also attending were m kathryn eickhoff , who had run economic policy in president ronald reagan s budget office , and arthur b laffer , who advocated tax cuts that supposedly paid for themselves in addition , jude wanniski , a private economist , and richard w rahn , chief economist of the united states chamber of commerce , were present at the time , both were known as adherents of supplyside philosophy ms buchan agreed that none of the 28 experts invited to the white house this year had emerged saying , for example , that the plan to end taxes on some dividends was a bad idea when asked if she attributed that uniform lack of criticism to luck or coincidence , she laughed and said , it s just good policy yet several wellknown economists from wall street even those who supported previous tax cuts by republican administrations have publicly disagreed with the bush administration s proposals
from redesigned firstaid kits to a radically new kind of surgery on the front lines , battlefield medicine has changed markedly and , as a result , doctors in the war in iraq hope to significantly reduce the death rate from battlefield wounds a rate that has not budged for 150 years since the civil war , experts in military medicine say , one of five wounded soldiers has died , half from profuse bleeding pentagon doctors hope to change that , and have mobilized an array of innovations some , like putting pressure bandages in firstaid kits , are drugstore cheap others , like a new anticlotting drug for internal bleeding , are hightech expensive , about 7 , 000 per dose and some , like sending radically redesigned surgical teams to operate at the front lines , involve tactics and equipment that simply were not available in the last gulf war these special surgery units were tested in afghanistan , where they reduced the diedofwounds rate , the death rate for those who survived long enough for a surgeon to operate , to a fraction of a percent for the past halfcentury , it has hovered around 2 percent doctors said it was hard to overestimate the difference there was little change from vietnam to the first gulf war in doctors' instruments , drugs , techniques or tactics except for some in the army , which put surgeons in the front lines in desert storm , wounded soldiers received first aid from medics but no surgical care until they were evacuated to a larger hospital now , all the services have small mobile surgical teams scattered throughout the battlefield , where they operate on the most severely wounded as close to the front as possible they do the minimum operation to stabilize patients for evacuation to a larger hospital there , they may have another operation to further stabilize them for evacuation to a hospital in europe never before in modern warfare have we done things so differently , said lt col donald jenkins , a surgeon who is chief of trauma at wilford hall air force medical center in san antonio many of the patients treated have been iraqis by geneva convention and nato standards , casualties are taken care of in order of priority , based on injury and illness , not based on uniform , dr jenkins said that s been the policy back to our own civil war at least col john holcomb , a surgeon who directs the army institute of surgical research in san antonio , said some of the innovations came from afteraction reviews in which doctors analyzed data on why soldiers died , where they died , and how each branch of the service makes its own decisions about which innovations to adopt for example , the marine corps has added a new product , quikclot , to every marine s firstaid kit , said lt cmdr joe dacorta , who is in charge of expeditionary medicine at the marine corps warfighting lab in quantico , va the substance was tested for battlefield use by dr hasan alam , a trauma surgeon at the uniformed services university of the health sciences in bethesda , md dr alam said he was haunted by troops who bled to death in somalia before surgeons could help them for dr alam , it meant that your buddy has to stop the bleeding , not the medic , not the surgeon so he turned to quikclot , a product made of the mineral zeolite and sold over the counter by zmedica it looks like cat litter but , sprinkled on a wound , it absorbs water from blood , concentrating the body s own clotting factors and speeding up the formation of a clot zmedica has supplied 50 , 000 doses to the military dr alam and his colleagues tested the substance on 36 yorkshire swine , which are close to a person s size the results have not been published , but dr alam said quikclot converted wounds that were 100 percent fatal into wounds that were 100 percent nonfatal clots formed and none of the animals died although the marine corps plans to use it , other branches of the military are not yet convinced the question is whether to use it , and at what dose one concern is that heat is generated when quikclot is poured on a wound , and the fear is that it might burn tissue we do n't have a huge amount of data , dr alam said we 've done two studies also , the troops must be trained in how to use it and surgeons must be trained about what to expect meanwhile , the army and the special operations forces are taking an additional approach to clotting , colonel holcomb said they will use coated bandages to stop bleeding one bandage , developed by the red cross , used two clotting proteins , fibrin and thrombin , to speed clot formation the other , made by hemcon of oregon , uses chitosan , a clotpromoting protein in shrimp shells remaining problems include what to do about severe injuries to the abdomen or pelvis , which may cause rapid and uncontrolled internal bleeding , or bleeding in the brain from a head injury what about an intravenous drug that could accelerate the hemorrhagecontrol process \? dr holcomb asked the army , he said , is considering using factor viia , a clotting drug recently approved for treating hemophilia animal studies , he said , indicate that it can work , and trauma centers often use it the defense department and the company hope to conduct a clinical trial military medical experts said the hope , with all of these new products , is that they will keep the wounded alive until they can see a surgeon surgeons will be using a method pioneered a decade ago in trauma centers in cities reeling from an epidemic of drugfueled violence one of its leading innovators was dr c william schwab , a trauma surgeon at the university of pennsylvania , who was troubled by the number of patients treated there who died later
philadelphia i went to a concert at the new kimmel center here not long ago , and everyone has asked me the same question what are the acoustics like \? how embarrassing with so much music going on , i forgot to notice i could go back and try a second time , but i 'd probably forget all over again my modest proposal , unlikely to be adopted , is that music critics be banned from writing reviews of acoustics anyway it s none of their business , and it takes their minds off what really is their business walls and ceilings do n't make music , and only rarely do they behave badly enough to keep our ears from working but the subject is a tender spot for officials of the philadelphia orchestra the kimmel center opened last season after a long and tortured run of moneyraising problems aside from some turmoil with tickets and subscriptions , many attendees argued about the sound bad news for an orchestra that had placed so much hope in a new and brighter acoustical day the move was indeed an escape at last from the elegant old academy of music down the street , still looking terrific but sounding absolutely awful the kimmel center has made adjustments and is trying to get naysayers back for a second listen i'm afraid it wasted a review ticket on me for all their measuring instruments and theories , acousticians still throw the dice with every new construction and renovation it s necromancy with computer projections the whitest of the black arts , according to one practitioner with a thriving career in repairing the miscalculations of his colleagues in recent decades , halls in berlin and tokyo have worked brilliantly london , with two endearing old opera houses , has had terrible luck with its newer concert spaces avery fisher hall at lincoln center has been cursed since birth and should probably be demolished and visited by an exorcist critics waste way too much intellectual energy on acoustics the whining and recriminations after the renovation of carnegie hall some 17 years ago sent reviewers to every corner of the hall to report on the sound of the cello section from row p as opposed to the second balcony left no one seemed to ask whether the sound of the cellos might depend on who was playing that night , and what they were playing more important , everybody forgot to listen to music the carnegie experience did show that in extreme cases acoustics can intrude tricked out in beautiful new decorations and seating , the small adjunct weill recital hall sent up such a jarring clatter at its opening concerts that sound repairmen were back on the site almost immediately , applying absorbent surfaces and the like those thick green curtains now on either side are not a decorator s fancy but an acoustical counterattack the concert experience is , or ought to be , a transaction between two imaginations one that emanates from the stage , the other going to meet it from the seats imaginations are powerful machines if their aim is truly to hear music and decipher its performance , they have a virtuoso ability to adjust , toning down excesses coming their way and enhancing acoustical sins of omission this is what allows us to imagine that we are hearing the berlin philharmonic coming out of a small box with wires in our 20 foot by 20 foot living rooms from the stage s point of view , there is a plausible if perverse theory that the famous philadelphia sound , with a richness of strings unparalleled in other orchestras , derives from talented players struggling over several generations to hear beautiful sounds within themselves while playing in the academy of music s deathly dullness the conductor herbert von karajan once told me that his novitiate experiences with bad provincial opera orchestras did wonders for his mind s ability to turn dross to gold good acoustics , like a good haircut , go unnoticed the reason , perhaps , i have heard not a critical squawk about carnegie hall s in years acoustics are to music what bookbinding and typeface are to faulkner a beautiful cover is a delight to hold in the hand the right page design is easy on the eyes but if our minds are doing their work , faulkner s voice will sound the same in the roughest , smallest and most unwelcoming old paperback as it does in the most luxurious special edition it depends on how well we read i wish the philadelphia orchestra good luck with its acoustics it has had a long and bitter struggle with the city to build its new hall , which needs all the public approbation it can get and the philadelphia remains a wonderful ensemble its retiring conductor , wolfgang sawallisch , gave it an admirable seriousness its musicdirectortobe , christoph eschenbach , promises new adventures riccardo muti tried to turn it into an idealization of the kind of verdi orchestra he would be hard pressed to find at home in italy , but the philadelphia stayed the philadelphia with its important premieres and with dashing leaders like leopold stokowski , it harbors as much valuable history as any orchestra in the country or , indeed , the world i do n't much care for the kimmel center s public spaces , but the concert hall itself is warm and inviting among our five senses , sight is the tyrant it insists on first say we tend , in other words , to hear with our eyes as well as our ears i wish my particular ears could remember how the hall sounded , but the program was great , and the acoustics looked terrific drawing \( otto steininger \)
feeling overshadowed , new york \? relax you have your own identity , reflected in what could be a new state slogan that , we submit , captures new york s political reality as validly as the recall election captured california s leave bad enough alone new york is just not an innately rebellious place , remember never has been it did n't approve the declaration of independence until july 9 , 1776 five days behind all the other colonies and habits die hard california , for instance , bumped a governor over budget mismanagement new york has serious budget problems , too , and like the newly recalled gray davis , gov george e pataki ignored them until he was safely reelected even though new york has no recall provision , one might think mr pataki would be in big trouble but mr pataki quickly reembraced the fiscal conservatism he 'd abandoned in fatter times , and merely suffered a lessthanprecipitous drop in the polls with a few exceptions , new york city s most sweeping political changes have come through court action , or after at least a generation of persistent political lobbying , not at the public s initiative new yorkers did , with the substantial financial encouragement of a wealthy conservative republican , put a twoterm limit on city elected officials a few years ago but its most daring move was electing michael r bloomberg as mayor not an actor or a celebrity of any kind , but a wealthy , littleknown republican businessman from boston who promised savvy management in the city s difficult days after sept 11 and his idea of boldness is to support the yankees over the boston red sox in the american league championship series he is also trying to get voters to approve a watereddown version of a nonpartisan election system important , but not destined to attract jay leno s oneliners not that the city would care that much new yorkers have a way of treating celebrities like , well , celebrities who return the favor it s hard to think of a successful entertainer , certainly none comparable to arnold schwarzenegger , who has run for office in new york in recent years , al lewis \( tv s grandpa munster \) , ran for governor and united states senator , and alfred c cerullo iii , who has acted in soap operas and in bit movie roles , was once a city councilman the politically unorthodox in new york tend to be businessmen or writers , like norman mailer and jimmy breslin who ran for mayor and city council president in 1969 , and lost new york just does not like big change a reflection , some historians have said , of considering the likely impact on commerce , the market and on incumbent politicians remember when staten islanders pursued secession \? they had been fighting for five years when , in 1994 , the wily speaker of the state assembly , sheldon silver , suddenly discovered that without a home rule message a formal request from the city the legislature could not consider a secession bill the city council and mayor rudolph w giuliani , a republican with a strong following in republicanleaning staten island , were not about to comply secession died new york s lawmakers have quite a way with blocks and feints , of using legal devices to procrastinate they are well known for their selective inaction california prefers the other extreme of direct democracy citizen referendums , ballot initiatives and electoral recall proposition 13 , which capped property taxes in 1978 \( to the continuing detriment of the public schools , detractors contend \) is the classic example new york has no such system but when he ran for reelection last year , mr pataki introduced legislation to bring direct initiative and referendum to the state by amending its constitution , and the republican state senate approved a bill to do just that but that sounds like more than it is amending the state constitution requires approval of both chambers of two separately elected legislatures , and then of the voters in a referendum and speaker silver , who firmly controls his membership , opposes initiatives and referendums as antidemocratic devices that usurp the public s voting rights there is no way in hell the speaker is going to go for anything like that , said john mcardle , the veteran spokesman for the senate republican leadership it s like any other onehouse bill unless the other house passes it , it ca n't happen direct democracy , with its every foible , is california s plaything , thank you as advertised this is new york , the state that leaves bad enough alone after all , bad can be better than worse
the last time that new york s rent laws were about to expire , in 1997 , the battle in albany was one of the testiest and most dramatic in years joseph l bruno , the majority leader of the state senate , vowed to eliminate the entire system , and tenant groups warned of widespread chaos , before an agreement was struck just hours after the laws expired but now , with just two weeks to go before the rent laws regulating more than one million apartments in new york city are to expire again , there is general agreement among state leaders that the laws should be renewed and a sense of complacency over the issue has led many housing officials to believe that albany , having already squeezed out a difficult budget , may not have the political stomach to do more than just extend the current laws without any alterations only last week , for instance , rent regulation was mentioned as a top legislative priority when mr bruno met with gov george e pataki and sheldon silver , the assembly speaker , for the first time since the legislature overrode the governor s veto of the state budget and after the meeting , both mr pataki and mr bruno said that they believe the laws should be renewed , as is whatever drama there will be between now and the expiration of the laws on june 15 will likely revolve around one major issue vacancy decontrol , which allows property owners to eliminate rent regulations on some vacant apartments when their rents reach 2 , 000 a month tenants say that as many as 100 , 000 apartments have been deregulated under vacancy decontrol since 1993 landlords say that the real figure is closer to 30 , 000 and both sides are hoping to validate their claims with the release today of a report on vacancy decontrol by the city s rent guidelines board more broadly , landlord groups say that this year represents as good a time as ever to advocate the eventual phasing out of new york s 60yearold rent regulation system , given the republican hold over both the senate and the governor s mansion but landlords have complained that legislators have made the topic a low priority it s been frustrating from our part , because we have recognized that we have been on the sidelines until now , said joseph strasburg , president of the rent stabilization association , a major landlord group tenant groups fear that landlords , having clearly extracted some concessions in 1997 , are running out the clock on rent regulations and while some groups insist that a mere extension of the laws is far from a fait accompli , mr silver said that many tenants do not feel pressure to lobby for tighter controls because , unlike in 1997 , none of albany s political leaders have publicly threatened to end them they are living with a false sense of security right now , said mr silver , a democrat who represents the lower east side while mayor rudolph w giuliani in 1997 actively aligned himself with the city s tenants in urging that the laws be continued , mayor michael r bloomberg has been far more reticent indeed , when a spokeswoman for mr bloomberg was asked last week about the mayor s position , she referred to comments he made in february after the release of a housing report let me be clear i support the rent regulation laws as they exist today while rent regulations in new york and elsewhere date back to at least world war ii , in one form or another , the current system of rent stabilization grew out of a 1974 state law , known as the emergency tenant protection act the law specifically applied to new york city , and to any municipality in westchester , rockland and nassau counties that chose to opt into it since then , tenant groups and their advocates have fought landlords and the real estate industry nearly every time that the 1974 law has come up for renewal , though 1997 is widely seen as the most bitter and divisive battle yet in general , senate republicans have traditionally sought to water down the rent laws to help the landlords , while assembly democrats have sought to make them tougher to protect the tenants this time , a bill offered by mr silver , which was one of the first passed by the assembly in february , would extend the current law until 2008 , and make substantial changes like repealing the highrent vacancy decontrol provision that allows vacated apartments to be phased out of the program after the rent reaches 2 , 000 a month another proposal in the bill would limit the rent increase on a vacated apartment to 10 percent for a twoyear lease , down from the 20 percent increase allowed under current law still another proposal would limit the circumstances under which a landlord could reclaim a rentstabilized apartment for his or her personal use , or for that of a family member for instance , the bill stipulates that only one apartment could be recovered for an immediate and compelling need , and that a tenant cannot be forced out if he or she has lived there for 20 years or more there will come a point where so few people will be living in rentregulated apartments that tenants will no longer have the political muscle to get the laws renewed another time , said michael mckee , associate director of the new york state tenants and neighbors coalition of course , landlord groups have a wish list , too under the current law , rentregulated tenants whose rent is 2 , 000 a month or more and whose income exceeds 175 , 000 a year for two years in a row can lose their rent protections but many landlords would like to see both figures lowered , said andrew hoffman , president of community housing improvement program , a landlord group it s hard to understand how the assembly thinks people who make 150 , 000 a year are rich enough to pay higher income taxes , but needy enough to deserve rent control , he said landlord groups have also been trying to move the debate by citing a recent study for the conservative manhattan institute by henry o pollakowski , a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology the study claims that the vast majority of the benefits of rent stabilization go to the higherincome areas of manhattan , where the median monthly subsidy from rent stabilization is 397 by contrast , the median subsidy in the bronx is 58 , and in brooklyn 5 it is still possible that albany lawmakers will be swayed by one or more of these arguments , from either side stranger things have happened but many albany lobbyists say they believe that while the level of rhetoric may heat up in the next two weeks , not many minds will be changed it s an electionyear budget , where there are lots of restorations , and now they want to get out because it can only go downhill from there , said one longtime lobbyist , who asked not to be identified i think it s elation more than fatigue they 're ready to finish up business and get out of town
los angeles , july 4 california officials were meeting through the holiday weekend to try to address the state s 38 billion budget shortfall and an imminent reduction in the state s already low credit rating gov gray davis vowed to resist a republican budget plan that he said threatened education and public safety and said that a recall election to remove him would waste 30 million that would be better spent for pressing state needs in brief remarks before he met with his budget advisers this afternoon , mr davis said the republican proposal would postpone kindergarten for more than 100 , 000 5yearolds and deny college admission to tens of thousands of students my budget balances our books and still provides enough funding for education , public safety and health insurance for children , mr davis said of his own plan , which raises taxes by 8 billion and cuts 18 billion from the budget the republican plan has no tax increases but there was little hope that the budget stalemate would be resolved in coming days , and there were predictions that the situation could drag on through the summer , as it did last year in the meantime , supporters of the effort to recall mr davis were canvassing holiday picnics and parades to gather the 900 , 000 signatures needed to put the recall question to voters in the fall two major creditrating agencies , alarmed by california s continuing political and fiscal trauma , said this week that they were considering further lowering the state s credit rating , already the worst in the nation such a move would significantly raise the state s cost of borrowing and make potential investors wary about purchasing california public debt at a time when it appears that the state will have to turn to the markets to help pay its bills california s estimated 382 billion shortfall over the last and current fiscal years is larger than the annual budget of every other state except new york the state assembly is scheduled to meet on sunday to consider a republican budget plan that includes the proposal to save money by delaying entrance to kindergarten for more than 100 , 000 5yearolds the large democratic majority in the assembly is expected to reject it the nationwide economic slump has strained the finances of more than half the states , several of which are operating on shortterm budgets and seeking tax increases and spending cuts to cover operating deficits the creditrating agencies have listed more than a dozen states as having a negative outlook for the medium term , meaning that a rating cut is not imminent but that economic developments are worrisome moody s investors service downgraded connecticut one notch this week , but the state s credit rating remains relatively healthy but california , by nature of its huge deficit and its political deadlock , is in a class by itself moody s and standard poor s , citing the budget stalemate and the recall movement , placed the state on their watch lists for possible downgrade in the next 90 days moody s rates california debt at a2 , the lowest rating among the 50 states , along with new york and louisiana standard poor s , which uses a different nomenclature , rates california debt at a , the lowest of any state the third major bondrating house , fitch ratings , has three states on its list for possible imminent downgrade california , new jersey and wisconsin analysts at moody s and standard poor s said this week that political instability caused by the recall movement was exacerbating the fiscal problem recall proponents say they have submitted nearly one million signatures to election officials and are continuing to gather more the bond analysts said wall street was growing increasingly worried about the state s ability to resolve its crisis and meet its debt obligations the concern is that they 'll take the easy way out by not cutting spending or increasing revenues enough to cover the shortfall and instead will borrow their way out of their problem and hope that economic growth will bail them out , said david g hitchcock , a state credit analyst at standard poor s who has been following california finances for more than a decade that would not be a good development from a credit perspective , mr hitchcock said but it is a sovereign state and it is in their own hands he said that if the budget impasse lasted into august , the state might be unable to make payments to local governments and community colleges or meet other obligations it has basically exhausted its ability to issue shortterm notes and is operating on the proceeds of revenueanticipation bonds issued in june but mr hitchcock also expressed the belief that california s deep and diverse economy and progressive income tax structure would eventually pull the state out of its quagmire phil angelides , the california treasurer , said in a telephone interview that the warnings from the ratings agencies were a symptom of the state s problems , not the cause clearly what they 're concerned about is the deep partisanship reflected in the recall movement and the budget stalemate , which are creating political paralysis with financial implications , said mr angelides , a democrat mr angelides said that a onenotch downgrade would mean 400 million in additional interest costs on 246 billion of general obligation bonds that have been authorized but not issued over the 30year life of the loans while governors and legislators across the country are struggling with the effects of the economic slowdown , the problem has not quite reached the proportions of the recession of the early 1990 s , credit analysts say since february 2001 , when the hightechnology bubble began to deflate , moody s has downgraded eight states a total of 11 times , including california three times and tennessee twice in the recession of the early 1990 s , moody s downgraded nine states a total of 11 times currently , moody s has 15 states on a list with a negative outlook two of them , california and michigan , are also on moody s watch list , which means there could be a ratings downgrade within 90 days michigan has an aaa rating , the highest possible karl jacob , a director in the state and local government group at standard poor s , said the states' fiscal distress had been deeper and longer than anticipated tax revenues and others have not rebounded as quickly as state officials have hoped several states , including massachusetts and connecticut , were hurt by recently enacted tax reductions , further cutting into anticipated

there are bones in that hill , say residents of douglaston , queens , so do n't disturb the dead by building on that land the hill is a wooded halfacre topped by several houses along 242nd street it also overlooks a shopping center and , beyond that , alley pond park the dead , says sam dagrossa , president of the winchester estates civic association , are the four bodies shown on a 1923 map that refers to the site as cornell cemetery the map is found in a description of private and family cemeteries in the borough of queens , a booklet published in 1932 by the topographical bureau of queens mr dagrossa and his neighbors became alarmed recently when they learned that the city s department of buildings received an inquiry in february about subdividing and building on one of the hill s nine lots sid dinsay , a department spokesman , said the lot was owned by the international management corporation , a long islandbased company the company did not respond to phone calls to its office seeking comment the developer has not come back to us with any plans for developing the site , mr dinsay said at this point , it is in kind of a holding pattern that fails to soothe mr dagrossa and his neighbors , who say efforts have already been made to blot the cemetery from the map he recalled that in 1998 a developer hired a surveyor to scan the hill for evidence of burial sites and found none the surveyor then produced a map that made no reference to a cemetery mandingo oceola tshaka , a member of community board 11 , which includes the hillside , wondered how the remains could have been missed the dead have n't gotten up and walked , he said gabriel has n't blown his trumpet he pointed out that the surveyor might have missed the bodies because they were buried in a corner of the site he added that at least one early 20thcentury deed for a house on the block preserves a rightofway for the hill because it was a cemetery jim driscoll , a historian at the queens historical society who has seen the deed , agreed that it means the hill was once home to a cemetery there is good evidence , he added , that the cemetery was connected to the new life baptist church , an africanamerican congregation that existed nearby from 1841 into the 1870 s there was a cemetery there , mr driscoll said there was a church and therefore we assume that is what is stopping any construction on that site perhaps not mr dinsay said nothing in the building code would prevent construction on the hill because it once held a cemetery but if another agency has jurisdiction in this matter , we would cooperate , he said the idea of construction angered mr tshaka i'm sick and tired of the city of new york vandalizing and trivializing my people s burial grounds , said mr tshaka , who is black africanamericans have been here for 400 years you ca n't find one burial ground that is not violated that is disrespecting our history jim o'grady photo mandingo tshaka , left , and sam dagrossa with a decadesold map that shows the cemetery in dispute \( rebecca cooney for the new york times \)

salandero 'reilly galleries makes a pretty sweeping claim when it calls its italian sculpture from the gothic to the baroque show the largest and most comprehensive exhibition of italian sculpture ever held in new york city still , go prove that it is n't what can certainly be said is that it is an intriguing assemblage of 30odd works , ranging from the 14th to the 17th centuries , with some by major talents , among them luca della robbia , desiderio da settignano , benedetto da maiano , agostino di duccio and baccio bandinelli the unquestionable star of the show is a splendid small terra cotta model , or modello , of the figure for the fountain of the moor in the piazza navona in rome , attributed to the great 17thcentury sculptor gian lorenzo bernini \( 15981680 \) \( although in the absence of a signature the work was recently sold by sotheby s as attributed to bernini , the gallery proclaims it a bernini on stylistic and technical evidence served up by scholars \) the wonderfully worked baroque figure depicts a river god with supposedly moorish features struggling to hold a fighting fish the contrapposto torsion of the figure , rippling with muscle , is exciting to behold from any angle , and the surfaces are manipulated to provide a rich play of light and shadow it was made in 1653 as the presentation model for pope innocent x , the fountain s patron , and is said to be the largest known bernini terra cotta none of the other sculptures here can rival the dynamic bravura of the bernini , but there is still a lot more to hold the eye among the liveliest object is an earlier terra cotta , benedetto s angel of the annunciation , shown with a companion piece , god the father with two angels both , displayed on the wall , are thought to be models for a marble relief commissioned in 1489 for a burial chapel in naples the annunciation angel has a flow and movement that seem to prefigure the work of bernini its face radiates serenity and sweetness as it zips along on its mission , its hands clasped on its chest in what seems to be a gesture of prayerful thanks a rare lifesize terra cotta figure stands out , designed not as a model but as a work in its own right it is a highly glazed statue of san giovanni da capestrano \( circa 1550 \) , recently attributed to the tuscan sculptor santi buglioni the saint , whose unpainted head and face intensify his impassioned expression , is clad in a purplish monk s habit tied with yellow rope he strides forward in a preaching pose , right arm raised , finger pointing upward , carrying in his left hand a bright yellow banner monogrammed with ihs , an abbreviation of jesus' name in greek the figure was probably part of a decorative ensemble for a franciscan institution most of the works here are of course religious in nature , and there are several traditional madonna and crucifixion scenes antonio rossellino s madonna of the candelebra \( circa 14571461 \) , described in the show s catalog as perhaps the finest stucco relief known from the renaissance , is a lovely rendition delicately painted by another florentine artist , neri di bicci of the virgin and child seated on a gilded throne the fat , flaxenhaired child clutches a tiny bird , as the virgin gazes sweetly over his head not to be scanted is a rare and delicate tableau of polychromed wood , madonna and child with two angels , by a late15thcentury lombard artist known as the master of trognano \( now thought to be bartolomeo da como \) it shows the seated virgin , tenderly regarding a muscular child flanking them are two musical angels the highly refined carving is believed to be the work of the same master who did the reliefs for the altar of santa maria del monte , near varese in lombardy , commissioned by the sforza family , although to date no works by him have been positively identified a most affecting crucifixion image is imago pietatis , a small halffigure in marble \( circa 1330 \) of the dead christ by the sieneseborn sculptor tino di camaino the naked torso , with exquisitely modeled hands crossed at the belly , faces the viewer frontally , and the head with closed eyes sinks pitifully on the right shoulder the intensely polished marble is so beautifully worked that the piece probably meant to be set into a background resembles an ivory its small scale indicates that it was made for a private worshiper , possibly a member of the house of anjou , tino s principal patrons the show has several nonreligious works , including a terra cotta modello for a wall relief , venus and mars caught by vulcan \( circa 15301540 \) , by the florentine sculptor baccio bandinelli the tableau , based on tales from homer and ovid , shows the two lovers caught in flagrante delicto by vulcan , venus s husband , who marches on them with a net he has prepared accompanying him are mercury , apollo and male assistants the ubiquitous cupid hovers overhead in this terra cotta , which is probably a modello for a marble relief meant for a private chamber it has been suggested that bandinelli was also responsible for a spirited marble portrait relief here of cosimo i de'medici \( circa 1537 \) , which shows the youth in profile just before his accession as duke of florence at the age of 17 a prominent chin , strong nose and large eyes are part of his innocentlooking face , topped by tight curly hair , which gives no hint of his later ruthlessness as a ruler other examples of secular art include an elaborate torch re , a single candlestick of carved walnut \( circa 1540 \) more than seven feet tall , by niccol pericoli , known as il tribolo , and giovanni battista del tasso notable for its rich embellishment with decorative motifs sphinxes , harpies , grotesque masks , bats' heads , angels , cherubs , garlands of fruit this treasure could have been used in a private chapel or villa , perhaps one owned by the medicis and there is a remarkable fanciful herm \( circa 15601570 \) , a bust placed on top of a pillar and usually about the height of a man the design of this one is given to giorgio vasari , the 16thcentury painter and art chronicler who , it turns out , was also an active sculptor in wood , and the carving to dionigi di matteo nigetti , a close vasari collaborator using a complex decorative vocabulary probably of parisian inspiration involving volutes , rosettes , a garland of fruit , medallions , masks and a highly stylized woman s head that sprouts from the top of the shaft , the pair produced a mysterious , enchanted object that might have been used as a medici decoration the show , done in collaboration with the galleria il cartiglio in florence , is a sequel to last year s masterpieces of renaissance art eight rediscoveries at

london , sept 3 political pressure and overstated language in the dossier that the government published asserting that iraq could quickly deploy unconventional weapons caused concern among intelligence experts , officials said today at the inquiry into the suicide of the weapons expert david kelly brian jones , a ministry of defense official who led a group of scientists working with the defense intelligence staff , said his colleagues faulted the document for being too certain about things they considered only possibilities and for erring in detail and emphasis they worried that the authors of the dossier were overegging certain assessments , he said , using a british colloquialism for being excessive though one central government claim that iraq could deploy unconventional weapons in 45 minutes struck them as undersourced and exaggerated , mr jones said we at no stage argued that this intelligence should not be in the dossier we thought it was important intelligence the government of prime minister tony blair , president bush s principal ally in iraq , has seen its popularity plummet because of suspicions that it misled the public about the reasons for going to war dr kelly took his life in july after being identified as the source of a bbc reprot saying the government forced the 45minute claim into the dossier over the objections of intelligence chiefs and despite knowing it was wrong the government has repeatedly denied the charge the 14dayold hearings , led by lord hutton , a senior judge , have shown that the government was intensely involved in amending the document , which was published last september as britain tried to overcome public doubts about military action but there has been no corroboration of the bbc charge that the government deliberately falsified information mr jones , who is now retired , said dr kelly was aware of the questions about the 45minute claim but uttered none of his own he said dr kelly had approved the overall document i asked him , 'what do you think of the dossier , david \? ' mr jones said he said he thought it was good mr jones was asked about testimony last week from john scarlett , head of the joint intelligence committee and principal author of the dossier , that the 45minute claim had referred not to longrange missiles but to battlefield mortar shells or smallcaliber weaponry the admission was a significant one because it raised the question of whether such shortrange arms should be considered weapons of mass destruction and put forward as a threat justifying war i think 'weapons of mass destruction' has become a convenient catchall which in my opinion can at times confuse discussion of the subject , mr jones said the inquiry also heard from a defense ministry colleague of dr kelly s in weapons searches in iraq he was identified only as mr a testifying via an audio link , he said the feeling in intelligence circles was that the dossier had been round the houses several times in order to try to find a form of words which could strengthen certain political objectives in an email to dr kelly the day after the dossier s publication , mr a said , you and i should have been more involved in this than the spin merchants of this administration
chapel hill , nc , oct 16 pictures with michael jordan and dean smith adorn the shelves in the office of the north carolina basketball coach , roy williams but many of his boxes of memorabilia still sit on the floor waiting to be unpacked six months after he was named coach of the tar heels williams has been slow to settle into his new surroundings and reacquaint himself with the town he once knew it will be awhile before this all feels like home again williams spent 10 seasons as an assistant coach here , but he left 15 years ago to become the coach at kansas too much has changed for the transition back to be smooth and easy it s trying to fit an old body into a new shoe , williams , 53 , said monday as he prepared for midnight madness friday night and the first practice of the season on saturday the anticipation is tangible for tar heels fans , who have agonized the past few seasons as their team fell from the nation s elite to secondtier status in the atlantic coast conference after three tumultuous years under coach matt doherty , who resigned under pressure after last season , the tar heels hope they will again challenge duke and maryland for preeminence not only in the acc , but nationally as well williams points to a lack of depth on his first north carolina team as he tries to temper such early exuberance we 've lost 36 games the last two years , he said fans have got to understand that ol' roy ai n't that good that s probably the bad part about it they think some miracles are going to happen but the players believe in the power of williams they had soured on doherty , who opened in 20001 with a 267 record but was 820 in 20012 last season , led by freshmen like point guard raymond felton , guardforward rashad mccants and centerforward sean may , the tar heels began the season 50 but may broke a bone in his left foot , and the tar heels quickly sank on their way to a 1916 record , missing the ncaa tournament for the second year in a row that had not happened to north carolina since the early 1970 s may was among those who considered transferring until doherty was forced out and williams was induced to come back and restore the luster this team can be a great team , may said thursday during the team s annual media day at the dean dome at the same time , if we all do n't come together , it can be the same as the past two years but i know coach williams wo n't let that happen we 're not going to let that happen we 're going to do whatever it takes for us to bring the tradition back to carolina basketball there is evidence that williams can be the one to do it he led the kansas jayhawks to a 418101 record in 15 seasons that included berths in the final four the past two seasons , capped by last season s loss to syracuse in the championship game just as important , he learned at the side of dean smith as an assistant williams turned down the position in 2000 before doherty was hired but the second time smith called asking him to take the job , williams recalled , he did say , 'we need you more now' i said no to coming home the first time i was comfortable with that but i could n't say no to coming home a second time it was an agonizing decision , he said williams said kansas had been thinking of naming a building after him but a wellpublicized rift between williams and the kansas athletic director at the time , al bohl , played a role in his decision to return to north carolina north carolina approved an eightyear contract for williams on friday that will pay him 632 , 300 in the first year and 14 million for at least five years , the associated press reported that does does not include compensation from basketball camps or his deal with nike still , the transition has not been easy the program he left in 1988 is different now , and he is not sure if he likes all the changes we are much more political here now than we were , williams said i have n't had time myself yet to figure out why , whether it s good or bad when i'm trying to decide where i want the pregame meal , i have to pass through three committees and call all 12 disciples to get their approval williams said comments like that had irked some north carolina insiders and he did not win friends when he declared that the decision to accept boston college as the third addition to the acc along with miami and virginia tech turned a ridiculous mess into just a mess but williams s close connection to smith he plans to involve him in the program more than doherty did and his performance at kansas allow him to speak his mind and if williams can turn the tar heels into big winners again , none of the rest will matter the process has already begun even before he took his first step on the court , the players had a coach they believed in again with a track record like his , you 've got no choice but to listen , the junior forward jawad williams said he s proven he s a winner now he just has to prove it again photos roy

washington , aug 30 when spencer abraham was a senator from michigan , he had one big idea for the department of energy abolish it today he is the secretary of energy , overseeing the department s 100 , 000 employees and contractors and its 22 billion budget and he is leading the investigation , along with his canadian counterpart , to figure out what caused the biggest power shutdown in american history on aug 14 and how to prevent such a failure from happening again his new role as detective thrusts mr abraham to the forefront of a complicated technical issue with intense political undercurrents he was considered for the cabinet as a consolation prize after he lost reelection to the senate , and his first choice was transportation energy is considered one of the least desirable cabinet posts the department s portfolio is highly diverse , its issues are mindnumbingly technical , energyrelated news is almost always bad and the secretary has little regulatory authority i love this job , mr abraham said the other day as a small military plane flew him to columbus , ohio , and detroit for meetings on the blackout but when something goes wrong , it s always my fault if the price of gas goes over 150 , it s my fault but the second it goes down , it was somehow 'the markets' that brought it down until the blackout , mr abraham had been one of the less visible members of president bush s cabinet even that day , he was in london but as the power failure cascaded across the midwest , northeast and canada , mr abraham issued emergency orders to activate the cross sound cable connecting long island and connecticut to protect the system when power returned he caught the first plane back to washington in the morning , visited with northeast governors in albany and made the rounds of the television talk shows mr abraham , 51 , is the first to admit that he is no enrico fermi outside his office is a picture of fermi , the nobel physicist , standing in front of a blackboard showing off a complicated equation mr abraham laughed during a recent interview as he described a fantasy having his own picture taken in a lab coat in front of a blackboard showing off something simpler , like 7 11 18 , then hanging this picture next to that of fermi , with the slogan the department of energy the tradition lives on such selfdeprecation has earned this harvardtrained lawyer a reputation for collegiality , both inside the administration and out condoleezza rice , president bush s national security adviser , said that mr abraham was a very quick study and that his people skills had made him one of the primary channels for getting some improvement in our relations with the russians on nonproliferation issues talking nukes with the russians is just one piece of the sprawling energy empire mr abraham is also responsible for maintaining the nuclear stockpile , cleaning up billions of dollars worth of nuclear waste and developing the nuclear waste site at yucca mountain , nev , which he said was his biggest challenge so far yucca was bigger than the manhattan project , he said but pinpointing the cause of the blackout and preventing another are now his priorities and could cost 50 billion over 30 years a national discussion of the subject will begin this wednesday , when mr abraham is to testify before congress already , some democrats are challenging his department s authority to conduct the investigation and are calling for independent reviews representative john d dingell of michigan , former chairman of the house energy and commerce committee , said he was apprehensive that the administration was taking over the whole investigation he said the public had been burned by the administration over the secret development of its energy policy , which raised questions about their trustworthiness once burned , twice alert , said mr dingell , a democrat like most michigan officials , mr abraham is intertwined with the automotive industry the son of an auto worker and the owner of two chrysler minivans , he was the no 1 recipient of campaign contributions from the automotive industry in 2000 , according to the center for responsive politics but even democrats who may find mr abraham too cozy with industry also find him smart and easy to work with we 've had a good relationship with him , said senator jeff bingaman of new mexico , the ranking democrat on the energy and natural resources committee senator bingaman said the fact that mr abraham represented industry was little cause for alarm in an administration that tilts that way on its own it s not as though secretary abraham is causing the administration to take positions they would n't otherwise be taking , mr bingaman said none of them want anything significant to be done about fuel efficiency that proindustry approach , set at the top and carried out agreeably by mr abraham , has led to criticism that the administration has not put in effect a coherent energy policy , despite controlling both houses of congress
the nurse at the center of an investigation of an unexplained death at a somerset county , nj , hospital worked at five other hospitals in new jersey and pennsylvania in the last dozen years , and was either fired or forced to resign from three of them for incompetence or questions about his handling of potentially lethal drugs , hospital officials said friday yet no complaints about the work of the registered nurse , charles cullen , 43 , were reported to medical licensing boards in either state , board officials said his license remains in good order , they said and , to the dismay of somerset medical center officials , word of mr cullen s spotty employment history did not reach the state licensing board or subsequent employers it was not until somerset called the county prosecutor last summer to investigate a disturbing trend among patients under mr cullen s care that a pattern of problems surfaced now the somerset county prosecutor is subpoenaing mr cullen s employment records from the four new jersey hospitals where he worked some of of those hospitals have begun reviewing all patient deaths that occurred while he was on duty a senior law enforcement source who is part of the investigation said friday on condition of anonymity that either hospitals or police investigators would review the deaths of patients who had been under mr cullen s care any death at any hospital where this guy ever worked would have to be under review , the investigator said doctors and investigators are looking into why , of the thousands of blood tests performed for somerset last summer , those of six patients under mr cullen s care showed alarming variances from normal a year earlier , mr cullen was forced out of st luke s hospital in bethlehem , pa , after coming under suspicion of wrongly diverting medication officials suspected that he had stuffed unopened heart and blood pressure medications into a safety bin for used needles mr cullen has not returned phone calls to his home on fernwood street in bethlehem and was not at home last night people who worked with him say mr cullen did not stand out in any way at the three hospitals that he left voluntarily the three hospitals that fired him or forced him out have nothing good to say of him mr cullen lost his most recent job at somerset on oct 31 after an investigation linked him to abnormal blood chemistry in six patients all elderly people with multiple medical problems last summer four of the patients died , and all but one of the deaths have been explained but the cause of the fourth death , that of the rev florian j gall , of our lady of lourdes roman catholic church in whitehouse station , who died in june at 68 , has not been determined father gall s remains were exhumed and autopsied in october , but the results have not yet come in , said john r haggerty , spokesman for the division of criminal justice in trenton , which assists the county prosecutors with forensic investigations of the six patients , four had low blood sugar , a condition with natural causes , or one that could have been caused by an overdose of insulin two , including father gall , showed extremely high levels of digoxin , a heart medication that can cause heart failure given in high doses the news of the investigation into father gall s death , first disclosed by the starledger of newark on thursday , and of mr cullen s work history has created tensions and fingerpointing in the medical professions and in law enforcement dr william cors , chief medical officer at somerset medical center , said thursday that it was outrageous that none of the other hospitals that had bad experiences with mr cullen had sounded an alarm on friday , dr cors received a letter from a lawyer for st luke s threatening him with a lawsuit if he persisted in his criticism i got to tell you , we try to do the right thing , and we 're getting pummeled , he said over the phone late friday i have my hospital s name all over the place , and now i'm getting threatened to be sued susan schantz , a spokeswoman for st luke s , said friday that her hospital , too , had done an investigation into the hiding of unopened medications and had not called state regulators or the police because hospital officials had found no cause to you do n't get to be one of the top 100 hospitals in the country unless you get very good clinical outcomes , she said in an interview , and that s why it s so distressing when a fellow hospital would take such an unwarranted swipe and you may quote me before mr cullen came to somerset medical center last year , he worked at st luke s for two years , from june 2000 to june 2002 the end of his time there , in the cardiac care unit , came after another nurse found a sharps box a safety box for used needles stuffed with unopened containers of procainamide , used to treat heart arrhythmia , and sodium nitroprusside , a blood pressure regulator the nurse removed the medications but found the needle bin filled with new bottles the next day an investigation led to mr cullen he resigned , ms schantz said , but having said that , it is also true that he resigned when we were investigating him he did n't resign out of the blue there were no more incidents with drugs in the needle bin after he left , she said mr cullen is a navy veteran who worked without apparent problems at warren hospital , in phillipsburg , nj , and at the hunterdon medical center in flemington , nj , from february 1992 to october 1996 he then spent eight months at morristown memorial hospital , in morristown , nj , until august 1997 , when he was fired for poor performance , said joan lebow , a spokeswoman for atlantic health system , parent company of the hospital mr cullen was hired nearly two years later at lehigh valley cedar crest hospital in allentown , pa , where he worked until the spring of 2000 , when he again left without reproach and joined st luke s

fountainofyouthwise , lincoln center has the competition beaten hands down this is particularly true of the charming but obscure friday morning concerts performed by the new york philharmonic although i am now a mature , welltraveled 52 , i am still roughly three decades younger than the average person attending these events by the time i start feeling old at the friday morning concerts , i will already be dead and even then i 'll still be more animate than some of the series subscribers i started going to the philharmonic concerts , held six times a year at 11 am , in the late 1980 s , when leonard bernstein returned to the institution he had helped immortalize before that , i used to sneak out of work at 10 in the morning on thursdays and fridays and attend the philharmonic s dirt cheap open rehearsals all my life , i have tried to have jobs that were easy to sneak out of , because it seems to me that work , while noble and in some ways important , should never get in the way of music in fact , the main reason i became a freelance writer is because i like to keep my friday mornings free shortly after bernstein enticed me into becoming a philharmonic subscriber , he died by this point the flashy but generally useless principal conductor , zubin mehta , had been replaced by the competent but uninspiring kurt masur however , there were many terrific guests the olympian colin davis , the dignified , generous andr previn , the rambunctious riccardo muti , the fierce valery gergiev there were also duds the fastidious but pedestrian leonard slatkin and any number of silly brits but by this point the conductors and the programs had become almost secondary i had become hooked on my friday morning concerts because they were so strange , so unexpected , so mysterious none of my friends had ever been to a friday morning concert at avery fisher nobody in my circle of friends even knew of their existence it was like belonging to an amazing secret society , where the only qualifications were that you had to love classical music and you had to be about 85 years old or , in my case , look like you had a fighting chance of getting there the cognoscenti insist that the morning is a bad time of day to listen to live orchestral music in part , this is because certain composers put a strain on the human nervous system biorhythmically , primates were not designed to absorb schoenberg or webern before nightfall , and listening to wagner before noon can ruin lunch but because the programs are the same ones that are played on thursday , friday , saturday and tuesday nights , biorhythmic considerations go out the window sometimes the orchestra serves up the inoffensive matinal strains of haydn , ravel and ibert other times it battles its way through the brooding , nocturnal alban berg or the elephantine anton bruckner for my money , there is nothing in the world more disorienting than listening to shostakovich right after breakfast you keep expecting stalin to barge in and purge the cellists on the other hand , the most memorable concert i attended was one of those friday morning rehearsals conducted by bernstein the program featured three third symphonies written by three american composers aaron copland , roy harris and william schuman as bernstein diligently explained to a crowd that was hanging from the rafters \( yes , bernstein could sell out a morning rehearsal \) , each composition dealt in some way with america s battle against fascism some people might try to tell you that music was merely a sequence of notes , bernstein said do n't believe it when he played the most emotional passages from copland s delicately patriotic third symphony , some people in the audience wept so much for biorhythms so much for the cognoscenti over the years , i have become quite friendly with some of the music lovers who sit near me , and less friendly with others ten years ago , i had a bit of trouble with a deranged woman who would sit directly behind me and hum entire movements from her favorite symphonies \( my hatred of mendelssohn stems directly from these encounters \) one morning , sensing that everyone else in the section was infuriated by her humming , but too timid to do anything \( she was a bruiser \) , i turned around and hissed , i think we should just let johannes brahms and the orchestra handle this she ignored me , but luckily she eventually died on the other hand , the couple who sit directly to my right have become very good friends fred and carol drive all the way from easton , pa , for the friday morning concerts , and it is clear that these outings are as integral a feature of their existence as they are of mine at least once a year we go out for a hearty meal after the concert whenever one of us cannot attend we let the others know , lest they be shocked by the strangers in the adjoining seats
a young man disguised in a wig , lipstick and a stuffed bra was arrested aboard the staten island ferry yesterday morning in connection with monday night s fatal shootings of two undercover detectives who were posing as gun buyers , the police said the suspect , omar green , a 19yearold high school senior , was arrested at 8 30 am on a manhattanbound ferry after a passenger told two officers that she had passed someone who was either a guy or the ugliest woman and who was acting suspiciously when the police went looking for someone fitting that description , they said , they found mr green in disguise on the upper deck police commissioner raymond w kelly said the two detectives were killed while on their way to a gun sale with two suspected associates of mr green in the detectives' leased car the detectives lost contact with four undercover police cars trailing them when a hidden wireless transmitter being worn by one of the detectives failed to work in the hilly staten island terrain , mr kelly said the killing of the detectives was the first instance in more than 13 years in which two new york police officers were fatally shot on the job on the same day police officials identified the detectives killed monday night as james v nemorin , 36 , and rodney j andrews , 34 their deaths seemed especially shocking at a time when the murder rate remains lower than it has been for decades and the city s attention is consumed by fears of terrorism and possible war let me just point out that the city police department devotes an enormous amount of its effort to getting guns off the street , mayor michael r bloomberg said at a news conference unfortunately , just when you think you 're making progress , something like this happens in addition to mr green , the police said they had arrested michael whiten , 19 , in connection with an earlier gun sale to one of the detectives , and jessie jacobus , 16 the police were still searching yesterday for a fourth man , identified as ronell wilson , 20 , of staten island , who a senior police official said was identified as the gunman by his conspirators they were also looking for a fifth man , paris bullock , who they believe saw one of the men leave bloody clothing and a gun belonging to one of the officers at mr green s mother s apartment , the police official said mr green was suspended from new dorp high school in october and had not been seen at the school since nov 26 , deputy mayor dennis m walcott said yesterday mr green lives with his mother , bertha green , a 12yearold sister and a 1yearold brother in an eightstory brick building at 67 warren street in the stapleton houses , a housing project in tompkinsville yesterday , friends and neighbors described mr green as a lover of video games and sports , a wellmannered kid and , one said , like a big brother of the 'hood but an uncle , lawrence black , 32 , said mr green had changed i saw him on the street and it seemed he did n't really care for life anymore , mr black said i do n't know what caused him to snap cynthia whiten , an aunt of michael whiten , said her nephew had once lived in the stapleton houses she said he graduated from susan wagner high school in june and was attending a college she declined to name she and one of her sisters said mr whiten admired sports and girls i'm in shock , ms whiten said he would n't do anything like this mr green s mother and his grandfather , who identified himself only as abdul , said last night that he was innocent they complained that the police had ransacked their apartment in what they said was retaliation for the detectives' deaths we are sorry for everything that has happened , abdul said but everybody is suffering now i'm hurting right now that s my grandson mr green was arrested on firearms charges in 1999 with five other people , one official said , and another official said he was charged with felony drug possession in july 2000 the second official said mr wilson was arrested on a robbery charge in march 2000 the outcomes of those cases was not known the detectives were shot during an undercover sting operation , the police said the detectives , one carrying 1 , 200 , had gone to the stapleton houses to buy a tec9 semiautomatic pistol , a weapon favored by drug dealers there , they are believed to have spoken by cellphone with mr green then two other men , who a senior police official said were believed to have been mr wilson and mr jacobus , emerged from the building and got in the back seat of the detectives' car with the undercover cars trailing , they drove to victory boulevard and corson avenue , where they pulled over one of the men in the back seat , whom the official identified as mr wilson , got out the backup police cars kept their distance so they would not be noticed , mr kelly said the man who had gotten out of the detectives' car then returned and the car moved on but because of what mr kelly described as the rolling terrain in the area , the backup cars lost contact with the detectives
the fleshandblood immediacy of theater gives it an advantage over film in the evocation of many types of emotional circumstances , particularly those of the everyday funerals , romantic rivalries , dinner table disputes , divorces and other situations within the experience of most theatergoers are the meat and potatoes of the stage and , not incidentally , of stagecraft but when stories are farther afield , the capabilities of a camera and special effects give film the edge in creating an atmosphere for credible emotional display generally speaking , movies will be better at drama that takes place on the high seas or in outer space or anywhere else where there are forces that neither mortal men and women nor set designers can control that includes war , whose emotions have everything to do with the horrors of the battlefield happily , the closest most theatergoers get to them is in films where verisimilitude is an artistic aim the power of a movie like , say , saving private ryan , derives very much from its ability to recreate the sense of a war so that the audience can somehow begin to understand the emotional climate in which the characters live frank mcguinness s play observe the sons of ulster marching towards the somme is no exception to the war play that pales in comparison to the real thing but though it is set nearly 90 years ago and was written in 1985 , its arrival at the mitzi e newhouse theater at lincoln center , where it opened yesterday , is grippingly timely the consuming sense of the impending invasion of iraq gives at least part of this otherwise formulaic antiwar tract an affecting , nervejangling buzz the play tells the story of a platoon of protestant irish soldiers fighting in the british army in world war i , from their initial encounter with one another in a barracks to their bonding in battle to the death of all but one of them in the battle of the somme on july 1 , 1916 as a script , it is lyrical enough to be recognizably irish otherwise , it is as conventional as can be , complete with a prologue set in 1969 in which the one survivor , kenneth pyper , looks back and recalls the ghosts that have haunted him for half a century , shaking his fist at the god who would allow such a slaughter , not to mention his own suffering the aged pyper is played here by the elegant stage veteran richard easton , who is pitch perfect in setting the show off on its sad , righteous and inevitable course from then on , there are three scenes , the last two of which are disappointingly programmatic in the middle episode , the eight members of the platoon are seen in pairs in four locations they 've already been to the battlefield in france , fought together and come back alive now they 're on leave , before returning to the front in the simultaneous encounters enacted on a bridge , in a church , on a field and on a sea island \( alexander dodge s set design is resourceful if not spectacular \) the fear that battle has instilled in each of the men emerges they grasp desperately for solace in their separate ways pyper \( justin theroux \) and david craig \( jason butler harner \) , give expression to their physical attraction for each other john millen \( scott wolf \) and william moore \( dashiell eaves \) , symbolically act out the need to go on with confidence , with one helping the other overcome his gut terror at crossing a narrow rope bridge the two meatheads of the bunch , george anderson \( rod mclachlan \) and nathaniel mcilwaine \( david barry gray \) , share drunken fits of patriotic pride and weepy anxiety and in the church , christopher roulston \( jeremy shamos \) , a lapsed preacher , and martin crawford \( christopher fitzgerald \) , a proud heathen , grapple with the notion of faith and its function in war in the end all eight cling not to their devotion to ulster or to protestantism in their desire to survive but to one another the final scene takes place in the hour before they 're sent off to their bloody deaths , and mr mcguinness fills it with the soldierly camaraderie you would expect in the service of expressing solidarity the trading of gallows jokes , the impromptu soccer game , the piggyback jousting match , the group prayers , the singing the conclusion is foregone both of these episodes , which take place after intermission , generate only the power of generic emotion they rely on the characters' having had the experience of war and knowing what they fear , but their terror has to do with their having witnessed things that by their very nature are unimaginable and that the stage cannot come close to replicating whether any of the actors or the director , nicholas martin has had war experience is not specified in the program , but my guess is none have the staging and the performances feel like guesswork that said , the opening act of sons of ulster is as pertinent and riveting as anything i 've seen lately in new york in it , as the eight young soldiers meet for the first time , flash their personalities and foreshadow conflict , the parallels between the soldiers of ulster in 1915 and today s americans are many and specific
americus , ga , june 5 under a sapping georgia sun , tammia bartlett , a volunteer tour guide in a turquoise polo shirt , led a small group of visitors today toward a mass of dilapidated shacks made of rusty tin and scrap wood it was two days before the grand opening of a new and unlikely tourist attraction , and ms bartlett , a college student from south africa , was refining her spiel now we 're entering our slum village , she told the group the roughly 30 shacks , some papered with magazine pages or decorated with battered hubcaps , are recreations of poor living conditions in africa , asia and central america , put together by habitat for humanity international , a nondenominational christian ministry that helps build lowcost housing in 89 countries it s a beforeandafter of poverty housing , said millard fuller , president and founder of the organization an experiment in combining tourism , social activism and promotion , the sixandahalfacre park , the global village and discovery center , officially opens on saturday after walking through the houses , visitors will tour model houses of the sort the organization builds in various parts of the world mr fuller said he expected 50 , 000 to 70 , 000 visitors a year as volunteers and staff members put the finishing touches on the village and 12 models last week , a few visitors toured the grounds tarpaper hung from the walls of one shack another used a dented car hood as an awning a jumble of tires and debris was stacked between two small buildings a visiting couple , jack and anita snell , nodded approvingly but had one cavil you need a polluted ditch running through , said ms snell , 62 , who works with abjectly poor communities throughout asia for the cooperative baptist fellowship on second thought , she added , i was wondering if you want to add smells to make it more realistic the executive director of the center , dick koegeman , said the builders tried to walk a careful line we had to make sure it did n't look too nice , but it also had to be safe , said mr koegeman , whose background is in the theme park industry at a certain point , we had to stop making it too realistic we ca n't have stagnant water and naked children running around because it presents poverty as a tourist attraction , the site makes an easy target for critics , including rush limbaugh , who mocked the attraction on his syndicated radio program i guarantee you after one trip to this slum theme park your kids will never , ever be asking you again , 'are we there yet , are we there yet \? ' mr limbaugh said on his program lynne griever , statewide coordinator of the georgia task force for the homeless , said there was no need to build a mock slum , because people lived in shacks in every county in georgia habitat does a great job at what they do , ms griever said and i'm not criticizing their building of the park but we all miss the point that we have this poverty here at home here in americus , 28 percent of the population lives in poverty , compared with 13 percent statewide , according to the census mr koegeman said the park would add a dilapidated trailer as an example of poverty housing in america in two months the trailer belonged to a brother and sister in americus who moved last year into a house that they built with habitat mr fuller emphasized that the global village did not divert money from house building , because all the money came from donations earmarked for the park he added that the park would ultimately raise money and attract volunteers to the main activities and likened the costs to money spent on direct mail solicitations admission is a voluntary 5 donation for adults and 3 for students if this proves to be a huge success , he said , we might replicate it elsewhere construction costs for the park , built on donated land near habitat headquarters , are at 13 million , and the group expects the total to reach 5 million the opening coincides with the start of a weeklong program to build 92 houses in three poor communities in the region the biggest obstacle in building the park , mr fuller said , was that builders kept making the area too attractive we 'd say , 'you 're making it look too nice , ' he said 'look at the photo again' scott bender , who designed most of the village , said he had never visited its equivalents , relying on photographs and television images the idea stemmed from a group of five model houses that habitat maintained to show visitors to headquarters last year , 12 , 000 people visited the offices and toured the houses that s just rinkydink , mr fuller said of the five houses it made me realize that if we could have more extensive experience , we could give people more of an understanding of the miserable conditions in which so much of humanity lives and what we 've been doing about it for the larger park , habitat added a slum for contrast , mr fuller said if we just put model housing out there , he said , americans would look at it and say , 'what a modest house' but if you see the slum housing , you say , 'wow , what a difference' outside the cluster of shacks , a sign warns , because reallife poverty comes with splintered wood , sharp corners , roughcut tin , the occasional protruding nail and the like , please exercise extreme caution as you walk through this area each house has a plaque that lists the materials and construction costs , a nottoosubtle hint for donations the cheapest house , a brick structure used in malawi , costs 2 , 900 to build none of the houses has indoor plumbing or electricity on a tour , alan and jeanette carlson , a retired couple from wilmer , minn , admired the papua new guinea house , a clapboard structure on stilts it s like a little lake cabin in minnesota , said ms carlson , 65 , who runs a habitat for humanity affiliate we should be so lucky photos a mudwalled house at the habitat village the center expects 50 , 000 to 70 , 000 visitors a year tammia bartlett guiding ron and dolores smith of knoxville , ga , at habitat for humanity global village and discovery center in georgia \( photographs by librado romero the new york times \)
i think i 've seen the future of airline food in the coach cabin , and guess what it ai n't too bad as was noted in this space three weeks ago , two airlines , america west and northwest , decided to test the idea of selling food on flights that no longer offer free meals other major carriers , with the possible exception of continental airlines \( which maintained most inflight freemeal service when competitors cut back or eliminated theirs last year \) , are considering a similar move , or toying with alternatives like selling food at gates america west conducted the most extensive testing over a threeweek period that ended sunday on a total of about 250 of its flights out of phoenix the first week s selection was snack boxes for 3 the next week , hot lunches and breakfasts were offered for 5 last week , they rolled out a hot dinner menu for 10 on a flight from phoenix to raleighdurham , nc , last wednesday , joette schmidt , the vice president for customer and inflight service at america west , happened to be sitting in a coach seat across the aisle from me she was poring over a thick stack of survey forms filled in by passengers who had been asked to evaluate the experiment over all , we know one thing at this point , that we have customer acceptance on the concept , she reported the surveys are overwhelmingly positive even if they did n't purchase a meal on a particular flight , over 80 percent indicated that they would in the future yes , i know there are people out there saying honey , get a load of this baloney ! airlines used to give you meals for free now they 're charging for them , and claiming that customers like the idea yet it appears to be true among the reasons are that a good number of passengers evidently dislike purchasing takeout food in the airport and lugging it through security and onto the plane also , some passengers evidently dislike even more the prospect of airplane cabins becoming redolent with the sights , smells and spills of other people s takeout favorites further , many passengers understand that advancepurchase domestic air fares are as low as they can go , that airlines continue to lose billions a year , and that free fullmeal service in domestic coach seats is not likely to return we heard from so many customers that they do n't have the time or the desire to buy food in airports to carry on , ms schmidt said they 're saying , 'we understand airline economics we want you to stay in business we want you to keep our ticket prices low , so just give us the option to buy something on board' on my fourhour flight to raleigh , i had the chicken kiev , which came on a china dish with a baked potato , green beans , a tomato and mushroom salad , bread sticks and a big cadbury chocolate bar the other choice was beef tenderloin , with comparable accompaniments now , i'm no food critic , but i do know the difference between good grub and granola , and i'm here to tell you that the america west 10 dinner was better than any meal i 've had in a firstclass seat on a domestic flight in the last 18 months according to the passenger surveys , those who opted to buy the america west meals liked the food among those who did not buy , many said they would if they had known about the option in advance others wanted more selections , including cheaper dinner prices , and perhaps a kid s meal some said that paying by credit card would be good one guy just was n't happy at all , however serve only cold food ! the plane stinks like a lousy diner from the hot meals , he scrawled on his form to my surprise , none of the america west flight attendants i spoke to at airports or on the plane expressed a complaint at first i thought i was going to be embarrassed selling food , but the passengers liked it so much that it was no problem , one said another was relieved that takeout packaging might be reduced a women s soccer team recently brought pizzas on a flight , and we could barely find a place to stack the empty boxes , she said the forsale meals fit on the standard food cart , and the dishes and trash can be stowed easily , another said no one really knows yet whether this idea will actually fly on a wide scale northwest will continue its foodsale tests through feb 15 , on 12 flights a day \( out of a total of 1 , 500 \) , said kurt ebenhoch , a spokesman northwest s testmenu items , like america west s , are prepared by lsg sky chefs , the big airline caterer , which has been aggressively promoting the idea caterers have been badly hurt as airlines eliminate meals on many flights america west executives are evaluating the passenger response and the logistical questions , ms schmidt said can the system handle expanded selections , or will the limited menus be enough \? can credit cards be processed on board \? is there a way to let customers buy meal vouchers when they book reservations without making it look like some kind of backdoor fare increase \? if the airline decides to approve the idea , it will probably be a phasein , with simple items first , 45 days or so forward , ms schmidt said there is no rush , she added the traveling public , particularly the frequent traveler such as the business traveler , realizes right now that airlines need to be focused on core competencies , such as , let s get you there safely , on time , and hopefully with your luggage with you they 're saying , 'do that give me value for what i pay for' anything else , like food , is a customerservice option drawing \( chris gash \)
jets \( 97 \) at washington redskins \( 79 \) \( records are 2002 regular season \) 9 pm today , abc the schedule makers were up to mischief when they put these two together for the season opener not even britney spears is more intriguing than pitting the redskins against the team they raided for four free agents during the offseason the players claim there are no hard feelings , but the front offices traded barbs after the signings and there will be plenty of extra juice for this game none of those four were a quarterback , though , and for both teams , that remains the biggest question mark the secondyear quarterback patrick ramsey is the redskins' starter , and this time steve spurrier said he really means it there will be no quarterback carousel this season if so , ramsey will have time to develop chemistry with his gifted target , the former jets receiver laveranues coles , who was quiet this week but undoubtedly wants to show the jets what they lost ramsey was only 8 years old when vinny testaverde began his nfl career the jets are hoping that such experience means that , after taking just 21 snaps in the preseason , he will be able to shake off the rust in a hurry so the jets can avoid the slow start that plagued them last season the good news for the jets washington s defensive line is suspect , so running back curtis martin should be able to ease some of the pressure on testaverde there are plenty of question marks about both teams , but one thing seems certain if the jets can get the running game going , and testaverde can keep from throwing interceptions to washington s two outstanding corners , spurrier s visor could go flying jets 21 , redskins 10
daniel patrick moynihan liked to describe himself as a boy from hell s kitchen until his death on march 26 at the age of 76 , it was one of his defining characteristics in fact , moynihan and his family lived in the neighborhood for only a few years , and for most of that time he was away at college but for subtle and complicated reasons , hell s kitchen became a powerful and enduring metaphor for his life and his politics the quintessential workingclass irishamerican neighborhood sandwiched between times square and the bustling docks served as a reference point for moynihan s young life his youth was essentially that of a middleclass kid cast into downward mobility his experience was much more complex than the simple horatio alger tale of a poor boy making good but the hell s kitchen story was easier to tell , and less painful , than the truth so he created a myth one that he himself came to believe that sustained him and made his transition to politics fit within a familiar framework it was in 1928 that moynihan began his journey to hell s kitchen , a neighborhood that came to embody , for him and thousands of others , the workingclass life of the 1930 s and 40 s his father , jack , took a job as an advertising copywriter in manhattan , and moved his young wife and infant son from tulsa , okla , to new york they spent a few months in greenwich village and some years enjoying relative affluence in various communities in the suburbs but jack was discontent with the lifestyle of what passed for a young postdepression professional , and in 1937 he abandoned his family what followed for margaret moynihan and her three children was close to outright poverty and in any case created an abiding insecurity they lived in a coldwater flat on east 88th street and in several apartments on the upper west side along with his brother , pat famously shined shoes in times square in 1947 his mother opened a bar at 558 west 42nd street , near 11th avenue , that moynihan would talk about for the rest of his life moynihan s bar was dimly lit and smelled of stale whiskey the family lived in a railroad flat upstairs as the oldest male in the household , moynihan , who had returned from a stint as a naval officer , felt dutybound to keep both the bar and his family running smoothly , which he did he found that life in hell s kitchen remained profoundly less ordered , and less safe , than the one he had begun to know as a naval officer his famous statement that as a politician he relearned what i had known as a child , which is that the world is a dangerous place , indicates how vulnerable he felt at the time moynihan tended bar for the summer and then took advantage of the gi bill to finish college at tufts university , near boston but the situation at home was highly volatile , both in terms of his family s instability and the difficulty of making ends meet frequently moynihan had to trek down in person , textbooks in hand and sleepdeprived , to put things right in fact , although he graduated with a bachelor s degree the next spring , he missed graduation week because he had to rush home to resolve a dispute that had erupted at the bar in 1949 , he summed up his hell s kitchen experiences by saying i 've lived much of my life in a jungle of broken families , watching them tear out each other s minds , watching them feasting on each other s hearts the near daily contact with what he described in a letter as the sprawling , plodding , stupid , sluggish , ugly beautiful working people had begun providing moynihan with a profound sense of personal identity he never missed an opportunity to underscore what new york , and especially hell s kitchen , had given him i owe something to the city of new york , he said in 1965 , while contemplating a run for mayor i was raised here during the depression we were poor yet there was never a day of my life that i would have wished to be any other person there was then , as now , a sense of building an even greater city and , he added , there is none like us hell s kitchen was also the workingclass milieu in which moynihan developed his first political instincts , became aware of the power of organized labor and formed the bulk of his democratic party principles but that is not necessarily why he clung so strongly to the myth that he was truly a child of the neighborhood in many ways , it must have been simpler and easier to be a poor boy who made good and grew out of the proletariat than to tell the whole painful story of his young life certainly it was easier to cite hell s kitchen as the place of his youth than to list the reality , an endless series of apartments , houses and neighborhoods the proletarian nature of hell s kitchen also took on great significance for moynihan because of his notion that poor people were generally morally superior to others in 1945 he wrote to a friend that while he liked the privileged young men he was meeting at middlebury college , where he received his naval training , he could not stomach their attitude toward life nothing fazes them , he said they sit there and wallow in every kind of economic and social advantage our society has to offer and remain completely spiritually and mentally mediocre , while people who really could learn go stewing away at ccny moynihan s relatively brief , lateteen experience in hell s kitchen undeniably had real bearing on his politics and ideas his abiding interest in family policy and structure and his interest in welfare reform but it became the mythic heart of his political narrative because it suited the persona he wished to project and , most important , the values he wished to embody photos moynihan said and believed that the irishamerican neighborhood between times

a tragic honesty the life and work of richard yates by blake bailey 671 pages picador 35 the mere mention of richard yates s novel revolutionary road is a reference that enacts a sort of culturalliterary handshake among its devotees , says richard ford , a yates admirer within this circle and now , it is to be hoped , for the benefit of a new and much larger one the arrival of blake bailey s great , perceptive , heartbreaking yates biography is a landmark event at this late date \( yates died in 1992 \) , it is a terrifically moving one as well a tragic honesty , marred only by its drab title , is wrenching not just for the sheer sisyphean torment of yates s experience but also for the miracle of his artistic tenacity in the face of unimaginable odds during his legendarily messy lifetime , yates racked up rejection letters and never once wrote a story deemed acceptable by the new yorker , however hard he tried upon the publication of his short story collection liars in love , he arrived to give a reading in boston not one listener showed up he sat in the silent lecture hall while his two sponsors gazed at their watches , mr bailey reports finally yates suggested they adjourn to a bar he did n't seem particularly surprised so the most difficult decision for a yates biographer is to decide how much of this misery warrants repeating with access to yates s wives , friends , daughters and colleagues , to his manuscripts and correspondence , and to much evidence of how yates s real experiences were transmuted into keenly autobiographical fiction , mr bailey chooses a wartsandmorewarts version he justifies his approach with astute and admiring criticism of yates s accomplishments , not to mention the validation of everyone yates knew amazingly , at the mere midpoint of this transfixingly bleak account , yates has already been through a bruising childhood , heavy alcoholism , impaired health \( he developed tuberculosis at 24 \) , mindnumbing employment in the corporate world \( extolling remington rand s products in chatty babbittese for the layman , mr bailey says \) , the failed suburban marriage immortalized in revolutionary road and a couple of public breakdowns yet the book still has 300 pages to go how much worse can it get \? throughout yates s life , anyone around him was dogged by that question if the prerequisite of any great writer s life is an unhappy childhood , then richard yates was especially blessed , mr bailey begins no wonder yates mentions the odors of mildew and cat droppings and plasticene to evoke the basic bouquet of his childhood he was 3 when his parents divorced , and was subsequently overwhelmed by his mother , a wouldbe sculptor who used her little son as a nude faunlet model and allpurpose foil nicknamed dookie in life \( and called pookie in the novel the easter parade , with yates s typical nearappropriation of real names and events \) , she became the antithesis of all he hated about alcoholic squalor and middlebrow artistic striving born in 1926 , yates spent part of the 1930 s in scarboroughonhudson , ny , living as a tenant on the estate of frank a vanderlip , a patron who encouraged dookie s artistic efforts before being forced to evict her in the 1950 s the same quarters were occupied by john cheever , an author with whom yates shared literary as well as geographical terrain revolutionary road \( which risked being called losers , nectar in a sieve , the fiasco and the big nothing before finally taking its title from a scarborough street sign \) embodied mid50 s suburban malaise but its pitiless vision precluded popularity to repeat the obvious , mr bailey points out , most people do n't like reading about , much less identifying with , mediocre people who evade the truth until it rolls over them thus the new yorker would review this great american novel only in brief , dismissing its meaningless characters leading meaningless lives i just plain ca n't afford to be as doomed as the people i wrote about , yates observed at the time while contemplating the fate of his foremost role model , f scott fitzgerald flaubert was another of his heroes , sparking a determinism that was a matter of knowing his characters well enough to know their fates , and making the reader see this too , mr bailey says yates reveals the pattern of his characters' mistakes without manipulating their fates he s off paring his nails , so to speak , while the characters behave as they must yates s predilection for immaculately wellobserved , psychologically astute fiction could not have been less in sync with american popular culture often dismissed with an extremely wellwritten , but during the vogue for flamboyantly experimental novels \( he loathed the work of robert coover , richard brautigan and john irving , among others \) , yates stubbornly clung to the style that made him appear dated then and timeless now a tragic honesty is also in large part devoted to the gory details of yates s doestoyevskian housekeeping , disastrous love affairs , precarious teaching stints \( with students like richard price and tony earley helping to keep him afloat \) and terrifying mental instability , complete with straitjackets and hospitalization there were times when he could not be absolutely certain that he had not shot president john f kennedy \( he had briefly been a speechwriter for attorney general robert f kennedy \) and times he feared he would physically harm his beloved daughters in addition his lung problems imposed a long period of choking and retching before he was able to begin smoking for the day yates \( who once set fire to his apartment and nearly destroyed the manuscript of the easter parade \) smoked even when attached to an oxygen tank in his ghostly final years by balking at none of this , mr bailey winds up underscoring the sheer victory of yates s determination to write , no matter what even if 100 perfect words constituted a long day s output , even if he had to run on empty \( this is what keeps your old daddy in business ! he once remarked , downing a handful of antipsychotic pills and chasing them with bourbon \) , even if dick generally expressed bewilderment at finding himself in a particular place and time , his work remained inviolate and essential many thought he was n't long for the world , certainly not as a writer , mr bailey notes , with supreme understatement but \( oddly enough \) they were wrong so wrong , in fact , that his work survives for those who , yates s daughter monica said , can appreciate it best those whose pleasure in great , unflinching art outweighs the discomfort that it causes photos richard yates , rejected but undeterred \( jill krementz \) \( pg e1 \) blake bailey \( donna t ruhlman picador \) \( pg e9 \)
nobody talks about a touch of venice i only heard of this 15yearold mattituck restaurant last spring when it earned a gold metal for outstanding comfort food at the 2003 east end food and wine awards sponsored by the long island wine gazette tucked away in the mattamar marina , this offthebeatentrack spot deserves a wider patronage a touch of venice is an airy , attractive , whitetablecloth restaurant dominated by a wall of windows , with views of expansive green lawns , boats at anchor and spectacular sunsets inside , the dining room s focal point is a whimsical and highly inaccurate mural of venice , in which the rialto bridge leads to an island in a gondolafilled lake surrounded by mountains never mind it s what s on the plates that counts and a touch of venice serves bountiful platters of wellturnedout fare the young , cleancut staff is north fork friendly crew members were also knowledgeable and speedy they immediately brought a little pot of pesto , and a basket loaded with chewy focaccia and slices of crusty italian bread olive oil flavored with peppercorns , garlic and rosemary was a perfect partner evening specials were listed on a separate menu , along with the farms that provided the ingredients a long island wine was suggested under each selection one of the most satisfying starters appeared on that list of specials slices of rare tuna set upon crunchy fried arugula with a topknot of roasted peppers and splashes of hot pepper oil and a balsamic reduction the regular menu boasted a couple of outstanding openers , too a salad of cubed tuscan bread , roasted peppers , anchovies , olives , red onion and garlic and an unusual and unusually good bruschetta the latter consisted of quartered , not chopped , tomatoes , and oh what juicy local beauties they were they were joined by crumbled gorgonzola , red onion , garlic and a flourish of basil alongside big slabs of grilled bread rounds of tender roasted calamari in a spicy stewlike tomato sauce served over crostini were a hefty pick aside from the 6 house salad , all others were big entr esize affairs \( 10 to 16 \) baby spinach crowned with slices of red , yellow and orange tomatoes , pancetta and walnuts in a lemon vinaigrette tasted great but was far too large for an appetizer the same could be said of the tuscan salad , a tricolor with chopped red onion , shaved parmesan and tomatoes in a tomatobasil vinaigrette and a special of boston red leaf lettuce with almonds , fresh strawberries , a strawberry vinaigrette and chunks of exceptionally creamy goat cheese from the catapano dairy farm just down the road steamers came across as ordinary they would have benefited from drawn butter none was served the entree i 'll remember longest was the tuscan steak , a beautifully charred , sliced delmonico over a bed of arugula and those luscious tomatoes crisp sweet potato fries , which drew just taste these raves , accompanied the steak those same great fries also appeared with the grilled swordfish , an exemplary piece of fish brushed with a pepperlime sauce and topped with colorful roasted peppers , asparagus and artichoke hearts a half ear of very sweet local corn rounded out the dish other seafood successes were local striped bass with saut ed chicory and an entree potato salad of cubed swordfish , assorted varieties of tomato and three kinds of local potato gold , red skin and blue we were not as impressed with the more traditional italian dishes gnocchi in a beautiful fresh tomato amalgam with pancetta and arugula , alas , were gummy gemelli puttanesca lacked punch a special of saut ed lobster meat , shallots and asparagus over angelhair needed a dash of salt but was otherwise fine a dish called italian delight did n't live up to its name it consisted of a mishmash of breaded eggplant , chicken , veal and shrimp alongside sausage and a stuffed shell all covered with melted cheese desserts were jumbosize beauties , each topped with an edible fresh orchid the warm mixed berry crisp la mode shared first place honors with the huge slab of warm , moist , flourless chocolate cake crowned with espresso ice cream and chocolate

san francisco by the time barry bonds batted for the third time yesterday here at pacific bell park , marlins manager jack mckeon had attempted the strategy of pitching to the giants' muscle man in the first inning , which failed when bonds doubled in a run , and walking him in the fourth , which failed worse when edgardo alfonzo doubled home a pair fatalism is a terrible thing to feel , particularly by the fifth inning in game 2 of a playoff series you know , you 're damned if you do and damned if you do n't , mckeon said you walk him , he scores you pitch to him , he hits it in the cove and i'm swimming for the ball he sighed at the thought of bobbing in the bay like some 72yearold aquatic souvenir chaser and came to the reasoned conclusion it comes down to the situation agreed pitching to bonds or alfonzo in the giants' lineup must , above all , be situational , so let s review those in which the obvious call would be to make bonds earn his way on , or all the way around when the score is 270 , in your favor , preferably during the last three innings during a blackout or an earthquake , especially when the epicenter is a shade to the left of home plate definitely during a hurricane , with galeforce winds blowing in from right without hesitation at any time during the month of march fortunately for mckeon , he decided to play the percentage sanity was screaming for as bonds batted in the fifth , runners at first and third , one out , the giants leading by 54 and threatening to break open the game the result was carl pavano getting alfonzo and benito santiago to pop out with the bases loaded and the game pivoting to the marlins , who scored four times in their next two atbats and evened the series with a 95 victory they 've now dared to walk bonds five times in the first two games of this national league division series on national television , of all places ! and reopened the silly debate of whether such tactics are good for the game or , worse , unamerican mckeon might have made the choice any redblooded football coach or former yale cheerleader surely would have he might have caught the eye of felipe alou , his opposite in the giants' dugout , spit into the dirt and mouthed the words bring 'em on along with pavano , mckeon had dontrelle willis , the lefthanded rookie sensation , warming up , a sight that must have put the television highlight facilitators on alert , and alou in an anticipatory mood whenever we saw a lefthander during the season , we were happy because that meant they were going to pitch to barry , alou said to walk him , you do n't really need dontrelle you could bring the left fielder in , he 'll do that job mckeon instead had rick helling , who pitched like a left fielder , toss four high and wide the fans booed and peter magowan , the giants' owner , probably made a mental note to campaign harder for the ludicrous rule change he proposed that would award extra bases for more than one intentional walk to the same hitter that way , the manager on the other side would have time to judiciously think what s the right time to walk him , and not just necessarily in the first inning with the score 00 , magowan was quoted in usa today it would add strategy sounds great , but what happens when the catcher remains in a crouch and the pitcher aims six inches below the knees or wide of the plate , as the marlins' brad penny did in the fourth inning , with one on , none out \? these are pitchers , who can throw the ball to a spot except when they are pitching to bonds and are scared stiff , as penny was in the first inning mckeon was in a frisky mood and said , go on , see if bonds will swing at the kind of pitch alou said he was calling for in batting practice , six inches off the plate the marlins' catcher , ivan rodriguez , set up outside penny threw inside and bonds ripped a runscoring double down the rightfield line mckeon went back to the game 1 plan do n't put us in the position where he can beat us walk barry kill bill magowan and baseball s integrity police can make this sound like some complex tarantino drama , but all we are talking about is the smart baseball play that puts the onus on others and accentuates the team aspect of a sport too often marketed with the home run in this era of inflated achievement the fans boo , alou argued they boo in other parks , too a lot of people believe they pay their money to see him swing the bat maybe bonds sells the tickets in april or july , but these are the playoffs , when the competition , and survival , is the point of it all we 're in the business of trying to win the game , mckeon said , too old and ornery to care what anyone really thinks he did pitch to bonds , leading off the ninth , with a fourrun lead , bringing in willis , who said , i was ready in the fifth inning , too bonds hitting with a chance to do damage was n't happening yesterday , and it wo n't soon chicken \? no , it s just putting the burden on the giants to show us the beef beyond bonds
mosul , iraq , july 21 the fruits of a long personal mission for paul d wolfowitz were spread out before him today in a modest secondfloor conference room in this bustling city in northern iraq there sat the newly elected mayor and his council arabs , kurds , christians and turkmens it was the kind of mix of ethnic groups and faiths that mr wolfowitz has long argued could thrive if saddam hussein was ousted , and iraq became free and democratic now mr hussein is gone , and mr wolfowitz , the deputy defense secretary and a main intellectual architect of the bush administration s iraq policy , today expressed both elation at meeting the council part of a carefully choreographed visit to iraq and sounded a cautionary note to his new allies in what he says is a running war on terror you do n't build a democracy like you build a house , mr wolfowitz said over tea , honey pastries and water buffalo cheese democracy grows like a garden if you keep the weeds out and water the plants and you 're patient , eventually you get something magnificent mr wolfowitz crisscrossed iraq on a factfinding trip to gauge the road ahead for america s strategy here , as attacks against united states troops continued to put pressure on the bush administration in the latest strike on americans , a roadside bomb exploded today near a military convoy in northern baghdad , killing one soldier and his iraqi interpreter , the associated press reported three other members of the first armored division were wounded the american military credited an iraqi bystander who helped the troops out of the damaged vehicles with saving the life of one of the soldiers mr wolfowitz s fiveday journey seemed to produce a welter of soaring emotions as well as a sense of final vindication in a man who had warned since 1979 of the menace posed by mr hussein and his baath party followers long before anyone feared iraq s suspected chemical and biological weapons arsenal much of the trip had the feel of being stagemanaged to support those longstated views on mr hussein s brutality reporters joined mr wolfowitz on a tour of a mass grave in hilla , where 3 , 000 bodies had been unearthed from shallow pits he led another tour through the notorious abu ghraib prison outside baghdad where thousands of iraqis were tortured and executed mr wolfowitz has long compared the rule of mr hussein to that of nicolae ceaucescu , the deposed head of communist romania so when the occupation authority s senior civilian adviser to the iraqi foreign ministry turned out to be a romanian diplomat , mr wolfowitz was delighted when the diplomat agreed with his comparison throughout the trip , in conformity with his activist bent , mr wolfowitz referred to mr hussein as tyrant , killer and sadist mr wolfowitz said at a news conference here that washington would welcome outside help in rebuilding iraq , but he warned its neighbors and suspected foreign guerrilla fighters who may have arrived in the country against meddling i think all foreigners should stop interfering in the internal affairs of iraq , he said those who want to come and help are welcome those who come to interfere and destroy are not during his tour , mr wolfowitz was greeted as a liberator by two groups who suffered the most under mr hussein s threedecade rule kurds here in the north and shiites in the south , especially marshland arabs and he listened to their horrific tales of loved ones tortured or killed by mr hussein s followers mr wolfowitz was , however , also a magnet for complaints that the allpowerful united states had failed to provide more security , more electricity and more jobs even though there are many things we can do , we are not gods , and the things we can do take time , mr wolfowitz told leaders here it s important for you and your colleagues to teach patience during the trip , mr wolfowitz underscorced mr hussein s brutality , but he virtually ignored the issue of weapons of mass destruction , even though that was president bush s main reason for waging the war mr wolfowitz met briefly in private on sunday with david kay , who is overseeing the strategy for a newly expanded american search team i'm not concerned about weapons of mass destruction , mr wolfowitz said tonight to reporters traveling with him , adding that that was now the job of american intellegence agencies i'm concerned about getting iraq on its feet clearly iraq is still a very dangerous place on the ground , mr wolfowitz traveled in a heavily armed convoy , often with attack helicopters buzzing overhead word of his destinations was not widely disseminated in advance his c130 transport plane detected enemy ground radar on a flight today to kirkuk , and discharged flares as a defensive measure crew members said they saw no missiles immense challenges lie ahead some glimpsed by mr wolfowitz and others discussed in his many meetings with iraqis and americans now trying to run iraq thieves in basra tap into pipelines and smuggle oil into nearby iran the slightest rumor of fuel shortages creates huge lines at gas stations , requiring army soldiers to stand guard the country needs tens of thousands of new police officers

vianlesbains , france the big handshake between the transatlantic odd couple , president bush and president jacques chirac of france , finally happened here this hot and muggy sunday afternoon on the shores of lake geneva it was , in the end , both a dramatic letdown and a diplomatic success decorous , accompanied by polite chatter , but with no glimpse into the feelings of two emotional men what was far more telling was watching mr bush on a flowerfilled terrace of the 19thcentury h tel royal as mr chirac stayed by his side working the room of fellow global power brokers prime minister silvio berlusconi of italy , who supported mr bush on iraq , got a big neck squeeze prime minister junichiro koizumi of japan , who in late may spent two hours lounging around the pool with mr bush at his texas ranch \( and who supported him on iraq \) , got an arm around the back prime minister tony blair of britain , the president s closest ally on iraq , got a swinging handshake , as if he were one of mr bush s yale fraternity brothers this annual summit meeting of the world s leading industrialized democracies and russia , known as the group of 8 , has an official agenda thick with scheduled talks on iraq , the middle east , the nuclear problems of north korea and iran , aids , poverty and the dollar but underneath , it is really a messy family reunion , one of those longscheduled ones that everyone is forced to attend , that this year falls after one of the biggest fights in decades the even group of 8 lineup of four against four adds to the tension the united states , britain , italy and japan supported the war france , germany , russia and canada did not so on sunday in this sleepy , not terribly fashionable resort town of spas , a big casino and the natural spring water bearing its name , nobody missed the fact that mr bush s friends got the texas treatment , and that mr chirac , in his first facetoface encounter with the american president since iraq , got something less there was no word yet on how he would interact with chancellor gerhard schr der of germany , who was not due here until late sunday , although mr bush did see him on saturday in russia , during the celebrations of st petersburg s 300th anniversary in vian , body language was all how much thought has been given to the handshake with president chirac \? a white house correspondent asked a senior administration official who was briefing reporters en route to france on sunday morning on air force one none , the official crisply replied , to laughter no , the president is going to do what the president does he s a friendly person , he s going to , i'm sure , shake president chirac s hand , and we 're looking forward to seeing him he had an encounter with chancellor schr der last night they shook hands the reporter persisted , you know it s customary to kiss on both cheeks , right \? that s only if you are french , i think , the official replied we do n't do that in the united states in texas they do n't do that a larger question was how the inhabitants of vian were reacting to the presence of mr bush , who was nestled into the hillside in a suite at the h tel royal , originally built for the pleasure of king edward vii the consensus , at least among the few natives who could be found along the town s lakeside promenade , was that they did not like the american president and they liked the war even less , but they were nonetheless pleased he was here i would be very happy to see him somewhere , said julienne fr d rique , 35 , who works as a clerk in a local supermarket nothing ever happens here , so it s very exciting for me even less seemed to be happening sunday evening , when the promenade , which looks out toward the swiss shore and lausanne , was nearly deserted people had fled because of a long holiday weekend and the headaches of having the world s leaders descend on the town , leaving behind a strange quiet the lake was serene fishing , swimming and boating had been banned for security reasons for the duration of the summit meeting as the french alps overhead turned blue in the dusk at the casino vian , the tables were silent there is nobody here it s a dead town , said pierre vigliano , 60 , a hotel builder and financier who was out walking near his home as for mr bush , he said it s not normal that he went to war against iraq he did n't have a good reason to go to war and president chirac thinks the same nonetheless , mr vigliano said , the war turned out all right this compensates for my bad opinion , he said having mr bush just up at the h tel royal , he said , made him very proud on sunday , mr chirac said that his conversations with mr bush were positive and that he did not feel the slightest discomfort even though mr bush had implicitly criticized him as recently as the day before , when mr bush said in a speech in krakow , poland , that this is no time to stir up divisions in a great alliance none of that split was evident on sunday , as mr chirac stood with mr bush at the h tel royal and prepared for a halfhour meeting with him on monday at the family reunion in vian , everyone , for now , is on the best behavior photos hail fellows , well met congenial pairings of leaders in geneva , from left , crown prince abdullah of saudi arabia and president bush jacques chirac and tony blair and jean chr tien and hosni mubarak \( associated press \) \( agence francepresse \) \( reuters \) mr bush in a t te t te with prime minister junichiro koizumi of japan \( associated press \)
the masses may have been glued to cnn , but at altcoffee , a shabbychic caf on avenue a , the under25 crowd was distracted by their laptops , assorted apolitical reading material and the boredoms , a japanese noise band that screamed through the speakers discreet eavesdropping revealed conversations about summer employment , proust and the pros and cons of electrolysis i think people are trying to hide from it , greg curley , cashier and cappucino maker , referring to the newborn attack on iraq but none of the patrons could be described as apathetic a freshly made antiwar poster hung on one wall , and when prompted , just about everyone admitted to feeling a mixture of fury , sadness and fear but after months of agitating and speaking out against armed conflict , many customers said the time for distraction had arrived this war is so wrong , i'm completely against it , but there s nothing i can do about it , said lucy malii , 19 , a sophomore at city college ms malii had been home when president bush announced the military s opening salvos and decided she had to get out of her family s lower east side apartment my mother is so worried , she was making me crazy , she said i know what s happening is horrible , but right now , i 'd rather not know about it andrew jacobs
the eight memorial designs being considered for the world trade center site seem to have done almost everything they were supposed to do except resonate in the public imagination they may not have been greeted with the impassioned hostility from some quarters that first met maya lin s design for the vietnam veterans memorial but neither have they been fervently embraced and that raises some questions can a transcendent memorial actually be planned \? or are planners and the public trying to make more of a single memorial than it can possibly be \? conventional wisdom says that the lower manhattan development corporation followed a textbook process perhaps that is why it got textbook results the corporation chose a conscientious and competent jury , as isolated from politics as a body can be that owes its existence to the governor and mayor the jury perused submissions from around the world that were solicited in an open competition designers and jurors were guided by a mission statement drafted by members of the victims' families and modified through consensus and public hearings this yielded five major program principles that the memorial recognize each individual who was a victim of the attacks on sept 11 , 2001 , and feb 26 , 1993 that it make visible the footprints of the original world trade center towers and that it provide areas for the victims' families and friends , for quiet contemplation and for the interment of unidentified remains by the corporation s own checklist , every finalist met the program though the plans have technical challenges that would need to be resolved during the normal design process , the corporation reported , none were fatal flaws yet the plans seem to have left people hungering for something else there is a remarkable sameness to these designs , said the new york metropolitan chapter of the american planning association none provide a welldesigned urban public gathering space , none make use of the artifacts from the world trade center buildings and none convey the urban and international texture of the place that made a target for attack there is nothing that evokes the experience of those further away watching the second plane hit and the towers coming down there is nothing about those who labored in the pit or those who ministered to the rescue workers most glaring , the designs as they stand do little to recall the actual horror of the destruction of the towers or the void left at ground zero in general , said michael kuo of the municipal art society , the public feels the designs did not communicate really what happened here , at this place and did not go beyond the victims to reflect the sense of community that held us together after our city and our lives were torn apart mr kuo is the planner of the imagine new york program , which has gathered the views of more than 300 people at public meetings and more than 2 , 600 people through an online survey most of the missing elements cited by critics were not required by the guidelines and it is hard to imagine that the designs would have turned out appreciably better with a 10 or 15point program instead , it seems likelier that the plans would have grown even more diffuse by contrast , the 9 11 memorials that have touched the public have been unplanned , straightforward and simple kevin m rampe , the president of the development corporation , recalled them last week when he introduced the finalists it began with the first flower laid gently on the steps of trinity church , he said , the first candle to flicker in union square park , the first heartfelt message inscribed on the viewing platform overlooking ground zero it continued with the installation in battery park of the damaged sphere for plaza fountain

extraordinary number of visitors who circulate around the site every day suggests that a memorial already exists and while a permanent remembrance at the trade center site must be more than exposed

satisfied all the demands , unless one were to start thinking of the memorial collectively the sphere , the pit , the chapel , the wall , the cross , each and every firehouse and all the other

tampa , fla , march 5 david wells failed to cover first base today he also threw a doubleplay ball into center field in three innings against the atlanta braves , he gave up five runs on nine hits brian cashman saw none of it wells , the yankees lefthander and author , is twisting cashman , the general manager , finished wells s saucy autobiography on tuesday night and did not have time to watch the yankees' 122 loss , which wells started , at legends field today cashman has made no decision on disciplinary action , and the firestorm around wells continues cashman wants to fine or suspend wells , one club official said , and he has conferred with club lawyers about what action he can take the problem , the official said , is that cashman s options are limited i'm talking to our personnel internally , cashman said other than that , i ca n't comment several club officials said that the yankees were not considering trading or releasing wells and that they had not asked him to waive his notrade clause , which wells has said he will not do but there is a growing sense that cashman will try to discipline wells in some way cashman would not comment on his impression of wells s book , perfect i'm not ! boomer on beer , brawls , backaches and baseball , which will be in new york stores by the end of the week but club officials believe wells has severely embarrassed the organization , which has gone without major controversies over the last few years the yankees have largely avoided distractions since manager joe torre took over in 1996 , and there is a feeling that if they do not at least try to discipline wells , they will be tacitly condoning what he wrote based on excerpts that he read before receiving the book , cashman was rankled by wells s boasts that he pitched his 1998 perfect game while halfdrunk wells also irritated fellow players by claiming that steroid and amphetamine use is rampant in the major leagues even so , the union is supporting wells this is a book there s no demonstrable impact on the club that i'm aware of , and more important , there are substantial doubts that what the book says is true , said gene orza , the associate general counsel for the players association all of this suggests that it is highly doubtful that either the club or the commissioner could sustain any discipline in this matter orza said the union would challenge the yankees if they tried to discipline wells in any way he also said the situation was not comparable to the one before the 2000 season involving john rocker , then an atlanta pitcher , who made offensive comments in a magazine interview i do n't think the standard is rocker , orza said commissioner bud selig , who plans to read wells s book and could take action apart from any the yankees might take , suspended rocker for 73 days and fined him 20 , 000 the union objected , and an arbitrator reduced the suspension to 27 days and the fine to 500 rocker s effectiveness as a pitcher has steadily eroded since then , but wells said today that he had never had trouble maintaining his focus , despite his second poor showing of camp i think i 've been around long enough to know how to do it , wells said the media s going to write what they write i'm not worried about one thing , to be honest i'm just worried about going out and doing my job i ca n't get distracted torre said wells had made a habit of thriving off controversy that seems to be more what motivates him than what bothers him , torre said in the past , any time he s been challenged , he seems to respond well to that in two spring training starts , wells has allowed 7 runs and 13 hits in five innings he allowed four runs in the second inning today after throwing johnny estrada s doubleplay grounder into center three consecutive singles followed the error with two out in the third , wells failed to cover first after estrada lined a ball off the glove of first baseman todd zeile wells thought the ball would get through the infield and never started toward first but second baseman alfonso soriano came up with it , to the dismay of wells and torre i know we work on it , and it s something that should n't happen , torre said fans booed , which wells expected there was no comment from george steinbrenner , the team s principal owner , who called hideki irabu a fat toad for the same offense in an exhibition game in 1999 steinbrenner has stayed silent on all things wells i'm handling it solely , cashman said it s in my lap to handle , as it should be inside pitch jason giambi was a late scratch from the lineup because of stiffness in an abdominal muscle on his right side giambi felt some discomfort when he swung during batting practice and decided not to take a chance he will miss at least a couple of days it s nothing serious , giambi said we just do n't want to play with it and make it worse i could miss the rest of spring training if it was something serious , so i'm not even going to mess with it reliever steve karsay had back surgery in november , but the yankees have a new concern his right shoulder karsay has been shut down for now after complaining of shoulder soreness after his outing on monday the yankees have hired jimmy key as a consultant key , who retired after 15 years in the major leagues in 1998 , pitched for the yankees from 1993 to 1996 he will work with the major and minor league teams during the season and could be a candidate for pitching coach when mel stottlemyre retires i do n't know if it s something he 'd like to do , general manager brian cashman said but with his ability , r sum and demeanor , i'm sure that s something he would be capable of doing the cincinnati reds scouted sterling hitchcock s outing tuesday , but the yankees are not close to a deal the reds cannot increase their payroll , and the yankees would have to pay a substantial portion of his 6 million salary nick johnson , who has a sore left wrist , said he felt almost no pain when he swung during batting practice wednesday he will play his first exhibition game friday photos david wells s autobiography \( harpercollins \) \( pg d3 \) david cone , who is

more than a million schoolchildren play chess in the united states , yet beatriz marinello says they have been largely ignored by the game s official sanctioning body she intends to change that ms marinello is the new president of the united states chess federation , and she is planning new scholastic chess initiatives aimed at supporting existing programs as well as introducing the game to children who have had little exposure to it , particularly girls and those in lowincome areas the federation has neglected them , said ms marinello , an international chess master and the first woman to hold the federation s presidency there are so many kids playing , but we lose most by the time they 're 11 , she said we need to provide more opportunities for them to take part in the game chess teaches pattern recognition , systematic thinking and flexibility in adapting to changing situations scholastic chess gives us the chance to introduce the game into the culture in a massive way already , 60 percent of the federation s members are 14 or younger , and an even greater majority have not yet graduated from high school historically , the federation s scholastic members who cannot vote before age 16 were represented by a vocal group of adults who , until recently , had relatively little political power within the organization , ms marinello said but in the last three years , as younger members became a majority in the organization , the influence of scholastic chess advocates grew so much that they were able to elect ms marinello to the federation s board , from which she was appointed president a native of santiago , chile , ms marinello , 39 , started playing chess at 13 and three years later became a chilean national women s champion since moving to this country in 1990 , she has participated in four united states women s championships , and she was a playercaptain in the 1994 chess olympiad in moscow she said that her dedication to scholastic chess comes from both her love of the game and the fact that her parents actively discouraged her from playing because she was female i succeeded in spite of them , she said now i have a mission ms marinello said that her first move as president of the federation would be to invest 200 , 000 in new computer technology , giving the federation online ability to reach out to both young chess players and children who have had no contact with the game she estimated that of the more than a million children playing chess in the united states , only 50 , 000 have any connection with the federation using the internet and her academic expertise , she said she would help develop scholastic chess programs , particularly in lowincome areas she said that most children who play chess in the united states are male , white , affluent and participants in private or schoolsponsored chess clubs , but that fewer youths near or below the poverty line are exposed to the game to bridge the gap , she said that she was writing curriculums , creating program models and soliciting funds to set up chess programs in school districts that have none her most recent project is chess for our children , a privately financed initiative that will bring professional chess instruction to 7 , 000 lowincome students in dade county , fla , this year ms marinello , who is moving to miami from manhattan , said she would like to see the program integrated into the district s regular school curriculum , expand into public and private schools throughout florida and eventually become a national program another objective , she said , will be to strengthen afterschool chess programs by providing them with professional and organizational support from the federation in the hope that they , too , will eventually be integrated into their school districts' academic curriculums ms marinello has considerable experience in this area , having brought chess into the classrooms of a number of new york area schools , including the dalton school , where she was one of the chess coaches from 1990 to 1992 public schools 9 and 6 in manhattan , where she was the main classroom chess instructor for kindergarten through fifth grade from 1993 to 1996 the horace mann school in the bronx , where she led students to second place in the national elementary chess championships earlier this year and the chappaqua , ny , elementary schools , where she taught chess to elementary students as an academic subject the federation s vice president , tim hanke , said that ms marinello s plans to promote scholastic chess would not only benefit schoolchildren but would enliven the game if you go to an average adult tournament , you 'd be lucky to see 50 people there , said mr hanke , who manages the federation s finances but some of the biggest scholastic national events have between 2 , 000 and 3 , 000 people playing clearly , dramatic changes are needed , and beatriz is the one to make them photo beatriz marinello , president

on monday afternoon at the mtv studios , the donnas were strutting through a sharp makeout song called , take it off about a hundred fans all young , mainly white , largely female bobbed and clapped as brett anderson \( who is donna a \) told a reticent lover to quit dillydallying stop staring at my d cup , she snarled the song lasted about as long as an average commercial break , and when it was over one of the mtv hosts , la la , nodded at torry castellano \( donna c \) and said , that drummer is something serious then la la turned to the camera to announce the day s big news for the fourth day in a row , justin timberlake s cry me a river was no 1 every afternoon trl \( for total request live \) plays mtv s 10 most requested videos trl celebrated its fourth anniversary last september , and for most of its history the show has been closely associated with the teenpop boom there were times when trl seemed like an hourlong commercial for mr timberlake s boy band , 'n sync these days , though , teenpop is in remission , and mtv executives think they may have identified its successor punk rock on trl this is spankin' new bands week , which means performances from five punkinflected bands in five days the donnas , the used , simple plan , new found glory and good charlotte none of these bands have had widespread success yet , and mtv is hedging its bets by splitting its coverage after playing just one song on trl , each band is playing a fivesong set on mtv s sister network , mtv2 still , it s hard to dismiss the reductive logic behind the network s gambit like the pop acts that came before , these bands are known for straightforward tunes , energetic performances and teenfriendly lyrics the band members generally seem friendlier than rappers , more wholesome than rb singers , hipper than country stars , more fun than divas and more cheerful than their heavymetal counterparts if some of these bands score smash hits and if mtv stays supportive , punk rock just might become the new teen pop maybe in a year mtv will have a reality series called making the punk band for their part , the donnas seem amused \( and not a little bit flattered \) to be on the show , even though the band is n't quite spankin' new it was formed a decade ago , when the members were in eighth grade all four donnas admit to being fans of trl , and maya ford \( donna f \) , the bassist , says she once emailed trl to request take it off the donnas are traditionalists they recently released their fifth album , spend the night \( atlantic \) , which completes their evolution from a threechord punk act to a swaggering hardrock band onstage , guitarist allison robertson \( donna r \) prances and sneers like angus young from ac dc if anything , the donnas are more stylized than the average trl act in a recent video the band members were portrayed as cartoon characters but while the lyrics to take it off would n't sound out of place on a christina aguilera album \( c'mon and break me off 'cause i get what i want and i like what i see , ms anderson delivers the lyrics with a playful blankness that warns you not to take her too seriously like many of the rising punk rock bands , the donnas have found a way to mock teen pop while coopting its language tom calderone , executive vice president of music and talent programming , argues that this attitude is what distinguishes the current crop of punk bands from earlier waves people may make the argument that it s punklite or that it s punk for girls , he said but in reality , people are gravitating towards it because these are great pop songs during the first punkrock boom , in the 1970 s , many of the groups defined themselves by their opposition to mainstream popular music johnny rotten of the sex pistols used to wear a tshirt that said , i hate pink floyd in the 1980 s punk s guiding ethos evolved from opposition to separatism for many bands the goal was to create a selfsustaining punk community even green day , a punk band that achieved mainstream success in 1994 , retained something of this spirit the group seemed to exist in its own world , separate from the pop acts with whom they shared more than a few fans more recently , though , punk bands have found more ambiguous ways to exploit popstar imagery a few years ago blink182 made a video called all the small things , in which the group posed as a boy band , draped in bright unbuttoned shirts and surrounded by screaming girls they were making fun of the backstreet boys , but they were also acknowledging that they , too , were a boy band , of a sort more recently , good charlotte made a music video called lifestyles of the rich famous , which includes an appearance by chris kirkpatrick , from 'n sync many of the bands performing at mtv this week are veterans of a punk rock scene that exists somewhere between the underground and the mainstream all five have been part of the warped tour , a traveling summertime festival and mr calderone says spankin' new bands week was conceived last month , when he and other executives started noticing some of these bands hovering just below the top 10 on the requests chart

boston , oct 10 a week ago today , the red sox returned to fenway park on the brink of a postseason debacle boston trailed oakland by two games to none in their american league division series , and its losses had featured listless hitting , poor relief pitching and porous defense with all of new england bracing for another painful october , the red sox players displayed a considerable amount of confidence in their clubhouse they had begun shaving their heads in a karmachanging binge sparked by first baseman kevin millar , then they began winning games , beating a jittery a s team three straight times and advancing to the american league championship series to take on the yankees they flew straight to new york from oakland and split two games at yankee stadium on friday they were back at fenway , but in less dangerous circumstances than they were a week ago the mood in the red sox clubhouse was n't all that different , with the players maintaining they were confident last friday and are confident now pedro mart nez , the team s ace , will start saturday s game there s an air of confidence on the planes and in the clubhouse that has n't changed , red sox outfielder gabe kapler said when we were down , 02 , that did n't change , and it has n't changed now red sox general manager theo epstein noted the similarities in the clubhouse he joked that the only difference came from the signs waiting for the team when it returned from the trips after the two losses in oakland , a fan hung a sign outside the red sox players' parking lot that quoted john belushi s rallying cry from the movie animal house was it over when the germans bombed pearl harbor \? last friday , i remember being impressed with the players' genuine belief that we were going to come back and win three games , epstein said now , after the first two games of this series , it confirmed what we already knew , that these two teams are evenly matched it s a best of five , we 've got three games at home , and pedro going twice the red sox will also get a boost from johnny damon s return to the top of the lineup after he missed the first two games of the yankees series with a concussion resulting from his game 5 collision in oakland i feel like i'm 100 percent ready , said damon , who hit the ball sharply in three rounds of batting practice on friday he said that he still gets sporadic headaches , and conceded that yankees starter roger clemens is a difficult pitcher to return against , but said his biggest concern is not clemens s propensity to pitch inside my biggest concern is the sun , damon said it s pretty brutal in center field and right field i'm going to have to deal with it damon s appearance will undoubtedly rouse the fenway crowd , and probably rouse the red sox players , too but they 're used to it we 've been evenkeeled on a very emotional high , if that s possible , kapler said we 've been even , but up does that make sense \? the veteran pitcher john burkett said that the red sox' plane flight was actually a bit more deflated returning from new york this morning with the alcs tied , 11 , than when the team returned from oakland with the red sox down , 02 we were disappointed that we did n't come out of there with two wins , burkett said in reference to new york and he spun the notion that being up , 20 , is n't necessarily the most enviable spot what s funny about the playoffs is that you could be up , 20 , but that might not be as good as being tied 11 , burkett said because if you 're up , 20 , well , everyone is expecting the red sox to win and if you lose a game it might swing the momentum back part of the red sox' confidence stems from the team s camaraderie burkett said that in his 14year major league career , he had never been on a team that had gotten along better virtually everyone now has a shorn head except damon and nomar garciaparra even epstein and manager grady little have been put under the buzz clippers now they would like some champagne to pour over those haircuts photo red sox manager grady little , right , who has joined most of his players in receiving a buzz cut , talking to shortstop nomar garciaparra , one of the few hirsute holdouts \( photo by associated press \)

cleveland , july 8 the mets were prepared to offer billy traber 13 million when they drafted him with the 16th overall pick in the 2000 draft but a routine magnetic resonance imaging showed damage to traber s pitching elbow , and the mets slashed their bonus offer to about 400 , 000 traber signed anyway , and the next winter , he was traded to cleveland in the deal for roberto alomar the mets may regret that trade for years , and after tonight , the yankees could tell them why they faced traber for the first time , and their depleted lineup could hardly touch him traber threw a onehitter in the indians' 40 victory , facing just 28 batters , one over the minimum traber seemed to have little conception of what he had accomplished he came into the game with a 35 record and a 489 earned run average in his rookie season , and had never pitched more than seven innings in his seven major league starts but he acted as if he expected to throw nohitters regularly asked if this was his best game ever , traber said , i do n't want to sell myself short the yankees gave traber , a 23yearold lefthander , all the credit , even if their lineup was missing six everyday players alfonso soriano and derek jeter both took a day to let their injured hands heal , though jeter pinchhit in the ninth and flied out i'm glad the question was not asked 'was it his pitching , or lack of hitting \? ' or , 'did you guys have a letdown after the red sox \? yankees manager joe torre said at the end of his session with reporters none of that stuff happened it was all him , no question he was terrific tonight jeff weaver \( 47 \) allowed two runs in the first and two in the eighth , leaving with two out in that inning cleveland s matt lawton , who was also included in the alomar trade , scored twice off weaver , after a walk in the first and on a homer in the eighth he pitched well , torre said of weaver the other guy pitched great john flaherty , whose name traber could not remember afterward , had the only yankee hit , a clean single through the left side to lead off the third inning traber has a belowaverage fastball , but flaherty said he succeeded by getting ahead of hitters and not having to throw it when you throw strike 1 with it and you 've got some movement and you 're hitting your spots , flaherty said , you 're almost forcing the hitter to be aggressive coming up there because you do n't want to be behind in the count that s half the battle , the firstpitch strike , especially when you have n't seen the guy and you 're trying to get a feel for him jorge posada , who started at designated hitter , said traber was much different from what the yankees' scouting reports had said very good changeup , throws strikes , has a very good sinkerball , and he s around 8485 miles an hour , posada said , reciting the yankees' reports on traber he was hitting 9091 we could n't get him traber was incredulous when told of posada s comment i do n't try to throw hard , he said i do n't think it was very hard do n't tell me i'm used to working in the mid80 s and changing speeds the first two batters in the yankees' lineup were enrique wilson , now batting 200 , and todd zeile , now batting 198 soriano and jeter were injured by fastballs from pedro mart nez on monday the ball that hit soriano also tipped off the knob of his bat for a foul , but it did more damage soriano had a large bandage on the side of his left palm , below the pinkie , and he carefully wrapped his hands around a bat by his locker this afternoon soriano holds his bottom finger just below the knob of the bat , and when he did this , he instantly felt uncomfortable it hurts so much now , said soriano , who later had his hand wrapped when i tried to hold the bat right now , it s pain jeter took batting practice , but torre did not like what he saw and told jeter to take only one round jeter did not protest , but said he could have played torre said he expected bernie williams to return from a knee injury on wednesday after a fivegame rehabilitation stint with class aa trenton nick johnson is on the disabled list , robin ventura had the night off and raul mondesi missed his fourth game in a row with a sore hip but , torre said , the missing yankees were incidental to traber s success i'm not sure that would have made a difference the way he pitched , torre said inside pitch the yankees and the lawyer for darryl strawberry fielded telephone calls tuesday from callers asking if strawberry had died , a rumor that apparently began in the afternoon on the internet darryl rouson , strawberry s lawyer , and rick cerrone , a spokesman for the yankees , assured reporters that strawberry , 41 , was alive everything is fine , rouson said in a telephone interview he said strawberry was spending time with his family at an undisclosed location photo billy traber gave up only one hit last night , to john flaherty in the third \( associated press \) \( pg d3 \)
baghdad , iraq , nov 20 a powerful truck bomb killed five people on thursday near the offices of a proamerican kurdish group in kirkuk , in the north , while the commander of american forces in baghdad reported that a 12day bombing campaign against suspected guerrilla bases had sharply reduced attacks on occupation troops the target of the kirkuk bombing appeared to be the regional offices of the patriotic union of kurdistan , or puk , a kurdish political movement allied with the united states it was not clear whether the attack was a suicide bombing , as was the case last week when an explosivesladen truck crashed into an italian police compound in nasiriya , killing at least 32 people jalal talabani , the puk leader , who currently holds the rotating presidency of the americanappointed iraqi governing council , was not in kirkuk at the time the attack came three days after a recorded message , said to be from saddam hussein , the deposed iraqi leader , urged iraqis to kill anyone cooperating with the americanled occupation forces on wednesday night , 2 iraqis were killed and 11 others were wounded in a car bombing in ramadi , northwest of baghdad , near the offices of a local governing council some of mr talabani s aides blamed ansar alislam , a militant islamic group that has been linked to al qaeda , for the bombing in kirkuk american bombs destroyed the group s base in northern iraq in march , but american forces have captured several suspected leaders of ansar alislam in recent weeks speaking in baghdad on thursday , brig gen martin e dempsey , commander of the first armored division , said bomb attacks on iraqi and foreign installations over the past three months might be the work of islamic militants or jihadists hired by loyalists to mr hussein while no definite link has been established , the general said , american investigators suspect that mr hussein s agents may be recruiting noniraqis to drive explosivefilled cars when they decide they 're going to commit a sensational attack , one in which they 're going to try to grab the headlines whether it s an alliance or simply a matter of convenience , we do n't know , the general added a highranking iraqi security official went further in an interview on thursday , saying he believed that at least some of the attacks on iraqi and foreign targets in iraq were the work of al qaeda the official , ibrahim jannabi , is the director of intelligence in the newly reconstituted interior ministry in baghdad he said that as the bush administration has maintained , mr hussein s intelligence service had developed contacts with the terrorist network in the past few years al qaeda and rogue officers of the former government may be using those contacts to organize attacks against western targets in iraq , he said mr jannabi also said that his investigators believed that the suicide bombing at the united nations headquarters here in august was planned either by al qaeda or by former iraqi intelligence agents with links to the terrorist group we have informed the coalition that we found four groups involved in the un bombing , mr jannabi said none of the groups knew about the other but there was a single coordinator i think the coordinator was al qaeda or those connected with al qaeda in iraq , in other words , saddam s intelligence service over the past two weeks , american troops have shifted to a more aggressive strategy to quell a persistent insurgency across the central and northern parts of iraq in the capital , general dempsey said , the first armored division has disrupted three cells made up of loyalists to the former iraqi government , capturing 104 people suspected of being insurgents , killing 14 and wounding 23 he said the cells carried out some of the mortar , bomb and rocket attacks that have rattled baghdad over the past two months since his forces shifted tactics and began using helicopter gunships and warplanes , general dempsey said , the number of such attacks has dropped by about 70 percent in their offensive , he added , american troops destroyed buildings where they suspected that insurgents were making bombs or firing mortars shells they also seized weapons , including 18 blocks of c4 plastic explosives , two surfacetoair missiles and 522 artillery and mortar rounds i want the enemy to know that although i'm on his home turf , he is not going to use that to his advantage , general dempsey said concentrated offensives were also launched against suspected guerrilla targets in the area north and west of baghdad , military officials said troops from the 101st airborne division , supported by helicopters , detained 158 people suspected of conducting or aiding attacks , and seized c4 plastic explosives , the officials said un to announce iraqi plans soon \( by the new york times \) united nations , nov 20 secretary general kofi annan told reporters on thursday that he planned to submit a report to the security council by the beginning of december detailing how he planned to continue united nations operations in iraq earlier this month , citing the worsening security situation , mr annan pulled all but about 40 foreign workers out of iraq american and british officials , while saying they are mindful of mr annan s need to protect his staff , have been prodding him to accelerate his staff s return mr annan also said he planned to appoint an envoy fairly shortly to oversee operations in iraq the envoy will be based in jordan or cyprus and will serve as the operational coordinator in the region , he said sometime later , he said , he would appoint a new special representative to iraq , a post last held by sergio vieira de mello , who was killed in a bombing in baghdad on aug 19 until the security improves , mr annan added , the united nations will probably run operations in iraq from outside the country with staff members shuttling across the border
why does the national football league persist in waiting until it is embarrassed in a super bowl or in a playoff game by its unfair overtime procedure \? why does it persist in allowing a coin toss to determine , in nearly 30 percent of overtime games , which team wins simply because it won the coin toss \? the coin toss does n't involve blocking or tackling it s either heads or tails at best the call by the visiting team s captain is based on superstition or a hunch force overtime after having played hard for 60 minutes , and if you 're lucky , you win the toss and take the kickoff with a chance to win the game right away if you 're unlucky and the other team scores on its first possession , you never even get the ball that almost happened sunday in the giantsjets overtime game , except that the giants' placekicker , brett conway , hooked a 39yard fieldgoal attempt wide left the jets punted , the giants punted , the giants blocked the jets' hurried 51yard fieldgoal attempt , then the giants won , 3128 , when conway kicked a 29yard field goal with four seconds remaining in the 15minute overtime though the jets lost the coin toss , they eventually got the ball twice but that should n't obscure the problem had conway s 39yard fieldgoal attempt sailed between the uprights , the jets would have never had the ball and would have never had a chance to score because they happened to have lost the coin toss because the giants , as the visiting team in their own stadium , called heads and it came up heads this is n't about the giants having won or the jets having lost it s also not about the silly college overtime system , in which the ball is placed at an opponent s 25yard line it s about fairness if the giants had lost the coin toss and the jets had won on their first possession , the cointoss procedure would have been just as unfair ever since the nfl adopted overtime in 1974 , some franchises have urged that each team should have at least one possession after the kansas city chiefs lost two overtime games last season , one when the new england patriots won the coin toss and marched to a 35yard field goal , the chiefs filed an official proposal saying that each team should have at least one possession the competition committee split , 4 to 4 , in its recommendation , and the owners' vote was seven short of the necessary 75 percent for adoption at the annual league meeting the count was 17 to 14 in favor with one abstention of the 355 overtime games since 1974 , only 16 have ended in ties in 100 of those 355 games , the team that won the coin toss also won on its first drive , meaning the team that lost the coin toss never had the ball that s 100 too many of the 17 postseason overtime games , 3 were won on a team s first possession after winning the coin toss that s three too many but none of those three games were under the demanding microscope of a super bowl or even a conference championship , when the losing team s outcry would be loudest with such an unfair overtime procedure , it s an unfair accident just waiting to happen the nfl persists in waiting as the playoff race shapes up with only 3 of last season s 12 postseason teams on track to get there again the indianapolis colts \( 71 \) , the tennessee titans \( 62 \) and the philadelphia eagles \( 53 \) on the bubble at 44 are the reigning super bowl champion tampa bay buccaneers , the giants and the green bay packers all but eliminated are the atlanta falcons \( 17 without quarterback michael vick \) , the defending american football conference champion oakland raiders \( 26 \) , the jets \( 26 \) and the pittsburgh steelers \( 26 \) the cleveland browns \( 35 \) and the san francisco 49ers \( 45 \) are struggling the raiders have fallen the furthest , especially with cornerback charles woodson having charged that the team is falling apart because coach bill callahan is too stubborn to accept suggestions if some of those suggestions were from al davis , callahan wo n't be coaching the raiders next season the surprise playoff contender is the dallas cowboys \( 62 \) , but coach bill parcells is about to learn the true measure of his team after sunday s home game against the buffalo bills \( 44 \) , the cowboys have successive tests at afc east leader new england \( where he coached a previous reclamation project \) at home against carolina \( 62 \) and miami \( 53 \) and at philadelphia if the eagles keep rolling , the wild card in the national football conference could well boil down to the giantscowboys game at texas stadium on dec 21 , if not to the giants' season finale with visiting carolina meanwhile , the kansas city chiefs \( 80 \) have a real chance to be the nfl s first 160 regularseason team the 1972 dolphins were 140 in the regular before stretching it to 170 with a victory in super bowl vii but no matter how the chiefs finish , they should campaign for another vote on their proposal to give each team at least one possession in overtime what s fair is fair
dangers lurk on all sides at locke high school in los angeles , where scores of students are battered , robbed or sexually victimized by classmates and intruders every year last spring , several students were injured in a riot , and in june the school district settled a lawsuit with a student who required eye surgery after he was beaten by bullies yet locke is not persistently dangerous , according to the definition adopted by california officials to comply with a federal law requiring educators to notify parents about dangerous schools for that matter , none of california s 8 , 000 schools are persistently dangerous under the federal no child left behind act , parents across the nation can transfer their students from dangerous to safer schools , but 44 states have set the legal threshold for persistently dangerous so high that no schools in those states fit the definition only six states identified a total of about 50 schools among the nation s 90 , 000 public schools as dangerous under the law new jersey , new york , nevada , oregon , pennsylvania and texas we know significant crime and violence continue in many schools around the country , said dr ronald stephens , executive director of the national school safety center , a nonprofit group established by order of president ronald reagan to monitor and prevent school crime so its been surprising to see states set the watermark for 'dangerous' so high that few schools are even listed the dangerous standard took effect at the start of the school term , which school safety experts are calling one of the bloodiest in years just this month , a 15yearold in cold spring , minn , killed a fellow student and wounded another swat officers shot and wounded a student wielding a pistol in a high school in spokane , wash three students were stabbed in a high school parking lot brawl in oakdale , calif a teenage intruder stabbed a 13yearold student at a high school in annapolis , md and a 16yearold boy died after a fight at a tucson school at least 14 students have been shot at bus stops and just outside schools since the fall term began , 5 of them fatally , according to reports gathered by kenneth s trump , a school safety consultant in cleveland normally the school year starts calmly and you see a spike in incidents in the spring , after kids have met each other and conflicts have developed , mr trump said but this year we 're seeing significant violence in the first weeks one reason may be that schools have fewer safety officers patrolling hallways , mr trump said , because many state governments have drastically cut money for school safety the concern of federal and state officials and congress over school safety , which was intense after the shootings at columbine high school near littleton , colo , in 1999 , has seemed to diminish as the war on terror has been pushed but on monday , representative marilyn musgrave , republican of colorado , will convene hearings of the house education and workforce committee in denver to investigate how state governments developed their regulations defining dangerous schools it s incredible that colorado has determined that there are no persistently dangerous schools , ms musgrave said we know there are dangerous schools in colorado , as there are in other states dave smith , a director at the colorado department of education , said a broad panel of educators and law enforcement officials had worked hard to draft the state s definition of persistently dangerous the colorado definition lists crime thresholds that schools of varying sizes must exceed for two years in a row to be labeled persistently dangerous for a school with 1 , 000 students it is 180 offenses , which can range from weapons or drug violations to felonies like assaults and homicide a school with 1 , 000 students could have 179 homicides every year and , without other offenses , still not qualify as dangerous that s technically correct , mr smith said , when told of the figure our problem was a total lack of guidance from the federal level they just said , 'define it as you like , and we 'll tell you whether we like it or not' ohio s definition is similar to those of many other states under its terms , a school with 1 , 000 students could experience four homicides and seize a weapon from students on 19 occasions each year without qualifying as persistently dangerous this has become a joke in ohio , said richard a decolibus , president of the cleveland teachers' union state education officials just wanted to protect the reputations of their schools , so they said , 'we 'll write the regulations so that no school could ever be considered dangerous' j c benton , a spokesman for the ohio department of education , said officials developed the state s criteria after a thorough process that included discussion among teachers' unions , law enforcement officials and others california officials tied their definition of persistently dangerous to the number of students expelled from a school in the school years 19992000 , 20002001 and 20012002 , students at locke high school experienced 33 assaults with a deadly weapon , 116 beatings , 66 robberies and 17 sex offenses but in the same years , only 11 students were referred for expulsion , far below the state s threshold of about 30 expulsions per year for a school its size critics accused the california department of education of writing the definition so no schools would qualify as dangerous but jerry w hardenburg , a sacramento consultant to the department who helped write the state s definition , said , there was no preconceived idea to formulate a criteria under which no school would be identified as persistently dangerous tim b buresh , the chief operating officer of the los angeles unified school district , said the federal law is not a tool that helps me keep kids safe he added we 're seeing kids shot , stabbed or shot at every single day , but the violence is happening mostly in the neighborhoods outside and not in the schools themselves this law ignores the larger context and presents a misleading picture of the violence bill modzeleski , an associate deputy under secretary of education , said the fact that few schools were identified as persistently dangerous had not undermined the law s intent i'm not willing to say that this law is not working , because we 've not given it a chance yet , mr modzeleski said photo despite many crimes on campus , few schools have been designated persistently dangerous these students in cold spring , minn , were at a memorial on wednesday after a school shooting left one dead \( photo by john doman st paul pioneer press \)
washington , nov 19 defense secretary donald h rumsfeld ordered an additional 15 , 000 reserve and national guard troops on wednesday to prepare for the possibility of yearlong duty in iraq or kuwait , rounding out a plan to rotate american forces in the region by next spring combined with alert warnings and deployment orders approved two weeks ago , mr rumsfeld s decision brings to 58 , 000 the total number of reserve and national guard troops who have been alerted for possible service in the persian gulf region early next year the latest orders , which had been expected , are part of the pentagon s overall plan to reduce the american force levels in iraq to 105 , 000 by next may from about 130 , 000 now we 're notifying the next wave of reservists who were included in the original rotation announcement , said lawrence di rita , the pentagon s chief spokesman he said that the notification began wednesday and that the list of units would not be made public until troops received official word reserve and national guard troops will play an increasingly important role in the next rotation by spring , reservists will represent about 37 percent of the total force in iraq , or 39 , 000 troops , compared with about 22 percent now , or 28 , 000 troops the big difference is that the reservists in iraq now are support personnel in the next rotation , there will be 15 , 000 troops from three national guard combat brigades the largescale mobilization of reservists , and the strains it places on their families and employers , has been a difficult issue for the pentagon , and military officials had sought to limit this next round of callups but because so many of the military s logistical units are in the reserve or national guard , the pentagon has had little choice but to tap more reservists , focusing on units and individuals that had not yet been mobilized since sept 11 , 2001 the 15 , 000 whose units are being alerted are army reserve and national guard troops to ease the army s burden , the pentagon in its callup two weeks ago alerted reservists from other services , like navy cargo handlers and air force truck drivers , to fill jobs usually assigned to army troops the large deployment of guard and reserve forces to iraq , and whether the lengthy mobilization will hurt retention , was a contentious theme at a hearing wednesday of the senate armed services committee their morale is good , they 're ready to fight , senator john mccain , republican of arizona , said of the guard and reserve forces but he expressed concerns that the iraq deployment might persuade some not to rejoin at the end of their current commitments , saying , they 're not ready to stay in at this kind of deployment schedule might as well be in the regular army les brownlee , the acting army secretary , told the senators that any problems in retaining troops for the guard and reserve had not yet shown up in statistics for the 2003 fiscal year but he noted that it might be too early to measure any effect i believe that we will not be able to get a good answer to that question until some three to six months after these units return , he said gen peter j schoomaker , the new army chief of staff , was pressed by the senators on whether the service needed more troops , and he said none of the commanders in iraq said they were short of fighters general schoomaker \( pronounced skoomaker \) surprised the senators by noting that the army currently was even larger than the level authorized by congress , owing to orders that prevent scheduled retirements and other moves during time of war or national emergency the united states army today has about 20 , 000 more people in it than we 're authorized , and that is a result of stoploss , stopmove' that we 've done on the active force , general schoomaker said senators also expressed deep concerns over shortages in the latest models of bulletproof vests and in armored humvees , and also raised questions about the timetable for upgrading helicopters in iraq with the newest equipment for warding off surfacetoair missiles these reports of a shortage of body armor , these reports of illequipped ground vehicles and air vehicles in terms of the armor , are just totally unacceptable , said senator john w warner , republican of virginia , the committee s chairman the panel was told that all troops in iraq , and not just those in frontline combat roles , will be issued the army s newest interceptor body armor by december but it could be 2005 before enough armored humvees are produced to fill the requirement in iraq , so the army is exploring alternatives , including strapping armor to soft skinned humvees and using vehicle fleets assigned to other commands we have moved all of the 'uparmored' humvees from everywhere else in the world into this place , general schoomaker said it s not just what we 're producing , it s what we 're moving from everywhere that we 've got the senators were told that chinook helicopters in iraq would be upgraded if they did not currently carry the army s most advanced antimissile systems , a process that takes about three weeks for each helicopter photo gen peter j schoomaker , the army chief of staff , spoke to the senate armed services committee yesterday about american troops in iraq \( photo by carol t powers for the new york times \)
washington , april 28 american forces in iraq have signed a ceasefire with an iranian opposition group the united states has designated a terrorist organization , and expect it to surrender soon with some of its arms , american military officials said today under the deal , signed on april 15 but confirmed by the united states central command only today , united states forces agreed not to damage any of the group s vehicles , equipment or any of its property in its camps in iraq , and not to commit any hostile act toward the iranian opposition forces covered by the agreement in return , the group , the people s mujahedeen , which will be allowed to keep its weapons for now , agreed not to fire on or commit other hostile acts against american forces , not to destroy private or government property , and to place its artillery and antiaircraft guns in nonthreatening positions the accord is apparently the first between the united states military which in early april was bombing the group s iraqi camps and a terrorist organization , and it raises questions about how consistently the bush administration intends to apply a policy that had vowed to crack down on terrorist groups worldwide the iranian group , which is led by a woman and has an estimated 10 , 000 members in iraq , has no known ties to al qaeda , but its members killed several american military personnel and civilian contractors in the 1970 s and supported the takeover of the american embassy in tehran in 1979 it has carried out dozens of bombings that were aimed at iranian military and government workers , but that also killed civilians it was added to the state department s list of terrorist organizations in 1997 page a18 an american military official said the group could provide intelligence regarding iranian government activities both in iraq , and in iran itself a spokesman for the central command , in doha , qatar , who was responding to a reporter s inquiry , issued a threesentence statement today that provided the basic outlines of the ceasefire a senior military officer said he expected the accord to be followed in the next few days by a formal capitulation agreement , and he indicated that the group would eventually have to give up some of its arms the accord with the people s mujahadeen reflects a pragmatic approach to a security problem for an american military that already has its hands full trying to stabilize baghdad and other areas of iraq but it raises the issue of how to square the accord with the administration s antiterrorism policy a state department official said tonight that the deal was not inconsistent with the broader effort against terrorism the official said the agreement with the group , which operated with support and protection from saddam hussein s government , would help the united states learn more about iraq s ties to terrorism and the nature of its former government you ca n't get information out of a dead man , the official said he said the decision to call a halt to american bombing and other attacks against the group did not reflect any change in its terrorist status it s a ceasefire , he said , that s all it means as recently as last week , senior pentagon officials described the group as a vicious entity that had served as a de facto security organization for the iraqi government at the same time , however , supporters of the people s mujahadeen , including dozens of members of congress , have portrayed the decision to label the group as terrorist as one that was taken by the clinton administration largely as a positive gesture to the iranian government , which regards the people s mujahadeen as a serious foe a senior american officer said several approaches , or courses of action were being considered by the united states government as to what to do about the group and its weapons over the long run asked why american commanders would sign a ceasefire with a terrorist organization , a central command spokesman , lt cmdr charles owens , said he had no further information he noted that the state department was responsible for decisions about the status of terrorist groups at a time when united states forces are stretched thin in iraq , the mujahadeen organization is one of the few groups of armed fighters that had been affiliated with the hussein government that is not a threat to american forces , they said american military officers in iraq said they expected that some of the group s weapons might be confiscated once the capitulation agreement was signed one motivation for allowing the people s mujahadeen to keep some weapons , they said , was to leave in place a balance of power between the group and the iranianbacked fighters known as the badr brigade some of those fighters are based in iraq and have continued to focus on the organization even since the fall of the hussein government if the mujahadeen group were disarmed , american forces would have to assume the responsibility of separating the two antagonists , a task the heavily burdened american forces do not want to assume muhammad mohaddessin , a top people s mujahadeen official , said in a telephone interview from paris that this ceasefire agreement gives us the right to keep our weapons in noncombat formations and the right to defend ourselves against attacks from iranianbacked forces none of the group s members had been taken into custody by american forces , mr mohaddessin said the statement issued by the central command said the ceasefire had been signed by a coalition forces commander and a mr mahdi baraie of the national liberation army of iran , the armed wing of the mujahadeen organization military officials declined to identify the coalition forces commander , but senior military officers said the agreement was being enforced in areas north of baghdad under the control of the army s v corps mr mohaddessin , the people s mujahadeen official , identified mr baraie as a senior official of the organization and a member of its army s general staff as recently as april 22 , the central command spokesman in doha , brig gen vincent k brooks , declined to say whether a ceasefire with the people s mujahadeen , known to the united states government as the mujahedeen khalq , or mek , had been signed we certainly know that the united states has maintained the mek , as we describe it , on the terrorist list , and they still are , general brooks said at the time so , until that changes , we view them that way however , there s still discussion that s ongoing right now to determine exactly what the condition and what the status will be and how we 'll handle them it s premature for me to describe exactly what that will be at this point the disclosure that a ceasefire had been signed on april 15 suggests statements by american officers lagged events on april 17 , general brooks said at a briefing in doha that work intended to secure some agreement that would be a ceasefire and capitulation would most likely unfold within the coming days a senior military officer said a formal capitulation from the group was likely to be taken in coming days by the army s fourth infantry division , which is conducting peace enforcement in tikrit and areas in northern iraq photo saraiha behzadi , a member of a combat unit of the people s mujahedeen , performing maintenance yesterday on

andy price was back home in minnesota on thursday night , eagerly watching his twins on television as they played the yankees in game 2 of their american league division series price , the director of game presentation for the twins , heard complaints from within the organization about the long ceremony after the top of the seventh inning in game 1 at yankee stadium on thursday night , he decided to time the yankees' seventhinning stretch , starting when the popular irish tenor ronan tynan was introduced until he finished god bless america and the players resumed warming up it came out to 6 minutes 20 seconds the twins stood at their positions , although pitcher brad radke , whose pinpoint control had kept yankees hitters in check , was not on the field when play resumed with the score tied , 11 , radke hit the first batter he faced then the roof fell in the yankees scored three times in the inning and won , 41 after the game , twins manager ron gardenhire complained that the delay might have hurt his team he s right as popular as tynan has become over the last two seasons since the world trade center attacks by singing god bless america , a sixminute delay is too long price said the twins would not play god bless america today during game 3 they play the song on sundays the twins use one verse of god bless america tynan sang a longer version after take me out to the ball game , and they finish up with god bless the usa , which they began playing after the sept 11 attacks our seventhinning stretch on sunday will be about 3 minutes and 20 seconds , maybe 3 30 , price said yesterday , as opposed to what we saw in games 1 and 2 at yankees stadium we do it , but we also try to pay heed that there is a baseball game going on the long break is n't all that conducive to the playing of baseball during the season , the yankees generally use a 40second recorded version their live postseason version of god bless america is beautiful and dramatic , but it s too long , even if it s only an extra three minutes as temperatures plunge and the stakes of postseason competition rise , the live rendition should be shortened sung before the game or shifted to the end of the sixth inning so the yankees can stand around before they resume playing defense if the approach affects the competition on the field , there has to be an adjustment shortly after the sept 11 attacks , major league baseball mandated that teams play god bless america during each game by now , the league s only requirement is that teams play god bless america on sundays none of the home teams this weekend have used god bless america as the yankees have the chicago cubs play it before the game , before the national anthem they spend all their energy for the seventhinning stretch with a production that includes guest conductors but the players are free to warm up the florida marlins play god bless america on sundays and holidays the boston red sox will play god bless america tonight , but during the regular season they play it only on sundays and certain holidays one marlins official said that during the 2002 season , a number of pitching coaches complained that the delay for god bless america interrupted the flow of the game and cut into warmup time in the wake of gardenhire s complaint , baseball should ensure that no ceremony puts the visiting team at a disadvantage a sixminute break does exactly that defense in baseball is crucial there is no easy way to atone for blunders the defense cannot force turnovers and convert steals , fumbles or interceptions into points runs are like gold if the pitcher tightens up , a subsequent mistake could be the difference in a game the home team , not the visitors , should be at risk a sixminute break at night in the fall in new york is too long if the yankees do n't adjust , baseball should intervene , especially because the yankees will probably be alive in the postseason for a while minnesota missed an opportunity thursday to put the yankees in a hole they would have been hard pressed to climb out of with the red sox about to collapse , the yankees suddenly have a very doable path to the world series there is deep and understandable sentiment surrounding the yankees' treatment of god bless america the twin towers are gone , and thousands of lives were lost and families turned inside out with grief if a tribute is a little long , so be it just do n't put an opposing team at a disadvantage shorten the rendition or use it before the start of the seventh inning the national anthem was first sung at baseball games in 1918 , during world war i , a historian at the national baseball hall of fame said it was n't regularly sung again until 1942 , during world war ii since then , the national anthem has been a staple at athletic events , though before the start of the games god bless america may yet become a staple , too , but it should n't be a thorn photo twins starter brad radke left the game thursday night not long after the break for the seventhinning stretch \( photo by g paul burnett the new york times \)
when sandra johnson , his fianc e , complained of stomach pain last july , dean meminger grabbed johnson and hailed a cab outside their upper east side apartment he was not sure why maybe it was the cancerous tumor she had had removed in may but meminger had a bad feeling as they were being driven to lenox hill hospital his concerns were merited a perforated ulcer had caused an infection in johnson s organs worse , prior to surgery , she had a heart attack while on the operating table dr mitchell chorost , the head of the hospital s oncology department , walked grimly into the waiting area afterward she s on life support , chorost told meminger , the former knicks guard we 've done our best if she does n't recover in 72 hours , she s going to go this was supposed to be a minor operation , meminger thought now the woman he was going to marry might die \? he broke down in tears and called earl monroe , his former teammate and close friend monroe went to the hospital and sat with him , waiting , praying it was three decades since the carousing early 1970 s , when the city and the knicks' bachelorladen basketball team bonded over two championships gone , too , were jobs that did not pan out for meminger after he retired , the defunct leagues , the reneged contracts , the dismissals the disillusionment after his playing career ended in 1977 along with the prolonged cocaine use and a daily struggle for sobriety did not matter , either the woman who had saved him from his addiction could be gone in less than three days the woman he sometimes awakened at 4 am because , as she said , he wanted to philosophize , who listened to his tales about the old rucker playground days and manhattan nights as if she were hearing them for the first time at 55 , meminger , whose existence teetered somewhere between uptempo and frenzied , decided to stop running he just waited there for her to wake up , chorost recalled dean the dream , they had called him he was new york s schoolboy basketball king before anyone had heard of kenny anderson , stephon marbury or felipe lopez he went off to marquette , where he became an allamerican point guard , and he returned as a firstround draft pick , plucked 16th in 1971 by his beloved knickerbockers every team he played on won and won and won from rice high school in harlem to marquette to the national basketball association stoopshouldered , maybe 6 feet 1 inch , meminger skittered more than he ran , his elongated arms pushing the ball upcourt in a blur he coupled a stopandpop playground game with a menacing , moveyourfeet defense that had been drilled into him in parochial school cagey , clever , he could dribble faster than tiny archibald from end line to end line al mcguire , his college coach , once said meminger was quicker than 11 15 mass at a seaside resort the defining moment of meminger s career came in game 7 of the 1973 eastern conference finals at boston garden he locked down a flammable jo jo white , who had been scoring easily , just as the knicks were about to surrender a threegamestoone lead in the series meminger and walt frazier led the knicks to victory over a celtics franchise that had never lost a game 7 dean went out and shut jo jo down and we won that game , phil jackson recalled it was a signature performance in our history jackson , now the coach of the los angeles lakers , paused over the telephone before his team began practice last week , musing about meminger i know dean ran into some difficulties after playing , he said i have n't seen him in a couple of years what s going on with him now anyway \? back in basketball wearing a tweed jacket and a patterned silk tie , meminger emerged from the court on a recent saturday afternoon his manhattanville valiants had just quelled a late rally by the college of mount st vincent in a bandbox in riverdale built three years after the titanic sank some manhattanville parents had whispered in the stands , how did that old knick end up coaching their son at a small liberal arts college 30 miles north of manhattan \? monroe s longtime companion , marita green , works in the office of development at manhattanville when monroe declined to be interviewed for the job , he recommended meminger earl said , 'it would be good for the school and it would be good for dean , ' manhattanville s president , richard a berman , said in a telephone interview i agreed the valiants \( 43 \) have won four straight games and are unbeaten in the skyline conference they run and move the ball and rarely give up the baseline , just like their coach the job does not carry a big salary , and meminger , who does not have a car , takes the commuter train to practice but the game beckoned again , and that is something when your signature coaching moment was more than 20 years ago in the women s professional basketball league , during the 197980 season , meminger guided the new york stars to the league s championship and was named coach of the year but then the team folded , followed by the league the next year people reneged on contracts , and the nba never came calling there were other leagues and other lowpaying jobs , but none lasted
plano , tex , nov 25 after recording one save last season , taylor hooton expected to join the starting rotation next spring for the baseball team at plano west senior high school you could count on the kid to throw strikes , said billy ajello , taylor s best friend and a catcher at plano west , which is located amid the affluent sprawl north of dallas by all accounts , taylor was popular and ebullient he was a cousin of burt hooton , the former major league pitcher , and his brother pitched in college next spring , he would make his own mark during his senior season but on july 15 , a month past his 17th birthday , taylor hooton killed himself the authorities ruled the death a suicide by hanging his parents and a doctor familiar with the case said they believe that taylor s death was related to depression that he felt upon discontinuing the use of anabolic steroids the sense of euphoria and aggression that accompany the use of steroids can be replaced by lethargy , loss of confidence , melancholy and hopelessness when a person stops using performanceenhancing drugs , doctors said it s a pretty strong case that he was withdrawing from steroids and his suicide was directly related to that , said dr larry w gibbons , president and medical director of the cooper aerobics center , a leading preventive medicine clinic in dallas this is a kid who was well liked , had a lot good friends , no serious emotional problems he had a bright future taylor hooton s example is extreme , but the use of steroids by athletes and nonathletes in high school is considered even more troubling than the use of them by elite athletes who are involved in widely publicized scandals in sports like football , baseball and track and field , a number of doctors said while there are relatively few professional athletes , some doctors estimate that 500 , 000 to one million high school students , or more , use steroids adolescents are also more susceptible to some physiological dangers , including premature cessation of bone growth , which can limit a person s height , doctors said by nature , teenagers are risk takers , and they are less likely to understand the health risks or to be concerned with potential side effects like infertility , atrophied testicles , high blood pressure , liver damage and prostate cancer , some of which may not appear for 20 or 30 years , doctors said i'm worried about kids , said dr donald a malone , a psychiatrist at the cleveland clinic , who wrote a 1995 study indicating an association between depression and steroid use elite athletes know the side effects , and they can afford to pay for the real stuff kids do n't have the knowledge , and they 're buying it from some clown selling it at school who knows what they 're getting \? high school students take musclebuilding steroids to enhance athletic performance , improve selfconfidence and become more attractive to the opposite sex , athletes and doctors say young athletes say they are influenced by their professional role models who use illicit substances parents are often clueless about signs of steroid use and some parents even encourage it in a misguided attempt to promote their children s careers , doctors said , while many coaches are also uninformed or seem to turn a blind eye four percent of high school seniors said in 2002 that had used steroids , according to a survey by the university of michigan other surveys indicate that 3 percent to 11 percent of high school students said they had used steroids a survey by the national collegiate athletic association indicated that nearly half of college athletes who admitted using steroids had begun in high school as many as 3 percent of eighth graders said they had used steroids , according to the michigan survey while we focus on the elite athletes that are headline grabbers , the underbelly of all this is a much more serious problem , dr gary i wadler , a professor of medicine at new york university , said parents and students are rarely willing to speak about steroid use in high school but don hooton , taylor s father , and ajello , taylor s close friend , have begun holding seminars and granting interviews , believing that parents , administrators and coaches need to become better educated and need to confront the issue more forcefully , so that another tragedy may be prevented do n't tell me it s not a problem , don hooton , a director of worldwide marketing for hewlettpackard , said my kid just died symptoms overlooked those who knew taylor hooton described him as a young man who smiled often , was popular with girls and had many friends from different backgrounds he was very popular , blake boydston , the baseball coach at plano west , said he always came to the field in good spirits when he spoke , it was , 'thank you no , sir yes , sir' ajello said that taylor was also a teenager who colored his hair and looked twice when he passed a mirror during a chemistry class in the fall of 2002 , taylor mentioned that he might begin using steroids , ajello said when ajello asked why , he said taylor replied i'm not doing it for baseball i'm doing it for myself
baton rouge , la , dec 23 my parents were at tiger stadium on halloween in 1959 , the night billy cannon made his punt return and became everybody s allamerican my mother won season tickets at a dairy queen raffle in the cajun town of eunice she and my father sat apart that evening to accommodate friends , and my father ended up a row or two in front of cannon s wife , dorothy the mythical national champion in 1958 , louisiana state was ranked no 1 late in october 1959 , and mississippi was no 2 the tigers trailed the rebels , 30 , in the fourth quarter when cannon returned a punt 89 yards for a touchdown his wife became so excited , my father said , that she removed her earrings and tossed them into the crowd i had n't heard that one before , billy cannon said i hope they were n't good ones with 18 seconds remaining , cannon assisted on a goalline tackle , sealing a 73 victory for lsu and the heisman trophy for himself nearly a halfcentury later , as the tigers chase another national title , against oklahoma on jan 4 in the sugar bowl in new orleans , cannon remains the standard by which every lsu football player is measured he was the star of the title team of 1958 he remains the university s only heisman winner and the lone lsu football player to have his jersey retired some people named their children after him when cannon s second daughter was born while he was still in school , a diaper bearing his no 20 was hoisted on a flag pole at tiger stadium he married his high school sweetheart and , during 11 years in the american football league , became football s first 100 , 000 player he returned to school during each offseason , became an orthodontist and was known for providing braces free to those who could not afford them then his legend grew complicated in 1983 , snared on a wiretap , cannon pleaded guilty to participating in a 6 million counterfeiting scheme and spent nearly three years in prison the college football hall of fame has shunned him to some , he remains a reminder of the old louisiana and its stereotypes of florid chicanery yet lsu and the people of louisiana seem to have largely forgiven him and have embraced him in the fall , cannon was introduced at tiger stadium on homecoming weekend and was given a standing ovation for the past seven years , he has directed the dental clinic at the state penitentiary at angola the warden has credited him with significantly upgrading the care of inmates in a sense , his life has followed an arc of great success , ignominy and rehabilitation that parallels the man who presented him the heisman trophy , richard m nixon billy is a study in contrast , said rand miller , the former assistant united states attorney in baton rouge who prosecuted cannon if you 're looking to put him in a small box , he ai n't going to fit at 66 , his brush cut having grown thin and white , billy cannon still exudes brawny strength he is funny , selfdeprecating and wary of reporters he gives few interviews he is engaging , but he also keeps people at a distance , as if protectively striking the arm slength pose of the heisman trophy to a certain generation here , though , he is regarded with an adulation from another time all across the state , people can tell you where they were and what they were doing when he returned that punt yearly , during the week of the lsuole miss game , his run is replayed on radio and on television , providing blackandwhite reaffirmation of his greatness we stopped the clock , cannon said on that humid evening in 1959 , lsu trailed by a field goal when quarterback jake gibbs , who later became a catcher for the yankees , punted for ole miss in the fourth quarter he intended to kick the ball out of bounds , but it bounced high at the 11yard line and into cannon s arms seven ole miss players hit cannon , but none could bring him down he was a magnificent athlete , a 6foot1 , 225pounder who ran 100 yards in 94 seconds , threw the shotput 54 feet and benchpressed 435 pounds by midfield , gibbs had lunged futilely , and nothing but grass separated cannon from the end zone i 've never seen that combination of speed and strength in anyone else , including bo jackson , said boots garland , a former longtime track coach at lsu a quartercentury later , when gibbs coached baseball at ole miss , lsu fans carried boombox radios to a game in baton rouge and serenaded him with replays of cannon s run every time the manager approached the mound catch him , jake ! one fan shouted repeatedly he said people have taken him into the stadium and given him money to take a picture on the spot where he missed billy , said skip bertman , who was then lsu s baseball coach and is now the athletic director honest to god that cannon s trickortreat punt return persists as louisiana s greatest sports moment says much about lsu and the state itself no other louisiana university dilutes lsu s athletic appeal in a religiously and ethnically diverse state , lsu football unites the catholic southern parishes and the baptist north and in a state that lags behind others in such areas as education , lsu football provides confirmation that louisiana measures up
washington , sept 26 president bush welcomed president vladimir v putin of russia to camp david today for another meeting intended to show the two as problemsolvers who work best in informal settings , even as they appear still divided on iraq and on russia s continued insistence that its sales of nuclear technology to iran are benign the meeting came during a week when the international atomic energy agency has found new evidence that iran is enriching uranium mr putin , who expressed doubts two years ago that iran was seeking nuclear weapons , has begun to concede that tehran may be doing exactly that even while denying that russian technology is contributing to the effort for two years now , mr bush has been raising the issue , and for two years white house officials have insisted that they are making progress , without much noticeable change in the russian position mr bush , asked about iran s nuclear ambitions on thursday , told reporters , you bet i 'll talk to president putin about it this weekend the iranian nuclear question has become an important symbolic and substantive test of the results of the relationship since their first meeting , when mr bush declared that he had looked into mr putin s soul and found a man he could trust since then , there have been a series of meetings designed to nurture that unlikely relationship , from formal sessions at the kremlin and in st petersburg to informal ones at a dacha outside moscow , at mr bush s ranch in texas , and now at camp david the administration officials do not actively argue with the notion that the relationship has been longer on bonhomie than on solid results iraq marked a significant division between mr bush and mr putin russia joined france and germany in opposing a resolution authorizing the use of force asked about the issue a few days ago , mr putin said that he did not regret his position , adding that the situation that is developing in iraq is the best confirmation that russia was right on thursday , speaking at the united nations , he called for the organization to take the lead role in iraq now , another position that puts him at odds with mr bush mr bush s aides say that while these differences are important , none of them have affected the broader relationship we are trying to push some specifics through , and get moving , and accelerate the course of work , a senior administration official said today but the official acknowledged that the going has been slow , because you have a russian bureaucracy that does n't buy into the putin vision , and an elite that understands he has to turn west , and that the dangers to russia are to the south and the east , meaning iran , north korea , and perhaps china mr bush faces another delicate issue this weekend how to deal with the continued russian military crackdown in chechnya , with the regular reports of humanrights abuses , and growing evidence that mr putin s government is repressing dissent , closing the last independent national television network and using the power of his government to put down all political challenges white house officials appear at a loss about how to respond to those actions , despite growing pressure to do so mr bush s criticisms of mr putin have been largely tepid , leaving midlevel officials to issue stronger statements that lack the weight of presidential declarations
embarrassed columbia university officials admitted yesterday that some of the local community students chosen for its new private elementary school had not been selected by the lottery systems columbia had promised to use the school at columbia , as it is named , chose 100 students by lottery from among 1 , 700 applicants from the community and created a short waiting list but in september the school accepted four students not chosen by lottery , after watching the number of community students planning to enroll dwindle to 91 the discrepancy was discovered two weeks ago by state assemblyman daniel j o 'donnell , a democrat who represents the area around columbia he said yesterday that some residents had told him about the students , and that he , in turn , protested to columbia it is a very serious violation of their word , said mr o 'donnell , who accused columbia of lying about the school and called on the president to investigate the admissions process the school was a real opportunity for columbia university to dispel the notion in my community that they are never honest , he said to that end , columbia has failed university officials said that none of the four students were connected to anyone with influence at columbia , and that all four were receiving financial aid they looked just like the other children from the community , said the school s headmaster , gardner p dunnan it is not as though we went out and selected in some unfair way children who would be different from the other children we took nonetheless , columbia s president , lee c bollinger , said in an interview yesterday that the admissions were problematic the admission of the extra children was for a good purpose , to try to meet our promise to the community that half of our students will be from the community , he said but the process was woefully deficient the way we want to deal with this , he added , is to go back to the community and discuss this with them emily lloyd , columbia s executive vice president for government and community affairs , who was the first columbia official assemblyman o 'donnell tried to reach , talked with several community leaders yesterday they were only partly mollified i'm angry , said eric m nelson , one of the participants in the meeting , who was chairman of community board 7 when columbia was seeking variances to build the school , and who is now a member of the board s steering committee this is not about us being at war with columbia , but about being upset and angry that their commitments are called into question and that we ca n't take what they say as true my board now has to explain to the lottery applicants who were not admitted why there are four children who never applied at all through the lottery who are attending the school , mr nelson said referring to the headmaster , mr nelson said , in a single stroke , dunnan has completely undermined all of our efforts to assure fairness the private school , which columbia opened last month , was originally developed as a tool to help it recruit faculty members with young children but under pressure from community critics , who said columbia should be working to improve the public schools rather than creating a private school , the university agreed to give half the seats to students from the community and to provide the financial aid necessary for them to attend mr dunnan said he had intended the extra admissions as a creative lastminute solution to the problem of having fewer community students than planned , and as a solution that fell within the agreement that columbia had made with the community , and that would also help the community
a new study maintains that the government is poorly structured to assess possible environmental hazards posed by genetically modified fish the study , being issued today by the pew initiative on food and biotechnology , a nonprofit group , comes as the food and drug administration is considering whether to approve a salmon genetically engineered to grow twice as fast as regular salmon the study notes that oversight of the fledgling field is left largely to the fda , which regulates such fish under the rules covering drugs for animals but the study says that those rules may not allow the agency to consider fully the environmental risks of such fish and that even if it can , it lacks the expertise regulators will increasingly have to stretch their authority to make old laws and regulations address the evolving next wave of products , michael rodemeyer , executive director of the pew initiative , said in a statement we seem to be treading in uncharted legal waters while some genetically engineered fish are being grown experimentally , none have been approved for use as food but the fda is considering an application from aqua bounty farms , a company in waltham , mass , for the fastgrowing salmon the pew initiative , based in washington and backed by the pew charitable trusts , says it is not against genetic engineering but wants to promote public discussion about biotechnology and its regulation indeed , the report said there could be benefits from genetically engineered fish fastergrowing fish could make fish farming more productive efforts are also under way to get fish to produce human drugs like a blood clotting factor , to make fish diseaseresistant and to make shellfish that will not provoke allergic reactions but there could also be hazards , the report notes some studies suggest that if the engineered fish escape from pens they could outcompete wild fish for mates or food , endangering wild populations another question is whether the genetic engineering affects the rate at which a fish accumulates toxins like mercury from the environment the report , based on a review of legal and scientific literature and interviews with experts , says the fda s effort to regulate genetically modified fish as drugs might not withstand a legal challenge yet another problem with the arrangement , it said , is that drug applications are kept confidential , denying the public a chance to comment such secrecy , the report said , could undermine public confidence in the regulatory system many of these concerns have been voiced in the past by opponents of genetically modified food and by the national research council in a report issued last year dr stephen sundlof , director of the center for veterinary medicine at the fda , said the agency believed its regulations were adequate we 've required environmental assessments on animal drugs as long as i can remember and they are substantial , dr sundlof said he added that the fda could also seek input from other agencies , like the fish and wildlife service joseph b mcgonigle , vice president of aqua bounty farms , said the argument by pew that the fda s authority might not withstand a legal challenge was a debating exercise because no company would mount such a challenge in the real world , mr mcgonigle said , i do n't see a commercial company benefiting in any way from challenging the fda and taking on the publicity damage with their customers he also said that the company had commissioned harvard scientists to do an environmental assessment of the company s plans and that it would eventually make that report public
bamboleo , a swank , semihiplooking restaurant in glastonbury , is not only nuevo latino but nuevo generic some of the architecture is bold and striking , but it does n't hold together well , as if someone visited a couple of dozen model restaurants elsewhere in the country but could n't synthesize all the information tables are of orange and blue glass tile , and a room divider is of similar material a plain glass divider separates the bar from the dining room \( but does n't prevent either smoke or noise from wafting over it \) and there are some lovely elongated semiconical light fixtures but the overall look , to my eye , is marred by the huge stone columns and the fact that none of this or any of the other strong design elements really marry the food has a similar plight the menu is interesting and intriguing , but the execution could be way better in fact , if all of the dishes lived up to the promise displayed by the best of them , this would be a destination worth a trip as it stands , there are better restaurants of this genre elsewhere in the state after several visits to bamboleo you could probably devise a strategy that focused on the strengths of the menu and ignored the weaknesses , but there are simply too many dishes that do n't work several appetizers that should have been hot including a threesome of grilled meats on skewers came out of the kitchen at room temperature the second time this happened once , of course , is forgivable i asked about it and was told that they were just grilled briefly and that the sauces were cold \( one of the sauces might be best described as ketchup , though moderately adulterated \) i took grilled briefly to mean cooked in advance and inadequately reheated and wondered why the meats could n't be grilled at the last minute and the sauces held at room temperature a pork taco was a couple of notches up from fastfood , but not more than that my guess is that it was flavored with liquid smoke better was some shredded chicken on an arepa , the south american corncake that is done well almost everywhere , and exceptionally well here in fact , a side of arepas turned out to be the highlight of one of my meals and was one of the most encouraging things about the place if you are in the neighborhood , have a dish of these and a mojito proceed from there the arepa shows up again as a base for the stunningly prepared short ribs , which are boldly but not overpoweringly seasoned , meltingly tender and crispcrusted these would be a showcase dish at any restaurant further indication that someone in the kitchen knows what he or she is doing is the hanger steak , served with wild mushrooms , along with a potato gratin that blew the mind of everyone who tasted it a sort of brazilian bouillabaisse with swordfish , shrimp , clams and squid in coconut milk with rice was creamy , rich and nicely done pork shank actually cured pork shank , better known as ham hock with a sweet glaze worked well thanks to the addition of bitter greens and a few clams but sea bass not true sea bass , but the chilean kind being sold as such was dull and served with a undistinguished sauce the plantaincrusted swordfish was way overcooked and not helped by another uninspired sauce of according to the menu bananas and tamarind had i not referred back to the menu , i would not have had a clue rather than going on and on , it is safe to summarize that the kitchen handles meat better than it does fish , not something that you want to hear about a panlatinamerican restaurant in keeping with this statement , i will point out that by far the tastiest ceviche i tried here was made of mushrooms what makes this a ceviche , usually defined as marinated fish , is anyone s guess , but it was delicious there are other good points the freshly made root vegetable chips brought to the table upon arrival are incredible like the arepas , they would make a good snack the wine list , with an emphasis on iberian wines , is superb and fairly priced \( i realize i'm making a case for treating bamboleo as a bar with better than average food , and it could be that , but that is not my intention the friday night bar scene , however , is pretty intense , so clearly i am not the first person to think this way \) service , despite its informality , is far better than average in fact , some tonier restaurants could take a lesson from bamboleo , where all the staff including , it would seem , the kitchen help pitches in to deliver and clear plates with precision and energy desserts , though variable , are on the whole more consistent and more appealing than the main courses both the vanilla and pumpkin flans drove my guests wild , and the chocolate pots de cr me were old fashioned and nearly perfect would that the whole menu measured up to these and the other high standards bamboleo 2935 main street , glastonbury \( 860 \) 6579251 good atmosphere informal but stylish bright ,

washington , april 11 medicare is a fiscal time bomb , unsustainable over the long haul and badly in need of major structural changes to save it that , at least , is what republicans are arguing as they begin yet another effort to pass medicare legislation , a central element of president bush s domestic agenda the bush administration has set the bar very high this year , demanding that congress pass not just a new prescription drug benefit , a feat hard enough , but also sweeping changes in medicare to get more private health plans involved the quest for that kind of structural change is fraught with political danger many democrats assert that it would amount to privatizing a fundamentally sound and popular program and eventually throwing millions of elderly people onto the mercies of the private insurance industry administration officials are acutely aware of the political risk they know that many members of congress , an exceedingly riskaverse crowd , would rather just pass a prescription drug benefit and be done with it by the 2004 elections many members have , after all , promised a drug benefit for six years moreover , for all the promise of choice in the new medicare marketplace envisioned by mr bush , such a plan is easy to demonize health maintenance organizations do not rank high in the public s esteem but republican leaders , inside the administration and on capitol hill , are beginning to make the case that maintaining the status quo in medicare is not an option steps must be taken , said representative bill thomas , chairman of the house ways and means committee , to ensure the sustainability of medicare over the long haul mr thomas made his comments at a hearing last week that featured the heads of the congressional budget office and the general accounting office , both warning of longterm fiscal and demographic strains on the medicare program as this committee well knows , medicare is projected to consume an everlarger piece of our national income just in delivering its current set of benefits , said douglas holtzeakin , director of the budget office under current law , medicare spending , measured as a share of the economy , is projected to nearly quadruple by 2075 , growing to more than 9 percent of gross domestic product , from its current level of 25 percent citing a recent report by the medicare trustees , david m walker , who as comptroller general heads the accounting office , noted , medicare in its current condition , with no prescription drug benefit , already faces a huge projected financial imbalance that has worsened significantly in the past year but there are few absolute truths in the medicare debate that are unaffected by partisanship democrats maintain that medicare is in better fiscal shape today than it has been for much of the recent past more to the point , they assert that the republicans' solution relying on competition among private health plans to hold down costs is unlikely to work any better than it has in the private sector , where health care costs are also rising rapidly democrats argue that the republicans are operating out of ideology rather than pragmatic concern for the health of one of the last pillars of the great society privatizing medicare is the sun , the moon and the stars for them , said representative sherrod brown of ohio , a democrat active on issues involving the elderly it s iraq , domestically , for them just as perle and wolfowitz wanted to go after iraq for 10 years , the far right , the insurance industry , the drug industry , have wanted to privatize medicare for 20 years none of this bodes well for the prospects of a major medicare overhaul this year house republicans are hoping to pass a bill before the memorial day recess , but how far it will go beyond adding prescription drug benefits is not clear senate leaders are considered more ambitious , but given that the republican majority is so narrow , it is not clear how realistic those ambitions are either as robert d reischauer , former budget office director and now president of the urban institute , argues , medicare spending is rising rapidly for the same reasons that health care spending is rising rapidly among the population at large new technology , the general aging of the population , the greater use of medical services there are few fixes that are very palatable politically even a president coming off a wartime surge in popularity may have trouble breaking the deadlock
shirley less than 70 miles from new york city , where pigeons are widely regarded as feathered rats , fanciers gather to haggle over the price of thoroughbred racing pigeons every week , on wednesday nights and sunday afternoons , as many as 60 people crowd into the back room of the pigeon store at 60 northern boulevard in shirley to discuss breeds , eat doughnuts and occasionally buy a bird pigeons are a big deal around here , said joan schroeder , who works at the store and breeds her own birds i nearly could n't squeeze into the auction room last week there were so many people auctions are also held at the pigeon store s second location , in lindenhurst on long island , an estimated 2 , 500 pigeon owners breed , fly and race more than 300 types of birds the nassausuffolk pigeon fanciers club , which has about 100 members , holds three shows and a swap event each year at the holtsville ecology center its biggest event , to be held on nov 15 this year , showcases about 2 , 000 birds , none of which would be found on a city street corner the general public will always assume the pigeons we breed are the same as the ones they see in the park , said deone roberts , the spokeswoman for the american racing pigeon union in oklahoma city , a national organization that promotes pigeon racing but that s like comparing a thoroughbred to a plow horse , or a champion show dog to a street mutt there are some 1 , 000 pigeon clubs in the united states with membership ranging into the tens of thousands , the racing union estimates although no organization keeps track of the exact number of clubs , fanciers with decades of experience estimated that there are 12 to 15 on long island alone some towns on the island require licenses for pigeon lofts , but fanciers said that that stipulation was honored mostly in the breach as with horses , the variety of pigeon breeds seems endless , but at the pigeon store s auctions , homing pigeons birds capable of returning to their home lofts from after journeys of thousands of miles constitute the largest number of sales then there are the tipplers , or birds that can stay aloft for more than 15 hours fancy birds , the result of crossing different breeds to create rare and elegant strains and rollers , or pigeons that tumble as if shot in midair , only to spring back to life and surge skyward at a recent auction , iridescent green and gray homing pigeons fluttered nervously in their cages as bigband music filtered through overhead speakers , a handful of men , mostly elderly and white , appraised the birds , preparing to stock up for the fall racing season , which runs from labor day to early november some unsentimental fanciers even buy large homing squabs for the dinner table the average price for a racing pigeon is about 5 , but the cost of a bird with a champion lineage can rise into the hundreds , if not thousands on the day before a race , which may range from 100 to 800 miles , fanciers gather at their local club with the birds they plan to register they load the birds onto the club s trailer for the trip to the race s starting point , called the liberation site for long island fanciers , the sites are usually somewhere in pennsylvania , ohio or new jersey , depending on the race mileage at dawn the next morning , club representatives release the birds and watch as they wing their way eastward the bird that flies at the fastest average speed , measured in yards per minute using global positioning data , from the liberation site back to its home loft , is the winner most of the birds fly at speeds of 35 to 60 miles per hour , depending on the wind direction and velocity racing pigeons are little athletes , said ms roberts , the racing union spokeswoman they 're racehorses with wings some fanciers have equipped their lofts with hightech clocks and electronic landing pads that read transmitters on their birds' leg bands and automatically clock them in the owners then take a printout of the times to the club sponsoring the race traditionbound fanciers do all this by hand they wait for their birds with string paddles , or poling sticks , which resemble lacrosse sticks and are used to capture the birds when they arrive the owners remove the leg bands and put them in capsules , which are placed in the slot of a timestamp clock when the fancier turns a crank , a capsule is stamped with the arrival time capsules are held in the clock s innards until the clock is opened at race headquarters but sometimes the birds do n't come back at all predators , power lines , storms and strong winds all take their toll you hate to lose them , but you ca n't beat nature , said val matteucci of hicksville , a fancier for 40 years and the secretarytreasurer of the international federation of american homing pigeon fanciers , organized in 1881 if they stop in a tree or hit a wire and fall to the ground , they can become prey very easily humans have used homing pigeons for more than 5 , 000 years to send messages over great distances the united states army used tens of thousands of birds in both world wars and in the korean war when radio silence was necessary or when communications had been disabled now pigeons are used by the military as a doublecheck on chemicalweapons sensors , much as canaries were once used by miners scientists still do n't know how homing pigeons find their way , but they believe that the birds pick up cues from the position of the sun and from geomagnetic fields in europe , pigeon races often carry sixfigure cash prizes , and each year , the million dollar pigeon race is held in south africa in the united states most fanciers compete only for diplomas and trophies , although the snowbird classic , which is sponsored by the fernando valley club of sun valley , calif , is expected to offer 100 , 000 in prize money for the first 10 finishers the race will next be run on nov 20 , 2004 gary , a fancier from mastic beach who insisted that his last name not be printed because he did not have a license for his 350bird loft , said that feeding pigeons has some fringe benefits their droppings are the best fertilizer , he said you scrape it up and throw it in the garden in a few days , it pushes up tomatoes like forget about it photos john leone , far left , checks in for an east meadow pigeon club race there are an estimated 2 , 500 pigeon fanciers and 12 to 15 clubs on the island for the east meadow club s 300mile race last month , pigeons were transported in crates to the starting point in

nashville why do n't people vote their own selfinterest \? every few years the republicans propose a tax cut , and every few years the democrats pull out their income distribution charts to show that much of the benefits of the republican plan go to the richest 1 percent of americans or thereabouts and yet every few years a republican plan wends its way through the legislative process and , with some trims and amendments , passes the democrats could n't even persuade people to oppose the repeal of the estate tax , which is explicitly for the megaupper class al gore , who ran a populist campaign , could n't even win the votes of white males who did n't go to college , whose incomes have stagnated over the past decades and who were the explicit targets of his campaign why do n't more americans want to distribute more wealth down to people like themselves \? well , as the academics would say , it s overdetermined there are several reasons people vote their aspirations the most telling polling result from the 2000 election was from a time magazine survey that asked people if they are in the top 1 percent of earners nineteen percent of americans say they are in the richest 1 percent and a further 20 percent expect to be someday so right away you have 39 percent of americans who thought that when mr gore savaged a plan that favored the top 1 percent , he was taking a direct shot at them it s not hard to see why they think this way americans live in a culture of abundance they have always had a sense that great opportunities lie just over the horizon , in the next valley , with the next job or the next big thing none of us is really poor we 're just prerich americans read magazines for people more affluent than they are \( w , cigar aficionado , the new yorker , robb report , town and country \) because they think that someday they could be that guy with the tastefully appointed horse farm democratic politicians proposing to take from the rich are just bashing the dreams of our imminent selves income resentment is not a strong emotion in much of america if you earn 125 , 000 a year and live in manhattan , certainly , you are surrounded by things you cannot afford you have to walk by those buildings on central park west with the 2 , 500squarefoot apartments that are empty threequarters of the year because their evil owners are mostly living at their other houses in la but if you are a middleclass person in most of america , you are not brought into incessant contact with things you ca n't afford there are n't lexus dealerships on every corner there are no snooty restaurants with water sommeliers to help you sort though the bottled eau selections you can afford most of the things at walmart or kohl s and the occasional meal at the macaroni grill moreover , it would be socially unacceptable for you to pull up to church in a jaguar or to hire a caterer for your dinner party anyway so you are not plagued by a nagging feeling of doing without many americans admire the rich they do n't see society as a conflict zone between the rich and poor it s taboo to say in a democratic culture , but do you think a nation that watches katie couric in the morning , tom hanks in the evening and michael jordan on weekends harbors deep animosity toward the affluent \? on the contrary i'm writing this from nashville , where one of the richest families , the frists , is hugely admired for its entrepreneurial skill and community service people do n't want to tax the frists they want to elect them to the senate and they did nor are americans suffering from false consciousness you go to a town where the factories have closed and people who once earned 14 an hour now work for 8 an hour they 've taken their hits but odds are you will find their faith in hard work and selfreliance undiminished , and their suspicion of washington unchanged americans resent social inequality more than income inequality as the sociologist jennifer lopez has observed do n't be fooled by the rocks that i got , i'm just , i'm just jenny from the block as long as rich people stay real , in ms lopez s formulation , they are admired meanwhile , middleclass journalists and academics who seem to look down on megachurches , suburbia and hunters are resented if americans see the tax debate as being waged between the economic elite , led by president bush , and the cultural elite , led by barbra streisand , they are going to side with mr bush , who could come to any suburban barbershop and fit right in most americans do not have marxian categories in their heads this is the most important reason americans resist wealth redistribution , the reason that subsumes all others americans do not see society as a layer cake , with the rich on top , the middle class beneath them and the working class and underclass at the bottom they see society as a high school cafeteria , with their community at one table and other communities at other tables they are pretty sure that their community is the nicest , and filled with the best people , and they have a vague pity for all those poor souls who live in new york city or california and have a lot of money but no true neighbors and no free time all of this adds up to a terrain incredibly inhospitable to classbased politics every few years a group of millionaire democratic presidential aspirants pretends to be the people s warriors against the overclass they look inauthentic , combative rather than unifying worst of all , their basic message is not optimistic they have n't learned what franklin and teddy roosevelt and even bill clinton knew that you can run against rich people , but only those who have betrayed the ideal of fair competition you have to be more hopeful and growthoriented than your opponent , and you cannot imply that we are a nation tragically and permanently divided by income in the gospel of america , there are no permanent conflicts drawing \( katherine streeter \)
to the sports editor as a lifelong yankee fan , i feel compelled to comment on the fiasco that george steinbrenner has created by criticizing derek jeter lest anyone forget , the recent yankee resurgence can be tied directly to the suspension of steinbrenner for nefarious activities by fay vincent , then the commissioner of baseball in steinbrenner s absence , gene michael and other knowledgeable baseball experts in the organization carefully rebuilt the team , and the end result was four world series titles these yankee teams have won in spite of steinbrenner and his shenanigans derek jeter has been at the center of the winning until i saw him play , i never really understood what ted williams and others meant when they talked about phil rizzuto and the relative lack of correlation between his numbers and his uncanny ability to help his team win now i do jeter s skills are already famous , but more than that , he is a born leader , with a work ethic second to none he is also possessed of the kind of quiet , unassuming and respectful demeanor that is so sadly lacking in athletes of our time for whatever warped motivational reason , steinbrenner has tried to tarnish the reputation of a man who has more dignity and class in his little finger than the principal owner has in his entire body charles a gruen hackensack , nj
one of the united states' most significant contributions to the world is the athletic scholarship if you do n't think the athletic scholarship has a global reach , then look at web sites with hundreds of services offering to match athletes with college athletic programs we have the world s most distinctive sports system golfers , tennis players , swimmers , field hockey players , lacrosse players and , of course , basketball and football players vie to have their education subsidized in exchange for their athletic skills and the potential to bring glory , if not a championship , to their college there s something about this arrangement , however , that makes many people feel uncomfortable the discomfort will be apparent during the ncaa basketball tournament , when critics will use terms like sham , disgrace , exploitation and hypocrisy in connection with intercollegiate athletics , basketball in particular there will be cries from critics to tear it down , to do away with a system that ties athletics to academics murray sperber and i go round and round on this issue sperber is a professor of english and american studies at indiana university he has written several books about the billiondollar business of college sports inc sperber , a semipro hockey player in his youth , is a skeptic my theory , he said yesterday , is that the farther a sport is from the money , the better chance an athlete has of getting a good education sperber s point is that if our college system is as great as i tend to think it is , why are we the only country that does it like this \? we must have it wrong on the contrary we have this one right i came through the athletic scholarship system , and , like thousands of others , came through unscathed that was another era , of course , in the 1970 s intercollegiate athletics was n't the 24hour , sevendayaweek industry it is now we did n't spend 40 to 60 hours a week on sports after the last game of the football season , we might not see the coaches until spring practice unless we had one of them for a class but the basic premise of the scholarship remains the same athletics is a means to a larger opportunity , if you chose to take it the barriers that prevent maximizing the opportunity are more formidable than ever the system has succumbed to excess the excess simply reflects a culture that is sometimes too impulsive , too competitive our capitalism devours anything in its path if you 're a division i head coach , you 're on an endless treadmill of the 325 division i universities , 24 have some athletic program on probation jim harrick at georgia may be the latest to be overwhelmed by the pressure to survive tates locke , the head basketball coach at clemson in the 1970 s , was so desperate to recruit black players that he created a phony black fraternity during recruiting visits he wanted to give recruits the appearance of an africanamerican community when in fact there was none clemson wound up on three years' probation the concept of the athletic scholarship began in the south during the 1930 s and evolved from the ferocious competition for fresh bodies scholarships , or athletic subsidies , were regarded as blasphemy by many in his book onward to victory the crises that shaped college sport , sperber quotes the president of notre dame in the 1940 s , the rev hugh o 'donnell , as calling for a halt to the awarding of athletic scholarships before real professionalism takes hold the southeastern conference said it needed the lure of athletic scholarships to gain an advantage over powers in the midwest and east in 1948 , delegates to the ncaa outlawed full athletic rides but in the 1950 s , the ncaa agreed to fouryear scholarships in the 1970 s , ncaa delegates , at the behest of coaches and athletic directors , eliminated the fouryear rides in favor of oneyear renewable scholarships sperber said this was when the scholarship system changed drastically , from an amateur system in which the athletes were protected to a semiprofessional system in which they served at the coaches' pleasure what s the difference , sperber said , between being cut by your college team and cut by the pros \? the first order of business for myles brand , the ncaa s new executive director , should be to get back the fouryear scholarship guarantee the second order should be convening representatives from professional leagues down to amateurs to redefine a contemporary sports culture where lines between amateur and professional have been obliterated to the detriment of sport and the individual the athletic scholarship system is worth saving and worth reconfiguring to accommodate phenoms like lebron james who , for all his talent and flair , could profit from a reformed college sports environment money is power , but so is knowledge no one does bigtime sports better than we do we just need to do it better
i 've heard it said that i should try , just once , to write something upbeat honestly , on the domestic front it s hard yes , the business cycle is looking up but with the budget out of control , porkstuffed legislation making its way through congress and the extractive industries making environmental policy , we seem to have lost the ability to govern ourselves did i mention civil liberties \? but if i take the global long view , there s still a lot to cheer about when i went to graduate school , almost 30 years ago , i initially thought about specializing in development after all , there is no more important topic in economics than how to raise the standard of living of the world s poor but in the mid1970 s , development economics was just too depressing to pursue indeed , it might as well have been called nondevelopment economics no third world nation had made the transition to advancedcountry status since 19thcentury japan circa 1975 it seemed that the club of nations with decent living standards was no longer accepting new members now we know that the club is n't that exclusive , after all south korea and several smaller asian economies have made a full transition to modernity china is still a poor country , but it has made astonishing progress and there are signs of an economic takeoff in at least parts of india i'm not talking about arid economic statistics what we 've seen over the past generation is an enormous , unexpected improvement in the human condition how was this improvement achieved \? whenever i give talks about my latest book , someone asks whether i still believe in free trade the answer is yes not because i have any fond feelings about multinational corporations , but because every one of those development success stories was based on exportled growth and that growth is possible only if rising economies can expand into new markets some critics of globalization seem to be nostalgic for the era before the big growth in thirdworld exports of manufactured goods i'm not , because i remember the way that era really felt , our despair over the possibility of development that said , the critics of globalization do have some valid points first and foremost , the promise of exportled growth has failed in too many places in particular , latin america has signally failed to replicate asia s success latin nations have liberalized , privatized and deregulated , with results ranging from disappointing \( mexico \) to catastrophic \( argentina \) open world markets , it seems , offer the possibility of economic development but not an easy , universal recipe meanwhile , competition from newly industrializing economies does hurt some workers in advanced countries i could tell you how sensible government policies could minimize this cost , but since we do n't have those policies and are n't about to get them , free trade is , in reality , a morally ambiguous issue and someone in my situation has to acknowledge being in a particularly weak moral position , since they are n't yet having newspaper columns written in bangalore yet i keep coming back to the big good news of the past 25 years in a world with more or less free trade , development is possible we are not , it turns out , condemned to live forever on a planet where only a small minority of the global population has a decent standard of living will this good news continue \? growing tensions over world trade worry me the steady trickle of us protectionist moves , against everything from steel to chinese bras , has n't yet become a torrent but there s a definite sense that the grownups have left the building what s particularly striking is the contempt this administration has for the rules i was on the staff of the council of economic advisers during the reagan administration \( those were nonpolitical jobs back then \) one thing i remember was that if the experts said a proposed trade restriction violated international trade law , that was that by contrast , just about every protectionist step taken by the bush administration has been clearly in violation and if the major economic powers stop honoring the rules that preserve open global markets , the chances of future development in poor nations will be much reduced but none of this cancels the fact that over the past 25 years more people have seen greater material progress than ever before in history that s something to celebrate bob herbert is on vacation
college commencement signifies the end of a journey , often long and arduous but for some graduating seniors , the trip involves extra twists and turns here are the stories of graduates with their own special reasons to celebrate melissa colon as many jobs as it took melissa colon will graduate with the rest of her class from the public service scholar program at hunter college today she can do this because she has the day off over the last four years , ms colon has been a fulltime student , but she may have spent more time working to pay for college than sitting in class i 've always had at least one job , ms colon , 22 , said it was my junior year that things got really bad at that point , ms colon s mother s severance package ran out she had been laid off at nbc and had taken a job that paid roughly half her previous salary ms colon had a parttime job at a ticket agency , but it was not enough to study full time and get her degree in four years , ms colon took two more jobs she was a research assistant by day and a waitress by night she also held an internship at congressman eliot l engel s office she is the quintessential noncomplainer , said felix matos rodriguez , the director of puerto rican studies at hunter , for whom ms colon did research never a sense of selfpity though ms colon showed no signs of buckling , her boyfriend , rene bosolet , was worried i'm always concerned with the load she takes on , he said there was definitely a point where i was like , 'you got to maybe slow down a little bit' but ms colon would have none of it quitting one job could have forced her to become a parttime student , delaying her graduation for me , that was just not going to be an option , she said instead , she will join the new york city urban fellows program , which will provide a fulltime city job for nine months and a 25 , 000 stipend mark glassman photo
new york philomusica chamber ensemble merkin concert hall the new york philomusica chamber ensemble offered its thursday evening performance as a tribute to roland hanna , the jazz pianist and composer who died in november and who was knighted by liberia in 1970 sir roland had been a juilliard classmate of the ensemble s founder , director and french hornist , a robert johnson , and he had composed several works for the group none of those were included on the program instead , sir roland was represented by a previously unheard chamber arrangement of duke ellington s new world acomin' , a quasipiano concerto that ellington composed for a carnegie hall concert in 1943 the piece is classic ellington and very much of its time the ensemble moves and harmonizations are redolent of 1940 s jazz , and the piano writing ranges freely from the ruminative to the brisk often its accent is bluesy and subtle occasionally it speaks in the grand pianistic gestures of concert hall virtuosity jeb patton , who studied with sir roland at queens college , gave a sparkling , characterful account of the solo line , and the ensemble s winds and strings , abetted by eddie locke on drums and gail kruvand on bass , conveyed the flavor of the ellington band sound , reduced in heft but not in spirit also notable on the program was the united states premiere of michael berkeley s chamber symphony \( 1980 \) , a work that mr berkeley s program note suggests was inspired by the perilous state of the world the score begins murkily , like a slowmoving , muddy river and gradually becomes more sharply defined and even , near the end , spiky and bright there are vigorous dialogues between the piano and the rest of the ensemble , which at first speaks in unified , tandem lines that give it a single voice as the ensemble texture grows more variegated , the clouds seem to lift from the work , but only temporarily the ending is dark and ambiguous the program opened with haydn s divertimento in e \( hob xv 34 \) and ended with the brahms clarinet quintet \( op 115 \) , both in hefty but appealing performances allan kozinn
island s somber past q when my uncle , an architect , died , among his effects i found pictures labeled north brother island project april 5 , 1946 the pictures appear to be of nice art deco hospital buildings what are they and what happened to them \? a north brother island , off hunts point in the bronx , is probably best remembered as the place where the steamer general slocum ran aground while burning on july 15 , 1904 it has also been site of several public institutions , chosen for its comparative remoteness the most famous was the riverside hospital , opened in 1885 to care for victims of infectious diseases like typhus , cholera and smallpox the hospital , which expanded haphazardly as need arose , was a dumping ground for the destitute sick , most of them immigrants , as in the tuberculosis epidemic of 1903 and the polio epidemic of 1916 the most famous internee on the island was mary mallon , a cook better known as typhoid mary , a carrier of the disease who was known to have infected dozens , possibly hundreds , of new yorkers at the time of her quarantine in 1907 she died on the island in 1938 your uncle s drawings date from a later and happier time on the 205acre island amid a huge influx of college applicants after world war ii , dorm space was scarce at the city s colleges new york state leased the complex from the city and used it to house returning veterans going to college , even providing ferries to manhattan and the bronx but it is unlikely that the designs you found were ever used as the need for dorm space abated , the state turned the hospital into a rehab center for adolescent drug addicts in 1952 the result was rife with corruption , violence and recidivism the buildings are now in ruins , and the island is also home to an abandoned lighthouse that was in service from 1869 to 1953 there have been several attempts to sell or reinvent north brother island for some purpose , like mayor edward i koch s idea of housing the homeless there but the island is now a bird sanctuary , a home to thousands of herons , egrets and ibises there is no record of how the birds feel about art deco a view in bay ridge q there is a beautiful victorian house in bay ridge , brooklyn , on the block bordered by 76th and 77th streets , ridge boulevard and colonial road it takes up almost the entire block and seems to command great views is there anything special to tell us about this home \? a the house is a private home , a gothic revival building that sits atop a bluff rising over colonial road , with a hexagonal tower overlooking the upper bay it once belonged to dr frederic elliott , an early exponent of voluntary group health insurance in new york state dr elliott founded blue shield in 1944 and composed the state s first workers' compensation law no ordinary old store q what is the history of the beautiful building at 620 avenue of the americas \? why was it never torn down and replaced with mediocrity \? a we 'll pass on the second part of your question , not wanting to encourage such negative thinking but the building itself is handsome and interesting although it is identified as 620 today , it actually is part of a larger edifice , 616632 avenue of the americas \( between 18th and 19th streets \) , which was created in 18957 as the siegelcooper dry goods store by the architectural firm of delemos cordes part of the ladies' mile historic district , the building occupies more than half of a full city block and contains more than 15 1 2 acres of space as the aia guide to new york city notes , elaborately embellished in glazed terra cotta , it clearly bears the stamp of the chicago world s fair of 1893 the building once housed a fountain designed by daniel chester french that was a favored meeting place during world war i it was converted into a military hospital but in recent years it has returned to its roots as a retail store , with bed , bath and beyond on the ground floor , while losing none of its late19thcentury splendors george robinson drawing \( drawing by stuart goldenberg \)
boston , oct 14 nomar garciaparra has actually claimed that he does not get immersed in the ancient , fascinating rivalry between his boston red sox and the yankees because he is from california so he apparently wants millions of passionate fans , some who slept outside fenway park for a fleeting chance to attend tuesday s game , to believe that this is just another series it sounded unbelievable when garciaparra uttered it , but maybe , in garciaparra s world , he has been telling the truth you see , garciaparra has played as if he is not obsessed with the yankees , as his output against them has been almost nonexistent garciaparra has performed like someone who cannot wait to bolt to the west coast , chill out and escape all this rivalry stuff attention , nomar , you are one loss from going back to cali garciaparra drove in his first run in his last 12 postseason games with a groundout tuesday , but it could end up being much too late and obviously too little for the fading red sox david wells struck out garciaparra in a critical atbat long before his soft rbi in the eighth inning as the yankees glided to a 42 victory in game 5 of their american league championship series because garciaparra had the opportunity to deliver four runners in his first three atbats and delivered none of them , because boston s recordsetting lineup managed four hits off wells , a 40yearold pitcher who will probably not even be with the yankees next season , and because the red sox were once again treated to two innings of mariano rivera , they are one loss from being eliminated never give up , garciaparra said this team s not , so i'm not going to the red sox must have been employing reverse psychology on themselves or simply making it more difficult for reporters to interview them because they blared 50 cent in their clubhouse normally , losing clubhouses are filled with the sounds of silence , gloomy expressions and endless explanations but the red sox had only the expressions forget about the explanations , too why has garciaparra deteriorated from a twotime batting champion and one of boston s most dangerous hitters to a player the red sox lauded for having two walks against wells \? is that what garciaparra s postseason struggles have done to expectations , catcher jason varitek saying garciaparra had a key walk and the batting coach ron jackson contending he was very pleased with the free passes \? garciaparra is 2 for 19 against the yankees and 8 for 39 in the postseason if ever there was a moment for nomar to be the nomah every fan in new england will swear is lightyears better than derek jeter \( except in october \) , it came when the red sox had runners on second and third and two outs in the third inning wells had a 30 lead , but he was one single away from letting boston back into the game with a full count on garciaparra , wells pumped a 91mileanhour fastball that looked like the kind of pitch garciaparra would normally crush he missed it the mighty nomah had struck out it was pretty big , catcher jorge posada said he s been their guy that s been doing it for their team it was a big , big out i thought it really got david through the game jackson said garciaparra was opening his left shoulder , which leads to sloppy swings , and not getting his hands in position fast enough , which contributes to his being late to make contact that might explain why wells , not the most overpowering pitcher , overpowered garciaparra it s hard to figure out , jackson said you 'd have to ask him about that when garciaparra was asked about the atbat , he said that he battled and added he made a good pitch strike three in garciaparra s first 11 career postseason games , he batted 425 with 7 home runs , 20 rbi and 12 runs scored in his last dozen postseason games , garciaparra might as well have been invisible he is batting 196 with no homers and an rbi that delivered an inconsequential second run garciaparra has played in 928 regularseason games and he has endured only one longer streak without an rbi than the postseason drought that ended with a whimper on tuesday are you kidding me \? garciaparra said when someone asked if this was his most frustrating stretch it is the secondlongest drought without an rbi to a 15game span in 2000 , but this is the yankees and the postseason no matter what garciaparra said , it has not been any worse for him if that s the case with nomar , varitek said , the thing is he still has tomorrow varitek is right the red sox still have game 6 on wednesday and perhaps game 7 on thursday , but garciaparra must do something soon because he has already wasted too many atbats for a team that relies on him the compelling rivalry that garciaparra wanted to minimize is about to end he might want to get involved , or that flight to california will feel a lot longer photo nomar garciaparra after striking out to end the third inning , stranding two runners garciaparra is 2 for 19 against the yankees \( photo by barton silverman the new york times \)
in the tense days following the sept 11 terrorist attacks , officials at the securities and exchange commission conducted twice daily conference calls with stock exchange executives , monitoring their efforts to reopen the nation s securities markets the american stock exchange , which was closest to the world trade center , was having the greatest difficulty getting up and running it was viewed as imperative that all the exchanges open simultaneously but one key executive richard a grasso , the chairman of the new york stock exchange was conspicuously absent during the calls , said meyer s frucher , chairman of the philadelphia stock exchange , who took part in all the discussions not only did grasso never come on the phone to be part of that collegial network to get things up and going , he said , a significant portion of the time , nobody from the new york stock exchange came on the phone then , on sept 15 , two days before the exchanges reopened , he continued , the group learned that the new york stock exchange would open a few minutes later than usual the reason mr grasso wanted to have two minutes of silence starting at 9 30 , followed by a singing of god bless america as a result , the various exchanges that trade put and call options on both nasdaq and the big board would be forced to have a staggered opening , threatening already fragile trading systems executives from the other exchanges objected and argued strenuously for a simultaneous opening but it was not to be when the big board opened for trading that day , tv viewers around the world watched mr grasso , first with his head bowed , then joining the floor in god bless america like robert moses and lyndon johnson before him , dick grasso was a master at using all the levers of power available to him , mr frucher said that generates awe and respect , but also resentment the controversy over mr grasso s 140 million pay package may have been the main impetus for his ouster last month but the seeds of his downfall appear to have been planted long before his compensation ever became public toward the end of his career , mr grasso seemed to consider himself bigger than the institution he ran , leading to a series of missteps that attracted the scrutiny of the big board s secretive practices , according to more than a dozen people who worked with him and competed with him over the years at the same time , he failed to recognize that the culture outside the exchange was changing and that practices with even the appearance of a conflict of interest , like sitting on the board of a listed company , no longer passed muster because of his inability to modify his methods , the 211yearold institution he ran so ably now faces the prospect of a complete overhaul his abrupt departure has created a leadership vacuum , paving the way for continued chaos at the exchange its regulatory arm is scrambling to appear tough , and the trading floor is polarized whoever leads the big board next is unlikely to take his cue from mr grasso , who managed through intimidation and an oldfashioned favors system that resembles the dealings of a 19thcentury ward boss more than it does the practices of a modern chief executive former colleagues said he required the executives of every department to report to him , guaranteeing that he alone knew what was happening throughout the exchange he wielded the exchange s regulatory unit like a weapon , some of these people said , instilling fear in the members and the workers for example , a few years ago mr grasso even became involved in a hiring matter with a specialist firm , threatening to block an acquisition the firm had planned if one of his loyalists was not brought on board in the merger and the invitations to join the exchange s board that he extended to executives like the appointment of sanford i weill , chairman of citigroup , earlier this year , which backfired badly were in many cases strategic , a way to trade favors to try to benefit the exchange and also himself there is no denying that mr grasso s methods resulted in great success for the exchange during his 35 years there since he rose to chairman in 1995 , the big board increased its market share of the nation s stock trading from 70 percent to 90 percent more than half of the companies whose shares trade on the exchange listed them there during mr grasso s years as chairman and the value of an exchange seat has almost tripled since he took the helm equally important , the big board became an american icon during mr grasso s tenure , a symbol of the kind of capitalism that can produce wealth for everyone , not just the highborn no one could articulate the whole concept of the exchange to the outside world better , said one highlevel trader who has worked with mr grasso for the past 10 years he knew every single nuance of the place from who opened the front door in the morning to who was testifying before the sec the job was well done the real issue is whether or not he continued to represent the members or if he had a different agenda
washington , march 24 despite the breakup of the shuttle columbia , the three other ships in the fleet may be needed until 2020 , a top nasa official said today he added that nasa could cut the risks in later years , when the shuttles will be approaching 40 years old , by flying with fewer astronauts or none at all if a planned orbital space plane is ready the official , maj gen michael c kostelnik , the nasa deputy associate administrator for the space shuttle and space station programs , said the shuttle could become a cargo vehicle if the job of ferrying astronauts was turned over to the orbital space plane , a vehicle that nasa is hoping to have in service by 2012 , although it might set an earlier goal the orbital space plane is intended to carry as many as 10 astronauts but no cargo the shuttle can carry 55 , 000 pounds to an orbit 100 miles above the earth nasa factors in 1 , 000 pounds per astronaut , including gear and provisions the shuttle routinely carries six or seven astronauts , including three on the middeck , a cube deep inside the craft that cannot be fitted with ejection seats if the shuttle did not have to ferry astronauts to the space station , general kostelnik said , the middeck would not have to carry astronauts and nasa could even remove excess crew off the top deck that would allow ejection seats to be reinstalled , he said the columbia carried ejection seats on its first flight , when it had two astronauts , but the seats were removed when astronauts were added , for reasons of fairness if ejection seats were installed , the general said , perhaps then we can start to look at crew escape activities that make sense the shuttle now carries equipment to help the crew bail out , but only at relatively low altitude and low speed the equipment , a telescoping pole that is meant to allow astronauts wearing parachutes to avoid hitting the wings if they need to bail out , was added after the challenger accident 17 years ago , but there are doubts about how well it would work general kostelnik , speaking at nasa headquarters , gave a briefing on a conference held by nasa on march 19 and 20 at the michoud assembly facility in louisiana on extending the shuttles' service lives the conference was scheduled long before the columbia s destruction , and , general kostelnik said , the timing was terrible among the problems , he said , was that nasa staff members who would have been preparing analyses for consideration at the conference were instead investigating the breakup of the columbia as a result of the conference , general kostelnik said , nasa is reviewing 60 safety improvements that it might make , including some resulting from the columbia inquiry he was reluctant to say what the proposed changes were , although he mentioned fixing the insulating foam on the external tank so the foam does not fall off and hit the orbiter during liftoff , as happened on the columbia investigators have not established what effect , if any , the blow had on the orbiter s destruction during reentry general kostelnik said that nasa was evaluating ways to inspect the orbiter once it docked at the space station for the foreseeable future , the shuttles will go to the station on every mission , to help build it if the astronauts on the columbia had tried a spacewalk to make repairs , the general said , there was no way for a spacewalking astronaut to get any kind of grip to do any repair on the shuttle s underside but the space station has a robotic arm that might be usable for inspection or repair , he said in houston , astronauts have been using a simulator to experiment with flying the shuttle in a loop on approach to the space station so astronauts on the station can take digital photos of the orbiter but that maneuver has disadvantages , the astronauts say it burns fuel that could be used to boost the station s orbit or for other purposes , or that could have been left on the ground to increase the shuttle s cargo payload it also means that the astronauts on the shuttle would lose sight of the station as they approached it , introducing a risk of collision general kostelnik said today , however , that nasa workers carrying out much of the investigation had suggested the possible improvements he said that nasa did not know what the improvements would cost or how many of them it could afford reducing the risk on shuttle flights might require eliminating the crew , general kostelnik said while the shuttle will be needed as a workhorse , he said , it might not need to carry people he said that in later years it might even be feasible to use a robotic shuttle the shuttle s automatic pilot already controls the launching and most of the landing a human usually takes over for the final approach , in part because the automatic pilot tends to make aggressive changes in the flight path , the astronauts have said currently , lowering the landing gear and applying the brakes are not automated , nasa officials said photos maj gen michael c kostelnik , a nasa official , spoke yesterday about the future of the shuttles , including the atlantis , right , shown this month at

as with so many of the bad things that happen in prison , it is hard to ascertain from the outside everything that led up to the murder of john j geoghan the defrocked priest , convicted of one count of molestation and awaiting trial on others , had complained of harassment at the first prison he was sent to , a mediumsecurity penitentiary according to prisoners' lawyers , guards taunted him , his food was contaminated and excrement was placed on his bed yet because of his poor institutional adjustment at the mediumsecurity prison , according to a spokeswoman for the massachusetts department of correction , he was moved to a tougher prison for more violent criminals it was there , despite being placed in protective custody , that the 68yearold mr geoghan was beaten and strangled to death , the authorities say they say he was killed by joseph l druce , who is serving a life sentence for the murder of a man who he said tried to molest him victimizers become vulnerable in prison , none perhaps so much as child molesters in the hypermacho world of a maximumsecurity prison , baby rapers , as they 're called , are a common target of violence and frequently seek the sanctuary of protective custody and it s not just the inmates who are after them guards , too , tend to abhor child molesters i had thought this animus was just another sort of prison exotica until i learned that a prisoner i supervised on my floor at sing sing had committed sodomy on a minor \( i was n't supposed to know , but in prison you tend to find out \) my revulsion was immediate , visceral and stronger than i would have expected i had never knowingly met a child molester before , and had only recently become a parent after learning what he had done , i actually had trouble speaking to the inmate , a mildmannered , middleaged former accountant yet i had conversations every day with a variety of murderers in prison or on the outside , people feel this abhorrence toward this particular , pathetic kind of criminal even knowing how often these criminals themselves were victims of abuse and few tears are probably being shed for john geoghan , who may have molested nearly 150 young people while still a priest the difference , of course , is that too often prisoners and guards are allowed to act on this hostility mr geoghan s murder robs his other victims of their day in court , but it should also offend every citizen s sense of justice we do not leave it for prisoners to pass sentences and carry them out a court had given mr geoghan a 9to10 year sentence , not the death penalty especially perplexing is why mr geoghan was placed in such proximity to his murderer prison officials spend a great deal of time ensuring that enemies are kept away from each other prisoners are constantly being transferred , from one cell block to another or from one prison to another , on the basis of perceived antipathies mr geoghan s celebrity he was the priest whose malfeasance ignited the sexual abuse scandal in the catholic church should have made prison officials all the more careful about his placement short eyes is the title of a famous play written at sing sing by the prisoner miguel pi ero about a group of inmates that discovers a child molester in its midst what i remember most vividly is how their guard turns his back when the moment arrives to rape and murder the man massachusetts officials can profess to be shocked at what has happened governor mitt romney has formed a special panel to investigate the death of mr geoghan , while prison officials have pledged to get to the bottom of this yet anyone who has worked in a prison ca n't help but wonder how similar the murder of john geoghan , surely one of the most despised men in massachusetts , might have been to the one in the play
atlanta , jan 18 it was the type of play that could send a player into a shell darvin ham of the hawks dunked viciously over clarence weatherspoon while drawing a foul the play came with six minutes left and , after ham made the free throw , gave atlanta a 3point lead but weatherspoon did anything but retreat he scored the next two baskets to give the knicks the lead , added a 15foot jumper with two and a half minutes to play and made the gamesaving defensive stop on the allstar forward shareef abdurrahim , a man three inches taller behind weatherspoon , who scored 10 of his seasonhigh 18 points in the final seven and a half minutes , the knicks outlasted the hawks , 9592 , at philips arena weatherspoon , a reserve forward , was so hot that he became coach don chaney s goto player i'm not one of the guys who s going to get 20 sets called in a game , but in the fourth quarter we were looking for shots and i had a couple of putbacks and rebounds that got me going and coach called those plays for me on the baseline , said weatherspoon , who also had six rebounds and two steals in his 27 minutes if you get your number called and shoot it with confidence , you 've got a good chance of making them allan houston , who led the knicks \( 1523 \) with 24 points , said after friday s disconcerting loss at detroit that tonight s game would reveal a lot about the knicks' character tonight they proved , once again , that they have a solid cast of role players the knicks won even though none of their top three scorers , houston , latrell sprewell and kurt thomas , scored in the fourth quarter instead , charlie ward followed weatherspoon s lead with 7 points and 3 assists in the fourth he also grabbed the rebound of abdurrahim s late miss , then hit two gameclinching free throws othella harrington , who starts in front of weatherspoon , had 4 of his 12 points and 6 of his 11 rebounds in the fourth he also defended abdurrahim well he knew his moves from their days as teammates in vancouver as long as somebody does it , that s all that matters to me , chaney said that s what being a team is all about we have a lot of guys who make certain sacrifices and can score but give up their game for guys who we normally go to houston who gave a brief pregame pep talk to his teammates , saying this is a game we 've got to get let s go out and do it almost carried the knicks by himself in the first half , scoring 22 of their 49 points he said the timing of the surge was no coincidence whether i was missing all of those shots or not , i at least wanted to give myself a chance and give us a chance to get off to a good start , said houston , who shot 8 for 16 in the first half and 1 for 8 in the second some of the shots were kind of out of the flow of the offense , but i felt good fortunately , we were able to sustain the lead in the second half when i did n't get those shots to fall when sprewell , who finished with 7 points , finally scored his first points of the game , on a 3pointer with 7 minutes 36 seconds left in the third quarter , the knicks went ahead by 6151 almost five minutes later , sprewell sneaked in front of glenn robinson and stole a pass near midcourt while alone and heading toward the basket , sprewell smiled and licked his lips , as if salivating about the opportunity he finished the play with a twohanded , doubleclutch slam that gave the knicks a 7061 lead but the play rallied the hawks \( 1426 \) , not the knicks atlanta ran off 15 straight points to go ahead , 7670 , two minutes into the fourth after missing 11 straight shots , the knicks finally responded shandon anderson hit a free throw , then posted up the rookie dan dickau to score on a 3point play ward followed with a 3pointer to tie it at 7777 with 8 40 left moments after weatherspoon answered ham s dunk with his two baskets , the knicks went ahead by 9186 with 3 18 left but this one , like several other knicks games , went down to the final possession atlanta scored 6 of the next 8 points to pull to 9392 with 46 seconds left on a jumper by robinson , who had a gamehigh 27 points the knicks went to houston , and he missed a baseline jumper the hawks rebounded and after a timeout , they went to abdurrahim \( 14 points \) , but weatherspoon was all over him when he put up his errant turnaround jumper from the baseline with 47 seconds left ward grabbed the rebound and after he sank his two free throws , atlanta s jason terry missed a heavily contested 3pointer from the left corner to end the game houston said he learned something about the knicks i knew that we would respond well , but responding well and playing hard and winning sometimes do n't go together , he said to me , this was one we had to find a way to win and we did photo knicks' allan houston , dribbling past the hawks' glenn robinson , scored 22 of his 24 points before halftime \( associated press \)
baghdad , iraq , march 31 with american advance units pushing ever closer to baghdad and saddam hussein s presidential compound once again under remorseless aerial attack with what seemed like american bunkerbusting bombs , the iraqi leadership put on a show of redoubled defiance today and promised american troops nothing but death in the desert when government ministers emerged in their militarystyle uniforms and berets to spread their message of doom for the american war effort , they were insistently upbeat about events on the battlefield but there was something different in their their demeanor something more strident , more polemical , more pugnacious , and more edgy as the ministers told it , this reflected new successes for iraqi fighters amid the palm trees and grain fields of the euphrates river valley , the center of fighting for american troops advancing from the south but it was not difficult for a listener familiar with the changing shape of the war outside baghdad to think that this might not be the full story the americans are telling a lot of lies lying is the golden rule of the american administration , said naji sabri , the foreign minister he added , we shall turn the desert into a big graveyard for american and british troops the british , he said , already had graveyards here from iraqi uprisings against their colonial rule now they will have other graveyards , where they will be joined by their friends , the americans , he said those americans who will not surrender to us will face nothing but death in the desert , or else they will have to flee back to their puppet regime in kuwait the sharp boom of a new bomb striking a mile , or perhaps 10 miles away , shook the building at times during the news conference at the palestine hotel the ministers , undeterred , or at least determined not to be seen being deterred , affected not to notice to iraqi loyalists , this no doubt seemed like defiance of the invader at its best to others , there was the thought that the insistent indifference to the bombs might be a metaphor for something else perhaps an unwillingness to look at matters in any way that could presage an outcome other than victory for mr hussein and those around him , like the ministers , whose prospects , and perhaps lives , depend on his somehow confounding the onslaught one difference was that mr sabri and the information minister , muhammad said alsahhaf , made virtually no reference to mr hussein , although they stood beside a large , flatteringly youthful portrait of him another was that their remarks took place against the intrusive , offstage percussions of the american bombing and the sporadic iraqi antiaircraft fire that , so far , appears not to have downed a single american warplane over baghdad instead , mr sahhaf , wearing a holstered pistol at his hip and two magazines of bullets on his belt , spoke of a new iraqi offensive that had , he said , brought disaster to american advance parties that set up camouflaged hideouts in the desert from those hideouts , he said , the americans had harassed iraqi units and sought to create the impression that the americans were further forward and in greater strength than they were having discovered this tactic , mr sahhaf said , the saddam fedayeen forces destroyed one desert hideout , killing all of the american troops there he gave a tally for the previous 24 hours , from all sectors of the war , of 43 coalition soldiers killed in action , as well as 13 tanks , 8 armored personnel carriers , 6 other armored vehicles , 4 apache helicopters and 2 unmanned predator drones destroyed the snake is in a quagmire now , he said mr sahhaf said iraqi fighters had pushed the americans back into the desert the snake is now back in the desert sands , swerving around certain desert towns , he said the saddam fedayeen and certain smaller units of our armed forces are conducting the fight against the lackeys of the mercenaries night and day we have decided we will not let them sleep , and we are chasing them all over the place it was impossible to verify any of those claims from the restricted vantage point of baghdad , where the 150 foreign journalists face tight controls on their movements , limiting them mainly to visiting bombing sites selected by the information ministry , and attending news conferences at the hotel the palestine became the war press center after the third in a series of pinpoint tomahawk cruise missile strikes on the information ministry on sunday night but the one front of the war that is visible here , the bombing of baghdad , seemed not to be going at all well from the iraqi point of view in fact , the capital , the strategic heart of mr hussein s apparatus of power , seemed open to whatever punishment american air commanders chose to inflict through the day and deep into the night , bombs and missiles pounded targets all across the city , none more so than a huge colonnaded building amid the palm fronds of mr hussein s most prized piece of real estate , the hundreds of acres of riverside palaces and retreats , bunkers and guardhouses , gardens and fountains , that cluster around the republican palace
with almost every jets game being excruciatingly close , extra attention has been paid to coach herman edwards s unorthodox pattern of decisions on fourth down he bristles at the suggestion that he is a gambler , because it suggests that he is not in control of a situation perhaps aggressive is a better description the jets have gone for it on fourth down 10 times this season , succeeding 4 times sixteen teams have gone for it as many or more times during the jets' 04 start , edwards went for it on fourth down five times , when he was desperate to spur an offense that was lifeless the most recent example came against jacksonville on sunday , when edwards passed up a punt on fourthand4 from the jets' 40yard line with 3 minutes 33 seconds remaining in the game and the jets trailing by 106 they failed to convert edwards s rationale for trying was that he expected the jaguars to run on three straight downs to keep the clock going edwards took a leap of faith that the jets , who had the league s worst defense against the run , could keep the jaguars from going 10 yards for a first down , but he definitely did not think that the jaguars could march 40 yards for a touchdown so , at worst , the jaguars would have kicked a field goal , which would have meant the jets could have forced overtime with a touchdown edwards escaped a hail of secondguessing because the defense and chad pennington did exactly what edwards had hoped the defense held on three straight downs , and because the jets used a timeout after each run , just 29 seconds ran off the clock then pennington led the jets on the winning touchdown drive that he has a quarterback capable of such a thing is , of course , also part of edwards s thinking when he makes decisions based on his instincts i do n't play computer football , edwards said you have to have a sense of your football team , a sense of the situation no one has a sense of that better than the head coach that s standing there this was not the same situation as the one nov 16 against indianapolis , when the jets , trailing by 7 points , punted on fourthand7 from their 43yard line with 3 38 remaining colts placekicker mike vanderjagt would have practically been in fieldgoal range if the jets had turned the ball over on downs there , and a field goal would have given the colts a 10point lead , making it a twopossession game if the jets were to tie or go ahead the jets ended up losing , 3831 edwards explained the decision in the jaguars game by saying that he wanted the ball in his best player s hands , an echo of the decision in the giants game to try a field goal from 51 yards in overtime rather than punt or go for it on fourthand3 that kick was blocked , and the jets lost when the giants went on to kick a field goal while edwards defended his decision by saying he was taking a shot at winning a game , he also conceded the day after that he was secondguessing himself if a future decision is close , as it was against the jaguars , expect edwards to almost always go with pennington slim playoff prospects with the jets at 47 , it is still possible for them to finish 97 , the same record that won them their division last season but a run to the playoffs is even more of a long shot this season none of the four victories have come against a team with a winning record \( the combined record of those opponents is 1331 \) after 11 games last season , the division leader miami had four losses and the jets and new england had five , so there was no clearcut frontrunner this season , new england , the leader in the american football conference east , is 92 the jets would have to win their five remaining games and the patriots would have to lose their five for both to finish 97 new england , which won the first meeting against the jets , holds the tie breaker the teams play again dec 20 with indianapolis and tennessee both 92 in the afc south , the loser of the division is nearly assured of being one of the wildcard teams that leaves one more spot with baltimore and cincinnati both 65 in the north , one of those teams will probably win the division , but the other still has two more victories than the jets right now that means that four potential wildcard teams miami , denver , the loser of the indianapolistennessee race and the loser of the baltimorecincinnati race have better records than the jets team award for jones linebacker marvin jones , who in 2000 created the marvin jones foundation to help children realize their potential , was named the team s walter payton man of the year yesterday , making him eligible for the league award , which recognizes a player s community service
kentucky s medicaid program was 230 million in the red last year , and drastic cuts were on the table a state panel proposed excluding zyprexa , an antipsychotic medication that is the state s single biggest drug expense , from the medicaid list of preferred medications that was when the national alliance for the mentally ill and the kentucky consumer advocate network swung into action the two groups , which are nonprofit , bused scores of protesters to a hearing in frankfort , the state capital placed fullpage ads in kentucky newspapers attacking the proposal and sent angry faxes to state officials what the advocacy groups did not say at the time was that the buses , ads and faxes were paid for by eli lilly company , zyprexa s manufacturer zyprexa produced 369 billion in revenue last year , making it lilly s top seller and the sixthlargestselling drug in the world in the united states , 70 percent of zyprexa sales are to government agencies , mostly to medicaid if just a handful of large states were to limit zyprexa sales , lilly s profit and share price would be likely to suffer significantly , analysts say so lilly and other drug makers whose influence in washington was most recently on display in the debate over a medicare drug benefit are flexing their muscles in state capitals in state after state , the companies are fighting proposals to create or toughen government programs that use preferreddrug lists to try to cut costs drug makers argue that the lists are unfair to the poor , depriving them of medicine available to others and the lists , the companies say , tie the hands of doctors who should be making decisions about appropriate care especially when it comes to finding the right medication for someone with mental illness state officials respond that limiting access to some highprice drugs is one way , in tight times , to continue providing care to as many of the poor as possible particularly in cases where there is little evidence that the costlier drugs are more effective lilly lost the battle in kentucky the state decided to take zyprexa off its list of preferred medications , which means that patients must try and fail on a similar , cheaper drug before it will pay for zyprexa but it was a rare defeat after intense lobbying by patient groups and drug makers , the new york state legislature in may overrode a veto by gov george e pataki and enacted a law preventing state medicaid officials from establishing a preferreddrug list new york s 4billionayear bill for medicaid drugs is the biggest in the nation in the first 10 months of this year , the state spent 205 million on zyprexa , more than for any other drug oregon s legislature dropped thousands of patients from its medicaid program in august rather than restrict choices for the others by tightly policing the preferreddrug list the drug makers see little room to compromise they are reluctant to negotiate prices , for example , because under federal medicaid law , a discount to one state must be offered to all and preferreddrug lists for medicaid can influence doctors' prescribing practices for patients they see outside the medicaid program , blunting the effect of the drug companies' expensive marketing efforts because of their close ties to the national alliance for the mentally ill and other advocacy groups , drug makers have been particularly successful in arguing that states should exempt antipsychotic medications like zyprexa from preferred lists twentyeight states specifically exempt drugs for treating emotional disorders from cost controls , a lilly spokeswoman , anne griffin , said antipsychotics are the third rail of medicaid politics , said david parella , director of connecticut s medicaid program if you try to confront this issue , you get hit with these strange bedfellows of the trotskyite lawyers for patient advocacy groups being allied with the plutocratic lawyers for drug companies dr paul jeffrey , director of the massachusetts medicaid program , said that he had not proposed limits on antipsychotic medications for fear that the fight could lead state legislators to support wider limits on the preferreddrug list the battle would have been too bloody , he said with the enactment of the federal medicare drug benefit , these debates may soon move to congress , because the new law provides that the government begin in 2006 to pay the drug bill for patients who are eligible for both medicaid and medicare socalled dual eligibles in essence , the elderly poor now account for 58 percent of medicaid drug spending until 2006 , state medicaid directors say they have no choice but to continue cutting costs medicaid spending grew nearly 13 percent last year while state revenue fell 6 percent , according to the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured medicaid now takes 15 cents of every state dollar , more than any other program except education the fastestgrowing part is prescription drug costs , up 19 percent last year in all , medicaid programs spent 275 billion on drugs

washington , dec 19 libya s leader , col muammar elqaddafi , has admitted that his country had been trying to develop a broad arsenal of unconventional weapons , and he promised to dismantle them up and submit to international inspections , president bush and prime minister tony blair of britain said friday mr bush said that if col qaddafi followed through , libya could regain a secure and respected place among nations libya s actions came after nine months of secret diplomacy , beginning with an overture from colonel qaddafi to london and washington just as the invasion of iraq was beginning mr bush s aides , clearly seeking to build on the capture of saddam hussein last saturday , described the libyan action as directly linked to the iraq war , suggesting that colonel qaddafi had decided to give up his weapons aspirations rather than face off against the united states and its allies speaking to reporters in a hastily called session in the white house press room , mr bush praised colonel qaddafi s agreement to open his country to full inspections this is the first time colonel qaddafi has admitted to having such unconventional weapons or programs to produce them , government and independent experts say but the details given by the white house indicated that for more than two decades , libya had deceived international nuclear inspectors who have visited the country like iran , it hid facilities to produce nuclear fuel , though it did not appear that the libyans actually succeeded in making the kind of fissile material needed to produce a bomb because libya has a troubled history with america and britain , we will be vigilant in ensuring its government lives up to all its responsibilities , mr bush said his announcement came just two days before the 15th anniversary of the bombing of pan am 103 , an act of terrorism for which a libyan agent was convicted two years ago in a clear reference to north korea and iran , two other countries that are suspected of pursuing programs to develop unconventional weapons , mr bush added that i hope other leaders will find an example in libya s action in two trips to libya , including one earlier this month , american and british intelligence and weapons experts were given a tour of the country s arsenal , reportedly including mustard gas , a world war ivintage chemical weapon , and materials for making nerve gas and missiles , the latter from north korea none of these discoveries surprised the experts but one senior administration official told reporters on friday evening that the libyans had gotten much further in their nuclear program than the united states had suspected , showing the western visitors centrifuges that could be used to produce highly enriched uranium the officials declined to say what kind of centrifuges had been found , or what nations appeared to have helped libya both north korea and iran have similar programs under way , though the administration official said that in libya s case , colonel qaddafi s government had not declared that it had actually produced any weaponsgrade uranium that is something we will be pursuing , the official said he added that the united states had learned a considerable amount about north korea s missile trading business in the course of the talks with libya a british official said the libyans had shown visitors 10 nuclearrelated sites , adding that while the country had not manufactured a nuclear weapon , it was close to producing one inspectors from the international atomic energy agency will be sent to assess how close , and to monitor the dismantling of the facilities , british and american officials said not surprisingly , the white house described the surprise announcement as a victory for mr bush in facing down rogue states developing such weapons they also touted the libyan move as vindication for the decision to go to war against iraq where no unconventional weapons have been found because of the message it sent in word and action , we have clarified the choices left to potential adversaries , mr bush told reporters and when leaders make the wise and responsible choice , when they renounce terror and weapons of mass destruction , as colonel qaddafi has now done , they serve the interest of their own people and they add to the security of all nations the libyan government , in a statement , said it had made the decision of its own free will the white house said that despite libya s apparent renunciation of unconventional weapons , mr bush was not yet ready to lift american sanctions united nations sanctions were removed on sept 12 after a settlement involving the pan am 103 bombing over lockerbie , scotland , which killed 269 people in london , mr blair said the libyan overture on disarmament was a direct outgrowth of the talks that led to the settlements over the bombing under that agreement , libya agreed to pay at least 5 million to the relatives of each victim in january 2001 , a libyan military intelligence official was convicted in the bombing , while an executive with the country s airline was acquitted mr blair said libya wanted to see if it could resolve its weapons of mass destruction issue in a similarly cooperative manner
providence , ri , feb 23 the intensive care unit on the fifth floor of rhode island hospital is shaped like a cross jillian silva s brother , derrick , lies in a bed at the southern end mr silva s face is charred and swollen his hands are covered with thirddegree burns that ooze and ache stirrups hold them aloft mr silva , 22 , loves to play the guitar doctors told him it was unlikely he would ever be able to play again still , ms silva , 16 , knows her brother is fortunate when i see my brother i am grateful , she said , standing in the drizzle outside the hospital entrance she said she was grateful that he lived at all , when 97 others including mr silva s best friend , who is missing and presumed dead died in the fire that engulfed a west warwick nightclub on thursday night but ms silva said she was also lucky that he was not on the other side of the intensive care unit s axis across that axis , beyond the nurses' desk and behind locked doors , 22 people struggle for life doctors and nurses in isolation suits scurry around them these patients cannot breathe on their own they need machines to make their lungs work they are hooked to tubes that keep them hydrated , feed them and supply extra proteins we have people here who remain critical , said dr william g cioffi , chief of surgery at rhode island hospital they could be here for two to three months one of the most remarkable things about the fire at the station club is that , so far , no one who made it out of the club alive has since died rhode island hospital received patients who had burns on most of their bodies , their lungs severely scarred by the searing heat even if they live , they face a long struggle these people s lives will never be the same , dr cioffi said this is a lifealtering event when i meet the families of burn victims , i tell them we are going to become very good friends , because you will be coming back here for years rhode island hospital , the only hospital in the state equipped to handle major trauma cases , sits just 11 miles northeast of west warwick when dr cioffi s pager went off as he settled in at home to watch a boston celtics game just after 11 on thursday night , the message indicated the hospital should anticipate 100 burn victims it has 74 intensive care beds within 15 minutes , dr cioffi was at the hospital , marshaling hundreds of doctors , nurses and other staff members to contend with the biggest disaster of his 20year medical career by 2 am the hospital had treated 63 patients today 32 remain , 24 in critical condition of those , 22 are on ventilators dr cioffi left the hospital for the first time since thursday night about 2 pm on saturday he went home , took a threehour nap , then returned to work he is a wiry man wearing green scrubs and sneakers , with shaggy brown hair and grayblue eyes he retired from the army as a lieutenant colonel nine years ago , after an 11year career , most of which he spent at the army s elite institute for surgical research in san antonio a slight puffiness under his eyes is the only sign of the exhaustion he must feel but does not speak about my 6yearold said , 'i see you more on tv than i do at home , ' dr cioffi said he is more concerned about the stress his staff has been under right now everyone is still in an adrenaline rush , he said but later people will need help , and we will make sure they get it now that the critical first 48 hours has passed with no additional deaths , dr cioffi said , the doctors and nurses are trying to make sure that none of their patients die of infections , the top killer of burn victims but even that is just the beginning of medical care most victims will require skin grafts , physical therapy and cosmetic surgery and most , dr cioffi said , will need extensive psychological help with their injuries , which in some cases will be disfiguring they will have grief and anger and a whole host of emotions , dr cioffi said burn victims are often deeply traumatized emotionally by their injuries those who were the least injured have already gone home chris nowicki was discharged at 7 pm on friday , but he was back at the emergency room today because he was worried the thirddegree burn on his backside was getting infected mr nowicki s right arm , with seconddegree burns , is wrapped in a bandage at the crown of his head a purple scab the size of a silver dollar has formed over a burn caused by melting plastic that dripped onto him the pain is bearable , he said , as long as he takes the powerful narcotic painkillers doctors prescribed i can handle the pain , mr nowicki , 30 , said i'm better off than most liz arruda , 23 , will go home on monday , her father , anthony arruda , said he said she would have to return for surgery , skin grafts and physical therapy as she recovered from the thirddegree burns that cover her back i know she has a long way to go , mr arruda said but she is alive and now she is coming home

why is n't matt allen a quarterback \? allen , the holder , scooped up junkin s knuckling snap , spun around , sprinted to the sideline , and with one second left on the clock , uncorked a pass across his body and off his back foot that traveled 35 yards and had a serious chance of being caught if okeafor had not mauled seubert no one is certain if seubert has soft hands what is the back judge doing \? on my final viewing , i discovered an end zone shot from behind scott green , the back judge , who did not call , or see , okeafor s interference he had a great view from the grassy field , not from some faraway burg yet , as allen s pass landed and seubert crashed to the ground , courtesy of okeafor , green waved his arms as if a baseball umpire were calling safe ! did that mean \( a \) i saw no interference , \( b \) i saw no interference because i think seubert is ineligible , \( c \) incomplete pass , or \( d \) i know nothing ! nothing ! the national football league chose \( c \) why were so many linemen downfield \? it appeared that once the fieldgoal attempt failed , every giants offensive lineman rushed downfield like the three stooges in a dither i could swear i saw rosie brown there , too but seubert was the only eligible receiver the play is rich in detail and drama , but will it have historic legs , like franco harris s immaculate reception , jim marshall s wrongway run , dwight clark s amazing touchdown catch and joe pisarcik s fumble \? not really , steve sabol , the president of nfl films , said it s too complicated it s hard to explain and has too many ramifications it was a real strategic quagmire it s enlightening , but the shots are n't that good but none of those other plays elicited , or needed , the type of reaction the nfl felt necessary for the botch on monday , the league said the officials were wrong , that pass interference should have been called with the giants given another chance at a field goal two days later , on espn , commissioner paul tagliabue said that in future playoff games the seven officials would confer on all disputed calls and that their responsibilities on fieldgoal attempts might change the rapid responses by the imageconscious nfl contrasts with the flummoxed mode in which major league baseball s commissioner , bud selig , reacted to last year s tied allstar game recall how selig walked away from a fox reporter seeking answers about his decision to call the game a tie six months later , he has offered no changes in the way each team s players should be used by managers to avoid using them all up in extra innings as candid as the nfl was , what did it omit from its responses \? first , why did n't green , the back judge , notice the interference \? did he think seubert was ineligible , too \? did he only have eyes for tam hopkins , the giants lineman who was ineligible \? did he or did n't he ask the umpire or side judge who was or was n't eligible \? a league spokesman said it is important only to judge the officials' actions or , one would presume , their inactions not their feelings , thoughts , or intentions second , in tagliabue s new mandate for disputed call conferences , what will be the time limit \? ninety seconds \? five minutes \? fifteen minutes \? will there be a table and chairs \? sandwiches or crudit s \? third , the speed with which the officials left the field sunday was never mentioned but my stopwatch says the the game s crew chief , referee ron winter , raced off in less than five seconds , breaking marks set by such retired referees as red cashion and jim tunney

madison , wis for a farmer living in the english countryside two centuries ago , things could get lonely young people were starting to move to cities for factory jobs , and work in the field left little time for courting the few available females still around fortunately , an open mind and an advertisement in the local newspaper could yield dramatic results seven wives wanted proclaimed an item in a small english paper of that era reprinted by the times of london in april 1801 , the ad announced ladies of respectability , desirous of entering into the matrimonial state , may hear of seven gentlemen , who are desirous of enjoying true connubial bliss apparently , there were a lot of lonely farmers and the item was far from the first of its kind personal ads , it turns out , are nothing new they began appearing as soon as newspapers became common some 300 years ago , and became regular features in the mid19th century the first ads generally called for a partner in matrimony they tended to be placed by men who were apparently taking a gamble that a public announcement might net more attractive prospects than matchmaking efforts by friends and family in the victorian era , matrimonial ads strove to sound respectable and put a premium on privacy a gentleman , about 27 years of age , kind and amiable in disposition , is desirous of meeting with a partner for life the advertiser is engaged in a prosperous business and trusts that this mode may be the means of bringing him into communication with one of the fair sex similarly disposed , and of respectable family the strident secrecy may be relied upon this 1851 ad , which appeared in the manchester guardian , garnered a printed response from a lady agreeing to meet the gentleman in truth , though , meeting through the newspapers at that time was not considered respectable the advertisers knew they were taking a step off the beaten path , especially when they resorted to uncommon honesty without beauty to attract the world s crowd , or gold to allure the fortune hunter , i am , i believe , a truehearted , refined , educated woman young , frank , and mirthful , with the birthright entr e of cultured circles should this reach the eye of any still unwedded , who can prove himself to be truly a gentleman in character and standing , he may seek correspondence with miss ward we can only hope that this early bridget jones found her prince charming with this frank 1859 insertion in the new york times prince charming , to be sure , was busy advertising himself the aristocracy in europe has a long history of taking to the papers for the proper union in 1818 , lord lucan sought a bride capable from her rank and talents of supporting the dignity and titles which an alliance so honorable would confer to her a century later , two exiled and penniless hapsburg princesses advertised for husbands from old money , no title necessary a german aristocrat boasting of a sumptuous castle , baron von hallberg de br ch , received 700 letters in response to a fullpage ad he placed in the journal of munich in 1841 among the qualifications the 70yearold baron was looking for in a wife she must be from 16 to 20 years of age she must have beautiful hair , handsome teeth and a charming little foot the sprinkling of personal ads before the mid1800 s became a deluge of matrimonial papers during the last quarter of the 19th century such publications had pages of hopeful brides and bridegrooms , with handy information about the specific contents of bank accounts as well as detailed physical descriptions in the united states , the wedding bell and the correspondent circulated among the romantic and the curious in britain , the 24page matrimonial herald and fashionable marriage gazette claimed to serve the rich and aristocratic while the matrimonial news boasted 300 ads a week , with most advertisers claiming good looks and good circumstances with the turn of the 20th century , matrimonial papers remained popular , but many mainstream newspapers stopped running personal ads the new york times dropped them as early as the 1870 s , with other papers , like the manitoba free press and the atlanta constitution , following suit in the 1920 s a touch of scandal tended to color this sort of advertising , and newspapers preferred to report on it , not cause it in 1897 , for example , tillie marshall placed an ad stating that she was a young widow with 20 , 000 and matrimonially inclined several men conducted a correspondence with her and sent her money sufficient to travel from san francisco to chicago , washington , and new york none of her admirers actually met the globetrotting vixen before she headed for europe at the expense of yet another suitor , some trusting foreign gentleman the poor young men tricked by mrs marshall probably had it a lot easier than reuben lane that same year he walked on crutches from barnsborough , pa , to topeka , kan , to marry eliza ann parker , a widow 27 years his senior she would n't have him , despite the 36day journey notwithstanding these travails , people have found love through advertising though the personals quieted to a trickle of underground ads in the 1930 s through the 50 s , they began to explode again in the 1960 s of course by then , the content shifted from marriage to sex and dating gay ads emerged incognito in 1946 , in the hobby directory soon , niche publications filled up with items from people freed by the sexual revolution and seeking new adventures a spacesaving system of abbreviations developed as a code among those in the know the personals came of age at the turn of the 21st century , personal ads have become one of the most profitable and popular features of the web , with multitudes of matchmaking sites moving from the shadows and into the mainstream with little patience for cupid , prospective suitors from centuries past right up to the present day have embraced the marketplace perhaps we ca n't buy love , but good ad space is probably the next best thing
central islip , ny , jan 31 attorney general john ashcroft has ordered federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for a murder suspect , even though he had agreed to testify against others tied to a deadly colombian drug ring in exchange for a life sentence a justice department spokeswoman , while declining to comment specifically on the case , said that the department s decisions on capital cases were intended to assure consistency in the application of the federal death penalty lawyers said it appeared to be the first case nationally in which mr ashcroft had insisted on seeking the execution of a defendant who had secured a promise of life in exchange for information some lawyers said his decision here could hamstring federal prosecutors in the toughest cases because it would shake defendants' confidence that a federal prosecutor at the local level could deliver on a proposed deal in a death penalty case mr ashcroft has stirred a controversy in federal prosecutors' offices nationally in recent months by insisting that they seek executions in some cases in which they had recommended against it under justice department rules , local federal prosecutors can only recommend whether to seek the death penalty the final decision is up to the attorney general defense lawyers , and some current and former prosecutors , said the case here has taken that controversy to a new level because the previous cases had not involved potential cooperators the decision in the case , they said , could have repercussions far beyond the death penalty in its effect on negotiations between prosecutors and lawyers but critics claim mr ashcroft s decisions are a method of importing the death penalty to areas of the country where few or no executions have been carried out , like new york in united states district court here today , the charged nature of the plea negotiations was on full display chagrined federal prosecutors acknowledged to a judge that the defendant , jairo zapata , who had agreed to cooperate , would now face a trial in which the death penalty could be imposed this was a surprise to all of us , bonnie s klapper , one of the prosecutors who had negotiated the deal , told judge joanna seybert a defense lawyer , peter j tomao , asked that the terms of mr zapata s aborted deal be sealed because its disclosure could jeopardize his safety federal prosecutors say mr zapata was involved in two killings with others tied to the drug ring in queens judge seybert asked federal marshals to make special security arrangements for mr zapata in prison while he awaits trial it appeared that mr zapata s lawyers had obtained a written and signed agreement in which he had offered to testify line prosecutors typically sign such deals and have them approved by their supervisors in court today , the prosecutors said they had always made it clear that the agreement would be contingent on approval in washington other lawyers said the case could lead to major changes in federal cases across the country jim walden , a former senior federal prosecutor in brooklyn , said it was a remarkably bad decision to superimpose national death penalty policy over local federal prosecutors' judgments about cooperating witnesses it will likely result in fewer murders being solved because fewer defendants will choose to cooperate , mr walden said the federal prosecutor s office in brooklyn , where roslynn r mauskopf is the united states attorney , is the headquarters for federal prosecutors handling cases on long island , including the zapata case this is the second case in the last year in which mr ashcroft rejected a recommendation against the death penalty from the brooklyn federal prosecutors the other case also involved allegations of a killing by people involved in the drug trade when asked about the decision in the zapata case , ms mauskopf issued a statement through a spokesman it backed mr ashcroft s decision , saying mr zapata s violent history and his implication in two murders warrant seeking the death penalty in this case barbara comstock , the justice department s director of public affairs , declined to comment on the zapata case but a statement said the people involved in reviewing death penalty decisions at the justice department in washington have the benefit of seeing the landscape of these cases nationwide , thereby ensuring consistency the statement continued , we believe the process is designed to do exactly what congress intended guarantee the fair implementation of the death penalty the attorney general has the authority to countermand virtually all decisions made by federal prosecutors that has long been clear with regard to death penalty decisions but kevin mcnally , a death penalty defense lawyer based in kentucky , said the justice department practice in previous administrations generally permitted federal prosecutors to make plea deals that would avert execution mr ashcroft changed that practice , he said mr mcnally said his national group , the federal death penalty resource counsel project , which provides information to defense lawyers fighting capital cases , has studied mr ashcroft s death penalty decisions mr ashcroft , he said , has rebuffed local federal prosecutors in 21 cases in which they recommended against the death penalty he said that although mr ashcroft s predecessor , janet reno , had also rejected recommendations against the death penalty , she did so at a far slower pace he said one study found that during a fiveyear period , she insisted on the death penalty in 26 cases mr mcnally said that in the cases in which mr ashcroft had rejected recommendations against the death penalty , he knew of none involving cooperation agreements until the decision in the long island case mr ashcroft s decisions rejecting nodeathpenalty recommendations are often awkward for united states attorneys who must then seek execution even though they or their assistants had opposed it few federal prosecutors have openly expressed disagreement with mr ashcroft when he rejected their recommendations to spare a defendant s life but , as some lawyers noted today , the issue is particularly sensitive for ms mauskopf her main sponsor in winning the united states attorney s position was new york s republican governor , george e pataki , who made restoration of the death penalty a major issue in his first campaign for governor
st petersburg , russia , may 31 president bush affirmed today his commitment to the halfcentury relationship between europe and the united states , but he indicated that he expected traditional allies that opposed him in the war on iraq , like germany and france , to conform to an american vision of a shared future this is no time to stir up divisions in a great alliance , mr bush said in a speech on a warm , sundrenched morning at wawel castle in krakow , poland , before arriving here this evening for meetings with president vladimir v putin of russia and a celebration of st petersburg s founding 300 years ago by peter the great in the transatlantic quarrel over iraq , mr bush said , we have seen unity and common purpose we have also seen debate some of it healthy , some of it divisive europeans who were listening for words of reconciliation from the american president got almost none , while france and germany received an implicit reprimand for their past criticisms of his host , poland , over its steadfast support of the americanled invasion of iraq you also struggled to become a full member of the atlantic alliance , mr bush said to several hundred poles gathered in the small , ivycovered courtyard of the castle , where polish and american flags hung from the balconies yet you have not come all this way , through occupations and tyranny and brave uprisings , only to be told that you must now chose between europe and america poland , he said , is a good citizen of europe , and poland is a good friend of america , and there is no conflict between the two tonight , mr bush and his wife , laura , joined mr putin and other world leaders for a dinner at peterhof palace , the grandest of the czars' summer homes , about 20 miles outside the city on the gulf of finland after the dinner , around 10 pm , the group watched outdoor ballet performances set to the music of russia s greatest composers , with the 1812 overture as the grand finale fireworks displays burst overhead while the skies were still light , in this period known as st petersburg s white nights the city is so close to the arctic circle that in late spring and summer there is only a brief period of twilight between sunset and sunrise mr bush did not speak publicly here tonight he is to have a joint news conference with mr putin on sunday but his words in krakow were heard all over europe the vision of the transatlantic alliance that he put forth there was one that operated under american values i have come to krakow to state the intentions of my country , he said the united states is committed to a strong atlantic alliance , to ensure our security , to advance human freedom and to keep peace in the world but the president did reach out to the alliance for help in solving the middle east conflict and the global problems of aids and poverty to meet these goals of security and peace and a hopeful future for the developing world , we welcome , we need the help , the advice and the wisdom , of our european friends and allies , he said the president made his remarks on the first leg of a sevenday , sixnation trip to europe and the middle east from a site that overlooks the vistula river and kazimierz , the home of the largest jewish population in europe before world war ii by 1943 , the nazis had moved the inhabitants to ghettos or sent them to the nearby concentration camps of auschwitz and birkenau , which mr bush toured with his wife before his speech this morning reporters who accompanied the couple said the president seemed restless and unsettled as he stood next to two reconstructed ovens used to cremate jews killed in the gas chambers , and afterward , he related the experience to the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , on the world trade center and the pentagon and his campaign against terrorism the death camps still bear witness , he said they remind us that evil is real and must be called by name and must be opposed history , he said , asks more than memory , because hatred and aggression and murderous ambition are still alive in the world the events of sept 11 , the president said , were as decisive as the attack on pearl harbor and the treachery of another september in 1939 , when the nazis invaded poland he also noted that poland would soon be a fully integrated member of the european union and strongly praised the nation for the troops it sent to the two wars that have marked the two years of his presidency in the battles of afghanistan and iraq , polish forces served with skill and honor , mr bush said america will not forget that poland rose to the moment he also used his speech to announce an effort to fight the spread and transport of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , which he called the proliferation security initiative he said the united states and its close allies , including poland , had begun working on new agreements to seize illegal weapons and to search planes and ships carrying suspicious cargo over time , we will extend this partnership as broadly as possible to keep the world s most destructive weapons away from our shores and out of the hands of our common enemies , mr bush said white house officials said today that a conference would be organized , probably next month in europe , to begin exploring how the united states and its allies can intercept shipments of arms and suspected nuclear , chemical and biological components last year , the united states intercepted a north korean missile shipment on its way to yemen , but had to release it after the yemenis complained that there was no legal basis for the seizure in st petersburg on sunday , mr bush is expected to discuss concerns regarding iran with mr putin , including russia s continuing assistance to iran s nuclear development projects last spring , during a visit to st petersburg and moscow , mr bush told mr putin that he believed that iran was using the program to develop weapons , and asked him to stop all nuclear aid the russians said they believe that the program was peaceful , but recently have indicated some suspicions about iran s intentions in an interview released by the white house today , mr bush was asked by rtr , the russian state television network , if the united states' next military target was iran and if american forces would use bases in the former soviet republics of azerbaijan and armenia the interview was conducted on thursday in washington we 've had all kinds of reports that we 're going to use force in syria , mr bush said , even though he was not asked about syria and now some on the left , i guess , are saying force in iran or force here and force there you know , it s pure speculation and we used force in iraq after a long , long period of diplomacy he also said in the interview that he supported a strong dollar and that he expected to see it rise as the economy grows he added that the market , at this point in time , has devalued the dollar , which is contrary to our policy remarks by treasury secretary john w snow earlier this month that the dollar s decline was helping exports set off a sale of the currency by those who thought it indicated little american commitment to strengthening it on sunday afternoon , mr bush will leave st petersburg for vianlesbains and a meeting of the world s leading industrialized democracies photo president

moscow , may 12 a truck loaded with explosives blew up near a government complex in northern chechnya today in what officials said was a suicidal terrorist attack the blast killed at least 41 people and wounded scores more , many of them gravely , in a region that had until now escaped the worst of russia s war against chechen separatists the attack today was the worst convulsion of violence in chechnya since russia held a constitutional referendum there in march as part of the kremlin s efforts to hasten a peaceful end to the war after 44 months of violent conflict officials said the death toll already among the worst single attacks in the war could rise still higher none of chechnya s known separatist groups claimed responsibility for the attack , but president vladimir v putin , meeting with his cabinet at the kremlin shortly afterward , said the attack was intended to disrupt efforts to foster some sort of stability in chechnya under a loose political federation with russia all similar actions are aimed at only one thing to stop the process of settlement in chechnya , to stop the process of a political settlement , mr putin told cabinet members in remarks broadcast on television we cannot allow anything like that , and we shall not allow it the attack occurred just after 10 am when the truck with one and perhaps two or three apparent suicide bombers approached a compound of government buildings in the town of znamenskoye , along the terek river near chechnya s border with the stavropol region it exploded , perhaps prematurely , after ramming a steel barricade outside the compound , witnesses told russian news agencies the force of the blast , estimated to come from the equivalent of a ton of tnt , gouged a gaping crater more than 30 feet wide and some 20 feet deep in the road and damaged the headquarters of the regional government , as well as offices of the interior ministry and the federal security service , or fsb , which oversees the campaign against chechnya s separatists although the attack appeared directed at the government buildings , the truck exploded in a residential neighborhood nearby , obliterating several kiosks and homes video broadcast on russian television showed shattered hulks of buildings , broken beams and masonry and mangled mounds of earth , debris and bloodied cloth in an interview on ntv , ruslan daurov , who was inside one of the government buildings , described a hail of shattered glass everything was flowing around us , he said , his head wrapped in a bloodied bandage shouts and moans very many women were injured sultan m akhmetkhanov , the head of the administrative district , said in a telephone interview that at least four homes were completely destroyed and others were badly damaged he said

including at least 6 children in all , 269 people were reported injured 111 were hospitalized , 57 of them in critical condition nikolai p patrushev , the director of the fsb , the kgb s successor , said the truck exploded after stopping at a checkpoint , about 100 feet from a concrete wall surrounding the compound some news reports said security forces opened fire on the truck , but sultan s makhtiyev , the deputy head of the district administration , said in a telephone interview that no one had time to try to stop it before it exploded mr patrushev , speaking in the meeting with mr putin , said that police and security officers were among those killed , but that most of those killed or wounded were civilians interfax reported that the local fsb director , col mairbek khusiyev , had suffered a concussion the attack today was the latest to undercut the kremlin s claims to have largely restored order to the republic , where separatists have struggled to establish an independent republic ever since the soviet union collapsed in 1991 russian forces invaded in 1994 to crush the separatist movement , withdrew in 1996 in humiliating defeat and invaded again in 1999 unable anymore to confront the russians , the separatists , many of them islamic fundamentalists , are waging a campaign using increasingly audacious terrorist tactics that have been seen as a sign of the rebels' desperation in october , chechen guerrillas seized a moscow theater and held nearly 800 people hostage for 57 hours at least 41 guerrillas died , as well as at least 129 hostages , most of them from nerve gas used by russian commandos in the raid that ended the crisis in december , suicide bombers detonated two truck bombs outside the headquarters of chechnya s promoscow administration in grozny , the chechen capital , in circumstances strikingly similar to the attack today , killing more than 70 last month , an explosion killed at least 16 people aboard a bus in an attack that was videotaped and shown on a rebel web site the web site claimed 17 russian and chechen police officers had been killed , but russian officials said the victims were civilians just last friday , a bomb evidently fashioned from an artillery shell exploded outside grozny s stadium before a military parade commemorating victory day , the anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany one policeman died and two others were wounded the head of the promoscow government in chechnya , akhmad kadyrov , blamed the attack today on rebels under aslan maskhadov , the separatist leader a claim that a spokesman for mr maskhadov denied in an interview with ekho moskvy radio mr kadyrov , who often clashes with russian officials , also pointedly questioned the ability of russian forces to provide sufficient security

in a mocking summation , peter gotti s lawyer told jurors yesterday that prosecutors had piled hunches on guesses and had never proved that mr gotti , their star defendant in a wideranging racketeering case , was the leader of the gambino crime family the government has failed completely and utterly and miserably to put any evidence before you that peter gotti is the acting boss of anything , said gerald l shargel mr shargel , perhaps the best known of the lawyers who regularly represent mobsters , wandered the courtroom , gesturing and using fake voices to mimic what he said were government witnesses who tried to trick the jurors into believing there was evidence against mr gotti they ask you to see what they want you to see , he said of the prosecutors they ask you to hear what they want you to hear mr gotti , 63 , is one of seven defendants in a wideranging 68count case that includes allegations of corrupt control of the new york waterfront , illegal gambling and extortion mr gotti is charged with participating in the racketeering conspiracy of the gambino crime family but the specific charges against him center on limited allegations that he laundered money by receiving proceeds of the crime family s illegal acts mr shargel suggested that the prosecutors were most interested in convicting mr gotti , and called him the marquee name of the prosecutors' case after a sixweek trial in which federal prosecutors in brooklyn played hundreds of wiretap tapes , mr shargel worked to turn that same evidence against the government he said there was no proof that mr gotti received cash payments from underlings , and he noted that there were no tape recordings of mr gotti at all prosecutors say that a mafia soldier made regular visits to deliver tribute payments to mr gotti , the older brother of john j gotti , who died in prison last year but none of their witnesses saw payments passed and , as mr shargel repeatedly reminded the jurors , mr gotti was never searched mr shargel said investigators were afraid they would not find any money saying prosecutors had distorted the evidence , mr shargel presented alternate interpretations of government assertions when the prosecutors played tapes of another gotti brother , gene , who is serving a prison term , they claimed he acknowledged that peter gotti was now running the family but , mr shargel denied that assertion and noted that gene gotti also referred to peter , a former sanitation man , with a vulgarity and suggested that he should have continued picking up garbage cans mr shargel s summation followed the final statements of the other six defense lawyers , who picked at the prosecution case , sometimes in exhausting detail one lawyer told the jurors that the government s witnesses were liars , including pathological liars another said a jumpy , hazy surveillance videotape looked like a sonogram one prosecutor delivered a comprehensive summation last week another , andrew m genser , followed mr shargel yesterday with a rebuttal he said mr shargel had tried to distract the jurors , and he urged the panel to put one part of a powerful mafia organization and some of its leaders out of business
dobbs ferry , ny , nov 25 the crime was horrendous , a 14yearold boy sodomized with a broomstick by a 16yearold , while an adult supervisor held him down but the episode , as described by the police in dobbs ferry and by westchester county authorities , was also a window onto something more mundane , the long odds faced both by residents and the children s village treatment center itself , which is confronting an increasingly hard time in caring for 300 of the most troubled children in the foster care system most have been abused and neglected by their parents , and many have serious psychological problems children s village , which began in 1851 as an orphanage in new york city , is struggling to find and retain qualified workers because of a chronic lack of financing by the city and state , child welfare advocates said on tuesday staff workers who care directly for the boys in residential cottages scattered across the 150acre campus have a starting salary of only 20 , 000 a year not even a living wage in westchester county , advocates charge james f purcell , executive director of the council of family and child caring agencies , with 125 members statewide , called on the city and state to increase the streams of money to the network of private agencies that must serve an increasingly troubled group of foster children the last survey we did continued to show that childcare workers are paid very , very low salaries , well below what their counterparts in the public sector make , mr purcell said we are just not able to hire the caliber of staff we know we need the authorities said that last thursday the victim was sodomized with a broomstick by a 16yearold resident , elliot perryman , while jason brown , 29 , an assistant cottage supervisor , held him down both the resident and mr brown were charged with firstdegree aggravated sexual abuse , a felony mr brown , of mount vernon , worked at children s village from 1992 to 1997 in an entrylevel position he returned to the center in june , this time as an assistant cottage supervisor , and he passed all the background checks , said linda stutz , a spokeswoman for the agency most of the boys at children s village come from new york city , ms stutz said many have failed in multiple foster placements , and more than a third take medication for psychiatric disorders financing for the treatment centers comes from a mix of federal , state and local money advocates and the centers themselves say that there was a large cut in state financing in the mid1990 s , and that although some money was added back , the reimbursement rate remains far too low for the past two years , new york city has not paid the full reimbursement rate that the state sets , mr purcell said children s village has had to cut its staff and close a cottage as a result of the money pressures last year , the city said it just did n't have the money and did n't pay it , ms stutz said of the rate a spokeswoman for the new york city administration for children s services , which oversees foster care , said that none of the residents of wolfe cottage , where the episode occurred , were in the city s custody she said in spite of the city s significant fiscal crisis , the agency was paying children s village 95 percent of the state rate
in 1997 , the new york art world discovered south africa curators , collectors , museum directors and art dealers deserted the streets of chelsea to attend the second johannesburg biennial , lured by its charismatic curator , the nigerianborn okwui enwezor , and his stellar list of international artists the event launched the new global art world , and the travelers returned home with a revised map that added johannesburg to paris , london and new york on their art itinerary this news was hardly a surprise to linda givon , who has run the goodman gallery in johannesburg since 1966 widely acknowledged as the most important gallery owner in south africa , ms givon had already seen changes in her country the end of apartheid and the election of nelson mandela in 1994 that were nothing short of miraculous to her since then , it has been possible for her artists a roster that includes william kentridge , zwelethu mthethwa , tracey rose , david goldblatt , penny siopsis , willie bester , sue williamson and kendell geers to emerge from the isolation caused by the economic sanctions against south africa under apartheid and participate fully in museum exhibitions and art fairs in the united states and europe by 1997 , ms givon , who trained in the early 60 s at the grosvenor gallery in london under the tutelage of its founder , the brooklynborn writer , dealer and collector eric estorick , was ready to operate on a global level indeed , in retrospect it seems that decades before the art world descended on johannesburg , ms givon was primed for its arrival oh , if i could have been denise ren , said ms givon , 67 , during a recent trip to new york for the opening of mr mthethwa s show of new photographs at the jack shainman gallery in chelsea ren , the grande dame of paris art during the bleak postwar years of the 1950 s , was an apt choice of a role model for ms givon , who faced a similarly troubled cultural scene when she returned to south africa in 1964 her first gallery space , a storefront on a business strip in hyde park in johannesburg , grew in size as adjacent stores became available six years ago she moved into a spacious , freestanding modern building in the nearby parkwood neighborhood she has evolved into a bit of a grande dame herself , warm and gracious yet authoritative and somewhat intimidating , after decades as the biggest fish in a rather small pond , a pond with some very dangerous waters most of the galleries in johannesburg lauded artists who made pretty scenes of life in the townships , ms givon recalled , so that the white elite who bought these works could believe they were doing their bit for the blacks but were just living with pretty pictures i decided to go for the artists , when i could , who were confrontational and who were addressing socially important issues for ms givon the choice was merely an extension of the aesthetics she had learned at the grosvenor gallery , which specialized in works of the russian avantgarde and the italian futurists but she soon discovered that the reality of running a gallery during apartheid was quite different from selling works of art from revolutionary periods long past i was constantly getting into my car and driving down to the cop shop to bail my artists out for pass offenses , she said , referring to the notorious pass books that all blacks were required to carry openings required cop watchers , who kept an eye out for the special branch police , sure to shut down multiracial gatherings ms givon kept stacks of trays around and handed them to black guests if the police arrived everyone would turn into a waiter , she said we would have more waiters than guests at our openings many of the artists that ms givon showed at the time dumile feni , julian motau and ezrom legae among them came to her through cecil skotnes , a white artist who was the director of the polly street art center , the first art school for blacks in south africa when motau was killed in a domestic dispute in 1969 , ms givon arranged for a memorial show of his work at the association of arts in pretoria , then the bastion of white nationalism , insisting that the reception be open to blacks and whites overcome with emotion at the opening , dumile feni gave ms givon a kiss on her teardrenched cheek the next day , the police arrested ms givon for immorality an afrikaans judge who sat on the board of the arts association came to her defense i stood next to her the whole night and did not see her kiss anyone , she recalled his saying and she was released in 1978 , ms givon showed legae s infamous chicken drawings that represented the murder of stephen biko through pictures of poultry a clever reporter got hold of the story , so the cops arrived and asked , 'where are the biko drawings \? ' ms givon recalled i said 'i do n't know what you are talking about we only have drawings of chickens' the series is now considered an essential example of resistance art and is featured at the south african national gallery
about 10 glen cove restaurant owners were seated around a conference room at the coles house , convened for the first meeting two months ago of a group that does n't yet have a name linda cirigliano , one of owners of the coles house on glen street , a stately restaurantpub that dates back to 1810 , belongs to the glen cove chamber of commerce and approached michael davidson , the group s executive director , to propose that the chamber organize a forum for the city s restaurateurs the idea was that they would meet regularly , that they would promote the city as a dining destination and that , just maybe , they would help one another in other ways as well mr davidson , a career tourism industry marketer who was hired as the chamber s first salaried administrator in september , walked to the front of the room and came right to the point restaurants are a major economic force in the city , mr davidson told his audience , some still dressed in kitchen togs we should flex our muscles more , he said restaurants in general have suffered in the slumping economy , especially expensive ones in glen cove , where three major employers have closed or reduced their operations , restaurant owners are particularly pressed , mr davidson said mr davidson told the restaurateurs to see one another as friendly competitors emphasis on the friendly who benefit from the others' successes mr davidson , who was the executive director of the long island convention and visitors bureau for most of the 90 s , is taking the biggerpiemoreslices approach by promoting glen cove as a restaurant hot spot , he said , there will be more customers for everyone glen cove has a history as a restaurant town there have always been great places to eat there , especially stellar italian spots from the 60 s through the 80 s whitetablecloth ristoranti dominated the scene to a large extent they still do their ranks have thinned in recent years , but la ginestra , la pace and la bussola are still going strong none of them sent representatives to the coles house meeting it was a little like convening major league baseball minus the yankees , the angels and the giants but marie coyle , a financial planner who is president of the chamber , was undaunted i would love to educate them and bring them on board , she said if they got involved in the fledgling association , she said , we would have so much clout ms cirigliano of the coles house said i'm a little disappointed in the turnout today perhaps next meeting everybody here will invite someone else , and our numbers will grow but it will probably take more than numbers , and it wo n't happen with just one meeting most successful entrepreneurs are intensely competitive , and the food business is no exception restaurateurs are characteristically loath to admit that they are doing anything other than turnaway business , especially to a room filled with their competitors , friendly or otherwise ms cirigliano suggested that all the city s restaurants , big or small , established or justopened , would benefit from a cooperative effort , and offered an example from her own experience i was out of mesclun , and i freaked out , she said heads nodded sympathetically she phoned page one , another restaurant in town , and confided the problem to jeanine dimenna , an owner ms cirigliano s timing was excellent ms dimenna was just leaving for restaurant depot , a wholesale supplier in ronkonkoma a few hours later , she dropped off 10 boxes of salad greens in time for the dinner crowd my point is , we all have our own niche , she said i'm not in competition with the pizzeria , or the italian restaurant , or the mexican place they 're not in competition with me we can all help each other out the other restaurateurs looked at her expectantly i have 4 , 000 clients on my mailing list , she said i wo n't give you the list but i will mail things out for you ms cirigliano suggested they start by sharing suggestions for success putting up a menu outside is a good idea , she said , by way of example people want to see a menu they are afraid to walk into a restaurant without knowing what they 're going to pay msdimenna of page one picked up the ball cooking classes are a good idea , she said i had 60 people register for the class the first time i held it that was too big now i have 50 that s a better size the class is held on monday night at the words monday night , her audience perked up visibly \( mondays are traditionally slow \) a chef in the last row of chairs shifted in his seat and was now leaning forward nick stimola , an owner of the adirondack grill , said that he thought the biggest problem facing restaurant owners was the work force you look to build a quality wait staff , and that means they need to have people skills , he said it s so hard to train for that all you can do is hire them , put them out there and see what happens at this , andrea correale had an idea to offer i have a videotape that takes you through hiring a waiter , step by step , said ms correale , who owns elegant affairs , a caterer she offered to lend out her copy of the tape ms cirigliano jumped in in difficult economic times , she said , training waiters is especially important waiters have to sell your wine list , she said you have to teach your wait staff how to sell it mr davidson , the chamber s executive director , stood up again he suggested that the group hold seminars on topics like hiring and training we could do this once a month , he said ms correale seconded the idea angela condello , who owns epiphany restaurant , also on glen street , agreed to hold future meetings of the group the program ended , and people stood up and started exchanging business cards ms condello , who opened her restaurant last year , said it was valuable to meet and talk shop there are things that happen in this business that if you 're not in the business , you ca n't really understand , she said for example , two customers dine together and argue over who pays the bill one person already paid the bill now the other person wants to pay the bill and wo n't accept that the bill is paid how do you handle that \? i think it s good that we 're getting to know one another and have starting talking with one another , she said it can only help photo we should flex our muscles more , michael davidson of the glen cove chamber of commerce , center , told the restaurateurs \( phil marino for the new york times \)
la paz , bolivia , march 21 isabel ortega , a fullblooded aymaraquechua indian who dresses in the black bowler and heavily layered 19thcentury dress common to her people , is one of bolivia s newest members of congress but that has not kept guards from trying to bar her from the ornate building where the halls of power have long been the exclusive domain of buttoneddown descendants of europeans the guards would say , 'how can you come in \? ' and then they pushed me out , said ms ortega , 49 they would say , 'an indian is coming into the palace' such racism and resistance have not stopped ms ortega , who is part of a new congress with three times as many indigenous lawmakers as the last one nor have they deterred a growing number of other leaders from forgotten classes across latin america who are promising a political and economic upheaval they and their supporters are organizing as never before and using new , more open democracies to take on the traditional , lightskinned ruling classes they blame for keeping their countries mired in poverty and their people on the sidelines of power for 500 years whether filled with indians in the andes , blacks and mixedrace caboclos and mulatos in brazil or the poor of argentina s outlying provinces , the ranks of these new political movements are united by the dark color of their skin and their low economic station with popular protests and new political parties , they are challenging the orthodoxy of market reforms as the region faces its worst economic crisis in decades in the process , latin america s political landscape is being redrawn parties that have been the pillars of governments from caracas to quito to buenos aires are collapsing or fast losing influence latin america is undergoing a fundamental redefinition of identity , said elisa carrio , the leading antiestablishment candidate in the presidential election scheduled in argentina in april that identity is being tinkered with in different ways in each country , she said , because we are all different and not a single package , but there is one thing in common we are finally electing leaders who look like the people they represent in bolivia and peru , this change has been accompanied by violent protests elsewhere , it has meant the rise of new leaders like president luiz in cio lula da silva in brazil , a former labor leader born a peasant , and lucio guti rrez in ecuador , a former army colonel who led the coup that overthrew president jamil mahuad , a harvardeducated favorite of the international monetary fund , in january 2000 mr guti rrez was elected president in november after railing against traditional politicians and promising to cut poverty and scale back market reforms he was supported by a powerful indigenous movement , pachakutik , and inspired in part by another former army colonel and coup plotter , president hugo ch vez of venezuela in mr ch vez , the many darkskinned people of caracas s poor barrios believe they have found a powerful spokesman and the nation s traditional political and business class , a reviled antagonist in the last year , ch vez supporters have defended his fouryearold presidency against weeks of strikes by an opposition whose leaders are mostly of european descent these new latin american leaders do not offer a uniform solution to region s problems but their political base is decidedly anchored on the left , and all have toyed with the populism that has been a staple of latin american politics since the 1930 s what they have in common is the promise to replace the policies pushed by the international monetary fund with a return to a system of stateowned companies and protected markets it is not very well thought out , but it is the opposite of the status quo , said amy chua , author of a new book , the world on fire how exporting free market democracy breeds ethnic hatred and global instability the problem with these policies is they are more anti than affirmative anything mr ch vez , who introduced a new constitution in venezuela and is redirecting oil profits toward social programs , has taken the most aggressive tack others , like evo morales , the head of bolivia s main opposition movement , emphasize the traditions of indigenous people who have organized their communities collectively for generations more moderate leaders have begun groping for a middle ground between appeasing the powerful financial and capital markets of a global economy and addressing the complaints of those who feel excluded from the benefits of more than a decade of marketdriven economic reforms but the path is proving treacherous in peru , a host of independent movements , several with strong indigenous representation , swept recent regional elections and are eroding the standing of the marketfriendly government of president alejandro toledo in brazil and ecuador , the new governments have leaned toward fiscal prudence rather than following through immediately on promises to redistribute wealth disappointed followers are already criticizing both mr guti rrez and mr da silva , who assumed brazil s presidency on jan 1
indianapolis , nov 30 the colts' offense is often strokes of beauty in the rca dome on sunday , it singed the new england defense for four touchdown passes by peyton manning , 26 first downs , 370 total yards and 24 points in the second half but in the end , when the bubbly colts offense needed a yard , it not only failed but lost a yard thus , an indianapolis game of allornothing in style and production wound up as nothing for the colts in a 3834 loss to new england before 57 , 102 fans new england \( 102 \) plays division menace miami at home next sunday , and indianapolis plays at division power tennessee in huge games that will shape playoff positioning both indianapolis \( 93 \) and new england wanted this game badly to build momentum for next weekend only new england got it it won its eighth straight game two have come in overtime and three of the last four have been won by 4 points or less they remind me of the teams we had in tampa that grew accustomed to playing in close games because they knew they would win them , colts coach tony dungy said there was a lot that happened throughout the game , but not much seemed to bother them we called the plays we like to call down there and got the ball to the 1yard line but just could n't get it in patriots linebacker willie mcginest was the roadblock with 1 minute 9 seconds remaining and the colts driving for the winning score , mcginest was lying on the turf flat on his back because of a knee injury but with 11 seconds left , he was in the colts' backfield tackling edgerrin james on a fourthand1 run that mcginest stopped at the new england 2 when mcginest had been injured , the officials called timeout , even though new england had none left when mcginest returned a handful of snaps later for his big play , he looked fast and strong that was an amazing recovery , manning said i thought they should have been penalized for having to stop the clock with no timeouts , but that did n't go our way either and we had some injuries early in the game that knocked some of our guys out and kept us from using our usual goalline offense mcginest said he was not going to stay on the sideline for the fourthdown play he said the colts' slot receiver was aligned near his side , so he turned toward him as if he were going to drop back in coverage mcginest said that manning saw that and changed the play to a run so , i crept , i crept , mcginest said i saw the play coming and i was right there he was in the backfield with arms locked around james before james could reach the line of scrimmage the patriots' offense took over , knelt and ran off the final 11 seconds game over i would never fake an injury , mcginest said i would never fake it and get off the field and miss plays in a game like that they moved the ball on us , but when it came down to it we held it down the colts scoffed at mcginest s injury claim they were certain , however , that they had dug holes too deep by falling behind by 100 in the first quarter and by 2410 at halftime when new england scored on bethel johnson s 92yard kickoff return on the final play of the half we would have stole it if somehow we had been able to come all the way back and win this thing , manning said it took us a while to get on track whatever the drama and all that , it was just a big , fat l the patriots were leading , 3124 , with 10 21 left when manning tossed a 6yard touchdown pass to receiver troy walters tom brady answered with a 13yard scoring strike to receiver deion branch that gave new england a 3831 lead with 8 36 remaining the colts kicked a field goal with 3 27 left and began their final drive at the new england 48 with 2 57 remaining manning and the offense clicked fortyseven yards were easily gained one yard was not and that last stand began on a firstandgoal from the new england 2 james ran at right tackle for 1 yard james ran up the middle for no gain timeout colts manning threw an incomplete pass james meets mcginest game over the colts live and die with the big play , patriots cornerback ty law said they can lose 2 yards and then hit you with 20 but as the field shortens up , when you get down in the red zone and there is only so much field left to play with , we get tougher and we get tighter in a situation like that , 1 yard can seem like 100 photo new england defensive tackle dan klecko grabbed hold of indianapolis quarterback peyton manning yesterday and would not let go \( photo by getty images \) \( pg d4 \)
a selective listing by critics of the times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in new york city denotes a highly recommended film ratings and running times are in parentheses now playing blue car , starring david strathairn and agnes bruckner written and directed by karen moncrieff \( r , 87 minutes \) mr strathairn delivers one of the most exquisitely nuanced performances of his career as mr auster , a high school english teacher tempted to seduce his star pupil , meg \( ms bruckner \) , a beautiful and talented aspiring poet the characters are carefully rendered in shades of gray the teacher is a sensitive aesthete and a caring friend , but also a lecher and a literary impostor meg , who grew up with her mother and her emotionally troubled younger sister in a home scarred by divorce , is part angel , part surly teenage rebel the movie is an impressive debut for ms moncrieff , whose wisedup psychological radar takes in both sides of every situation \( stephen holden \) confidence , starring edward burns , rachel weisz , andy garcia , dustin hoffman and paul giamatti directed by james foley \( r , 98 minutes \) it has quite a lot of it , most of it misplaced mr burns is a con man who narrates , in long expository flashbacks , a convoluted tale of doublecrosses and zigzags the screenwriter doug jung s dialogue has flashes of pungency and wit , and mr foley s direction is smooth and lively , but their skill is applied to a lifeless , derivative exercise in attitude that plays like a desperate emulation of david mamet or elmore leonard mr burns , as usual , is much too busy overestimating his cleverness and charm to do much acting , and ms weisz does not even rise to the femme fatale ridiculousness of her part only mr giamatti and mr hoffman , indulging in egregious lowlife hamming , are any fun to watch \( a o scott \) daddy day care , starring eddie murphy and jeff garlin directed by steve carr \( pg , 93 minutes \) the most astonishing thing about this film a comedy that would have to work harder to justify even the appellation uninspired is that a kick in the groin is now a joke for toddlers they are both the target audience and the costars of this eddie murphy vehicle more of a big wheel really in daddy day care , intended for those who take their apple juice in sippy cups , mr murphy is an outofwork marketing executive with no real interest in children outside his own son he decides to open a day care center with phil \( mr garlin \) , his pal and equally fired colleague , who s a little afraid of his own son the extremely flimsy connective tissue is mr murphy , who barely bothers to do takes he 'll raise an eyebrow here and there , but he mostly uses a voice so smooth and warm you could pour it over pancakes in this context he can get away with it because he knows that the movie will do most of the work for him the very young audience is so primed to react to him as eddie murphy that it s surprising the children in the cast do n't call him eddie he s beverly hills pop you ca n't get more highconcept , or less plotted , that this daddy day care is a series of trailers for nickelodeon , most of which feature mr garlin getting attacked by something angry , either kids or bees , and probably , in the sequel , kids of bees \( elvis mitchell \) the dancer upstairs , starring javier bardem and laura morante directed by john malkovich \( r , 128 minutes \) mr malkovich s directorial debut is not the hammy manifesto you 'd expect from the silentfilm director he played in shadow of the vampire or for that matter the tantrummy , preening brat of being john malkovich and adaptation dancer , adapted for the screen by nicholas shakespeare from his own novel , is a stoic tease of a movie mr malkovich proves his devotion to actors , lingering on them during moments of silence agustin rejas \( mr bardem \) , a lawyer turned police officer , is tracking a pack of guerrillas led by a man known as ezequiel ezequiel s career traces the same steps as the life of abimael guzm n , the philosophy professor turned leader of peru s shining path terrorist collective , right down to his capture determined , solicitous and calm , rejas goes about his job , sifting through the wreckage physical and emotional in ezequiel s wake mr bardem plays rejas with a morose wit , a cheekiness that registers almost as an afterthought he exudes a weary professionalism because his manner is the only tool that keeps him from being subsumed by depression mr bardem s performance is different from anything he has done before the vivacious reinaldo arenas of before night falls and the brooding paraplegic of live flesh were characters who could n't hide the tremors of emotion that rocked them to the very core the balance of propriety suggests the ritual distance and emotional intelligence of graham greene , as characters simply go through their doomed motions \( mitchell \) down with love , starring ren e zellweger , ewan mcgregor , sarah paulson and david hyde pierce directed by peyton reed \( pg13 , 100 minutes \) this brightly colored romp is both a loving tribute to the rock hudsondoris day technicolor comedies of the late 1950 s and early 60 s and a revisionist critique of their moldy sexual politics ms zellweger and mr mcgregor are thinner and wirier than their predecessors , but their timing and energy are impressive , as is mr reed s fanatical regard for the look , sound and tone of the old pictures this one unfolds in a fairy tale 1962 manhattan , its streets thronged with boxy cabs and impossibly stylish dressers what is missing , though , is the subtext of sexual and social panic that made the earlier movies so bracing in their silliness ms zellweger s protofeminist firebrand , an apostle of workplace equality and sex without love , tangles with mr mcgregor s playboy journalist , with matrimony the ordained result mr hydepierce and ms paulson are the neurotic second couple , and the romantic high jinks are fairly well managed but the laughter ultimately grows out of complacency rather than confusion , and the teasing naughtiness , at this late date , seems more dutiful than daring \( scott \)
baghdad , iraq , march 29 one of iraq s top leaders said today that saddam hussein s government was ready to meet the overwhelming military superiority of the united states by resorting to widespread suicide attacks against americans and british troops and all who support them , both inside iraq and elsewhere in the arab world vice president taha yassin ramadan , ranked no 3 in the iraqi hierarchy , said at a news conference that the soldier who killed four americans in a suicide attack earlier today outside the holy city of najaf was the first in a wave of iraqis and other arab volunteers ready to become martyrs arabs outside iraq , he said , should help turn every country in the world into a battlefield in an hourlong display of defiance and threat , mr ramadan , regarded as one of the most zealous of the men around mr hussein , said there were battalions of arab militants arriving in baghdad to join the fanatical paramilitaries known here as the fedayeen , or martyrs for god those men , he said , were eager to follow the example of ali hammadi alnamani , the iraqi soldier posing as a taxi driver who was identified by the baghdad government as the bomber who killed the american soldiers at najaf the american forces in iraq , mr ramadan said , had seen nothing yet , compared with what lay ahead from the arab volunteers these are not suicide fighters , mr ramadan said , but men following in a long tradition of martyrdom in the islamic world those who commit suicide are desperate people , he said they are not filled as the martyrs are with faith and confidence in the arab nation and in their homeland he added i say to the united states administration , that it will turn the whole world into people who are willing to die for their nations the aggressors think that their b52 s carry bombs of such weight that they are capable of killing an unlimited number of people should we wait until arabs are capable of making bombs to counter that \? no , all they can do is turn themselves into human bombs if the b52 bomber can kill 500 people at one time , i am sure that our operations by freedom fighters will be able to kill 5 , 000 people mr namani , the soldier who killed the americans , was lauded as a hero on iraqi state television tonight the broadcasts said mr hussein , who was shown earlier meeting with top military officers , had awarded the dead man two posthumous medals mr ramadan hinted that similar attacks were being prepared you will hear more good news in the coming days , he said the people of iraq will receive the aggressors in the way that they should be received the iraqi official implied that many of the arab volunteers for suicide attacks had come to baghdad from the persian gulf states whose governments were supporting the americanled war , and from saudi arabia it was now time , he said , for the populations of those countries to support iraq in its decisive battle with america , and turn every country in the arab world into a battlefield , not only against those who wear the military uniforms of the united states and the united kingdom , but against all who support them although overheated polemics are a feature of the baghdad leadership , no member of the group around mr hussein has ever explicitly embraced suicide attacks as a potential iraqi weapon mr hussein announced last year that he would pay 25 , 000 to the family of any palestinian suicide bomber , and rallies have been held on the west bank to celebrate the iraqi funds but in its efforts to avoid a new war with the united states , the baghdad government vehemently insisted , up to only 10 days ago , that it was not a rogue state that it had no banned chemical , biological or chemical weapons , and no ties to terrorist groups today , that insistence was effectively abandoned any method that stops or kills the enemy will be used , mr ramadan said while iraq sent its first suicide bomber against the americans , the united states early this morning had its own surprise for the iraqis american tomahawk missiles struck directly through the roof of iraq s 11story information ministry in baghdad , forcing officials to abandon the building and move an important part of iraq s war effort , its propaganda machine , across the tigris river to the palestine hotel along with the stiff resistance iraqi fighters have mounted against american troops advancing toward baghdad , the government here has sought to marshal world opinion to its side with accounts of its struggle against america that has made the information ministry , in effect , part of iraq s front line , its principal task to raise international protests against the united states and britain to the point where , the iraqis hope , the allies will be forced to abandon the effort to overthrow mr hussein the missile attack came at around 1 15 am , and reduced satellite dishes and other communications antennas on the roof to scrap metal , still visible from the ground but punctured with holes like collanders

cleveland , july 10 if a yankees starter works deep into a game , chances are sterling hitchcock will not work at all hitchcock , a former starter , is the yankees' long reliever he was also manager joe torre s best option in the 10th inning of a tie game at jacobs field tonight that fact points out the yankees' dire need for bullpen help but tonight , the lefthanded hitchcock had every reason to feel confident he was starting an inning , facing the top of the cleveland indians' order , and he liked the matchups the first and third hitters were switchhitters who would have to bat righthanded the second hitter was a lefty none of that mattered after hitchcock walked the leadoff man , coco crisp he hung a curveball to the next hitter , matt lawton , who bashed it to right for a double an intentional walk loaded the bases , and jody gerut lined a single up the middle to give cleveland a 32 victory walking that guy to lead off the inning , that s the last thing you want to do , hitchcock said the last thing the yankees expected was to lose a series to the indians , a fourthplace team well below 500 but cleveland took two of three games in this series , and the yankees flew to toronto with their american league east lead over boston reduced to two games bullpen help may be on the way if the righthander antonio osuna returns as expected this weekend but for now , torre s options are limited roger clemens worked seven innings tonight , and chris hammond shut out cleveland for the next two torre has used closer mariano rivera in games with the score tied on the road , but he decided not to this time i looked at mel , he looked at me , torre said , referring to the pitching coach , mel stottlemyre , and we said , 'we need someone to hold them here hitchcock was not the answer , but he was not alone in taking blame for the loss the yankees' hitters squandered opportunities they put the leadoff man on base in six of the first eight innings , but scored just twice alfonso soriano was picked off twice in the ninth , jorge posada singled with one out off danys baez but ruben sierra struck out , bringing up raul mondesi the slumping mondesi entered the game as a pinchhitter in the seventh and was angry with torre for not starting him but with a chance for a big hit , mondesi struck out on a 95 mileanhour fastball , ending the inning more times than not , we come through , clemens said but it was tough for us tonight to hear clemens talk about his own effort , it was a wonder the game was so close the indians managed almost nothing off clemens other than ben broussard s tworun homer in the second , but clemens felt helpless on the mound it was just a constant battle to make good pitches , said clemens , who pitched for the last time in cleveland , where he made his major league debut on may 15 , 1984 i fought my way through and tried to keep us in the ballgame , but i did n't have much tonight he lasted seven innings , striking out six and allowing seven hits and two walks before heading into the dugout after the seventh , clemens waited on the field to acknowledge hideki matsui , who had made a sliding catch to rob crisp of a hit for the second out matsui made another stellar play in the ninth , throwing out jhonny peralta for the final out when peralta tried to stretch a single to a double but the defensive highlights were obscured by the lackluster hitting robin ventura was out of the lineup the first two games this series , resting against lefthanded starters he had two atbats tonight , flying out and grounding into a double play to extended his slump to 3 for 33 torre pinchhit mondesi for ventura in the seventh , trailing 21 , when the indians relieved starter jason davis with the lefthander alex herrera mondesi walked to load the bases , and with no outs , the yankees had a chance to take command but another pinchhitter , curtis pride , grounded into a double play , tying the score but shortening the rally soriano struck out , ending the inning and prolonging a miserable night he was picked off twice by davis , off first base in the first inning and off second base in the sixth i always try to steal the base , soriano said i know that he has a good move , because somebody told me he has a good move but he got me at first base and second base , too and the indians got the yankees , a firstplace team with flaws inside pitch the indians' milton bradley apologized to jason giambi in the 10th inning for barreling into him with his shoulder while crossing first base on a grounder in the third giambi , whose back was to bradley on the play , looked angry and took a few steps toward bradley , who trotted off but he accepted the apology later he s a good kid and a great player , giambi said we 're straight starter jos contreras , who is on the disabled list with a strained shoulder , said he would have another magnetic resonance imaging test on wednesday and hoped to pitch off a mound after that photo the indians' jody gerut after driving in the winning run off the yankees lefthander sterling hitchcock in the 10th inning the indians won two of the three games in the series \( associated

doctors in china have achieved the first pregnancy in an infertile woman using a technique that was devised in the united states but dropped here when its chief advocate shied away from seeking regulatory approval the case raises the perplexing question of whether tough regulation in this country is driving promising work abroad or is simply protecting american women from experimental procedures that could endanger their health or that of any resulting offspring the technique was pioneered by dr james grifo of the new york university school of medicine in an effort to help infertile women whose eggs , though fertilized by sperm , are unable to develop because of defects in the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus of each egg cell to circumvent that problem , the nucleus from an infertile woman s fertilized egg is removed and transferred to a healthier egg , from another woman , that has had its own nucleus removed the resulting hybrid egg is then placed in the infertile woman s womb , where , if all goes well , it will develop into a healthy baby the nyu researchers , with the approval of the medical school s institutional review board , tried the technique in 1998 on several patients who did not become pregnant they abandoned the quest after the food and drug administration , alarmed about possible adverse consequences from fastmoving reproductive technologies , asserted that all such experiments must get regulatory approval dr grifo deemed the time , effort and money he would probably need to comply with the fda requirements too burdensome , so he gave up and passed his technique and data on to chinese scientists their experiment , reported at a scientific conference this week , resulted in three developing fetuses , none of which survived one was removed in utero to give the others a better chance the other two died in the experiment the researchers insist that the deaths were from causes unrelated to the procedure , but the disastrous outcome inevitably raises questions as to whether this procedure can safely be tried in humans without far more animal research and other preparatory work the work is potentially beneficial to a small percentage of infertile women , but the fda is quite right to look closely before allowing it to proceed in this country the chinese government , meanwhile , has recently banned further use of the technique there

ramallah , west bank , july 19 less than three months on the job as the reluctant palestinian prime minister , struggling to persuade palestinians of the value of a new peace plan and israelis of his ability to put it into effect , mahmoud abbas faces a crucial week of diplomacy it is a week bracketed by a meeting on sunday with prime minister ariel sharon of israel , at which he plans to demand an israeli pullout from at least two more palestinian cities , and his first white house meeting on friday with president bush , at which he plans to ask for more financial help in his first interview with an american newspaper , in his modest office here over an appliance store , mr abbas spoke tonight about his negotiating strategy , his relationship with yasir arafat and his vision for palestinian statehood he argued that it was in the palestinians' interest to halt violence , respect israelis as neighbors , and pursue a state only in the west bank and gaza strip asked why he remains unpopular among palestinians , he said i'm not looking for popularity i'm looking to do the proper thing mr abbas , 67 , who shunned the spotlight for decades as a palestinian official and negotiator , was appointed this spring by mr arafat as the first palestinian prime minister , under international pressure since then , he has focused on restoring the palestinians' allbutsevered ties to washington and embarking on the new peace plan , known as the road map while expressing gratitude for 20 million promised by mr bush as washington s first direct aid to the palestinian authority , mr abbas said he planned to ask him for more money to help rebuild palestinian schools , sewers and other infrastructure destroyed by israel during the 33month conflict he also showed a map of historic palestine that he said he intended to display to the president to demonstrate that in seeking a state in the west bank and gaza , palestinians were asking for 22 percent of that land mr bush said in a speech last month that the holy land must be shared , and mr abbas said he wanted to note that it would not be a 5050 split that helped explain why , he said , palestinians would not accept any israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza , which israel occupied in the war in 1967 he said he expected israel to stop expanding its settlements immediately , as specified in the first phase of the peace plan but , he added with a smile , referring to the ancient , competing claims here , it s better not to talk about history or religion he said it was very important for palestinian leaders to continue working to persuade all palestinians to settle for a state only in the occupied territories our people are pragmatic , he said throughout a twohour conversation in english , mr abbas repeatedly sounded that note of pragmatism , emphasizing practical steps that he said would coax both sides toward a lasting peace israelis , he said , need security , and we should provide them with security then , he said , israelis would be willing to give up the settlements if you ask the ordinary people inside israel and inside the settlements they want peace , he said and if it is given to them , they wo n't want to hold the settlements mr abbas has come under harsh attack inside the palestinian leadership for opposing all palestinian violence one official recently accused him of turning palestinians into terrorists , after decades of what that official considered a freedom fight some israeli military officials have seized on the temporary suspension in palestinian attacks to declare victory in the conflict but mr abbas said halting all violence was the only way to achieve palestinians' goal of statehood palestinians overwhelmingly consider attacks on soldiers and settlers in the west bank and gaza to be legitimate resistance to occupation maybe it s legitimate , mr abbas said but , he said , if such attacks resume , we will return to the cycle of violence , because the israelis will retaliate palestinians would only lose , he said mr abbas is a diplomat where mr arafat , his colleague of four decades , is a politician , and their difference in style is marked so far , mr abbas s style plays better abroad , while mr arafat s more bombastic approach helps to sustain his broad popularity at home mr abbas did not dwell in the interview on israeli tactics during the conflict , as mr arafat tends to do in public remarks while mr arafat wears an arab headdress and fatigues , mr abbas leaves his silver hair uncovered and is given to bland suits tonight he wore a brown suit , brown socks , brown shoes and a beige shirt complemented by a reddishbrown tie his manner was similarly mild , though he leaned forward in his chair when it was suggested to him that in denouncing violence , he was seeking to satisfy the bush administration i satisfied myself , he said sharply , adding that we have to meet our obligations under the peace plan it s not for you , he said , referring to the americans it s not for the israelis it s for us
a hollywood video store manager was indicted yesterday on charges that he repeatedly sexually abused five of his employees and raped one of them a bronx grand jury indicted the manager , eugene cabble , 24 , of brooklyn , on 16 counts , including rape , sexual abuse , and attempted rape , and his bail was raised to 30 , 000 from 5 , 000 yesterday , said steven reed , a spokesman for the bronx district attorney the indictment came a week after four women and two female teenagers sued hollywood video superstores and three of its managers , including mr cabble they claimed that the company had ignored their complaints about sexual harassment and attacks by mr cabble they also said the company s district and regional managers had disregarded numerous complaints about his behavior from them , from their customers , and from other employees in the coop city mall where they worked finally , the women said the company had retaliated against them by transferring , suspending or firing them after they complained the offenses escalated , apparently unchecked , as the manager told his victims that he was invincible and that no one would listen to their complaints , they said one by one , they reported , their hours were cut back , or they were transferred or fired in interviews this week , two of the alleged victims said that mr cabble s offensive comments turned into grabbing , then groping in a backroom , where , they said , he usually turned off the surveillance camera one of the women said he tried to sodomize her and that she complained about him to at least five company officials , none of whom took action against mr cabble on march 1 , according to court papers , he raped an employee at her home and was later arrested the prosecution sought 25 , 000 bail , but the judge released mr cabble on his own recognizance , and he immediately went back to work , where the harassment continued , the victims said two weeks later , another victim went to the police , reporting an earlier attack , and mr cabble was arrested again and charged with 17 counts , including sexual abuse , unlawful imprisonment and attempted sodomy the suit claims that the company s managers , by their acts and failure to act , unleashed and condoned the behavior of a sexual predator mr cabble has been suspended with pay from his job , said eric english , senior vice president of legal affairs for hollywood video two calls to mr cabble s lawyer were not returned yesterday mr english said he believed the company s procedures to address sexual harassment work and have been followed in mr cabble s case some of the things that have been alleged will be difficult to substantiate without speaking directly with the people who filed the lawsuit , he said our goal is simply to find out anything and everything that may have happened he strongly denied the victims' claim that the company had punished them for complaining about mr cabble i see absolutely no evidence of retaliation , he said yesterday the store s 55yearold assistant manager , who was making 925 an hour after working at the store 15 months , said that she was suspended an hour after police officers came to the store to investigate the rape complaint , and that she was fired eight days later for theft of services , a charge she denies she said she felt physically ill , knowing that these women were being assaulted , and being powerless to do anything one saleswoman , who was 21 at the time and making 535 an hour , said one night he asked me to have his baby he made me clock out and go home and sleep on it , and when i 'd come back i 'd see if i have a job speaking on condition that she not be identified , she said that the day after she reported her problems with mr cabble to the district manager , mr cabble pulled her by the neck and held her against the door , telling her that he was more powerful than the district manager , and that it didnot matter what she said or did when she was working christmas night , she said , he pulled her into his office , pulled some of her clothes off , tied her hands behind her back and climbed on top of her i was fighting him , and he finally got fed up , and told me to go home , she said she said she complained to the district manager , a regional vice president and an employee relations worker , but the company did nothing the district manager , however , told her he had seen the surveillance videotape of mr cabble s christmas attack on her , she said in the suit two weeks later she was transferred to a nearby store , she said other employees in the case said that whenever they rebuffed mr cabble s advances , he told them to clock out , thereby docking their pay after the rape allegation , the women contacted rebecca dell'aglio , director of women s rights at work , an outreach project sponsored by citizen action of new york , who put them in touch with the law firm of storch amini munves , which is now representing them with lowerincome women of color , harassers and companies that retaliate assume they are illinformed of their rights and ca n't afford representation , ms dell'aglio said the saleswoman , who speaks in a soft voice , explained why she stepped forward i have three nieces , and that could 've been them , she said i was there by myself i was scared , and i did n't want it to happen to anybody else
the tree stood a bit crooked , and the only thing under it was an empty box covered in wrapping paper , but considering what isabel feliz and her family had gone through in the past two months , what was surprising was that they had a christmas tree at all on the morning of oct 13 , katherine , 12 , alyssa , 9 , and robinson , 4 , ms feliz s grandchildren , were pulled out of bed by their uncle william , who was staying with them while their mother , olga , visited ms feliz in her native dominican republic he told the children that olga had become sick and that they had to go to the dominican republic to pray for her they boarded a plane without asking questions , but alyssa suspected that something more was going on i was the one with the big ear , she said i heard my uncle say on the phone that something bad had happened , and i kept wanting to say , 'tell me what happened to my mother ! ' once they arrived in the dominican republic , the feliz children learned the truth their mother had died of a heart attack in the middle of the night i did n't believe it at first , katherine said none of us knew what to do when the children flew back to their home in new york after the funeral , ms feliz went with them even though she had lived her entire life in the dominican republic , she knew that she had to move to the united states to take care of her grandchildren there was a need here , ms feliz , who speaks spanish , said through an interpreter it was difficult to leave home , but these are my grandchildren i'm like a mother to them other relatives had the same reaction when the family met in new york to talk about who would take care of the children permanently , so many people showed up that they had to find a bigger room for the meeting but even with so many voices and opinions , a decision was easily reached as soon as she can , the children s aunt marina , along with her husband and two sons , who are 19 and 20 , will move from puerto rico to new york to raise katherine , alyssa and robinson until then , the children are not hurting for caretakers uncle william , who lives in the bronx , stops by their washington heights apartment daily aunt yolanda takes them to and from school and helps run errands uncle dante comes up from his home in pennsylvania every week ms feliz is there to take care of the house , make toast and juice in the morning and put the children to bed at night though she has vast experience in child rearing she has 13 children of her own ms feliz , 68 , says that this is different things have changed since her youngest child was still living at home now you have to explain to children why they have to obey you , she said , laughing but ms feliz is dealing with more than just the rebelliousness of youth she is still grieving for olga i was destroyed when she died , she said she gestured toward a portrait of olga that hangs on the wall every day , i see this picture , and i just ca n't bear it but ms feliz is pulling through , with the help of her very united family and the children s aid society , one of seven charities supported by the new york times neediest cases fund children s aid first became involved with the family when olga enrolled robinson in its head start program in september after olga died , jeanette then , a children s aid family worker , requested 76068 from the neediest cases so the children could buy winter coats , new shoes and other clothes katherine found a skyblue coat with fauxfur trim , robinson a thick puffy brown jacket , and alyssa a longer coat with what she called a funny hood the feliz children are now sure they will be warm for the rest of the winter , but it is less clear whether their other needs will be met their uncle william has been struggling to earn enough as an auto mechanic to support his own family and to pay the 1 , 000amonth rent for the apartment where the children and ms feliz now live however , no one in this tightknit family is complaining for her part , ms feliz says that taking care of three grandchildren is not a difficult undertaking i ca n't say that i'm at all fatigued , she said i do this out of love , so it does n't exhaust me at all how to help checks payable to the new york times neediest cases fund should be

an investigation of a fatal shooting by a police officer in brooklyn on jan 2 has been stymied by a lack of witnesses with a clear view of the officer at the instant of the shooting , according to several law enforcement officials prosecutors from the office of the brooklyn district attorney , charles j hynes , and investigators from the police department s internal affairs bureau , who are investigating the shooting on the afternoon of jan 2 in bensonhurst , have said that they think the officer may have discharged his weapon by accident , either as he banged on a window of a minivan with his pistol or as the minivan jostled him but officials from both agencies said more investigative work needed to be done before prosecutors presented evidence to a grand jury , as is standard in fatal police shootings the brooklyn shooting was one of four fatal police shootings that occurred in the first two days of the new year police commissioner raymond w kelly has said that preliminary investigations found that the other three appeared justified the incident occurred after officers chasing a stolen minivan corralled the driver in heavy traffic on 86th street near bay parkway during the afternoon rush , and the driver crashed back and forth into a bus in front of him and a car behind him in an effort to escape , the police said about half a dozen officers surrounded the van , and one , in an effort to pull the driver out , broke a driver s side middle window with the butt of his gun , and another , officer john brennan , tried to open the driver s door with his left hand while banging on the window with his pistol in his right hand , several officials said at that point , officer brennan fired a single shot , striking john lagattuta , 35 , once in the left shoulder , officials said mr lagattuta died later at victory memorial hospital officer brennan , 35 , a fiveyear veteran assigned to the 60th precinct , has not yet been interviewed by investigators prosecutors typically request no interviews be conducted in cases in which the degree of an officer s fault has not been determined because the interviews are mandatory , the officer receives immunity for any statements officer brennan had never been involved in a shooting and has had no civilian complaints against him , officials said he is on administrative duty pending the outcome of the investigation police investigators have interviewed more than 20 officers and one witness who has been identified as the only civilian known to have had anything approaching a clear view based on those interviews , several officials said , it remains unclear what caused officer brennan s gun to discharge as he tried to open the minivan door none of the police witnesses have said they had a clear view of the incident the civilian , who was seated in a car in traffic beside the stolen van , saw officer brennan bang on the window with his gun , but told investigators that he did not realize a shot had been fired , one senior law enforcement official said some of the officers around the van thought more than a single shot had been fired , apparently because of the sounds of the other officer s breaking the van s window or the sound of the van s hitting other vehicles , officials said investigators have said they are certain only the single shot was fired one officer called a report of shots fired into his radio , apparently before officer brennan fired his 9millimeter glock service pistol , because he heard what he thought were two shots and saw the officer who broke the middle window bleeding from the hand , officials said officer brennan s lawyer , stuart london , would not discuss any details , but said , after a thorough investigation is completed in this case , it will be apparent to everyone that this officer acted reasonably under the circumstances

a grand tour of russia s past alexander sokurov s russian ark has been doing record business in art houses across the country since it was released in december , and last week it passed the magic 1 million mark in grosses , with openings in portand , ore , and boston a million dollars may not be much for hollywood movies , but for an avowedly avantgarde russianlanguage film from one of the most challenging directors at work today , it s an impressive sum , and it suggests that an audience beyond the cinephile core has taken the movie to heart shot on video in a single , unbroken 90minute take , mr sokurov s film takes the viewer on a tour of russian history , using the grand interiors of the state hermitage museum in st petersburg to present a series of period tableaus in logistics alone how to keep the camera moving , the crowds of costumed extras swirling , and the dialogue between the foreground characters flowing without a single cut the film is some kind of masterpiece of movie engineering mr sokurov first approached his friend mikhail borisovich piotrovsky , the director of the state hermitage museum , about filming russian ark a few years ago the first impression was that it s absolutely fantastic and that it s absolutely impossible , mr piotrovsky recalled , speaking by phone from his office but speaking with sokurov , who i know and i know is a genius , i decided to go along and when we started to work on the logistics , it became clear that it would be possible in principle , he said , no films with actors are allowed to shoot in the hermitage we have had our experiences , he said cinema people always behave very badly in museums but here , i know that sokurov sacked some members of his team whom he thought would not be respectful enough to the museum the hermitage was built by empress catherine ii between 1754 and 1762 as a winter palace , and to house her collection of art in general , the hermitage itself is a metaphor for russian history of the imperial period , mr piotrovsky said , what i see now with americans who have seen the film is that for the first time they really see what russia is , old and new , much better and sometimes they see it is just opposite to what they have read in the newspapers and seen in films for mr piotrovsky , the film s appeal to american audiences seems obvious it is beautiful , it gives you some general aspects of history , and it makes some very important philosophical points the last words of the film are , 'like the ark , we will float forever and we will live forever' which means that art is the thing that saves nations , even in very troubled situations poet of the cinema when stan brakhage died of cancer on sunday in vancouver , british columbia , at the age of 70 , the world of avantgarde film lost one of its towering figures he defined the avantgarde film , the poetic film , the nonnarrative film , for the last 40 or 50 years , said jonas mekas , an avantgarde filmmaker who , with brakhage and other partners , founded the anthology film archives in the east village mr mekas recalled his first meeting with brakhage it took place at the living theater , when it was still on 100th street and broadway , and that was in 1957 , i think stan began making films in '53 , or something like that , and he came to new york sponsored by hans richter and marie menken that s when i saw the films for the first time , and i was struck by the originality and extent of his work in the postmayaderen period , mr mekas said , referring to the filmmaker who first defined the new york underground sensibility , he has been the main inspiration he was like the measure for all others , the standard keeper of the noncommercial avantgarde it is difficult to characterize brakhage s work briefly , because it was so protean , ranging from autobiographical imagery to colors and textures painted directly on film if you look at novelists and composers and poets , mr mekas said , there are some that produce a body of work during a short period , and that s it but there are others who go through different periods , and every 10 years or so , stan came up with slightly different content , techniques and forms during the last few years , he did a lot of painting on film , mr mekas said actually , for the very last film , which he did while he was already in a hospital bed , when he could not even work with any tools , he would dampen the celluloid and scratch it with his nails so that is his last film anthology , at 32 second avenue , at second street , is planning several tributes to brakhage in the next few weeks on april 4 and 5 , there will be a program of his final films on april 12 , the band sonic youth will perform a benefit concert the proceeds will help pay

albuquerque , march 21 on march 14 , a worried father wheeled his adult son into the emergency room of presbyterian hospital here the younger man was gasping for breath ten minutes later , the nursing staff discovered that the young man went through hong kong recently he was a remarkably healthylooking guy , said pete herendeen , a registered nurse who first examined the patient but he was acutely ill right away we had the sense that this might be an extraordinary case a check of the web site of the centers for disease control and prevention told the nurses that officials were just becoming aware of a deadly disease , severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars , found mostly in china and hong kong the nursing staff had also heard about the disease on television news we removed him from the triage area and six minutes later put a respiratory mask on him , mr herendeen said we recommended that he be put into isolation after being removed to isolation , the patient was sent home a few hours later , the same day he arrived , his condition diagnosed as walking pneumonia , said dr kris chongsiriwatana , an infectious disease physician at the hospital it was not until two days later , march 15 , when the centers for disease control issued concrete recommendations to isolate patients suspected of having the syndrome , that doctors called the patient back to presbyterian hospital for admission workers taking care of him wear special gloves , gowns , masks and eye protection on wednesday , the state health department sent home all 15 workers who came into contact with the patient on his first visit to the hospital they were waiting out the incubation period of the disease , which is two to seven days they began returning to work on friday , the seventh day none of them has reported feeling sick , said todd sandman , a hospital spokesman no other state has taken similar measures there have been 22 suspected cases of the diseases in 12 states , the federal health agency said on friday it is still not clear whether the young man , whose name and age have not been made public , has the respiratory disease , which as of friday had apparently infected 359 people in 15 countries since feb 1 it has killed 10 of them but health officials say presbyterian hospital s handling of the case illustrates the importance of a quick and aggressive response by the public health system in keeping the mysterious ailment in check when this disease is properly isolated , it does not spread , said dr , julie l gerberding , director of the disease control agency new mexico health workers are alert to novel infectious agents , said dr mack sewell , the state s chief epidemiologist a decade ago , an unknown pathogen , later identified as hanta virus , caused severe and sometimes fatal respiratory illness in a number of young people no doubt having that experience helped us in this situation , dr sewell said after the hanta virus outbreak , hospitals like presbyterian were equipped with isolation rooms in which air is filtered in the room , without escaping , for patients who can spread disease by simply talking or coughing mr herendeen said he had been through many kinds of epidemics in his 20 years of nursing we 're well versed in how to take universal precautions , he said we look for and listen for what might make patients a little more dangerous after the unusual pneumonia patient left , mr herendeen said , i bathed myself in antibacterial solution and did a mental inventory did this guy cough on me \? he said he asked himself did we shake hands \? the answer was no , so i figured i was ok without proper protection , health care workers are at high risk of contracting the disease , dr gerberding said of the 203 cases reported in hong kong , a third were family members of patients and twothirds were health care workers in the united states , one of the patients suspected of having the disease may have infected two health care workers while a second patient may be the source of infection in a family member , dr gerberding said both had recently been in asia close personal contact seems necessary to spread the disease the patient here is now in fair condition , dr chongsiriwatana said we still do n't know if he has sars or something else , he said , though the patient should be able to go home next week , the doctor said photo dr julie l gerberding , director of the centers for disease control and prevention , discussed her agency s investigation of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome at a news conference in atlanta last week \( associated press \)
philadelphia , may 11 the detroit pistons seemingly had him solved , running a host of fresh defenders at him to keep him off balance and out of sync even in philadelphia s game 3 victory on saturday , allen iverson had struggled to score his points , missing often and making his biggest contribution with his passing but tonight , iverson found his elusive rhythm , and none of the pistons' stingy defenders had an answer richard hamilton , who had used his seveninch height advantage to harass iverson , was helpless against him chucky atkins , whose quickness and determination had paid dividends throughout the series , was no better iverson , with his herkyjerky moves and crossover dribble leaving the pistons dumbfounded , recorded 36 points , 11 assists and 5 steals to lead the philadelphia 76ers to a 9582 victory at the first union center , evening this eastern conference semifinal series at two games apiece game 5 is wednesday night in auburn hills , mich iverson had shot just 39 percent through the first three games , but tonight he made 13 of 27 shots at his best down the stretch , he scored 15 in the fourth quarter , hitting 6 of 8 shots , most of them over a frustrated atkins it did n't really matter who guarded him in my mind tonight , philadelphia coach larry brown said after the first two games , much had been made about detroit s team play , but tonight it was philadelphia , even with iverson s eruption , that displayed balance five sixers , including iverson , scored in double figures , with derrick coleman and kenny thomas scoring 14 points apiece executing with precision , philadelphia committed only 8 turnovers coleman , in particular , was excellent , recording 15 rebounds and blocking 2 shots while anchoring a defense that kept detroit in check offensively , he and iverson ran the pickandroll to perfection , especially in the fourth with iverson on target from outside , the pistons were at the sixers' mercy when they ran two players at iverson , he passed off to coleman for an open shot when they sagged off , he drilled a jump shot we ran pickandroll more than i 've ever run pickandroll in my life , brown said the strategy enabled iverson , who also had 11 assists in game 3 , to become the first sixers player to record doublefigure assist totals in consecutive games since johnny dawkins in 1990 i had my shot going , and we were just adjusting to whatever they were doing , said iverson , who had 3 assists in the fourth quarter if they tried to trap me , i 'd get the ball away as quick as i could to dc or whoever i was running it with , he said , referring to derrick coleman if they did n't , i was looking for my shot it was kind of like a pickyourpoison thing , and it worked real well for us after a while i wanted to run it every play because they could n't adjust to it iverson s biggest basket came with 3 minutes 18 seconds to play and the pistons threatening to rally after chopping a 15point deficit to 9 able to free himself on the right wing , iverson buried a 3pointer from 26 feet to end detroit s hopes iverson s play in the clutch was much different than it had been in game 2 on thursday at the freethrow line with a chance to give the sixers a 4point lead with 15 seconds remaining , he missed both attempts detroit went on to win in overtime , leaving iverson tormented and blaming himself i had nightmares over that game , iverson said i could n't sleep after that because in situations like that my team wants me to have the ball and to be shooting those free throws and i want to shoot them they trust me to get it done and i feel like i can get it done , and to not get it done was one of the worst feelings i 've ever had in basketball i was real sick to my stomach over that this makes it feel a little bit better detroit has the sick feeling now in control of the series coming into philadelphia this weekend , the pistons are in a dogfight after two decisive losses they took it to us twice in here , detroit coach rick carlisle said we have to play better we have a couple of days to think about it and make some changes , and that s what we 're going to do the pistons hope the biggest change is in point guard chauncey billups , who returned tonight after missing the previous two games because of a sprained left ankle billups had been the pistons' leading scorer throughout the playoffs , averaging 228 points , but with no lift on his jump shot tonight , he was not a factor and maybe even a liability he totaling 101 points in his previous three games , but finished with 3 points on 1of6 shooting in 23 minutes tonight hamilton led detroit with 30 points , but atkins , who came off the bench to score 11 , was the only other pistons player to score in double figures detroit s other four starters totaled only 17 points as the team shot 426 percent from the floor the sixers took control over the final 6 43 of the second quarter ahead by 3129 , they hounded the pistons into missing their last 10 shots of the half and held them scoreless for 5 13 the airtight defense , combined with 5 points by iverson , powered philadelphia to a 123 run that put them ahead by 4332 at halftime detroit never drew closer than 7 points again photo sixers guard allen iverson , driving between pistons guards chauncey billups , left , and richard hamilton , had 36 points and

for the depressionweary strivers who moved there in the 1940 s and 50 s , the grand concourse was the champs lys es of the bronx , a broad boulevard of stylishly sedate art deco apartment buildings that filled their craving for modest touches of class like sunken living rooms those residents are long gone their exodus during the 1960 s and 70 s set off a deep slump , marked by gnawing crime and even some abandoned buildings the avenue has come back in the past decade or so , its apartments bustling with a new generation of immigrants and other strivers who appreciate the lingering , if tattered , touches of elegance but the revival has exacted a price the decorous look of a residential street stores and medical clinics , which began cropping up spottily in the 1980 s , have been carved out of scores of what were once groundfloor apartments the wave seems to have accelerated in recent years so that almost every block between 161st street and 196th street now has a grocery , a barber shop , a travel agency or a medical clinic , and some stretches are chockablock with stores and large , eyecatching signs historians of the bronx , preservationists , wistful former residents , and some government officials say they are heartsick at what they regard as an aesthetic blight on a oncegenteel street they are trying to stop the commercialization by creating a concourse historic district or by enforcing more strictly a 1989 zoning law that bans stores in all but a few places and limits signs in most of those locations to 12 square feet but most current residents seem to like the convenience of the stores , the jobs they create and the way they provide outposts of vitality on an avenue that on desolate nights can attract muggers for them , the avenue s history is , well , history i think the people around here are more interested in having the stores , said thomas hernandez , a 45yearold construction worker you do n't have to go to a supermarket three blocks away as long as people here have demands buying cigarettes , baby milk , stuff like that this is not going to faze anybody adolfo carri n jr , the bronx borough president and an urban planner , said the slow transformation of the concourse into another commercial strip would destroy its sense of place he would like to find a way to steer merchants toward busy commercial cross streets like 170th street and burnside avenue when you drive down fifth avenue or central park west , you know where you are , he said the place has a personality the concourse should be one of those places in our city where we make a statement about how we care about city still , mr carri n and the preservationists know they face an uphill battle while for years city action against illegal stores was virtually nonexistent , three months ago mr carri n s office asked the city s department of buildings to step in , and an inspector soon issued 170 violation notices at 70 to 80 buildings , said sid dinsay , a spokesman for the department the owners were given 45 days to correct the violations but mr dinsay said this week that to my knowledge none of the stores had been closed , though legal proceedings against some had begun the fact is , preservationists say , few residents are clamoring for enforcement , which is mostly driven by complaints there has also been no enforcement of signage laws on the street , they say , and citywide enforcement of those laws has been suspended since early summer , when the city council imposed a sixmonth moratorium after complaints from shopowners an effort to designate the concourse as a historic district foundered during the dinkins and giuliani administrations robert b tierney , the chairman of the landmarks preservation commission , said he planned to tour the boulevard to consider whether to rekindle the landmarking effort landmark status would compel landlords to get commission approval before changing facades a halfcentury ago , the grand concourse was the boulevard of the bourgeoisie small merchants , civil servants , tradespeople and wage earners , almost all white and a large proportion jewish doctors and lawyers occupied the stately 13story lewis morris apartments near 175th street , and a whitegloved doorman opened car doors for residents with a handful of exceptions , the only stores were just off the bronx s commercial hub on fordham road , and the only signs were discreet doctor shingles the boulevard began to flourish in the 1930 s and 40 s , after the completion of the ind subway line enterprising developers took advantage of the enchantment with art deco to create alluring buildings with elegant touches like polychrome brick and terrazzo lobby floors but starting in the mid1960 s , residents , flush with new cars and nest eggs enhanced by an era of prosperity , began moving to the suburbs landlords rented to far poorer tenants , most of them black and latino families for whom landing on the boulevard seemed a stroke of good fortune yet schools began losing their best students , crime festered and longtime tenants escaped to coop city , which had just been built today crime is down from the early 1990 s but the commercialization of the avenue has proceeded and is particularly noticeable on the boulevard s two gems the lewis morris and a smaller creambrick art deco structure at 1150 grand concourse that was known as the fish building for the tropical mosaic flanking its doorway on the ground floor of 1150 , there are now a barber shop and a tax preparer s office , each with a sign the ground floor of the lewis morris , where threequarters of tenants receive federal rent vouchers and medicaid , houses three clinics , each with a twofoothigh banner that advertises its availability to medicaid and insurance plans just across the street from the fish building , near 167th street , are a record shop , two groceries , a barber shop and a dental clinic why do you have to have a sign up there saying 'family dentist' \? asked michael saccio , a 48yearold prop man who has lived in the fish building for five years on park avenue you see a little gold plaque this guy is advertising like he s giving away something free but mr saccio is distinctly in the minority carlos fernandez , the manager of claris record shop , said the store s owner was in court six months ago , and residents turned out in force to support him they have to go six blocks to buy a cd , mr fernandez said he did not know how the case was resolved the shops in the fish building do not violate its certificate of occupancy , mr dinsay said , and the lewis morris was not inspected yet the businesses and signs in those buildings would not have been tolerated a few decades ago because of a tacit understanding about the residential character of the concourse dr jagdish n markale , who owns the dental clinic across from the fish building , said he put up his sign a year ago out of fear that other dentists with signs might lure his patients away dr markale , an immigrant from bombay , said the street s history is not as important as a grocery store the government has to consider their priorities rather than that of the people who used to be here 50 years ago , he said photos signs advertise groundfloor businesses along the grand concourse in the bronx , top and bottom , where stores and medical clinics began cropping up in the 1980 s above is a view of the grand concourse from 161st street in 1966 \( photo by angel franco the new york times \) \( photo by neal boenzi the new york times \) \( photo by

oakland , calif , nov 9 the officials made sure jets kicker doug brien had plenty of time to stretch his hamstrings and pull up his socks a review of the spot of the ball meant there would be no rush , none of the excruciating ticking of the clock to interrupt brien s preparation for another overtime fieldgoal attempt , another chance to save what remains of the jets' season and so with the jets' coaches telling the players to leave brien alone , he began the long , intricate preparation for redemption brien said he had been tortured by his botched 51yard attempt in an overtime loss to the giants last sunday during the week , coach herman edwards had told brien that he had made the right decision to put the game on him and that he would do so again but the jets' special teams coach , mike westhoff , blamed brien s elaborate prekick routine for the failure , and brien wondered if he would get another chance brien said he hoped the game sunday would come down to a field goal , and it did the jets rallied from an 11point deficit early in the fourth quarter to force overtime for the second consecutive week , and this time brien easily made a 38yard field goal as the jets eked out a 2724 victory edwards did not look as brien attempted the field goal but after the jets held on to beat the raiders , it is safe , at least for a week , to peek at their season again now that they are 36 i feel like in my career i have n't been lucky , brien said when you have something bad happen to you like that , you need something to erase everything that has n't happened to me that often in my career brien thanked edwards for the opportunity to try again , but second chances seemed to be the theme for nearly everyone , from the run defense to quarterback chad pennington , who returned to his personal house of horrors to lead the jets to a touchdown and a 2point conversion that tied the score at 2424 with 1 minute 15 seconds left in regulation the jets' defense may have needed a second chance as much as brien did the score was tied at 77 in the first quarter after oakland s phillip buchanon returned a punt 78 yards for a touchdown and a bizarre 65yard catch and run for a touchdown by santana moss on which he was spun around by a tackler , only to regain his balance and keep going but then the jets' defense yielded a 19play drive all of the plays were runs to take a 147 lead and oakland \( 27 \) had lost its top back , charlie garner , on the first play , and it entered the game with the fewest rushing attempts in the league the raiders did not need much of a scouting report on the jets everybody knows they have the worst run defense in the league the jets knew the run was coming , but by halftime , the raiders had rolled up 117 yards on the ground brien kicked a 48yard field goal in the second quarter , but the raiders led at halftime , 2110 , while running 31 times and having their thirdstring quarterback , rick mirer , attempt only seven passes meanwhile , the jets' offense could not exploit the league s secondworst run defense curtis martin had 8 attempts for 12 yards in the first half the raiders have ended the jets' last two seasons in the playoffs and it looked as if they would in effect do so again this season , this time with seven games remaining on the schedule running back lamont jordan spoke to the team in the jets' locker room at the intermission we came in at halftime and he said , somebody s season is going to end today and it ca n't be us , ' martin said we could not take that long plane ride knowing our season was almost over in the second half , the jets began to anticipate the run on every down and managed to stop it the result the raiders gained only 52 more yards on the ground , and mirer was forced to throw 18 times while mirer played well given his limited preparation he was 18 of 25 passing for 186 yards and a touchdown that was not the game plan the raiders thought they could win with sure enough , the raiders scored only 3 points in the second half a touchdown drive to start the third quarter was thwarted by tyrone wheatley s fumble at the jets' 7 so the stage was set for another of pennington s comeback efforts in the third quarter , with the jets trailing by 2110 , pennington , who was rattled when the jets lost here in the playoffs last season , was in the huddle during a timeout first of all , i told them we 'd win this game , he said i told them we have got to take it one play at a time and not get caught up in 2110 methodically , the jets began to drive at the end of the third quarter on thirdand1 , jordan went 39 yards to break open the running game , which ultimately gained 155 yards later , his twisting 2yard touchdown run made it 2116 , although a 2point conversion failed a raiders drive that consumed nearly seven minutes stalled at the jets' 4 , and sebastian janikowski s 22yard field goal kept the jets alive , trailing by 2416 the first play of the next drive proved pennington was back he launched a pass with perfect touch over napoleon harris to jerald sowell on the right sideline for a 44yard gain four plays later , sowell caught a 3yard touchdown pass that allowed the jets to go for the 2point conversion to tie pennington nailed the throw into tight end anthony becht s chest just as he floated over the goal line before defenders pushed him back a review confirmed the successful conversion , and the jets would have a chance to atone for their crushing loss to the giants that s two weeks in a row the kid has taken us down the field to get the game tied , edwards said of pennington that s good stuff so was overtime the jets drove from their 25 to the raiders' 21 , where jordan s run was stopped just short of the first down brien , who went to the university of california in nearby berkeley and lives here in the offseason , was quietly loosening up he did not think about last week , blocking out everything just as he did to his detriment last week the kick went up and , in a game and season full of emotional highs and lows , so did the jets' spirits i just kept walking on the sideline , edwards said when i saw the guys jumping up and down , chad said , 'you can look now , coach' photos jets receiver santana moss making a catch in the first half jets tight end anthony becht taking a hit from linebacker travian

san diego , oct 2 faced with new accusations of sexual misconduct , arnold schwarzenegger acknowledged on thursday that wherever there is smoke there is fire and apologized for having behaved badly sometimes toward women mr schwarzenegger , who has been surging in the polls in california s recall election , issued the apology here at the beginning of a statewide bus tour the sixbus tour , with international news crews in tow , is part of the actor s final push to replace gov gray davis mr schwarzenegger made his apology first thing on what swiftly turned into the most tumultuous day of his brief campaign in the afternoon he was facing questions about a 1997 book proposal that quoted him saying in 1975 that he had admired hitler in an interview , he said he did n't remember the comment and said he despised anything that hitler stands for page a20 his statements on thursday were the first during the extraordinary recall campaign in which mr schwarzenegger expressed remorse for sexual indiscretions , having previously played down accusations of groping and mistreatment of women as exaggerations , mistruths or provocations yes , it is true that i was on rowdy movie sets , the actor and former bodybuilder said , and i have done things that were not right , which i thought then was playful but now i recognize that i have offended people and to those people that i have offended i want to say to them , i am deeply sorry about that and i apologize because this is not what i'm trying to do the announcement came in response to a frontpage article in the los angeles times on thursday about six women who said they were the victims of unwanted sexual advances by mr schwarzenegger when they came into contact with him on movie sets , in studio offices or at a gymnasium , among other places mr schwarzenegger s attitude toward women has been an issue since the start of his campaign but the new accusations , and mr schwarzenegger s reply , set off a maelstrom of protest from his critics , including women s groups , democrats and arianna huffington , who dropped out of the race this week but had repeatedly clashed with mr schwarzenegger during a debate last week i consider his campaign a very expensively produced masquerade , ms huffington , who was running as an independent , said , 'the question is will the mask be removed before the election or after i believe what this story is going to do is really bring to question this big issue of trust and credibility if his word and image are consistently proven to be false , he does n't have a leg to stand on the los angeles times reported that three of the women said mr schwarzenegger had grabbed their breasts another said he reached under her skirt a fifth said he tried to strip off her bikini in a hotel elevator the sixth said mr schwarzenegger pulled her to his lap and asked if she was experienced in a particular sexual act the accusations covered a 25year period , ending in 2000 though some of the accusations had been published elsewhere , including in an article in premiere magazine in 2001 , the los angeles times account included fresh details and named two of the women in apologizing on thursday , mr schwarzenegger denounced the los angeles times article as trash politics and did not admit to any of the specific accusations made by the women a lot of those that you see in the stories is not true , but at the same time i have to tell you that i always say that wherever there is smoke there is fire , he said that is true until now , accusations of sexual misconduct involving mr schwarzenegger have held little sway with voters but the issue has shadowed the campaign since day 1 in announcing his candidacy on aug 6 on television on the tonight show , mr schwarzenegger was the first to raise the subject i know they 're going to throw everything at me , and they 're going to , you know , say that i have no experience and that i'm a womanizer and that i'm a terrible , terrible guy , mr schwarzenegger said then in august , when stories began to surface about an interview he had given in 1977 to oui magazine , in which he bragged about group sex and talked about the benefits of drugs and sex before bodybuilding competitions , mr schwarzenegger seemed to have been caught offguard he changed his explanation over the course of two days when first asked about the interview on a talk radio show in sacramento , mr schwarzenegger chuckled and said he never lived my life to be a politician he added obviously , i 've made statements that were ludicrous and crazy and outrageous and all those things , because that s the way i always was the next day at a news conference , he backtracked i have no idea what you 're talking about , he said i have no memory of any of the articles i did 20 or 30 years ago later , he said he made up the episodes to promote a documentary about himself and to advance his sport there were only a few hundred gymnasiums in america at the time when i came over here , mr schwarzenegger said on hardball with chris matthews on msnbc on sept 3 now there are hundreds of thousands so we were very successful with our campaign to promote bodybuilding , to promote fitness , the health industry and all of that

when empire blue cross and blue shield first announced that it might go public in 1996 , the company s press release cheerfully promised that the change would mean an additional 7 million a year in taxes for new york state seven years later , the benefits from a new company on the tax rolls pale next to the boon that has fallen to state government for letting the charitable insurance company become a profitmaking corporation the deal reached by gov george e pataki and the legislature last year that finally gave empire permission to go public included the condition that it turn over all the proceeds to the state , a jackpot now worth about 2 billion indeed , shares of empire blue cross and blue shield turned out to be worth twice as much as governor pataki and legislative leaders thought when they decided to let the stock sale go forward the law authorizing the conversion earmarked the proceeds to go into a fund for a variety of health programs and to pay for three years of raises for hospital and nursing home workers , an electionyear arrangement sought by the governor and the state s biggest healthcare union for the state , the success of empire s conversion has been a bright bit of fiscal news in an exceptionally bleak year now at least two other nonprofit insurers in the state are weighing whether to become publicly traded corporations , handing albany lawmakers the possibility of two more big windfalls at a time when the state is trying to close a cumulative budget deficit estimated at 12 billion next year out of a 90 billion budget to that end , mr pataki submitted legislation along with his proposed budget on wednesday that would give blanket authorization to other nonprofit insurance companies to convert to profitmaking entities if they wish about six other states and the district of columbia are also considering conversions and at least one , new jersey , is said to be intrigued by the new yorkempire deal but even as the conversions offer an infusion of money just at the moment when many states need one , some health care advocates and elected officials question whether the empire deal is the best model most states faced with the question had opted to use the proceeds from the conversion of their nonprofit insurers to set up foundations permanently devoted to helping the poor and uninsured but new york broke that trend , using its conversion as a oneshot source of cash to balance its budget and cover existing programs lawmakers who supported the deal say new york does n't need a foundation to finance health care for the uninsured because it already has unusually extensive programs for that purpose critics say some of those programs could be in jeopardy when money from the empire conversion stops flowing sometime around 2006 they 've set a terrible precedent for other states facing big deficits , said charles bell , a director for consumers union the consumers union and other groups have challenged the state s action in court , arguing that lawmakers improperly seized private charitable property and used it for political and government purposes the suit also accuses empire s board of breaching its fiduciary duties by allowing the state to seize the company s assets believe me , we did n't choose that route , said ira millstein , a management expert who advises empire it went right up to albany and once it went to albany , heaven help us for generations , empire had been the safety net for thousands of new yorkers , until the state changed the law in the 1990 s and required all managed care providers to offer insurance to any individual , no matter how sick long derided for its sloppy and occasionally unscrupulous business practices , empire took on new management eight years ago and began a remarkable turnaround that made it valuable on the open market the company had been asking for years to convert to a forprofit corporation , arguing that its charitable status restricted its ability to grow , compete and serve its subscribers company officials say they always knew that the value that empire amassed in its 68year history would be forfeited when it went commercial but a debate still rages over the route the state decided to take the governor and the legislature got involved when eliot spitzer , the state attorney general , ruled that the company needed legislation to switch to a profitmaking entity his decision handed governor pataki and one of the governor s political allies , dennis rivera , a golden opportunity mr pataki and mr rivera persuaded assembly speaker sheldon silver and joseph l bruno , the senate majority leader , to use the conversion proceeds to pay for a number of health programs , from health insurance for children to drug subsidies for the elderly the proceeds were also earmarked to subsidize raises for health care workers , including members of the union that mr rivera heads , 1199 seiu the state counted on only 1 billion from the sale of empire s stock , which it estimated might take three years to complete in november , however , when empire transformed itself into a publicly traded company called wellchoice , wall street paid a handsome 25 a share that translated into 480 million for that first batch of stock empire overall was suddenly valued at 2 billion , twice the net worth it carried on its books
london when i became an art historian , my mother decided that my only hope for financial security was to stumble on a rembrandt at a garage sale last weekend was my chance the royal college of art was holding its 10th annual rca secret , an exhibition and fundraiser that has become the bestloved gamble in british collecting the show features more than 2 , 000 postcardsize works by unknowns and genuine stars , including sol lewitt , christo , damien hirst , tracey emin and the designer alexander mcqueen the catch none of the works are labeled they all cost 60 you buy what you like , or what you think you can identify , but you do n't find out what you 've got until it s yours it s signed on the back the event has become so popular with bargainhunting art lovers that people start camping out days in advance the doors open to a crowd of hundreds clearly , to find my modern masterpiece i would have to get a very early start my friends may have 401 \( k \) s , but i had a borrowed tent and a stack of degrees that say i can spot a sol lewitt at 30 paces tuesday s preview was discouraging i saw nothing i thought was a lewitt , just a dozen sloppy student attempts at minimalism the tracey emins were obvious and strangely beautiful raw drawings of naked women surely they would be gone in a jiffy the christos were the biggest disappointment souvenir postcards of his famous projects , some of which , returning buyers told me , were the same as last year on wednesday , after a research trip to some galleries , i decided to focus on two breaking artists grayson perry and sophie von hellerman mr perry , a finalist for this year s turner prize , makes large ceramic vessels covered with dark , witty , sexually provocative drawings he also has a transvestite alter ego named claire i was pretty sure i had spotted his postcards a village scene made up entirely of penises and a portrait of a girl with blonde pigtails and hairy arms ms von hellerman , a recent graduate of the royal college of art , creates large , moody canvases , sketching a scene with a few bold lines and washes of color a natural storyteller , she was given her first solo show in 2001 by charles saatchi three loose watercolors in shades of black , blue and rusty pink were perfect examples of her style on wednesday night , i pitched camp , 12th in line , to await the friday sale i expected to find myself surrounded by 21yearold art students in search of famous artists in fact , most of the hardcore campers were closer to 50 than 20 and were looking not for today s megastars , but for more traditional british artists mary fedden , eileen cooper , peter blake austin clarke , 53 , flew in from northern ireland and camped for five nights to be first in line last year he 'd gone home with a damien hirst it s a buzz , he admitted brings out the kid in you and he admired his competition these guys are an education they do n't have the money to buy the big stuff , but they know their art the elder statesman of the group was peter sargent , 74 , a london suburbanite with cropped white hair and dressed in purple goretex he had been coming to the sale since 1997 last year he camped out for eight nights to be first in line for a postcard by the portuguese artist paula rego benjamin , 20 , an american student of political science who declined to give his last name , had wedged himself in at no 4 there s some machiavellian stuff behind the scenes , he said , but in the end , gentlemen s rules apply it s very civilized indeed each participant can buy only five cards it turned out that nos 1 , 2 and 3 all wanted sol lewitts and mary feddens instead of no 1 hogging the goods , they decided to take one each around 11 pm , i settled in to get some sleep mummified in six layers , i could see my breath thursday morning , trouble arrived in the form of a handsome law student , no 20 , who was wild about mr perry he spent the morning telling everyone how he had to have one i suggested that he might be better off keeping his enthusiasm to himself he ignored me , and by the end of the day , i was pretty sure the perrys had been publicized beyond my reach happily , no one mentioned ms von hellerman thursday night was thanksgiving my friend courtney brought me a piece of pumpkin pie at midnight by that time i had refined my list praying for the perrys , confident of the von hellermans and , just in case , a consolation prize a beautifully painted card by an unknown artist on friday morning we lined up in front of six computers and two flat screens displaying a rolling list of numbers , which turned red when the postcard in question had been sold as i moved up the line , i saw the emins go then the first grayson perry was gone a pause i was almost there when the second one flashed red on the screen no 11 , who 24 hours ago showed no interest in the turner prize nominee , went home with my phallic village i walked away with the three von hellermans , a nick park for my husband s christmas present and a sketch by stephen jones , a british hat designer , for courtney , my midnight pumpkin fairy when i packed up my tent at noon , two sol lewitts were still at large \( the top three in line had missed them so had i \) , and an unimpressive drawing in ballpoint pen had been identified as a damien hirst on my way home , i began to consider how to frame my new minicollection i wondered if my von hellermans were a real prize or just hype my thoughts turned to friend who had bought warhol when andy still had brown hair and pop was still soda sophie , my money s on you photos at london s royal college of art , buyers lined up , above , and looked , below the author s prize a sophie von hellerman watercolor , right peter sargent , a sale

east rutherford , nj , dec 26 the moment will stand in the permanent jim fassel file , forever to be recalled in any reminiscence of his coaching career it happened the day before thanksgiving in 2000 fassel had heard enough of people talking about the giants' sinking playoff hopes his hands gripped the sides of a lectern his eyes narrowed his face , which had been tense for weeks , grew tighter still this is a poker game , fassel said that day i'm shoving my chips to the middle of the table i'm raising the ante this team is going to the playoffs in the world of new york sports , the guarantee has a special home fassel s became lore when the giants won their next seven games , including two playoff games , and roared into the super bowl it might be fassel s signature moment in his sevenyear reign as giants coach , which will end sunday with his final game , but it is far from his only one most are harder to squeeze into a sound bite or to recall in a quick anecdote the gravest came the day he walked through ground zero , with smoke still rising out of the rubble , men caked in dirt digging through the wreckage looking for relatives and coworkers and evidence of the lives destroyed in the terror attack on the world trade center on sept 11 , 2001 it was the day fassel broke down in tears hearing the story of the brooklyn firefighter frank palombo , whose wife and 10 children were absorbing the enormity of his loss it was the day fassel vowed to take care of them , a vow that will long outlast his tenure as coach here those moments , and a lot in between , will come to mind when fassel takes the field at giants stadium for the last time as the giants' coach they have already made the rounds since fassel stood up two weeks ago and told everyone to acknowledge what they already knew , that he would be fired at season s end oddly enough , fassel might be the last one to think of such moments i have n't really had a chance to reflect , although i'm constantly asked about it , fassel said on friday i do n't know i 've always been trained that certain things go down in your life and it s all part of the process , and you do n't let it get all out of whack there s a job to do and you 've got to do it still , fassel knows , the walk onto the field sunday will not be as simple as all the others it s going to be rough , he said i 've got a lot of my life wrapped up right here fassel remembered the day in 1997 when , sitting in a meeting room in tempe , ariz , he saw the arizona cardinals' owner , bill bidwill , summon coach vince tobin fassel , then the cardinals' offensive coordinator , guessed the conversation was about him , and it was the giants had asked permission to interview him from his first giddy days as a head coach , fassel rode every up and down as his personal roller coaster none of the jolts , good or bad , ever spared him when he took over a 610 team and coached them to 1051 with five rookie starters in 1997 , fassel was named the league s coach of the year when that team blew an 11point lead in the final two minutes of a wildcard playoff game against minnesota and his players squabbled on the sideline , fassel absorbed that , too it s a very bitter pill to swallow , fassel said that day this is not going to go away very easily it began what would be fassel s pattern , success followed by crushing disappointment , holes the giants would dig into and back out of that hole got deeper the following season , when the giants sank to 48 they rebounded , winning their last four games and toppling the broncos to stop denver s undefeated season after a 130 start it was the first time fassel heard calls for his job that was not a good team , fassel said after winning the division with that team and then going 88 and i came back the next year and heard my job was on the line , i thought , 'whoa' he would think a lot of whoas over the next few seasons , but he always pulled the giants out of the tailspin before they crashed in 1999 , fassel was the driving force behind the signing of quarterback kerry collins , whom many coaches would not touch collins had been dumped by two teams , carolina and new orleans , and had developed a terrible reputation as a teammate his drunkendriving arrest had become his signature moment but fassel went to dinner with collins , and when collins refused to make excuses for his mistakes , fassel took the leap he believed in me when nobody else would , collins said behind collins , the giants started the 2000 season 72 and expectations soared , only to start plummeting after backtoback home losses to st louis and detroit that spawned the guarantee , which begat the super bowl , which lifted fassel s moment into local legend that the giants lost their first game the next season , a monday night game on sept 10 in denver , became irrelevant only hours after their plane delivered them home when fassel heard what was happening , he and his assistants scrambled to the top of giants stadium and watched the world trade center towers fall there were onfield ups and downs after that certainly , fassel will never forget the fourthquarter collapse in the wildcard playoff game against san francisco in january , so cruelly finished off with a bad snap on a fieldgoal attempt he will probably see the monday night loss to the cowboys this season in his nightmares , a kickoff rolling out of bounds with 11 seconds left to give the cowboys the chance to tie , which they did before winning in overtime fassel will never forget the giants' collapse after that loss , a super bowlhopeful team that careered to 411 and cost him his job but the bigger moments will be easier to recall the palombo family means more to him than football the jim fassel foundation , formed to help the families of the police officers and the firefighters killed in 9 11 , will outlive his tenure as giants coach fassel will always remember that day at ground zero everybody else watched it on tv we lived it , he said i always look back at that whenever you think life s tough for you , go back to that that is the only guarantee he has left
oakland , calif , jan 12 throughout the jets' remarkable run to the playoffs , the hallmark of their success had been an ability to protect the ball with as much tender loving care as they had protected their fragile hopes for postseason glory , even when they began the season 25 but today , with their preternaturally poised quarterback chad pennington rattled for the first time as a starter , the ball slipped and slid away and with it went the jets' hopes of advancing to the american football conference championship game three turnovers by pennington two interceptions and a fumble led to 17 points for the raiders and a 3010 loss for the jets before 62 , 207 at network associates coliseum pennington did not lose the game on his own , though the powerhouse offense on display in the last three weeks was so out of sync that the jets frequently struggled just to run a play without incurring a penalty the defense that had shut down its last three opponents ultimately unraveled when the raiders unleashed their best weapons in the second half finally , the return game , which had shortened the field so often for the offense , was rendered useless by a raiders plan to keep the ball from santana moss and chad morton so the jets' comeback from the brink of disaster this season ended where it always seems to end oakland beat the jets in the playoffs last year , too , but while the raiders have begun a redemptive march to the super bowl that they felt cheated of last season with a bizarre loss in new england , the jets will be haunted by a loss that was very much of their own creation the raiders will play host to the tennessee titans for the conference championship next sunday the jets will go home and begin planning for next season hopefully this team has learned a lesson with what happened today , coach herman edwards said we have to try to get back in this situation again this was a season of ups and downs for us , a lot of adversity we weathered a lot of it we got here to this game it s not where we want to be in fact , the jets were so excited to be in this game that receiver laveranues coles , who injured his achilles' tendon late in the game , believes the anticipation made them jittery , causing what had been the smooth operation of the offense to misfire repeatedly a bad omen came almost immediately , when the jets were called for a delayofgame penalty during their first drive pennington and the offensive coordinator paul hackett have such a smooth working relationship that the jets had not incurred a delay penalty since intentionally taking one against buffalo on nov 24 but the jets had two in the first half today , the result of a number of factors the jets were not getting into the huddle fast enough , and the play clock was started quickly after the previous play ended the result jets coaches were screaming at players to hurry into the huddle , and the pressure on pennington was enormous we were out of sync , coles said we were anxious we had to calm down we were a little overanxious , and it carried over to the field pennington threw only four interceptions as a starter in the regular season , none in the last five games and the jets had not had a turnover of any kind since their loss to chicago four games ago , the ball protection as pristine as the jets' performances in the three dominating victories that brought them back to oakland for the divisional playoff game today but with the game tied , 33 , pennington tried to scramble on thirdand10 as he began to run , pennington s arm was hit and the ball squirted out six plays later , zack crockett ran 1 yard for a touchdown to give the raiders a 103 lead even after the jets weathered their initial foibles and put together a magnificent 16play , 81yard drive to tie the score , 1010 , at halftime , they could never get into the rhythm that had become so familiar late in the season pennington s passes sailed high , he was frequently under pressure and he was sacked four times his receivers took the brunt of brutal hits in the secondary \( wayne chrebet injured his calf on one hit from charles woodson \) and sometimes dropped passes the jets endured a secondhalf shutout , something that had not happened to them since their collapse against cleveland that made them 25 for the last few games , we 've been almost flawless , curtis martin said sooner or later it had to come down it seems like today was the day it came down pennington said i had so much energy , i tried to calm myself down i could n't get my rhythm in the second half , the raiders gave a lesson in rhythm in the first half , they kept their most explosive players under warps , attempting only 10 passes and gaining 120 yards but in the second half , the raiders changed their game plan entirely , coming out firing early and often their first drive ended in a failed field goal , but the message had been sent when rich gannon passed on all but one play of the nineplay drive when a pass from pennington sailed high over coles he thought it was headed out of bounds tory james pulled it down at the sideline at the jets' 45
montgomery , ala , sept 9 alabama voters overwhelmingly rejected a 12 billion tax increase today , delivering a crushing blow to their republican governor , bob riley , who had staked his political career on the vote his ambitious plan was to close a 675 million budget deficit , ease taxes on the poor and catapult the state s school system from among the nation s worst to one of the best mr riley s background as a congressman and acolyte of newt gingrich , who had never voted to raise taxes , cast a national spotlight on alabama s fiscal crisis , even as other republican governors from georgia to nevada have turned to tax increases to keep afloat none , though , was as daring as mr riley , who sought to bring his state s antiquated finances into the 21st century in one fell swoop but voters made clear that they believed that mr riley had overreached with 98 percent of precincts reporting , opponents outnumbered supporters of the referendum to enact mr riley s program by 67 percent to 33 percent meeting supporters tonight , mr riley said ladies and gentlemen , i 've heard what the people of alabama have said , and they said very clearly tonight , 'we do want you to be good stewards , but we want a smaller government until you prove to us you are stewards of our money' we 're going to reduce services , he added but once we do and i hope everyone in the state of alabama understands this we have to be very judicious in the cuts we make because so many people are absolutely dependent on this state for their very existence we need to make sure that we continue to protect the least among us' mr riley is widely expected to call a session of the legislature next week to draft a drastically curtailed spending plan his aides said the austerity measures needed to balance the budget were likely to include cuts of more than 20 percent at some agencies , steep cuts in money for school textbooks and supplies and cuts in money for already overcrowded prisons that could force officials to grant early parole to thousands of nonviolent felons opponents of the referendum promised to step up efforts to cut spending in the new session there is not a revenue problem in this state , roger mcconnell , cochairman of the tax accountability coalition , said it s crystal clear there is a spending problem in montgomery , and it needs to stop today the referendum drive , which mr riley said had turned state politics into something like the planet bizarro , divided his fellow republicans and pitted mr riley alongside the unlikeliest of bedfellows , the state teachers union , black lawmakers and the democratic party , as well as bigbusiness groups like the campaign for alabama mr riley s plan ran into an even betterorganized coalition of players who had until recently been his strongest supporters , bankers , farmers , smallbusiness owners , timber interests and conservative groups like the alabama christian coalition and americans for tax reform the predicament that mr riley found himself could not have been foreseen when he won election in november , squeaking past a democratic incumbent , donald siegelman , on a platform of fiscal responsibility and accountability within weeks of taking office , mr riley faced soaring debt payments , shrinking revenues and a gaping deficit , even after an early round of cuts netted 275 million in savings influenced by a professor of tax law at the university of alabama , susan pace hamill , who had criticized the state s tax code , mr riley decided to tackle not just the budget , but also the whole tax structure rather than ask for a tax increase just to plug a deficit , he reasoned , he ought to deliver something big in the bargain , like a dramatically improved school system mr riley s supporters speculated that just as only richard m nixon could go to china , only a conservative taxcutting republican could reform alabama s centuryold and , by most accounts , backward tax system in which a family of four pays taxes after its income reaches 4 , 600 , the lowest threshold of any state he proposed raising that , to 17 , 000 immediately and to 20 , 000 in three years , and called for ending the state s full deduction for federal taxes , a provision that disproportionately benefits the rich the haggling over the finer points of taxes often took on the tenor of a canonical debate , as mr riley , sounding much like a preacher , urged voters to ease the burden on the least among us at times , mr riley made the mistakes of a firstyear governor in june , he alienated black lawmakers after they said he had broken a promise to sign a bill to make it easier for former convicts to regain voting rights the gaffe deprived mr riley of a crucial constituency for the referendum as polls consistently showed the referendum heading for defeat , mr riley and his allies acknowledged that they had lost the public opinion war opponents made hay , for example , out of a measure that would have extended the sales tax , which is as much as 10 percent in some cities , to repairs of items like cars and lawn mowers our side did a remarkably poor job in getting our media to define the issue , paul hubbert , executive secretary of the alabama education association , said we were playing catchup all the while in alabama , at least , mr riley s erstwhile allies on the right sounded at least a somewhat conciliatory note it s just as tall an order for him to recover from this as he would 've had to get it passed , said john giles , president of the state s christian coalition but if he sincerely apologizes for not listening to his core base , not involving his core base , and for listening to the wrong counsel , the people will forgive him there s still repair work to be done , and you 've got to demonstrate you mean what you say but people will forgive him the state s republican chairman , marty connors , said the vote proved that parties matter and chided the governor for not seeking the advice of his republican brethren before cutting a deal with the devil riley never came to the party leadership to try and figure out the best route to take , mr connors said he went to the teachers' union first and said , 'how do we fix this \? ' instead of to his loyalists you 've got to leave the dance with the guy that brung you photo gov bob riley of alabama after voting at the hi pine volunteer fire department near his home in ashland \( photo by associated press \)
minneapolis , oct 3 the yankees could be back in the american league championship series by the end of the weekend , or they could be gone from the playoffs in another bitter firstround defeat their fate will be determined by how they handle the minnesota twins and the roofrattling metrodome in games 3 and 4 in a series now tied at a game each whatever happens , joe torre will apparently return for his ninth season as yankees manager george steinbrenner , the team s principal owner , will be here this weekend , and he insisted through his spokesman on friday that he had already decided to retain torre joe torre is his manager now , he supports him and he will be his manager next year , said the spokesman , howard rubenstein he s done the job it was steinbrenner s first unequivocal declaration that torre is safe for next year , and it came after steinbrenner was asked to respond to a column that was harshly critical of torre in friday s usa today the column was written by allen neuharth , who founded usa today , is the former chairman and chief executive officer of the gannett newspaper chain , and is a close friend of steinbrenner s neuharth sat in steinbrenner s box at yankee stadium during the first two games of the division series , watching the yankees play sloppily in a 31 loss in game 1 on tuesday before rebounding behind andy pettitte and mariano rivera for a 41 victory in game 2 on thursday steinbrenner was generally unavailable for comment after the first two games , but the two paragraphs that neuharth devoted in his column to torre exhibited steinbrennerstyle frustration if the yankees do n't make it , the best boss in baseball , george steinbrenner , finally can show the door to baseball s most overrated manager , joe torre , neuharth wrote as a lifelong yankee fan , i think the head groundskeeper could have managed as well as , or better than , torre has during the past three seasons' playoffs going into thursday night s game , he has just one win in the past seven showdowns on friday , steinbrenner tried to distance himself from neuharth s comments while confirming their friendship george steinbrenner is a friend and respects al neuharth , rubenstein said however , he sometimes disagrees with him , and this is one of those times he values neuharth s friendship , but on this one , he s quite off base neuharth could not be reached for comment torre said he reads usa today and was aware of the column , most of which dealt with other teams in the playoffs however , torre said he had not read the column and could not comment on it asked for a reaction to steinbrenner s endorsement of him for next year , torre said he had none the one thing i ca n't do is try to do my job with the knowledge of saving it , torre said i have no control over it i do what i can any time you get to the point of trying to do your job when you 're afraid of losing it , you ca n't do your job that was my philosophy when i had a lot less security than now , financially next year will be the final season of torre s threeyear , 165 million contract that he signed after the 2001 world series although he has made it clear that offthefield distractions generated by steinbrenner have made this season less fun than other ones , torre has stressed that he will not resign torre seemed relaxed on friday , speaking with reporters at a news conference and then informally in the dugout before watching the yankees practice hopefully , the batting practice today will eliminate what happens every time you go indoors it s different seeing the ball , torre said we 'll get the outfielders some work , and you hope that the second day is better than the first day , as far as picking up the spin and stuff torre said he did not expect any changes in his lineup or defense for game 3 against the twins' kyle lohse , a righthander who will be pitching on his 25th birthday on saturday his opponent , the 41yearold roger clemens , will face a twins lineup he generally dominates five twins have more than 15 career atbats against clemens , and only shannon stewart \( 290 \) has an average higher than 220 the twins' biggest power threat , torii hunter , is 0 for 20 off clemens with 12 strikeouts clemens is retiring after this season , and said he has not thought about the possibility that saturday s start could be the last of his career he said he does not notice crowd noise when he pitches , so he does not expect the raucous fans to bother him the same goes for torre , who will be watched closely this weekend by the yankees' biggest fan , even if his managerial job seems secure inside pitch al newman , the twins' thirdbase coach , will throw out the first pitch before game 3 newman was released from a chicago hospital last week after suffering a brain hemorrhage in chicago in early september newman visited the team at the metrodome on friday basically , a lot of us did n't know if we would ever see him again , first baseman doug mientkiewicz said photo joe torre watching the yankees during practice at the metrodome , where his team has not played since april \( photo by associated press \) \( pg d3

looking at the northsouth cards here , in what contract would you choose to play \? the deal occurred in the first of two worldwide pairs contests , played on june 6 in 41 countries the world winners were gloria milder and elaine katzman , playing at jourdan s club in boca raton , fla , who scored 7524 percent eric kokish , the official commentator , correctly predicted that the most popular contract would be six notrump , making with an overtrick he pointed out , however , that seven notrump was desirable , with a better than 75 percent chance of success if played by south he can first test the spades , and if the jack does not appear , he will run the clubs and have squeeze chances if nothing good happens , he will resort to the diamond finesse among the 2 , 584 pairs , 191 hit this target and were rewarded with 4 , 974 match points out of a possible 5 , 166 that top score was achieved by a pair that was fortunate enough to be doubled in seven notrump thirtysix pairs arrived in seven spades , a much worse contract , and were lucky the spade jack fell conveniently , and each pair collected 4 , 747 points if that card had been well guarded , they would have had almost none as kokish points out , however , none of these contracts is theoretically best in a bidding contest the prize would go to pairs reaching seven clubs , which will succeed with any normal breaks suppose a neutral heart lead south wins in dummy , cashes the club ace and unblocks the acequeen of spades he then leads to the club 10 , noting that everyone follows , and ruffs a low spade he now draws trumps and claims 13 tricks , assuming that both opponents followed to two rounds of spades even if the clubs divide 51 , he has several chances can seven clubs be bid \? nineteen pairs did so and were rewarded with 4 , 692 points kokish suggests the delicate sequence shown in the diagram two diamonds by south is a reverse , strengthshowing and forcing two notrump , in the modern american style , is natural and gameforcing it tends to deny a threecard club fit , so four clubs on the next round suggests a doubleton honor three controlshowing bids follow , and north jumps to five notrump to ask his partner to select a slam the sixclub bid indicates a strong suit , and the grand slam becomes a good bet a few northsouth pairs had disasters two rested in partscores one contrived to pass the deal out , a mystery and 19 somehow achieved minus scores diagram

the hague , july 16 the new international criminal court is likely to open its first case by investigating the leaders most responsible for flagrant abuses against civilians in eastern congo , the court s chief prosecutor announced today the official , luis moreno ocampo , who took office last month , said he had received information about extensive atrocities in the region these include the massacre of unarmed civilians , mass rape , torture , kidnappings , mutilations and ritual cannibalism , he said the united nations security council corroborated many of the accusations in a recent report , he said although the fiveyearold war has cost an estimated three million lives through violence , starvation and disease , the prosecutor will focus on ituri , in eastern congo , where 5 , 000 civilians were killed between july 2002 and early 2003 while this represents only a fraction of the reported atrocities , this prosecutor can only act on incidents after july 1 , 2002 , when the court s jurisdiction began we selected the situation in the ituri region as the first case because it s urgent , it s of great gravity , it is under our jurisdiction and the state itself is not certain to act , he said at a news conference we may be able to prevent more killing mr moreno ocampo said he hoped national jurisdictions would join him in investigating the criminal business of the congo war money laundering , gold smuggling and arms dealing he said he had received reports that organized crime groups from eastern europe and some african , european and middle eastern companies could be linked to the atrocities doing away with the illicit business of war is vital , he said , because unless it is stopped , atrocities will continue he added this is a message we are now here and will investigate and punish crimes and companies doing illegal business and financing crimes must now know we will follow them even if the prosecutor acts fast , though , no case is likely to come to trial for at least a year there are other obstacles the court , now joined by 90 nations , has been the target of a hostile campaign by the bush administration while the court s mandate is to deal with genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , mr moreno ocampo today announced that he had received nearly 500 complaints , some dealing with environmental crimes , tax evasion , money laundering and judicial corruption , none of those pertinent to the court more than 100 letters were complaints relating to iraq , half of them accusing the united states of aggression the prosecutor said they were outside his jurisdiction because neither iraq nor the united states are parties to the court the prosecutor , though clear in his intent , stopped short of saying he was opening a formal investigation in congo in a case like this , initiated by his office rather than by a government or the security council , he first requires the approval from a pretrial chamber of three judges

sean landeta was standing in the parking lot at giants stadium being interviewed by carl banks , a former giants teammate but these days , banks works for wfanam , the sportstalk station in new york , and landeta is the punter for the philadelphia eagles as the interview concluded before the start of eaglesgiants game , there was a hearty round of applause polite , to be sure is n't there supposed to be some kind of rivalry going on here \? after all , the professional teams at either end of about 100 miles of highway have found their sports teams in the top two spots in their divisions the new jersey nets recently overtook the philadelphia 76ers in the national basketball association s atlantic division the new jersey devils and the philadelphia flyers have been dueling all season at the top of their division , also called the atlantic , in the national hockey league and last weekend the giants beat the eagles to finish in second place behind the philadelphians in the national football league s national conference east but in none of these cases , it seems , is there a bloodthirsty rivalry going on despite the geographic proximity and simultaneous success of the teams from new jersey and philadelphia , there appears to be only a lot of hohummery what byron scott has said all along is that he considers the boston celtics and indiana pacers our main rivals , said gary sussman , the head of public relations for the nets , said of the team s coach sussman added that though the nets make it a policy not to discuss their business plans , there have been no special promotions for games between the nets and the 76ers at the continental arena similarly , none of the 76ers giveaways or other promotions have been done for nets games and none of their dozen largest home crowds have been against the nets even though the giantseagles game was crucial in the standings , it was apparent that each team was looking ahead to the playoffs there has been somewhat of a giantseagles rivalry you can see here over the years , but it seems they were never good at the same time , so it never has amounted to all that much , said john cimiluca , manager of manny s sports restaurant and bar in moonachie , a longtime hangout for giants coaches and fans alike situated just a couple of miles from giants stadium but the netssixers have never been anything , and i would say that the devils , well , we get bigger crowds when they play the rangers , not the flyers , said cimiluca northern nonchalance aside , it works that way on the other end of the state , too south jerseyans love their philadelphia teams and could care less about those up the turnpike a nets game would be meaningless here , even though they are good , said bill mahler , manager of p j whelihans pub , a sports bar in haddon township the traditional rivals for the 76ers , at least so we can see , are the celtics and lakers p j whelihans is one of the favorite watering holes for many of the flyers , several of whom live nearby and practice about four miles away , in voorhees a few of the players and coaches were in the other night and sat near a tv with the detroit red wings game on , said mahler i kidded them about scouting the game but the red wings play exciting hockey i think one of the reasons a devilsflyers rivalry never really developed for fans is that they both play defensive hockey that s pretty boring to watch you do n't get excited by it jody mcdonald , who is a host on wfan and also does the pregame show for wyspfm before that station s broadcast of eagles games , blamed the low temperatures on inertia and lack of longevity for his part , mcdonald lives in marlton , which is closer to philadelphia than new york , though he has a history in new york sports since his father , joe , was an executive with the new york mets if there is a rivalry at all , it would be the eaglesgiants , since the giants still use the new york name , he said new york gets south jersey fans boiling , but they do n't get the same thing when it is a new jersey name but the giants have been good for a long time and the nets have been good for 13 months we 'll see what happens if jason kidd stays in new jersey and allen iverson stays in philadelphia then maybe fans will become more excited to richard harris , director of the senator walter rand institute for public affairs at rutgers university in camden , the temperature may be rising harris sees a parallel between the rising profile of south jersey in politics and the potential fomenting of bigger sports rivalries between south and north in the 1970 s , there was a halftongueincheek effort to have south jersey secede because it did n't get its due , he said but now several of the major legislative committees are headed by south jersey politicians , and they are feistier than they used to be harris went on in sports , you are seeing more of a flicker of that , too but still , it will tend to be mediadriven the media can more easily get a handle on new york versus philadelphia new jersey teams are n't in a place that is a media center but maybe if they move to newark , there will be a there there and that will change photos giants fans , above , cheering against the philadelphia eagles on dec 28 wearing eagles jerseys , below , fans watched the philadelphia phillies take on the montreal

i challenged my brother to a tour of the city either he finally gave a tour or he had to quit flashing his new york city sightseeing guide license not that it was n't an impressive credential , stamped and laminated , featuring steven s trustworthy face digitally photographed behind plexiglass not that i begrudged him the right it afforded , to start charging for services our family had long taken for granted airport and ferry pickups , ticket buying , deliveries , firsthand traffic updates and lastminute reservations at il mulino not that i even cared that he got the license as a reaction to the attacks of sept 11 or a novel way to meet foreign girls and play pranks on tourists , all of which he mostly denied i chose the first day of spring for the tour steven fittingly , picked spring street as its subject he invited a small group , which he summarized as my sister me , my fianc e jen , my college roommate jesse , my lawyer gregg and my best man matt matt catapano , also a virgin guide , had been the one who persuaded steven to get the license in the first place the two had become devotees of barry lewis s cooper union lectures on architecture together they headed out to shea stadium dozens of times a summer , forging alternative routes and impromptu tours , like flatbush avenue movie theater church and hairbraiding mecca their shared love of the city had become something of competitive sport bet you ca n't name the seven secrets of grand central station in less than 10 seconds \? matt might ask as their subway approached 42nd street or , why do i detect the faint odor of manure \? steven might ask as they drove down ocean parkway , once a horse trail in brooklyn but whereas steven would have been content to go on pontificating behind the wheel of his audi , matt had a secret desire to be a guide atop a doubledecker bus to do so , he discovered , required a license from the city s department of consumer affairs requirements a photo id , three affidavits , 50 and a passing grade on an exam so both men took a preparatory course at city college and then the actual multiplechoice test both correctly answered such questions as where did lou gehrig live \( yorkville and later fieldston \) and when can one idle a bus \( only when picking up or discharging passengers \) does either one of them need the 50 they might earn per professional tour \? both say no steven and matt have lucrative jobs at cumberland packing corporation and mtv , respectively neither plans to pursue a doctorate in history or architecture so why bother to get a license \? jesse the roommate wondered aloud while we waited in the rain for the rest of the group to convene at spring and elizabeth streets bragging rights , steven replied and to champion truth for that moment in a bar when some bonehead starts spouting misinformation about my city ! then i 'll just whip out the card matt sported a smug smile he had preempted steven , having already given a bunch of midwestern girls a tour of times square but steven was undeterred he tempted us out from under the awning of caf leibowitz with slices from lombardi s \( the country s first licensed pizzeria \) as we peered into the eastern united states taoist association shrine , he introduced us to the main themes of the tour , the confluence of architectural styles and cultures along this city block steve will be using that word confluence frequently , matt warned , unaware that steven was keeping count of how many times matt said back in the day , as in , back in the day before tenement laws , there were 10 , 000 people living here without electricity , plumbing , running water even a group as innocuouslooking as ours drew suspicious stares from store owners so the guides slowly moved us westward from nolita to little italy , now regrettably shrunk down to mulberry street here , john gotti once ruled the neighborhood from the ravenite social club here , matt s grandmother used to return home after a day washing floors on wall street here , a collective gassy memory of san gennaro festivals past we all claimed to be spring street experts the roommate , who works nearby , could name vesuvio park before the sign came in view the fianc e knew its best restaurants balthazar \( at crosby \) and aquagrill \( avenue of the americas \) i sleep in a bed made by scott jordan \( varick \) yet it was news to us that there was actually a spring here \( once owned by aaron s burr s water company \) , a house literally cut in half \( near west broadway \) and a new spot devoted exclusively to rice pudding \( near mulberry \) stranger still , none of us ever noticed that standing on spring , one could see so many landmarks the old beauxarts police headquarters , the chrysler and woolworth buildings , the empire state , now the city s tallest structure i got my sightseeing license on the first anniversary of 9 11 , steven confessed as we stared into the familiar hole in the sky i woke up , and it seemed the only way to deal with the day lightning emptied the street of passersby and filled them with men selling umbrellas jen the fianc e bought seven , and we huddled together , staring down at the slick manhattan schist , which matt explained was dug up to create the subways and tunnels further down , steven added , we 'll see the firefighter museum where i went on a fifthgrade trip the tour had veered off to a more personal spring street , a place beyond the mansard roofs , glass plugs , cast iron and cobblestones there was that grease pit where jesse s friend was once the chef the great girls matt met at the bar near lafayette , who turned out to be not only jailbait but also promgoers the hassle regarding the blinds i bought at the sixth avenue janovic , completely ignorant of the fact that on that exact ground existed the original richmond hill , summer headquarters of general george washington and home of john adams and aaron burr by the time the holland tunnel came into illuminated view , we were so soaked and giddy , our guides stopped their bickering to jointly describe this wonder of the world circa 1920 people drove through it just to drive through it ! hotels advertised by offering a free ride on a streamlined bus to the city in just eight minutes ! eight ! our tour ended at the ear inn , part of the 1800era james brown building whose original owner is thought to have been an exslave who fought in the revolution beer bought us bonus stories of the spring street ghosts juliana elmore sands , found in the winter of 1800 floating in a well on spring and broadway , her apparition seen rising from waterbeds as recently as 1974 mickey , a sailor who was run over right outside this door , seen as recently as , now ! behind you ! it was time for steven to flash his credentials , even if they 'd soon be obsolete a few weeks ago , the city decided to revamp the licensing exam guides will now be expected to understand the concepts behind the facts , the history behind the trivia steven wonders why communication skills are not required matt suggests candidates be made to prove that they actually like people nevertheless , i challenged my brother to a new test if he promised to take the test , i told him , i 'd write this photos steven eisenstadt , left , and matt catapano , newly minted guides , led a tour of spring street on the first day of spring \( photographs by joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
it s been more than 30 years since whitney young jr died and his name is no longer particularly well known , which is a shame mr young was the executive director of the national urban league and one of the big four civil rights leaders of the 1960 s , along with martin luther king jr , roy wilkins and james farmer he drowned at the absurdly young age of 49 during a visit to nigeria in 1971 more than 6 , 000 people attended his funeral at manhattan s riverside church , and thousands more lined the streets of harlem to view the funeral procession mr young had been a giant in the movement and it was widely recognized that his death represented a terrible loss what was not understood at the time was that an incredible decadeslong slide into the horrors of violence and degradation for millions of africanamerican youngsters was already under way more than three decades later we still have n't stopped the descent it is now absolutely normal in many circles for young black men and women \( and , for that matter , little black boys and girls \) to refer to one another as niggaz and bitches and ho s doing well in school is frequently disdained as a white thing doing time in prison is widely accepted as a black thing , and no cause for shame few people are surprised to hear that a gathering at this party or that club degenerated into the kind of violence we used to associate with the ok corral homicide , drugs and aids are carving the heart out of one generation after another , and suicide among blacks is on the rise just before i sat down to write this column i happened to glance at an article that was on the front page of last thursday s boston globe beneath a color photo of a black toddler , the article began a 3yearold girl remained in critical condition last night after a former high school basketball star allegedly ended a shouting match with a woman by spraying her dorchester house with bullets , hitting the child in the back and severing her spinal cord my question is a simple one when are we going to stop this \? i'm waiting for the mothers and the fathers , the aunts and the uncles , the older brothers and the older sisters to step forward and call a halt to the madness , to say enough ! this is not what we 're about i mentioned whitney young jr because i had a conversation a few days ago with marc morial , the former mayor of new orleans who has just taken over as head of the urban league and is hoping to raise its profile to a level comparable to the glory days of the whitney young era he plans to lay out his agenda in a keynote address to be delivered later this month at the league s annual convention my suggestion hammer home the need to stop the selfdestruction that continues to block the advancement of millions of black americans i know there are serious economic problems , particularly the absence of good jobs , that are holding some people back and i know about the abuses in the criminal justice system and the continuing plague of racism and discrimination i 've written reams about all of these things none of them are good reasons for parents to turn their backs on their children , for children to turn their backs on school , for a young man or a young woman to pick up a needle and plunge it into a vein , for a gunman to put a bullet into a rival s head or a neighbor s spine , for blacks to view themselves as niggers and whores , for entertainers to sing of the joys of rape and murder the paradox of black life in america over the past halfcentury is that so much real progress and such wholesale tragedy should have occurred in the same place at the same time the task now is to reinforce the progress and bring the curtain down on the tragedy young leaders like mr morial \( he s 45 \) and venerable institutions like the urban league \( it s 93 \) are perfectly positioned to begin the coordinated effort that s needed for this fight , which is the most serious to face black americans since the demise of legal segregation those who are looking to government to lead this effort are deluded george bush and clarence thomas will not be riding to our rescue what s required is nothing less than round two of the civil rights movement , the goal being to create a safe and constructive and nurturing environment in which all black americans can thrive
for a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the studio museum of harlem , thelma golden , the museum s deputy director for exhibitions and programs , chose 85 pieces from among more than 1 , 500 objects in the permanent collection , which includes historical and contemporary work by africanamericans and artists of the african diaspora the focus of the threepart exhibition now at the parrish art museum in southampton is on those who have had a direct relationship to the harlem community or the museum itself , including several former artists in residence the first section is devoted to harlem s most famous photographer , james vanderzee , who devoted his long and productive career to documenting the individuals and groups that defined the community s positive view of itself the museum is the custodian of the vanderzee archive , which includes vintage prints that have not previously been exhibited , as well as many familiar ones owing to restrictions imposed by the estate , however , none were made available for reproduction in this column the current selection is confined to the 1920 s and 30 s , when the socalled harlem renaissance nurtured artists , writers and intellectuals , as well as a newfound sense of pride and accomplishment in the black community at large from civic and political groups , like marcus garvey s universal negro improvement organization \( which advocated repatriation to africa \) to stylishly dressed families and formal portraits of prominent citizens , vanderzee recorded an urban microcosm striving to forge an identity that celebrated african heritage yet claimed a rightful place in american society one wellknown picture shows a couple in raccoon coats posed with a magnificent automobile , the very image of upward mobility the largescale print emphasizes the glossy sheen of fur and chrome in group portraits , entertainers and members of fraternal organizations , turned out in their finery , gather proudly for the camera the individuals are unidentified which is a shame , since their personalities register forcefully but even without names , their faces offer collective testimony to harlem s vitality during that pivotal era the show s second section features work by abstract artists who entered the mainstream in the 1950 s and 60 s a few , like beauford delaney and sam middleton , found a more sympathetic climate in europe , while norman lewis , charles alston , alma thomas and others gained recognition at home alston , whose stylized figure paintings and woodcuts based on african themes were much praised in the 1930 s , was a central figure of the harlem renaissance and influenced many younger black artists after world war ii , he developed a looser , gestural style in response to current trends his black and white ii , a 1960 canvas , illustrates this phase , but it lacks the dynamic tension of his earlier work and does not do him justice similarly , the small acrylic by thomas is far from representative of her achievements as a lyrical abstract colorist lewis , on the other hand , is well served by two canvases and an oil on paper often grouped with the abstract expressionists , he seems closer to abstract surrealists like tanguy and masson , as in his ominous 1952 painting , arctic night , with its dry , scumbled surface and cryptic forms engulfed in shadow two major works by alvin loving trace his transition from hardedge geometry to freeform abstraction variations on a sixsided object is a strong example from the late 1960 s , when mr loving painted crisply defined shapes in flat colors within a few years , however , he began making loosely constructed combinations of painting and collage , often sewing the elements together roger , a lively arrangement of torn and painted cardboard , has the delightful whimsy of a found object and the finesse of a sophisticated composition the third section offers an overview of recent work by black artists , some of whom pointedly address racial and political issues , occasionally with tongue in cheek david hammons s shrinkwrapped pile of boxes contains harlem soil , packaged for export , like care packages for the culturally needy his too obvious , a broken piggy bank that spills out cowrie shells , is a comment on the incompatability of different traditional values , but a rather subtler one than his selfdeprecating title implies willie cole s steaming hot , an iron that appears to emit feathers instead of steam , amuses with its duchampian wackiness but carries an ulterior message a reminder of the domestic labor of black women for white clients paradoxically , the iron is white with black trim , suggesting the interdependence of the disparate roles a more overt expression of racial tension is found in kerry james marshall s untitled series of posterlike relief prints of black power slogans , which are still provocative , even taken out of context and presented as art not all the artists deal directly with such themes , however odili odita paints geometric abstractions , terry adkins s wallmounted wood sculpture is a study in complementary form and texture , and martin puryear s etching reflects the primal organic forms of his abstract sculpture wangechi mutu brings an african perspective to bear on contemporary notions of black identity in her pinup series , a compelling group of watercolors with collage , in which deformation and transformation challenge the concept of ideal beauty kojo griffin undermines the very premise of race by drawing hybrid characters colorless human figures with the heads of storybook animals to act out scenes of anxiety and conflict , effectively universalizing his troubling narratives an american legacy art from the

he was 14 , she was 29 he was a skinny , bigeared kid from the bronx , she a blond bombshell from hollywood they said it would never work out , and sure enough , it did n't but for one brisk day in the spring of 1955 , peter mangone and marilyn monroe were in love and he has the film to prove it back in the 1950 s , mr mangone , now 63 and living in palm beach , fla , was such a monroe fan that for several months he staked out the gladstone hotel on east 52nd street , where she was recovering from her divorce from joe dimaggio and her summary dismissal from her contract at 20th century fox on one of those truant mornings , mr mangone took an eightmillimeter kodak camera from his brother , headed downtown and met monroe just as she was leaving the hotel for a therapeutic shopping spree then , just as in the movies , she waved , winked and asked him to come along once you saw her , once your eyes fixed into her , she was burnt into your head , mr mangone said i have n't been able to look at another woman the same way since mr mangone shot monroe in fits and starts over the afternoon , developed the film and watched it in his house on starling avenue he did not see it again for nearly 50 years when i was about 17 , i remember cleaning my room and throwing a bunch of stuff out , movie magazines and stuff , because i was a mature person now , he said i remember losing it the imaginary couple grew apart mr mangone became a speed skater , a roller derby star and eventually a professional hairstylist working with hollywood stars doing vegasstyle shows in florida \( see zsa zsa gabor , sammy davis jr , wayne newton \) monroe returned to hollywood and continued to struggle with men , fame , drugs and depression she died of an overdose of sleeping pills in 1962 at age 36 it was n't until last year that mr mangone and his film were reunited , when his brother found it among their father s possessions and returned it to him i thought he was joking , he said then i saw the case the film , ignored and stored in a beatup cardboard box , was in almost mint condition just over five minutes long , the original color film had suffered none of the ravages of time because no one had ever really seen it or screened it , said russ suniewick , the president of colorlab , a rockville , md , film preservation company that transferred the film to 16millimeter stock and vhs and dvd formats there was no sound track it s an amazing little piece of film , mr suniewick said the only downside is that it was shot by a 14yearold kid not completely accustomed to working with the camera the film is shot from four or five feet away , with a series of interactions between monroe and the camera walking backward , mr mangone captured monroe in classic new york city poses like strolling armandarm down fifth avenue with her friend and photographer , milton b greene , and stepping gingerly over a subway grate \( this was the year of the seven year itch and that famous whoosh of air and her revealing white dress \) the camera also caught unguarded , unglamorous moments her yawns , stumbles and a speck of dust flying into her eye the background has images emblematic of the 50 s checker cabs , '55 chevys , men in fedoras and women in crinolines monroe wore a black cashmere suit beth vahle , a representative of cmg worldwide , which handles the marketing rights to monroe s image , said she was not aware of any other home movies of the actress from that period i'm sure there are amateur photos of her behind the scenes at various photo shoots or on set , ms vahle said but this is just him following her around town monroe , in fact , seems to be enjoying herself in the film and in new york , smiling , gazing up at the buildings and once blowing a kiss at the camera when the film was shot , she was in a transitional period , having been fired by 20th century fox for refusing to appear in how to be very popular recast with a monroe lookalike , the film bombed she moved to new york and lived with mr greene and his wife , amy , and , sick of being typecast as a dumb blonde , began acting classes at the actors studio with lee strasberg she returned to hollywood the next year , finding mixed success as a serious actress and slowly selfdestructing mr mangone never saw her after 1955 , but his fascination has blossomed again he s uncertain what to do with the film a coffee table book of stills is one idea but he says he s happy to have found his old flame again this is a gift , he said it was like refinding my high school sweetheart and you know what \? she was just the way i remembered her photos frames from peter mangone s eightmillimeter film of marilyn monroe when she invited him to go along on a shopping trip with her and a friend , milton b greene , in second picture from the right \( peter mangone \) \( pg e1 \) peter mangone , who made a home movie of marilyn monroe \( tony cenicola the new york times \) \( pg e7 \)
seoul there was a time when the specter of communism frightened americans into digging bomb shelters in their backyards today , improbably enough , the frequent characterization of north korea as a stalinist or hardline communist nation appears to be having a calming effect , perhaps because it evokes a happy time when all america s enemies were coldhearted materialists who could therefore be reasoned with if it takes misperceptions to get everyone talking , then maybe they 're not such a bad thing but it would be dangerous for america to believe that it has negotiated successfully with kim jong il s kind before mr kim is not a stalinist in any relevant sense , and his party s juche ideology has nothing in common with the sovietstyle communism his father espoused during the korean war granted , the redthemed birthday parades may look familiar , but the cult of the two kims is no socialist personality cult stalin and mao were revered for their perfect grasp of dialectical materialism , an omnipotent science that made them omnipotent too kim jong il and his late father , kim il sung , are revered , like the monarchs they more closely resemble , for their perfect embodiment of national virtues chief among these virtues is sobak ham , a hardtotranslate korean term that corresponds closely to the word spontaneity in its marxistleninist sense the soviets considered the spontaneity of the common people , especially their tendency to violence , to be a dangerous force unless tempered with political consciousness in north korea , the people s spontaneity is seen as one of the country s greatest strengths north korean novels and movies often show the hero casting off the restraints of his book learning in a fit of wild , sometimes suicidal rage against the japanese or american enemy this political culture induces officials to tolerate a high level of violence in daily life north korean refugees attest that fistfights are the accepted way for men and women to settle even minor differences while communism was always an internationalist movement , juche \( literally , selfreliance \) sees the world in ethnic terms north korean propaganda makes no distinction between american capitalists and american workers the entire yankee race is presented as inherently evil , degenerate and ugly dictionaries and textbooks suggest that americans be described with bestial attributes \( snout for nose , for example \) the central villain of han sorya s novella jackals \( 1951 \) , the country s most enduring work of fiction , tells of an american child who beats a korean boy so brutally that he ends up in a hospital where he is murdered by the american s missionary parents since the south korean government began pursuing its policy of rapprochement , the north s ethnocentric world view has become even more stark the united states is now presented as being exclusively responsible for all tensions on the peninsula this propaganda appears to be effective even among north koreans opposed to the rule of kim jong il when i visited a resettlement center for refugees near seoul last year , many of those to whom i was introduced as an american recoiled in terror or glared at me in hatred the glorification of spontaneous violence , sweeping hatred of the american people , and a budding nuclear capacity the combination is liable , as p g wodehouse would say , to start a train of thought perhaps some in washington can sleep better by believing that kim jong il has an urbane and sensible take on the political culture he inherited from his father in 1994 but none other than mr kim was at the head of the party s propaganda apparatus when it went into overdrive in the mid to late 1960 s too much is made of his muchpublicized love of pizza and hollywood videos while his hedonism may make him a hypocrite , it s highly unlikely that it signifies any real affection for the west in short , mr kim stands for more than just a desire to stay in power america should focus less on his eccentricities and more on his ideology , especially since the antiamericanism at its core is as heartfelt and popular as the antiamericanism that led to 9 11 and other terrorist attacks diplomacy cannot succeed until the bush administration begins addressing the historical basis for this hatred a good start would be a public apology for the excesses of the american air campaign in the korean war the saturation bombing of north korean cities , the use of napalm , the attacks on irrigation dams in order to cause flooding at the same time , president bush should call on mr kim to stop posturing about the axis of evil remark , which was tame compared with what north korea s official press has been saying for the past few years about the united states , pyongyang s main aid donor it is time for the president to demand that north korea s official news media accord the same basic civility to washington as to seoul in an isolated nation dominated by propaganda , this would be a significant sign that mr kim is serious about wanting to improve relations drawing \( jeremy traum \)

the time limit in the seventh corsica knockout quickplay tournament was not quick enough for viswanathan anand , the 33yearold indian grandmaster he did his dirty work in the tiebreaker games after the first four games were drawn , at the rate of 10 minutes for all moves , plus a 10secondamove bonus , he had made no impression on his adversary , the bulgarian grandmaster veselin topalov anand had to fight to get those draws but once the time control was shortened to five minutes for all moves , plus a fivesecond bonus , anand was in his element he won the tiebreaker , two games to none three hundred fifty entrants started the event , which was held from oct 28 to nov 3 , with topalov and anand meeting in the final anand did not suddenly switch to a strategy of complexity in attack , but won both games with positional play that had the effect of limiting topalov s usually trenchant tactical style anand s new success came on the heels of his winning the world rapid chess championship in le cap d'agde , france , the previous week in the second tiebreaker game , anand chose a rare variation against the sicilian defense , one in which white omits d4 in favor of mobilizing his minor pieces topalov did not perceive the dangers to his pawn formation until it was too late the early pawn thrust in the center with 4 e5 is an attempt not to scout out attacking chances , but to develop quiet positional play and look for weak squares in black s camp it was not a long wait after 4 de 5 ne5 , topalov used 5 a6 to prevent any awkwardness from a bishop check at b5 as well as to avoid the annoyance of nb5 in an endgame without queens yet it weakened his b6 square anand was forced to advance with 6 a4 , for otherwise 6 b5 followed by the fianchetto 7 bb7 would have yielded his opponent excellent development after 10 re1 , it would probably have been better for topalov to play 10 nbd7 his 10 qc7 11 qf3 nbd7 12 bf4 qa5 was not the soul of efficiency but pointless wandering anand s 11 qf3 prevented 11 nc6 the doubled pawns after 12 nc6 bc would be a horrendous weakness anand s 13 h4 was not a bid for quick glory he did not have the power to shove an immediate 14 h5 but meanwhile , how was topalov to improve his formation \? the ball was now in his court anand relinquished the bishop pair with 14 bd2 nc4 15 nc4 , but after qd8 16 bf4 , the dark squares b6 and d6 were solidly in his pocket this was one of the main themes of his opening , and topalov seemed not to understand the positional dangers facing him after 17 be5 , topalov could not well have played 17 nc3 18 bc be5 because 19 re5 qc7 20 qe3 b6 21 a5 would win for anand after 22 qe5 , anand was a pawn ahead with a winning game after 33 ng6 , by which anand collared a second pawn and broke up the black pawn formation , topalov realized the seriousness of his predicament and gave up table sicilian defense white black anand topalov 1 e4 c5 2 nf3 d6 3 nc3 nf6 4 e5 de 5 ne5 a6 6 a4 g6 7 bc4 e6 8 00 bg7 9 d3 00 10 re1 qc7 11 qf3 nbd7 12 bf4 qa5 13 h4 nb6 14 bd2 nc4 15 nc4 qd8 16 bf4 nd5 17 be5 qh4 18 bg7 kg7 19 nd5 ed 20 qd5 be6 21 qc5 rac8 22 qe5 kg8 23 re4 qh6 24 rae1 rfd8 25 b3 rd5 26 qf4 qg7 27 nb6 rf5 28 qd2 rc6 29 nc4 h5 30 qe3 qc3 31 re2 b5 32 ne5 rd6 33 ng6 resigns
on the southern shore of staten island on the edge of lemon creek park , a cluster of 21 buildings defy architectural classification some are multifamily , tripledecker designs of saltwhitened wood that resemble new england seafarers' homes others are postmodern , singlefamily units built of plastic in the shape of gourds all have excellent views of the lapping waters of prince s bay , because they are built high atop poles but the most striking thing about these dwellings is that they are the size of dollhouses oh , and the residents are birds every spring for half a century , a group of purple martins have flown into new york city to make their summer homes by the shore these large members of the swallow family fly in from brazil \( where they roost in city parks around s o paulo \) and are welcomed by human caretakers with whom they have an unusually involved relationship on a recent friday evening , we visited the lemon creek martin colony and found gloria deppe , 77 , standing beneath an octagonal birdhouse and placing broken eggshells on a low platform the females need calcium , she explained my friend saves me all her eggshells from the whole winter ms deppe , a staten island resident and retired schoolteacher , has been the de facto building manager and concierge at the martin colony for 27 years in the summer she s out almost every evening chasing away pesky starlings and house sparrows , two nonnative species that frequently try to evict the martins she supervises a crew of volunteers who repair houses damaged by storms , and she makes sure the interiors are swept clean before the martins arrive for the summer these birds are very finicky about where they choose to make their nests , she said if i do n't keep the houses shipshape , they 'll reject them but once they 're all settled in , they seem to love people they 're not afraid at all dogwalkers and strollers stopped to chat with ms deppe as she waited for the martins to return for the night just before dusk is the best time to see them , she advised everyone s welcome as long as you do n't throw rocks an hour before sunset as the sky began to turn pink over prince s bay , ms deppe showed us our first martins , a pair performing a dazzling series of aerial acrobatics , swooping two to four stories over our heads and in and around their cottages that s the male , said ms deppe , pointing at an eightinchhigh bird with a slightly forked tail that , at first , appeared allblack when its plumage caught the light , it gleamed an iridescent purpleblue the female , with a dark back and gray belly , was less flashy they called to each other , making a melodious gurgling sound as more martins arrived after a hard day of catching insects on the wing , they circled high in the air or perched on telephone lines nearby before coming in for a landing on their front porches , where they chirped sociably with one another i whistle so they know me i do n't know if they do , but i do it anyway , ms deppe said as she walked within a few feet of the perching birds the starlings scattered , but the martins stayed put martins are unusual because over centuries of association with people they have largely given up their natural nest sites in tree cavities these days martins are not known to nest anywhere in eastern north america except in houses built by humans even then they rarely nest in a birdhouse unless it is within 100 feet of a human habitation somehow the martins have learned that they 're safer with people nearby , ms deppe said , shooing away a few more starlings it turns out that being with humans , even new yorkers , has survival value , because predators and competitors are more likely to stay at bay the lemon creek colony is part of a network of martin communities the purple martin conservation association in edinboro , pa , monitors the progress of many such martin sites , provides construction plans and sells prefab houses to martin landlords , or martineers , as they 're sometimes called across the united states and canada , the association has registered thousands of colonies but lemon creek and a nearby colony on arden avenue are the only ones in new york city the lemon creek colony was started in 1953 , ms deppe said we 're celebrating our 50th anniversary this year the colony was founded by howard cleaves , a pioneer in wildlife photography , a popular lecturer on bird life and a prominent member of the section of natural history at the staten island institute of arts and sciences , where ms deppe is a longtime member mr cleaves lived right over here on purdy place , said ms deppe , pulling out an aging ledger that documents the martins' comings and goings in 1953 he attracted six pairs and they raised chicks successfully the next year he had 14 , the next year 21 the martins have been coming to lemon creek ever since they 're extremely faithful to nest sites she said that up to 80 pairs of birds had been at the site
do n't blame grady that was the message from pedro mart nez last night after the red sox lost the pennant to the yankees yet again but people will blame grady little , the boston manager , and they will have a point in the long and grim winter that is sure to come soon in new england , the fans will question why little left mart nez in for a pounding in the eighth inning , when he was long past his usual limit ninetyeight pitches that was the average number per game for mart nez this past season the season that ended last night mart nez faded in throwing an unofficial total of 123 pitches , most of them brilliant , but once again , new york has trumped new england in the american league , by a 65 score in the 11th inning , thereby winning its 39th pennant mart nez is known to need special care and handling boston managers have long since learned to give him his full four days of rest , which was why he and roger clemens were matched once again last night after their emotional duel last saturday in boston clemens was gone in the fourth inning mart nez pitched seven strong innings , giving up two home runs to jason giambi and then he came out for the eighth i would refuse to give up the ball if you asked me , mart nez said afterward , standing graciously to face the news media in a hushed boston clubhouse i am the ace of the staff this is no time to say i am tired the red sox always observe the pitch count for mart nez they want him at his sharpest , and do not want to wear him down however , he got up to 130 pitches in the first round against oakland last night the sox had a 52 lead in the bottom of the eighth up in boston there was reason to start preparing the lobster rolls and clam chowder for the world series parties , to celebrate beating their old rivals he got one out in the eighth then derek jeter doubled there was activity in the bullpen , which has been excellent in this postseason little has not been able to establish a fulltime dependable closer , but he has juggled his staff , wearing down oakland , sticking with the yankees no wonder little was inclined to stick with the man who has won three cy young awards when bernie williams followed with a single for a run , little came running out to the mound from the thirdbase dugout , and patted mart nez he asked me if i had any bullets in my tank , mart nez said i said i had enough after little went back , hideki matsui hit a groundrule double to right still no relief pitcher and then jorge posada , a switchhitter , dunked a double into leftcenter field for two runs to tie the score then mart nez was removed , with the pitch count at 123 grady little had gone with his slender , somewhat fragile ace who has won 166 games in the regular season it was a decision based more on loyalty and emotion than logic the red sox would lose later , because the yankees had mariano rivera and the red sox do not but this game will always be remembered in new england for little letting mart nez stay in the game pedro mart nez has been our man all year long and in situations like that , he s the one we want on the mound over anybody we can bring in out of that bullpen , little said in his postgame news conference what did little ask of mart nez on his trip to the mound \? pedro wanted to stay in there , little said he wanted to get the job done , just as he has many times for us all season long , and he s the man we all wanted on the mound the moderator of the news conference asked if there were any other questions for little there were none it was the only question why \? why \? why \? the scream echoes like the new england wind did little have any justification \? in the biggest game of the year , you leave nothing behind it could mean trotting in mike mussina and david wells in relief , as joe torre did for the yankees , because he knew he had rivera waiting pedro mart nez was an ace in search of a defining game boston was in search of a pennant neither happened it means nothing now that mart nez outlasted clemens , who has won 310 games and six cy young awards clemens , who is about to retire , could have pitched his last game , but now he will get his rest and pitch in another world series , his fourth mart nez still has none mart nez sat in front of his locker after it was over you spend a whole season with these guys , it hurts , mart nez said he said he respected the yankees , with whom he had a contentious outing last saturday in boston and he said he knew the fans in boston have to be heartbroken , as we are then mart nez defended his manager for leaving him in i would n't put grady on the spot , he said grady did n't play i was the one playing if you want to judge anybody , i was out there grady did a great job of managing that is not what people will be saying as they remember this game , this season they will remember an ace pitcher who went longer than he almost ever goes , and the manager who let him photos pedro mart nez heard it from the crowd as walked off the field at yankee stadium in the eighth inning after giving up the tying runs \( photo by barton silverman the new york times \) jason giambi watching his home run off mart nez in the fifth \( photo by barton silverman \)
andrea rosen gallery 525 west 24th street , chelsea through april 5 the young british painter gillian carnegie is working with several current ideas , none of which she takes far or personally enough her new york debut is an erratic , overly determined conceptual installation about painting , in which motif and process trade off and a brainy garishness prevails a target , for example , can be the subject of a small abstraction or a smearing device that adds a prismatic bravura to a more thickly painted landscape in a bit of needless sensationalism , ms carnegie begins each of her exhibitions with a relatively academic painting of her own backside that suggests a parody of courbet s source of the world thereafter , she explores the wideranging physical possibilities of paint her least successful works are several stiff landscapes that tend to move , processwise , from dark , thick paint at the edges toward lighter , thinner , more brittle treatments at the center the dark parts are best , suggesting scraped paint and encroaching night , or autumnal decay yet up close , they display an obsessive brushstrokeperleaf precision not surprisingly , the two strongest works , although not without gimmickry , are ones in which dark or thick paint , or both , dominate an ostensibly modernist monochrome , black square , is actually an expertly builtup forest scene in which , for example , thick wrinkled paint replicates tree bark with startling accuracy and popolvuh , an alldark thinlytothickly painted still life , also shows promise ms carnegie s excursions into the tensions between material , image and process seem indebted to gerhard richter , laura owens , lucian freud , jasper johns and michael raedecker , which are not bad choices but most of her paintings are calculated and devoid of pictorial life , which is to say that they barely make the case for their own existence roberta smith
cameras are not welcome in jury rooms in texas , the state s highest criminal appeals court ruled yesterday the decision reversed a judge s decision in november to let a television program videotape jury deliberations in a capital murder trial the judge in that trial , ted poe , had granted a request by the pbs series frontline to tape every aspect of the trial of cedric r harrison , including jury deliberations , saying the resulting documentary would have educational value mr harrison is accused of shooting a man to death during a carjacking the trial , which was suspended during jury selection while the appeals court considered judge poe s decision , will soon resume producers for frontline said they had not decided whether to go forward with a documentary based on other aspects of the trial courts in other jurisdictions have occasionally allowed jury deliberations to be taped but those cases were different in two ways , according to the texas appeals court all the parties in those cases consented to the tapings , and none of those cases involved the death penalty mr harrison , the defendant , agreed to the taping , but prosecutors objected fifteen members of the jury pool who expressed reservations about the possible videotaping of deliberations were excused the court , the court of criminal appeals , in austin , split 6 to 3 and issued six separate opinions but the decision was more lopsided than the vote suggests , with no dissenting judge endorsing the idea of videotaping deliberations they differed , rather , on whether the prosecution was entitled to an immediate appeal of judge poe s order putting aside that procedural dispute , the decision turned on the meaning of a texas statute that says no person shall be permitted to be with the jury while it is deliberating charles l babcock , the lawyer representing judge poe before the appellate court , argued that the law prohibited only physical attendance by outsiders during jury deliberations and was meant to avoid allowing jurors to be influenced by others he said that the frontline camera would have been unattended and that nothing would have been broadcast until after the trial but the majority , in a decision written by judge barbara hervey , said that the camera represented millions of viewers and was thus a person for purposes of the statute judge hervey added that jurors' knowledge that their deliberations would later be scrutinized would hinder their ability to discuss the case freely and frankly mr babcock said judge poe thought the appeal had been worthwhile judge poe sparked a healthy national debate about this issue and created a lot of thoughtful analysis , mr babcock said he felt and still feels that experimenting this way in a democracy would be helpful and not harmful james a hemphill , a lawyer for frontline , contended that the appeals court had made two mistakes a majority of the court is operating from the fundamental assumption that jurors cannot deliberate conscientiously when there is an unmanned camera in the room , mr hemphill said , and that s just a fundamental premise with which we disagree they 're also proceeding from the assumption that cameras are inherently corrosive to the judicial process , relying largely on very old cases , which is a thesis that has been disproven , he said judge cathy cochran , in a concurrence , said she applauded the lofty goals and good intentions of judge poe and frontline but judge cochran said they did not justify an intrusion into the jury room would any of us hesitate for a moment had the request been made by aunt tillie to sit quietly in the corner of the jury deliberation room \( or maybe hide in the janitor s closet peeping out of a hole \) , promising not to say a word , because she wanted the educational experience of seeing how jurors in a capital case debate these crucial issues \? she asked if 'frontline' is entitled to put its eyes and ears into the jury room , why not aunt tillie \?

a manhattan businesswoman who had been charged with stealing money from agencies after the sept 11 terrorist attack was indicted for a second time yesterday on new charges of using her business to falsely obtain emergency funds state prosecutors in manhattan said the woman , beatrice kaufman , 68 , falsely claimed that her business , an employment agency for lawyers , was damaged by the terrorist attack and collected thousands of dollars from two charities , the red cross and safe horizon ms kaufman pleaded not guilty to the new charges , thirddegree larceny and falsifying business records her lawyer , paul w siegert , said he could not comment on the specifics of the case , but said ms kaufman was absolutely not guilty she remains free on 15 , 000 bail ms kaufman also pleaded not guilty to the earlier charges , filed in november , that accused her of collecting almost 115 , 000 from the federal emergency management agency and private insurance carriers after claiming she had to leave her downtown apartment she was arrested along with 25 other people who prosecutors said were scheming to defraud government agencies and charities that were aiding victims of the terrorist attack in reality , according to the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , ms kaufman was renovating two apartments she owned in a building at broadway and maiden lane and was living in her house in the hamptons and at the carlton house hotel when the attack occurred the indictment yesterday represents another example of what government officials say is a continuing effort to investigate fraud and waste in programs to assist people and businesses hurt by the attack three months ago , for instance , fema announced that it was intensifying its investigation of companies and individuals involved in an effort for new york city residents known as the individual and family grant program , which has been far more popular than anticipated , paying about 46 million to date the program , which was supposed to help people who had lost their jobs , suffered property damage or needed to be reimbursed for airquality equipment , was plagued by confusion over eligibility and procedures fema officials were concerned that the program might have been ripe for abuse and fraud indeed , officials cited several examples of telemarketing companies claiming to be fema representatives last year in order to obtain credit and financial information from residents while the program stopped accepting applications at the end of november , fema officials have told new york officials in recent days that the level of fraud may have been higher than they originally suspected as a result , they have continued to dispatch investigators to verify claims that had been paid to people they have also said that they have referred some suspected cases of fraud to prosecutors , though none have been filed to date but , in an indication of how sensitive the topic of 9 11 assistance remains , several community groups representing immigrants and workingclass new yorkers said yesterday that fema had to shoulder some of the blame for creating an atmosphere ripe for such abuse because of what they called the agency s contradictory and confusing rules
washington , sept 1 a new series of major raids in northern iraq against supporters of saddam hussein s government and criminal operatives is the first widescale use of a revamped american strategy in which troops carry out more precise attacks instead of broad sweeps , american commanders say in the last week , several hundred troops from the army s fourth infantry division , supported by tanks and helicopters , have raided suspected guerrilla hideouts in a swath of territory north of baghdad military officials have provided few details , citing continuing operations , but at least seven iraqis suspected of carrying out attacks against american troops have been arrested the new approach reflects the views of senior commanders that the american military s large sweeps that sometimes rounded up several hundred ordinary iraqis were alienating the public at the same time , officials said , iraqis are providing more and better information about suspected supporters of mr hussein that has enabled the military to plan raids that are better focused on specific targets the main difference is the ability to focus more precisely because of better intelligence , said col guy shields , a military spokesman in baghdad because of better intelligence , we may know the exact house , rather than just the block that makes a big difference in the number of people you inconvenience the shift in tactics , which commanders began formulating last month , reflects the military s delicate balancing act between maintaining the support of an iraqi public that is increasingly restless over the continuing disorder and slow pace of restoring electrical power and water , and combating baathist party operatives , foreign fighters , islamic militants and criminals with american commanders acknowledging that the presence of 140 , 000 united states troops has attracted foreign fighters and terrorists from outside iraq , developing accurate and timely intelligence has become increasingly important to the americanled occupation ultimately , the people who are going to be most effective against the pockets of extremism , baathist remnants and other threats to internal security will be iraqis , not americans , gen john p abizaid , the commander of american forces in iraq , said in an interview on thursday , the day before a car bomb in najaf killed more than 80 people the vast majority of our operations are enabled by iraqis but iraqis had complained that the big sweeps the military had conducted as recently as midjuly were rounding up not only baathists and criminals , but also ordinary iraqis as a result , general abizaid and his top field commander , lt gen ricardo s sanchez , decided that the larger operations were becoming counterproductive general sanchez first raised the idea of changing tactics during an interview with the new york times last month we have to be as precise in our combat operations with ground troops going into villages as we were in our combat operations in the war with our precisionguided weapons , general abizaid said we ca n't be indiscriminate we ca n't just round up people and then sort them out it makes no sense to conduct a military operation that creates more enemies than friends general abizaid said developing better intelligence would be discussed by top military and civilian planners in baghdad later this week in a major strategy session to review iraq policies american officials are also trying to accelerate the training of an iraqi army , police force and civil defense corps , in part so those forces can establish ties to iraqis who can provide additional tips we 'll discuss all levels of security building within iraq , general abizaid , said , adding that a goal of this week s meeting would be to rethink the allies' campaign plan though it s not my mission to build intelligence forces , it is my mission to achieve intelligence breakthroughs he denied reports that the american military or civilian authorities were recruiting former agents of the iraqi intelligence service none of us are interested in having the bad guys on our team , he said general abizaid , the head of the united states central command , said american forces had to be careful that intelligence provided by iraqis was not simply to settle old grievances he acknowledged that in some cases , this had happened and that american forces had made mistakes commanders are using the new approach toward pinpointing enemy forces in operations against suspected guerrillas across the country two raids last week north of baghdad were the first largescale missions to use the tactics , commanders said what we are doing is surgical strikes on more remote areas where we have not had a very large or enduring military presence , maj josslyn aberle , a spokeswoman for the fourth infantry division , told reporters in tikrit last week in one raid near baqubah , about 40 miles north of baghdad , elements of the fourth division focused on a network headed by lateef hamed alkubaishata , a convicted murderer and gangster known as lateef he escaped , army officers said , but 24 others were detained , including seven iraqis wanted in connection with attacks against american forces his gang had claimed responsibility for a bomb that exploded outside police headquarters in baqubah on aug 10 , killing one american military policeman , army officers said lateef is also accused of selling weapons , burning down the baqubah courthouse to destroy criminal records , and killing a prostitute whom he accused of fraternizing with united states troops their primary focus is probably criminal activity , but they have attacked coalition forces through direct and indirect means , col david hogg , commander of the fourth division s second brigade , told the associated press last week as long as he is in place , we will not be able to establish the conditions for the iraqi police to establish law and order in the area colonel shields , the military spokesman , said troops were increasingly using cordon and knock operations , in which a home or building is surrounded by american troops who then seek permission to enter accompanied by an iraqi representative , rather than just kicking down the door but the military will not hesitate to use major force when necessary to bring down their foes when we have to be hard , general abizaid said , we 'll be hard
east rutherford , nj , dec 7 as quarterback kerry collins fell backward with his left leg twisted under him , the pain dawning on him in waves , the giants' entire season seemed to fit into that one moment it was the height of futility a play the officials should have blown dead on a delayofgame penalty and the lowest point of a giants season full of lows with collins , the seemingly indestructible quarterback , crumpled in a heap , the other details of the giants' 207 loss to the redskins on sunday faded to irrelevance the giants found out later that collins escaped with a bad sprain , but at the time , the air in giants stadium held nothing but doom i saw him going down backward , said giants running back tiki barber it was like slow motion i thought , 'pull your leg out pull your leg out' then i heard him scream that scream echoed through a halfempty stadium , the seats freckled with freezing fans , the field ringed by snowdrifts and whipped by a relentless wind only about 40 , 000 showed up to watch paid attendance was 78 , 481 unless you count the snowmen so creatively constructed by fans in the sections that were not cleared of snow those who came watched the giants \( 49 \) lose their fifth straight game and have their latest worstcase scenario play out losing collins was the final indignity in a season packed with them he rode away in a cart after a line of redskins came by to wish him well , including defensive end bruce smith , who had been the one who hit collins it was n't my intention to hurt kerry , said smith , who played a fitting part in the play s futility he has spent this season chasing the nfl career sacks record yet he got to collins late collins had already thrown the ball and on a play that did not count smith later broke reggie white s record with his 199th career sack , by taking down the backup jesse palmer the injury to collins , with 8 minutes 59 seconds left in the third quarter , happened on a play that was run after the 25second clock had expired but the back judge , greg steed , was so unemphatic blowing his whistle and throwing the flag that none of the other officials saw or heard it in time to stop the play ian allen , the tackle beaten by smith , was the only offensive player who knew there was a penalty collins did not find out until he had reached the training room i did n't hear the whistle , collins said i did n't know the play was dead i was playing it out if you 're going to blow it dead , blow it dead be forceful about it and step in there there was another play like that , a guy was unabated to the quarterback we can avoid things like this just be forceful about it the referee , walt coleman , said the rest of the crew did not hear steed s whistle because of the wind , but he also acknowledged that steed should have run toward the line waving his arms as soon as he called the penalty giants center chris bober said it s not like the crowd was overwhelming there was like , 10 people out there we should have been able to hear it if they blew the whistle i think i would have heard it the postmortems did nothing for collins , who walked gingerly after the game , leaning on crutches , his left foot in a protective cast the injury is likely to cost him the final three games he will certainly have his streak of 67 consecutive starts broken next week still , the giants were relieved the injury was not worse he s been kind of indestructible , said wellington mara , the giant coowner i used to joke with him that we should go to the single wing because he s such a good ball carrier now i guess the single wingback is out now but he s a good , tough boy he 'll be all right for the giants as a whole , the prognosis is not quite so easy the game fell in the same heap as so many of their losses they turned the ball over on their second play when barber lost his sixth fumble of the season , this one on the giants' 24yard line the giants held the redskins to a field goal , then missed a field goal of their own on the next drive the giants took a 73 lead after a shanked punt allowed them to start their next drive on the redskins' 35 but running back dorsey levens s 5yard touchdown run accomplished while dragging smith into the end zone quickly became a footnote the redskins returned the kickoff 50 yards and drove for a goahead touchdown , on a 6yard pass from tim hasselbeck to darnerien mccants with 14 02 left in the second quarter the giants mustered no more offense the rest of the half the redskins marched 80 yards on the first drive of the second half to make it 177 , and the giants' fate was sealed for good when collins went down later in the third quarter palmer took over and threw for 83 yards on 7of11 passing , but he was sacked 5 times in a quarter and a half collins was 5 of 14 for 62 yards and was sacked once barber provided the only offensive highlights with 99 yards rushing it came as no surprise that the giants' makeshift offensive line had been collins s undoing the giants were starting their sixth different combination , mostly because of injuries guard wayne lucier was placed on injured reserve this week , and left tackle luke petitgout missed his second straight game with back spasms coach jim fassel was forced to move allen , the struggling right tackle , to petitgout s spot allen , beaten by smith on the play that injured collins and on smith s recordbreaking sack , said he heard the whistle on the delayofgame call and let up on smith but he was the only offensive player who said he heard it he was angry the call was not made more forcefully and that collins paid the price that s not cool , allen said not cool at all some fans amused themselves by building snowmen one impressive sculpture depicted a fan slumped in a chair holding a giants flag and a very cold beer down on the field , the giants could find no such escape there was nothing fun about their game that s the hardest part about it , you ca n't ever get it turned around , bober said i do n't think people realize , football is the biggest game of momentum i 've ever seen when you 're on a roll , you ca n't be stopped i look at games last year when we were winning , we 'd make the same mistakes , but we 'd overcome it this year we 're not doing that losing so many in a row , it just wears on you it just seems like we 're fighting against the wind and that wind is only getting colder extra points giants receiver ike hilliard left the game with a knee sprain coaches suspect receiver tim carter sustained another concussion

atlanta , feb 8 the opportunity was as good as any , so amare stoudemire figured he would ask the legend for a little advice as his phoenix suns teammate shawn marion was coming downcourt with the ball in a game against the washington wizards this season , stoudemire turned to michael jordan what s the key to success \? he asked eagerly you 're doing ok so far , jordan told stoudemire , a rookie it seems like you have it already stoudemire , 20 years jordan s junior , remembers nothing further about the play when jordan steps out amid the 20 , 000 flashbulbs at his final nba allstar game on sunday night at philips arena , his tongue will be out , waving goodbye to a generation while welcoming in a new one his tongue wag used to be the tipoff that he was about to do something special on his way to the basket but jordan , who turns 40 in nine days , is on his way to retirement after the season , for the third and final time the itch is finally scratched , he said today in turn , jordan leaves the league scratching its head about questions like stoudemire s and leaves a handful of elite players still searching for his winning formula that s putting pressure on yourself to take over , said stoudemire , who jumped to the nba straight from high school me , i'm just trying to be the best player i can be somebody will come along kobe byrant is considered the most likely candidate for coronation but what of shaquille o'neal \? tracy mcgrady \? tim duncan \? yao ming \? vince carter \? allen iverson \? the fans have begun to move past jordan , it seems they did not vote him into the starting lineup for the first time in his 14 allstar game appearances though iverson and mcgrady offered jordan their starting spots , and the eastern conference coach , isiah thomas , said the right thing would be for him to start , jordan was honored but firm i would n't accept it , he said in a news conference today , wishing to respect the fans' vote for progress i 'd rather for it to happen that way because that s the chain of change , jordan said and i do n't want to hurt that i want to be the bridge to the next generation the allstars from the next generation consider this game a tribute to jordan , knowing that no one will truly replace him he s like the martin luther king of basketball , kevin garnett of the minnesota timberwolves said he opened the floodgates for a lot of things , for allowing myself and young players to come i do n't think we can give him things from one weekend or one game , but i think it has to be a couple of years that we need to just thank him for all he s done while television ratings and attendance initially jumped at jordan s return to the game last season , those numbers have flattened this season the wizards , despite their 2425 record , are drawing a leaguebest 19 , 219 fans on the road , with the lakers second with an average of 18 , 950 in jordan s comet tail there are diverse and developing talents , though none yet with his galvanizing force bryant and o'neal are the superstars of the bunch , leading a lakers dynasty that is blinking momentarily yao heads the infusion of international talent , along with dirk nowitzki and peja stojakovic bryant , garnett , mcgrady and jermaine o'neal are the allstar starters who bypassed college duncan is the softspoken , oldschool talent , and chris webber leads the kings' quest to foil the lakers the problem is all those guys are n't superstars , said charles barkley , who was outspoken as a player and remains so as a commentator for tnt there s only three or four guys might be superstars all those guys are growing into carrying the league i think the biggest problem those guys got is that they became spokesmen for the league a lot sooner than they were prepared for they ca n't anoint you somebody just has to step forward shaquille o'neal is the game s most dominating player , in talent , size and success he is trying to match jordan s six championships , but as he nears age 31 , o'neal believes the generations are also passing around him asked if he was confident of the strength of the league once jordan leaves , and if he considered himself the heir to his legacy , o'neal said i think it will be in somewhat good shape but the league does n't market big men like that i understand that , and i accept that you got guys like kobe and tmac and guys like vince , and you 've got semibig guys like kevin garnett and tim duncan with those five guys right there , the league will be ok once jordan retires , there may be only one member of the 1992 olympic dream team who will remain active john stockton , karl malone and david robinson may not be on the court next season , leaving just scottie pippen jordan and pippen made chicago the team of the 1990 s in a juxtaposition of eras and egos , thomas , who was once the bulls' nemesis with detroit , will coach jordan on sunday while confident in the young players' ability to sustain and raise the popularity of the league , thomas insists that it is the dynasties and the rivalries that keep it going the league needs great basketball teams , said thomas , the indiana pacers' coach this is a team sport , and the teams are the things that make the sport go there are the lakers and the kings and the quirky explosiveness of the mavericks , but the dynamic teams and rivalries do not seem prevalent in the east , where the team in the largest media market the knicks is trying to deal its way out of despair when jordan retired in 1998 , he prepared the league for renewal grant hill and carter emerged , their star power since defused by injuries bryant credited jordan as his teacher but said he wanted only to play kobe byrant basketball garnett said i think there are a lot of situations where people are looking for the next mike i do n't think that s fair because you have a michael jordan only every century the pacers' o'neal , 24 , knows his generation has a responsibility to jordan the burden is , we hope we can find a way as a group , not as individual players , to keep the league going strong , he said on sunday , the players will collect jordan moments for posterity i 'll be happy that i'm there and happy that i got to experience this , shaquille o'neal saidwhen my kids get to an older age , when you still talk about great players , i can tell them there was this guy one time named michael jordan , and he did this and he did that photos he s like the martin luther king of basketball , kevin garnett said of michael jordan , who will turn 40 next week and will play in his final allstar game tonight \( photographs by associated press \)

curatorial correctness has never carried much weight at exit art , the venerable soho alternative space that has now relocated to new manhattan quarters on 10th avenue , at 36th street jeanette ingberman and papo colo established it in their canal street loft in 1982 with the intention of doing things differently their mindset has resulted in an exhibitionperformance space that often seems to be making itself up as it goes along , yet usually keeps its act impressively together some shows have received extremely mixed reviews , but most have shed new light in some direction , whether on unknown artists , underground comics , record album covers , exhibition announcements or 1970 s performance art from behind the iron curtain ms ingberman and mr colo have always pushed the envelope in exhibition themes , formats , selection processes and installation procedures exit biennial the reconstruction , the first show in their new , vaulting groundfloor home , indicates that the pushing continues the 35 works installations and sitespecific pieces share one primary characteristic none of them existed when the show began four weeks ago all have been built since then , where they stand during the opening reception on march 8 , the 43 participating artists \( there are several teams and collectives \) arrived with their tools and materials , posted their proposals and drawings and set to work several are working still and may continue until tomorrow , when the show has its second opening celebration the reconstruction reflects the current fad for what might be called reality artmaking , the phenomenon of creating art in an exhibition space after the show opens big surveys of contemporary art often include one or two works done in this manner ms ingberman and mr colo saw their new space , which has not yet been renovated , as an opportunity to apply the concept even more broadly they also deviated from habit in their selection process , putting out an open call for proposals on the theme of reconstruction the artists chosen were to receive almost nothing space and electricity would be provided , of course , but no help from exit art s meager staff and almost no budget ms ingberman said they expected about 60 responses but received close to 400 many were from outoftown artists , including a few students the final group includes less than 10 artists they had even heard of most have never exhibited in new york city the reconstruction illustrates exit art s sandbox genre of exhibition management cram a lot of mostly young artists together and see what happens much of what results is quintessential alternativespace art roughhewn , politically skeptical , userfriendly and short on originality , but sparked with promise it is always valuable to see a lot of different artists burrowing their way through a single theme and set of limitations they all come up in different places the reconstruction concept is personalized , stretched from the literal to the metaphorical by the show s participants , and explored in modes , variously architectural , historical , cultural or emotional not unexpectedly , references to building processes abound , in materials that range from bulky to almost nothing , with the contrasts emphasized by the tightly packed nature of the installation on a little strip of space , hemmed in by two of the show s most obtrusive works , orly genger has spent the last four weeks crocheting quantities of thick yarn into squares , rectangles and less predictable shapes , which she arranges and rearranges as a floor sculpture \( after using them in a performance at tomorrow s opening , she will continue working , and arranging , until the show closes \) on one side of ms genger s small plot , frantiska and tim gilman have suspended a lifesize , fully furnished cabin upside down from the ceiling they are using real construction materials like vinyl siding and imitationslate shingles that are almost scarily lightweight to the other side , ward shelley , matt bua and jesse bercowetz have constructed the decidedly ponderous sweatshop , a juryrigged shantyfactory spewing pollutants and carbuncled with old but functioning television monitors this irrational assemblage mixes real with fake on all fronts , from the posters that plaster its surface to the frantic assembly line , operated by robots , that is visible in some of the videos another cabin , by kate gilmore , takes assemblage to even rougher , teetertottering extremes cobbled together from construction scraps scavenged from neighboring streets , it suggests the dangerously heavy , poorly anchored gondola of a hotair balloon lisa hein and bob seng used the fourweek construction period to build a wall out of brickshaped slabs of cherry , lemon and lime jello and mortar , a sisiphyean task fraught with accelerated intimations of mortality while the bricks at the bottom of the wall rapidly fall into decay , those on the top are as fresh as hard candy the artists are aiming for five feet
more times than anyone can possibly count , political leaders have pleaded since sept 11 , 2001 , that we have to go about our lives as usual , or else the bad guys will have won but for them , it turns out , normal is confined to benign activities like shopping or eating out in this city , it no longer includes something with more grit , like a protest march through manhattan never mind that large political demonstrations have always qualified as normal in new york , a local tradition many decades older than the statue of liberty it seems that mass marches have been banned in the heart of manhattan except for traditional parades like the ones on st patrick s day , columbus day and national puerto rican day any other march , especially one with a political message , has gotten a thumbsdown from city hall and the police security reasons , they explain sept 11 , they explain this official policy had been in place with little fanfare until it was detailed in a courtroom the other day by assistant chief michael d esposito , the police department s commander for manhattan south of 59th street chief esposito was explaining to judge barbara s jones of federal district court in manhattan why the city did not want to let antiwar protesters march past the united nations , or anywhere else , during a large demonstration planned for saturday while testifying , he disclosed that he had issued not one permit for a protest march in months it s now the department s policy , he said the demonstrators , rallying under the banner of a coalition called united for peace and justice , will join a worldwide protest on saturday against the brewing war in iraq they want to file past the united nations , said leslie cagan , the group s leader , because it is a central player in this whole crisis her lawyers from the new york civil liberties union reminded judge jones that this would not be the first huge political march past the united nations headquarters on first avenue one in 1982 , demanding nuclear disarmament , drew 500 , 000 people by police estimates it went off without a hitch so did other marches in that part of town in 1988 and 1994 the same , the lawyers noted , can hardly be said of some of the socalled traditional parades no offense , but the st patrick s day parade has had more than its share of scuffles and arrests and surely you remember how in 2000 some men went straight from the puerto rican day parade to central park , where they sexually assaulted one woman after another not only that , but chief esposito acknowledged on the witness stand that he had no reason to expect violence on saturday from the expected tens of thousands of demonstrators nor , he said , was he aware of any terror threat with respect to this event all the same , times have changed , he said postsept 11 , security concerns are considerable , and the ability of the police to deal with all of them is questionable yesterday , judge jones agreed the court , she said , will not secondguess or substitute its judgment for that of the nypd none of this means that a large antiwar protest is about to be prohibited despite some hyperventilating yesterday from a few of the organizers one union official called the judge s ruling an atrocity the city has no problem with a stationary rally on the streets near the united nations there will be no restrictions on the number of protesters or the inevitable antibush speeches they can say whatever they want they just ca n't march the police can more effectively monitor crowds for terror threats at stationary rallies than they can crowds moving in a procession , judge jones said but even granting that we live in difficult times , a question remains for some people how long does sept 11 last \? will it be endlessly invoked to restrict the kind of political activity that is practically part of the new york dna \? the judge herself acknowledged the distinct importance of marching from selma to south africa , marching is how millions have expressed opinions and outrage , and brought about change the city of new york has imposed an outright ban on one of the most important forms of protest , and that s the right to speak with your feet , the right to march , said donna lieberman , executive director of the civil liberties union in times of crisis , she said , our commitment to fundamental freedoms is put to the test agree with her or not , she feels this is one test the city has flunked
consumer confidence plunged in february to its lowest level in more than nine years , the conference board , a private research group , reported yesterday , as concerns about a possible war with iraq , rising energy prices and jobs took a toll on attitudes the consumer confidence index , a monthly measure , fell to 64 in february , from 788 in january the drop is the secondbiggest ever after the terrorist attacks on sept 11 , 2001 , the index fell 17 points february s reading was the third consecutive month in which consumers expressed waning optimism about their immediate and mediumterm prospects economists had expected the index to decline , but the magnitude of the decrease shown in the survey was much greater than forecasts the consensus estimate was a drop to 77 the conference board surveys 5 , 000 households about general economic conditions , their employment prospects and their spending plans analysts said uncertainty , coupled with the incomecrimping reality of dealing with high energy prices , has put the economy in jeopardy the uncertainty factor is obviously bad news for confidence , said richard berner , the chief united states economist at morgan stanley and the energy shock we are experiencing is also bad news for the economy and spendable income mr berner said he had recently revised downward his growth forecast for the first half of the year to a level he called stall speed the economy is very vulnerable , he said the odds of the economy rolling over are less than 5050 , and probably one in four , mr berner said but none of us anticipated the perfect storm we have had in energy prices , with the price of crude oil , natural gas and heating oil all shooting up like this the conference board s readings on what consumers expect in the nearterm future were also not reassuring the percentage of those surveyed who expect their incomes to increase six months from now fell to their lowest level since the board began collecting data in 1967 and the component of the confidence index that tracks the present situation of consumers fell to 616 in february , its lowest level since november 1993 chart consumer confidence index measuring attitudes toward the economy , based on 1985 100 feb 640 jan 788 dec 807 graph tracks index from september 2001 through february 2003 \( source conference board \)
looking to take full advantage of the publicity the television film the reagans has stirred , the showtime paycable channel has decided to show it on nov 30 , just two weeks after it would have been broadcast on cbs cbs abruptly pulled the film off its schedule this month after an intense protest from backers of former president ronald reagan and his wife , nancy though cbs was being threatened by an advertiser boycott led by conservatives , its chairman , leslie moonves , said he had made a moral call to drop the film because the depictions in it were simply unfair showtime , which like cbs is owned by the viacom corporation , announced that it was picking up the movie the same day cbs announced that it was dropping it but showtime executives originally said they would probably schedule the film some time early next year the film originally made to be shown in two parts and now about three hours long without commercials will run on sunday night , nov 30 matt blank , the showtime chairman said yesterday , i think we decided that the film needed to be seen as soon as possible he added , we felt it would have been silly not to take advantage of the attention that has surrounded it mr blank said both showtime and the film s producers and director were extremely happy with the way the movie has come out we did not edit this movie for politics , mr blank said we cut nothing to tone it down in a statement , the film s executive producers , craig zadan and neil meron , and the director , robert allan ackerman , said , as filmmakers we are pleased that our final version of the movie will be presented still , mr blank said that one widely talked about line , uttered by the reagan character and cut by cbs , would remain out of the film in that scene mr reagan makes a comment about aids sufferers being punished because they live in sin so far , showtime has not been subjected to the kind of fierce protest that was directed at cbs , mr blank said , but he added , we 'll see what happens he emphasized that none of the protesters had seen the film several of the groups that pressured cbs have said that putting the film on a pay cable outlet will not diminish the opposition to it tim graham , director of media analysis for the media research center , a conservative group , said yesterday that his organization had not yet decided what course of action to take against showtime he noted that because the film has no advertisers , a boycott of sponsors of showtime is not possible , and the group may not feel that a call for subscribers to drop showtime will be effective he suggested that few conservatives were likely to be showtime subscribers because of some of its programming , including the gaythemed series queer as folk
when he left the anaheim mighty ducks for the colorado avalanche as a free agent last summer , paul kariya took a pay cut that reduced his salary to 12 million from 10 million because he wanted to play with a friend , teemu selanne , on a strong team , he did not try to maximize his value on the market his contract is one of many startling numbers zooming around the national hockey league like so many errant slap shots the nhl s 30 teams , according to the commissioner s office , collectively lost about 300 million last season television figures , a barometer of the business , show the nhl s ratings in decline and its national network exposure slipping rather than competing with the national football league , major league baseball or the national basketball association , the nhl on television is compared to bowling , arena football and other lesser attractions and the low rating numbers may mean less revenue in the next network contract , expected next season the nhl players association said it doubted the owners' claims of financial problems in the last year of a collective bargaining agreement if negotiations between the owners and the players lead to a lockout next fall , the way they did for 15 weeks in 199495 , a new version of the world hockey association , currently in the planning stages , hopes to capitalize with new teams in an alternate league next fall so , as the nhl prepares to begin its 87th season tonight , a reasonable person may wonder is hockey in a recession \? and , if so , what needs to change \? the hockey business , from a revenue and attendance and exposure standpoint , from a licensing standpoint and a sponsorship standpoint , has probably never been stronger , commissioner gary bettman said last week in a conference call with reporters but we have disparities between revenues and expenses according to the nhl , the teams spent 76 percent of last season s 1927 billion in revenue on players' salaries , which have increased to an average of 179 million a player player salaries have increased at a rate even faster than our revenues , and this is at the core of the economic problems we are having , bettman said this is disputed by the union the conclusions we come to are dramatically different than the nhl s current claims of financial distress , ted saskin , the union s senior director , said saskin said that the union was prepared to make compromises that favor the owners , but that the players would not agree to a salary cap or any cost control system that prohibits owners from paying players according to the market the nhl s financial leaks to date have been very selective and completely distorted , saskin said in a telephone interview from toronto there is no way that their claims of financial distress could withstand any informal level of scrutiny clearly , the bleak picture is what many analysts are seeing one is marc ganis , president of sportscorp , a consulting firm based in chicago that works with arena and stadium development , and franchise acquisitions ganis said 5 to 10 nhl franchises could be sold , if there were buyers one reason there are no buyers , he said , is that numerous teams are losing significant percentages of their asset value and the ratings agencies very seriously question the health of the nhl ganis said you ca n't get financing it s very difficult he said it would remain difficult until the nhl aligned revenues with expenses and spread revenues more equally among the clubs the way it is now , he said , hockey revenues are very , very disproportionate in favor of franchises like the rangers , boston , toronto , detroit , colorado and dallas but ganis also said that bettman must get concessions not only from players , but also from owners , who need to share money some teams will absolutely not want to do this , he said teams like buffalo and ottawa are recovering from bankruptcy but pittsburgh , a few years after a bankruptcy filing , is making ominous sounds about leaving town if it does not get a new arena no team embodies the nhl s mixed signals more than the devils although they are defending the stanley cup championship for the third time in nine seasons , they are an afterthought in the sports consciousness of their own major news media market they sold out only 6 of 41 regularseason home games in 20023 , according to lou lamoriello , the team s president and general manager he said that they did not make a profit despite four rounds of playoffs the sport that best shares revenue is the nfl its system allows teams like the green bay packers to compete with the giants the bulk of the revenue comes from national television contracts that pay the league 22 billion a year , split equally among the league s 32 franchises but hockey s television picture is not as big , bright or clear in the current package , abc and espn , which are owned by the walt disney company , pay the league 120 million a season in the previous deal , from 1994 through 1999 , fox paid the nhl 30 million a season and espn paid the league an additional 143 million for a different package of games
kampala , uganda the biggest threat to lillian s virginity may not be her hormones or those of the boys in her high school class it may be her empty pockets and her ambition that prompt her to have sex lillian , a 16yearold orphan , would be any parent s dream child she studies hard and picks her friends carefully she avoids bad influences , a challenge in this rugged slum on the outskirts of kampala , the capital , and she is so committed to avoiding aids that she has become a leader in her school s straight talk club , which promotes abstinence aids , a devastating killer in her community , is always on this young girl s mind the disease ended the lives of both her parents while she was in primary school the uncle who then became her guardian died of aids as well she is intent on avoiding infection , and delaying sex is her and her country s answer president bush , on his recent tour of africa , praised uganda s antiaids approach , which emphasizes abstinence in uganda , condoms are considered an imperfect alternative for those who cannot wait but the situation is not that simple lillian s story and those of some of her classmates show the challenges that african young people , especially the girls , can face in trying to avoid the aids virus sex starts early here for a variety of reasons there is the sexual curiosity that stirs in young people everywhere marriage for young girls is common as well , with girls dropping out of school , often to become an older man s second or third wife sex also presents an opportunity to make money , and young women find few jobs available poverty , it seems , can weaken even those with the most resolve it s easy to say , 'abstain , ' said benjamin wamusiru , an english teacher who leads the abstinence club at a local school but actually doing it is difficult with all the pressures in society we lose members because of pregnancy as time goes by , more and more of the club members experiment it s toughest on the girls a dedicated student who dreams of going to college , lillian struggles to come up with the fees that all secondary school students in uganda are required to pay for lillian who , like some of her other classmates agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her last name not be used the tuition comes to about 30 a month recently , some of the cousins with whom she has been living since her uncle s death have begun pressuring her to raise money by selling herself they say , 'why do n't you find a sponsor \?

a new book of photographs by jack pierson features 15 images of beautiful men , arranged to suggest the arc of a lifetime beginning with a young boy and progressing to old age with men in various stages of undress there s nothing surprising about that mr pierson has been photographing beautiful naked men for years in this case , though , the photographs are offered under the title self portrait but none of the images is of the artist himself mr pierson has fashioned an autobiography from a collection of images of unidentified men his photographs affect the casual look of a vacation snapshot , one you might expect to find clipped to a page of a personal diary often there is an implicit , offhand eroticism to his pictures of men , as if something sexual is in the cards , or might have just taken place while there is a canny intimacy to these new pictures , languorously attuned to the temporal glamour of ordinary moments , the subject of this selfportrait series is desire when it begins , how long it lasts , what it tells us about ourselves or , at least , about the artist mr pierson is part of a group of photographers known as the boston school david armstrong , philiplorca dicorcia , nan goldin and mark morrisroe , among others all of them knew one another in the early 1980 s and photographed their immediate circle of friends in situations that were , or appeared to be , casual or intimate mr pierson was often the subject of mr morrisroe s photographs , and the object of mr morrisroe s desire the photographs in this selfportrait series take their cue from the template of pictures of the artist taken 20 years ago in an attempt to establish a mythology of self , mr pierson is presenting new photographs of other men in the manner of his own portrait , claiming their appearance to represent his own identity the book is published by the cheim read gallery in chelsea , where the exhibition jack pierson , featuring other works of his , runs through jan 3 self portrait is the flip side of what cindy sherman accomplished in her series untitled film stills dressing up to enact a wide variety of female archetypes , ms sherman photographed herself in fictional scenes alluding to hollywood films that body of work expresses an idea about the way identity is formed by the cultural forces all around us yet , despite ms sherman s insistence that her film stills are not selfportraits , the series flirts with the very idea of identity and selfportraiture mr pierson , by eliminating his own likeness from his self portrait , comments on the same postmodern idea about the cultural construction of the individual , but in this case the work suggests that assumed identities both define and obscure the individual in society the idea of the constructed identity is nothing new in an age of cosmetic surgery and online communication , it s easy to customize our appearance or hide behind an invented persona how often do we look at a picture in a magazine and imagine ourselves with that haircut , in those sunglasses , on that beach \? no matter how strong our own sense of who we are , the lust for some idealized version of ourselves is invariably summoned in the barrage of images endlessly flashing before us mr pierson s selfportrait series attests to this , underscoring at its core his own erotic impulse to be as desirable as those he desires , to become the very object of his own attraction in naming his pictures of others self portrait , mr pierson also owes a nod to the dada legacy of provocation the catalog of the first papers of surrealism , a 1942 group exhibition in new york organized by marcel duchamp and andr breton , used the selfportrait as a symbolic equivalent in photographs and drawings of completely unrelated or unknown people titled with the names of the participating artists , these ready made portraits , or found faces , took on new meaning in place of other expected identities in an essay for a show of portraits at pacewildenstein gallery in 1976 , kirk varnedoe wrote , if , in the extremes of modern portraiture , the artist sees the other almost wholly as himself , so in the selfportrait he often sees himself as somebody , or something , irrevocably 'other' portraiture has always revealed as much about the artist as the subject if you think about the difference between portraits by richard avedon and robert mapplethorpe , each photographer has a signature style remove the names of their subjects and you 're left with a collection of portraits that become as much a selfportrait as the artist s own likeness in effect , mr pierson has taken that idea one step further by omitting the names of his subjects , assuming their identities and calling his collection self portrait picasso , unsatisfied with the face of his portrait of gertrude stein after 80 sittings , painted one based on a mask of an iberian sculpture when people protested that the portrait did not resemble the subject , he is said to have commented everybody thinks she is not at all like her portrait , but never mind in the end , she will manage to look just like it photos finding in other men the mythology of the self jack pierson s self portrait no 4 , above , and self portrait no 15 , below \( photographs by jack pierson , from self portrait cheim read \)
cooperstown , ny even aside from the emergency afterhours bat xray , it s been a hectic summer for ted spencer , chief curator of the national baseball hall of fame and museum beyond the hordes of baseballobsessed pilgrims traipsing through , there were the shows his team put together for the allstar game and the hall of fame s annual induction ceremony not to mention another installation of baseball as america , the museum s traveling exhibition , moved from chicago for an opening in cincinnati on aug 16 but the bat xray , captured on a radiology table at mary imogene bassett hospital here , took curatorship to another level return with us now to june , when sammy sosa , the chicago cubs slugger , was punished with a sevengame suspension for using a corked bat in a game at tampa bay mr sosa said he 'd mistakenly used a battingpractice slugger , and immediately 76 of mr sosa s bats were gathered for a national league inspection here we deal with history , reality and facts , and we needed to know if our bats had been doctored , mr spencer said of the museum s five sammy sosa bats , one of which was used to hit his 500th home run but xrays \? in a hospital \? it s all about life in a small town , mr spencer said my son s fatherinlaw is a diagnostic radiologist at bassett , so i called and he said to bring the bats over after work the fatherinlaw in question , dr peter wright , carefully arrayed the bats on the table they held still and did n't have to be told not to breathe , dr wright said with a laugh all the bats passed inspection , as did the ones examined by the league now , dr wright said , i have enough data for a paper on bat radiology if i could just figure out what research journal to submit it to bat forensics apart , mr spencer , 60 , has consistently embraced innovation since he arrived at the museum 21 years ago after having been a manager of media services for the cigna insurance company during his tenure the collection has doubled to 35 , 000 artifacts , including 6 , 200 baseballs , 1 , 760 bats , 450 gloves , 816 jerseys and 577 caps there are also 130 , 000 baseball cards and 25 million library documents , including 500 , 000 photos among the valuablebeyondprice objects are lou gehrig s bracelet of diamond world series rings made for his wife , and two honus wagner baseball cards all of it is under the purview of mr spencer and his team of 40 at the 64yearold museum , which draws 350 , 000 visitors a year and has an 11 million annual budget mr spencer has had a few grand slams in his career as curatorial sleuth he identified a cy young baseball uniform after it had been attributed to another player , and discovered a scrapbook \( thought to have been consumed by fire \) full of documents from a 1907 commission convened to determine whether baseball had been invented in cooperstown baseball was n't invented here , or anywhere , mr spencer said , explaining that he used the scrapbook to help show that the cooperstown claim was excessively enthusiastic baseball just evolved , and may stretch back to revolutionary times its origins are murky the 6foot2 mr spencer , a vice president at the hall of fame , was born in quincy , mass , to a red soxobsessed family , and quite naturally , as the oldest of four , was named after ted williams not legally officially he is william thomas spencer jr but i 've been known as ted since i was 6 weeks old , he said , proffering a business card he reminisces about his family s baseball fixation and recalls the days when they used to gather around the philco radio every night to listen to red sox games it was n't until i came to the museum that i realized we were not abnormal , he said collectors and others possessed by the pastime contact mr spencer with finds , and he has to decide whether to accept them one supplicant brought him a red metal ticket stub box taken from forbes field in pittsburgh on the day it closed then he sheepishly confessed that he 'd stolen it i was able to give him curatorial absolution , mr spencer said with a laugh because he had n't heard but i , in fact , knew that on the public address system that day , management said that the fans could take anything that was n't tied down mr spencer , a pillar of cooperstown s sports community , is also its boswell for a decade he has been revered for his annual presentation of a documentary video at the cooperstown high school senior sports banquet mr spencer creates it by spending hundreds of hours shooting all the varsity sports teams , then editing the footage into a portrait of every graduating senior now that my children have left the high school , he said , it draws me closer to the community , and to these wonderful kids aside from his village his wife , pat and their three children \( none named after baseball players \) , his allegiances are clear i'm an american , he said , i'm a catholic , and i'm a baseball fan and that s the way it is photo ted spencer \( photo by chris rank for the new york times \)
to the editor re president orders full cooperation in leaking of name \( front page , oct 1 \) as the justice department begins an investigation into the public naming of an undercover cia officer , one wonders why the columnist robert d novak mentioned her in the first place it would seem that he decided to make her name public , since government officials had already done so by mentioning it to him but mr novak s doing so seems nothing more than a fool s errand what possible benefit would the reading public have in knowing the name of a cia agent \? the answer seems to be none paul kellogg new york , oct 1 , 2003
the wagner festival in the northern bavarian town of bayreuth takes place in late july and august most performances begin at 4 in the afternoon , meaning , usually , in brilliant sunshine for a good hour before that , the grounds around the theater are crowded with formally dressed people , most milling about in anticipation of their daily dose of wagner , others desperately trying to snag tickets one afternoon some 35 years ago , i was one of those milling suddenly , behind me , i sensed a disturbance in the force i turned and saw a tall man with impossibly broad shoulders and a face like an eagle , dressed impeccably in a summer white tuxedo jacket he was walking no , striding the crowd parted before him like the red sea in our secular age god is supposed to manifest him herself as anyone so joan osborne told us in the pop song what if god was one of us , and so the television show joan of arcadia tells us now but in more conventional iconography of the divine , jewish or christian , god looks more , well , godly and on that afternoon at bayreuth , hans hotter looked like god that was fitting , since hotter s most famous role was wotan , the chief god of germanic mythology , in wagner s ring des nibelungen , a part he had sung many times at bayreuth , not to speak of munich , vienna , london , paris and most other enlightened operatic capitals a few weeks ago i thought of that summer afternoon at bayreuth as i read of hotter s death at 94 he was the great wagner bassbaritone of the mid20th century , maybe of the entire 20th century but his career in the united states , new york in particular , was less imposing than the man and his performances deserved which tells us something about hotter s artistry and something about midcentury american operatic philistinism , rudolf bing s especially hotter had a voice to match his 6foot4 frame it was huge and grand , yet capable of a surprising mellowness his declamation and his acting , both his vocal acting and his stage deportment , were sovereign he had a wagner repertory that extended beyond wotan to include most of the other major wagner bassbaritone roles and , later in life , the bass roles the dutchman , kurwenal , king marke , hans sachs , amfortas and gurnemanz his nonwagner repertory was vast he sang several premieres of late operas by richard strauss , and over his long career there were mozart \( don giovanni \) and mussorgsky \( boris \) and verdi \( the grand inquisitor in don carlo 480 times , by one count ! \) and many , many more he was a concert singer \( bach \) and a master of german lieder he recorded winterreise five times , attesting to the suitability of his sepulchral voice to schubert s wintry journey hotter made his operatic debut he had first studied to be an organist and conductor at 22 in troppau , then a german town and now in the czech republic he was the speaker in mozart s zauberfl te , and he sang the same role at 80 in munich he continued performing well into his 80 s that noble face always made an impact , and he found roles in which the fragility of his decaying voice served dramatic ends , like the seedy schigolch in berg s lulu and , in the end , the speaker in schoenberg s gurrelieder , a part he called the wotan of my old age his international career was delayed by the war no nazi , he nonetheless stayed in germany and delayed making appearances in london , paris and new york until he was nearly 40 then , in 1950 and 1951 , he had a severe vocal crisis , developing a wobble that seemed to signal the end of his singing career through discipline and effort he largely overcame it , although the crisis sidelined him for the summer of 1951 , when bayreuth had its first festival since world war ii but the residue of that crisis , along with his constant asthma attacks , lent his voice a sometimes hollow and frayed sound , less than the belcanto ideal that bing espoused in 1954 , as the met general manager , bing pronounced hotter suitable only for secondary roles thereafter , hotter concentrated his career in europe and japan and elsewhere in the united states \( san francisco , chicago \) and his studio recording of wotan , skipping das rheingold \( george london sang that \) in georg solti s pioneering albums , came after his prime one of the truest documents of his voice at its grandest was a searing version of der fliegende holl nder recorded in 1944 under clemens krauss , one of his great champions in his early career there is also a fine dutchman from the met in 1950 under fritz reiner hotter reached the height of his fame and his career in bayreuth from 1952 to 1966 , the year of the premature death of the more brilliant of the two wagner grandsons , wieland hotter was part of an extraordinary group of singing actors among them astrid varnay , marthe m dl , birgit nilsson , wolfgang windgassen , gottlob frick , gustav neidlinger and anja silja who were the nucleus of wieland wagner s new bayreuth \( and none of whom , except of course for ms nilsson , had big met careers \) wieland sought to cleanse his grandfather s works of nazi stigma in the rings that he directed and designed , especially the first one from the 1950 s , wotan was more like zeus or jupiter , shorn of horns and shaggy hides hotter triumphed over the met s vocal fixations and the limitations of his audio recording because he was a true singing actor , best heard and seen a major influence was the great russian bass feodor chaliapin , whom he saw in prague in the late 30 s his major regrets , he told the los angeles times in 1987 , were that he never sang baron ochs in strauss s rosenkavalier and never worked with arturo toscanini or maria callas my own favorite memories of hotter onstage include his terrifying grand inquisitor , a towering blind monster with the force of personality to bend a vacillating king philip ii \( frick , in my experience \) to the will of the inquisition and his cardinal borromeo in pfitzner s palestrina , torn between vatican politics and faith in palestrina s genius and his king marke , heartbroken at tristan s betrayal and , of course , wotan s farewell at the end of die walk re , moving from rage to tenderness to the deepest sadness , as he puts his daughter br nnhilde into her trancelike sleep his last performance of wotan was in that opera , in paris in 1972 hans hotter sang as an individual , but also with the voice of good german culture , before nazi corruption he was vocally imperfect but , for all his godlike aura , deeply human photo hans hotter sang the role of schigolch in alban berg s lulu in san francisco in 1989 , the year he turned 80 he died this month at 94 \( photo by marty sohl \)
chris bosh had a brief conversation with his role model during the nba playoffs , and it was exactly the kind of understated exchange he could appreciate i admire your game i like watching you play , bosh told the player , spurs center tim duncan , on the sideline during the western conference finals in dallas , his hometown duncan said thank you and had to run he s just a cool , calm guy , and that s the same way i am , bosh said yesterday at the nba store in manhattan i do n't like to show emotion , it s just not me most of the time when you show emotion , you show anger and that s showing weakness bosh , a lithe 6foot 11 , 225pound power forward who left georgia tech after he was named the acc freshman of the year , has as little use for weakness as he does the spotlight now , he is about to be thrust into it many league executives consider him the no 4 pick in tomorrow s draft , a spot the knicks are trying to maneuver into from their position at no 9 none of the hype , intrigue or exposure that surrounds the projected top three picks lebron james , darko milicic and carmelo anthony has trickled down to bosh which is just fine with him the effervescent anthony sat beside bosh yesterday , joking that president bush owed him a favor because he flew from denver to the white house to honor syracuse s national championship bosh smiled modestly and talked of hitting the weight room i like laying low and just working hard and just come out and surprise everybody , not to say that s going to happen , bosh , 19 , said attention , that s just something i do n't really need the guys who are getting it , they 're well deserving of it some league executives have compared some of bosh s skills to duncan s his fluid , fundamental game , his shooting and his shotblocking others , including people close to him , believe bosh most resembles david robinson , and not just because both are lefthanded there are a lot of things to like about him he s got a lot of skills , he can post up , shoot the ball , he s just a skilled big guy , said billy knight , atlanta s interim general manager he s a classy young man , very poised and very smooth i really like his offcourt , and aroundthecourt demeanor he s like david robinson , or along those lines he s an exemplary type bosh s coach at georgia tech , paul hewitt , noticed the instant respect bosh commanded with his teammates and on campus he s got a presence , hewitt said bosh said me being mentioned with any nba player who is a great player is an accomplishment in itself david robinson , he s the league gentleman and there s nothing wrong with that if you 're going to have a lot of popularity , you should use that to do positive things in the community that s just how i see it at georgia tech , bosh quietly became the team s leader after the third game of the season , against georgia , when he took over at the end he led the team in scoring \( 156 points a game \) , rebounding \( 9 a game \) and blocked shots , and led the acc in field goal percentage \( 56 percent \) he deliberated with his parents , noel and freida , and hewitt about whether to come out after his freshman season when he realized he was projected as a topsix pick , he signed with an agent , henry thomas , two weeks ago it was a tough decision , he said i was just settling in at georgia tech , just looking at reality this was the best decision for me thomas said that bosh had gained 25 pounds of muscle since the season ended his frame still evokes some comparisons to marcus camby , the former knick , although hewitt added , chris is deceptively strong bosh has the potential to be like robinson , according to a general manager who spoke on condition of anonymity he s never going to be bulky , but he s got a strong body bosh has been learning about the nba while working out in dallas with his fellow dallas native and knicks power forward kurt thomas if bosh were to land in new york an outcome that is considered unlikely one eastern conference official said bosh would have no qualms about the atmosphere he has twice played in madison square garden last year and during the mcdonald s all american game as a high school senior i can adapt to any situation , bosh said playing in any city would be all right with me rebounds some eastern conference officials have said the nets have interest in the 6foot7 croatian point guard zoran planinic with the no 22 pick he worked out for the nets on june 11 it was his second and final workout because he tweaked his back in a drill he also worked out for the bucks planinic , 20 , is under contract with his euroleague team , cibona , but it seems likely that the team would release him photo georgia tech s chris bosh , who could be chosen fourth in the draft , has drawn comparisons to tim duncan \( associated press \)
more eighth graders than usual were shut out of their choices for high school next year because of greater competition and other factors , several principals and parent advocates said yesterday close to 100 , 000 eighth graders are seeking places in city high schools for the coming school year , officials of the department of education said , up from 92 , 000 in 2002 several middle school principals said they were shocked to learn last week that dozens of their students had not been accepted by a single school what happened this year makes a mockery of all the thought and time parents , students and schools expended , said the principal of a manhattan middle school where most eighth graders were not accepted at any outside high school our kids are devastated new york s high school admission process is complicated unless students want to attend their neighborhood high schools many troubled they must list up to five choices on a standardized application form this year , about 47 , 000 of the perhaps 100 , 000 , or 47 percent , were admitted to one or more of their choices , the officials said that does not include a number of students who applied only to their neighborhood high schools , where admission is guaranteed the education department could not provide that number yesterday , making it impossible to tell how many students who sought other options got none it is not unusual for up to 45 percent of students who apply to schools outside their neighborhood to be rejected by all their choices this happens every march , said clara hemphill , who works at advocates for children , a nonprofit group , and has written a book called new york city s best public high schools a parent s guide but what seems different this year is the volume of complaints the mother of an eighth grader in washington heights said she was shocked when her daughter , who has a 91 average at a good middle school , was not accepted at any outside high school this has been quite a blow , the mother said in an email message i mean , not even one school out of five choices \? she said their neighborhood high school , george washington , was not an option because its poor performance had landed it in the chancellor s district for troubled schools pamela wheaton , who works with ms hemphill at advocates for children , said the group had received many calls from parents of eighth graders who did not get into any of the schools they chose education department officials said the increased demand might be because three new specialized high schools opened this year , bringing the total to six these schools accept only students who score high on a competitive examination they said 25 , 000 students took the examination in december , up from 19 , 428 the previous year some principals and parents theorized that the increase could also be attributed to the poor economy and to the fact that fewer families could afford private and parochial schools another possible reason is that the department of education hired a new company to oversee the computerized acceptance process this year though department officials said no glitches occurred , several principals said there were many linda freebes , the principal of ss joachim and anne school in queens village , said 65 of her students applied to public high schools and encountered many problems all the applications were initially rejected and returned because the computer did not recognize their school , because of a coding error but even after the problem was fixed , ms freebes said , the results suggested something had gone wrong only 17 of her students were placed normally , she said , about 40 students are placed the city s high school system has several kinds of schools , each with its own selection process the fiercest competition is for the specialized high schools stuyvesant , bronx science , brooklyn technical and three others that opened this year at lehman , york and city colleges these are the schools that base selections on competitive examinations other high schools base selections on other indications of merit , including grades , attendance and other test scores some choose their freshman classes by rankings on seventhgrade reading tests the first round of acceptance letters went out in the last 10 days there will be two more rounds as students accepted at more than one school decide which one to attend , creating some openings there is also an appeals process for students who do not get their first choice but several parents and principals said that education department officials told them the process might be different this year because chancellor joel i klein was reorganizing the system s administration you used to be able to call the borough high school offices and sort it out with their people , ms hemphill said but some of those offices are being dismantled as we speak nobody is sure what to do anymore
tangier island , va the chesapeake bay was smooth as varnished maple as mitchell shores steered his skiff toward tangier sound crab huts on stilts stood like egrets in the shallow inlet watermen braided nets and tinkered with engines the scene seemed postcard perfect but the bay that gives the watermen so much had also taken something away several huts were bowled over like dollhouses before a rampaging child electric poles tilted at odd angles a boat was sunk in the muck and there was a pile of splintered planks and crumpled wiremesh traps the remains of mr shores s crab house , a victim of hurricane isabel mr shores , a grizzled 66yearold in a faded red flannel shirt who has been crabbing since he was a teenager , squinted against the sun and clucked his tongue as he surveyed the wreckage terrible , ai n't it \? he said , pulling at his bushy mustache in one day , to wipe out all you done all your life for more than three centuries , tangier islanders have endured war , storms and creeping environmental hazards they have seen their island overrun by raging tides but oldtimers say nothing since the nameless storm of 1933 , and possibly earlier , has hit tangier as hard as hurricane isabel did last month the storm s 80mileperhour winds and 20foot seas damaged or destroyed more than a dozen crab houses on the island s exposed eastern flank the watermen lost their crab traps , dredging nets and coolers and with them their livelihoods most will recover , as they have before but it will not be easy , because few have insurance , and those without it must wait for the federal government to help with grants or loans to cover damages that can run 20 , 000 and more per waterman it was just a disaster for the watermen , said the town s mayor , edward parks , a parttime waterman who lost much of his gear some of them will have to start all over living off the water is about all they know on this marshy 35milelong island populated by 640 residents this is not a summer getaway for the wealthy many here are descendants of families that settled here in the 17th century like the generations before them , they measure their fortunes by the bushel of oysters , clams and , most important , blue crabs located 14 miles from virginia s eastern shore , tangier is reachable only by boat or airplane cars are for the most part not permitted on the island s narrow paths , and residents travel by bike or golf cart there are seven restaurants , two churches , two grocery stores and one police officer a doctor from the mainland visits on tuesdays islanders have their own dialect , which has been described as elizabethan but can sound like a collision between south boston brogue and north carolina twang many residents cherish their isolation and the sense of sanctuary it provides they like the onebigfamily feel of their town , the absence of crime , the knowledge that neighbors will look after their children the only traffic jams occur when two people in their carts stop to talk the major crime is speeding 15 mph is the limit but for a few , hurricane isabel has shaken their assumptions marty crockett , 36 , was born and raised on the island , a scion of tangier s original settlers but the hurricane destroyed most of his crabbing equipment and part of his crab house three feet of water poured into the stately white victorian house mr crockett s family has owned for generations he is considering what once seemed unthinkable giving up the independence of crabbing to work the predictable hours and wages of a tugboat he is even thinking of moving off the island i love this place to death , mr crockett said but in the water business , you never know whether they 'll let you work , how much you 'll make or if a storm will knock you out with one breath of wind , he said , you 're out of business something you worked for all your life some watermen weathered the storm just fine , finding that it stirred crabs from their hiding places , making catches more bountiful but for others , it was the latest hardship in a difficult year deep cold last winter froze the inlet , making it impossible for some watermen to move their boats for weeks a cool , rainy summer drove crabs into deeper waters , reducing catches and then hurricane isabel struck , abruptly ending what should have been the most profitable season of the year the dredging of peelers , crabs about to shed their shells each softshell crab can sell for 3 or more , 10 times as much as a hardshell crab possibly the trend most damaging to tangier s fragile way of life has been a steady exodus of its young people a century ago , the island had more than 1 , 200 residents , sustained by seafood processing plants , a vigorous shipping industry and a bay full of crabs , clams and oysters but with the declining fortunes of the seafood industry , few teenagers stay beyond high school four of the six seniors at the island s 97student school said they planned to leave after graduating tugboat work , the military and college beckon more brightly than tangier my dad used to push me to work on the water , said brian pruitt , 17 but the years went by and he changed his mind he said , 'if you 've got any sense , go away' many watermen also say state regulations freezing the number of licenses for watermen have made it difficult for their children to get into the business without a license , a person can work as a mate on a boat but cannot start a business daniel mariano , 27 , said he could barely support his wife and son on a mate s salary mr mariano has applied for crabbing licenses , but none have been available the storm has made matters worse by wrecking his boss s business , leaving him temporarily unemployed i work week to week , he said when i'm out of work a couple of weeks , it s hard to bounce back the freeze on licenses was instituted in the late 1990 s to protect the dwindling crab population but now many environmental groups support exempting tangier island from the restrictions to help preserve its way of life it s not like people here have a mcdonald s where they can go to flip burgers , said lonnie moore , a former tangier waterman who now works for the chesapeake bay foundation , a nonprofit group it s either crabbing or leave but for many older residents like mitchell shores , there is nothing but crabbing with no pension , 401 \( k \) plan or significant savings , he keeps working mr shores snickers at suggestions that hoisting crab traps , dredging for peelers and navigating the bay 16 hours a day , even in winter , are somehow enjoyable it is not fun , he says it is all he knows in the water business , he said , you do n't retire photos more than a dozen crab houses on the eastern flank of tangier island , va , were

north merrick , ny , sept 17 the bellmoremerrick board of education voted unanimously tonight to cancel this year s football season at a long island high school that had been reeling from allegations that three older football players sexually abused freshman teammates the decision affects both the varsity and the junior varsity teams at w c mepham high in bellmore the school s first game of the season was to have been on saturday a significant majority of the mepham football team , varsity and junior varsity , has violated the district s code of conduct , article 7 , which requires that all students are expected to promptly report criminal , serious or dangerous violations of the code of conduct to school officials , said charles reinhardt , the board s president , reading from a handwritten statement the board met for more than four hours behind closed doors before emerging with the decision , and members left without comment the board s decision was the latest development in what has become a rocky start to the school year here , where one of the first lessons of the semester has become how to live inside a scandal students at mepham say they can deal with the unending stream of reporters and tv cameras , and with the vague administrative announcements about tragic events but the absence of answers has started to wear on some of them three weeks since the abuse is alleged to have happened at a football training camp in pennsylvania , no students have been arrested or suspended from school , although three players suspected in the abuse have been suspended from the team we 're certainly upset about the whole incident , alyse middendorf , a board member , said in a telephone interview this morning it was a heinous incident , and we 'd certainly like to take some action the teams continued to practice throughout the week but students said school administrators canceled a pep rally that traditionally precedes a game , and the public address announcements urging students to attend games have been absent prosecutors and the police still refuse to provide details of the allegations , but an article in newsday and conversations with several students who know the suspects paint a disturbing picture according to those sources , three members of the varsity squad sodomized three younger junior varsity players with broomsticks , golf balls and pine cones one of the students was so injured that he required surgery , newsday reported other members of the team witnessed the attacks , which occurred in a bunkhouse at camp wayne in preston park , pa , and the younger boys were threatened with reprisals if they told , the students said the younger boys told their parents about the attacks after returning home , and their parents notified the school and the state police in pennsylvania , school officials said thomas caramore , superintendent of the bellmoremerrick central high school district , said none of the coaches who had accompanied the team to the camp knew of the abuse now , some school officials say their investigation has been stymied by silence a board member , louis kruh , said that no students were willing to make written statements , and that as a result , the district could not suspend anyone two state police investigators from pennsylvania visited bellmore , and mark r zimmer , the district attorney of wayne county , pa , said he did not anticipate making any arrests in the next few days we 've got allegations that involve a bunch of children , all of whom have their whole lives ahead of them , mr zimmer said in a telephone interview today no matter which side of the equation they 're on , parents are thinking , 'this is going to ruin my kid' a group of junior varsity and varsity football players hanging out tuesday night near mepham high school said they had been told not to talk about the case but the players , who said they had not witnessed the attack , said the team would be meeting with the police this week a couple kids on the team did it , but the whole team s getting punished , said danielle defina , a sophomore who has friends on the team i think it s ridiculous

ann arbor , mich one given in the war against terrorism seems to be that suicide attackers are evil , deluded or homicidal misfits who thrive in poverty , ignorance and anarchy president bush , at last year s united nations conference on poor nations in monterrey , mexico , said that we fight against poverty because hope is an answer to terror senator john warner , the virginia republican , argued that a new security doctrine including wars of preemption was necessary because those who would commit suicide in their assaults on the free world are not rational a state department report issued on the first anniversary of the 9 11 attacks said that development aid should be based on the belief that poverty provides a breeding ground for terrorism as logical as the povertybreedsterrorism argument may seem , study after study shows that suicide attackers and their supporters are rarely ignorant or impoverished nor are they crazed , cowardly , apathetic or asocial if terrorist groups relied on such maladjusted people , they could n't produce effective and reliable killers , according to todd stewart , a retired air force general who directs the ohio state university program in international and domestic security in the suicide bombing of a cafe in tel aviv last week that killed three bystanders , for instance , the bomber and the man accused of being his accomplice grew up in britain , in relatively prosperous circumstances , and attended college the princeton economist alan krueger and others released a study in 2002 comparing lebanese hezbollah militants who died in violent action to other lebanese of the same age group he found that the hezbollah members were less likely to come from poor homes and more likely to have a secondary school education nasra hassan , a pakistani relief worker , interviewed nearly 250 aspiring palestinian suicide bombers and their recruiters none were uneducated , desperately poor , simpleminded or depressed , she reported in 2001 they all seemed to be entirely normal members of their families a 2001 poll by the nonprofit palestinian center for policy and survey research indicated that palestinian adults with 12 years or more of education are far more likely to support bomb attacks than those who cannot read officials with the army defense intelligence agency who have interrogated saudiborn members of al qaeda being detained at guant namo bay , cuba , have told me that these fundamentalists , especially those in leadership positions , are often educated above reasonable employment level a surprising number have graduate degrees and come from highstatus families their motivation and commitment are evident in their willingness to sacrifice material and emotional comforts \( families , jobs , physical security \) , to travel long distances and to pay their own way the body of research shows that over all , suicide terrorists tend not to have the attributes of the socially dysfunctional \( fatherless , friendless , jobless \) they do n't vent fear of enemies or express hopelessness or a sense of nothing to lose because of lack of a career or social mobility as would be consistent with economic theories of criminal behavior suicide attackers do n't opt for paradise out of despair if they did , say muslim clerics who countenance martyrdom for allah but not personal suicide , their actions would be criminal and blasphemous a study of world attitudes toward america by the pew research center in december 2002 and many other polls of muslims from algeria to indonesia show everrising support for martyrs a united nations report indicated that as soon as the united states began building up for the iraq invasion , qaeda recruitment has picked up in 30 to 40 countries recruiters for groups sponsoring terrorist acts tell researchers that volunteers are beating down the doors to join this allows terrorist agents to choose recruits who are intelligent , psychologically balanced and socially poised candidates who mostly want virgins in paradise or money for their families are weeded out those selected show patience and the ability to plan and execute in subtle , quiet ways that do n't draw attention al qaeda , especially , is rarely in a hurry it can wait years and then strike when least expected it s the particular genius of the institutions like al qaeda , hamas or hezbollah that they are able to make otherwise welladjusted people into human bombs intense indoctrination , often lasting 18 months or more , causes recruits to identify emotionally with their terrorist cell , viewing it as a family for whom they are as willing to die as a mother for her child or a soldier for his buddies consider the oath taken by members of harkat al ansar , a pakistanbased ally of al qaeda each martyr has a special place among them are brothers , just as there are sons and those even more dear brian barber , a psychologist at the university of tennessee , has interviewed some 900 young adults from gaza and a comparison group of bosnian muslims who had also suffered through violence but had not become a source of suicide bombers the bosnians had markedly weaker expressions of selfesteem and less hope for the future faith was the largest difference the palestinians routinely invoked religion to invest personal trauma with social meaning , whereas the bosnians did not consider religion significant to their life this overall pattern was also captured in a white paper by the parliament of singapore concerning captured operatives from jemaah islamiyah , a militant group allied with al qaeda these men were not ignorant , destitute or disenfranchised like many of their counterparts in militant islamic organizations in the region , they held normal , respectable jobs as a group , most of the detainees regarded religion as their most important personal value like the best madison avenue advertisers , but to ghastlier effect , the charismatic leaders of terrorist groups turn ordinary desires for family and religion into cravings for what they 're pitching how do we combat these masters of manipulation \? president bush and many american politicans maintain that these groups and the people supporting them hate our democracy and freedoms but poll after poll of the muslim world shows opinion strongly favoring america s forms of government , personal liberty and education a university of michigan political scientist , mark tessler , finds arab attitudes to american culture most favorable among young adults \( regardless of their religious feeling \) the same population that recruiters single out it is our actions that they do n't like as long ago as 1997 , a defense department report \( in response to the 1996 suicide bombing of air force housing at the khobar towers in saudi arabia \) noted that historical data show a strong correlation between us involvement in international situations and an increase in terrorist attacks against the united states shows of military strength do n't seem to dissuade terrorists witness the failure of israel s coercive efforts to end the string of palestinian suicide bombings rather , we need to show the muslim world the side of our culture that they most respect our engagement needs to involve interfaith initiatives , not ethnic profiling america must address grievances , such as the conflict in the palestinian territories , whose daily images of violence engender global muslim resentment of course , this does not mean negotiating with terrorist groups over goals like al qaeda s quest to replace the westerninspired system of nationstates with a global caliphate osama bin laden seeks no compromise but most of the people who sympathize with him just might drawing \( jonathon rosen \)
to the editor what becomes clear in bush team faces widespread pressure to act on liberia \( news article , july 23 \) is that none of the growing pressure on president bush to send troops is coming from the american public that liberians , the united nations and other countries are urging more forceful united states involvement should certainly be taken into account by american policy makers but absent a national security argument that even few interventionists make , no such involvements in purely humanitarian emergencies should be undertaken unless actively demanded by the american people after all , it is their lives and tax dollars that will be put on the line alan tonelson washington , july 24 , 2003
united nations , sept 22 the first report card on the united nation s twoyearold commitment to defeat aids gives the world s countries generally low marks in their efforts to overcome ignorance about the disease and provide access to prevention and treatment measures , united nations officials said here today at the general assembly s special session on aids in june 2001 , united nations members agreed that defeating aids would take commitment , resources and action today , we have the commitment , and our resources are increasing , secretary general kofi annan said at a meeting following up the declaration , which contained deadlines for battling the epidemic but the report card issued today , based on information provided by 103 governments , shows that the action is still far short of what is needed , mr annan said dr peter piot , the director of the united nations aids program , said the grades are barely a pass he added , there is n't a single a in the report card the united nations estimates that 42 million people are infected with hiv , half of them women , and that the vast majority live in subsaharan africa without an expanded response , the united nations estimates that an additional 45 million people will become infected with hiv by 2010 referring to these figures , secretary of state colin l powell told the united nations today that aids was more devastating than any weapon of mass destruction the declaration of commitment adopted in 2001 by 189 countries was intended to halt and reverse the aids pandemic by 2015 it was regarded as a turning point in the global response to aids and a recognition that the epidemic was a threat to the security of many countries the united nations declaration was followed by a 20 percent increase in funds , to 47 billion , in low and middleincome countries of that amount , 57 percent comes from sources outside the affected countries the 47 billion is five times the amount spent in 1996 but less than half the 10 billion needed for an effective response in 2005 and onethird of what will be needed by 2007 , dr piot said in part because of inadequate funds , many countries will not meet basic goals like rapidly expanding aids prevention and care expected of them by 2005 one goal is to ensure that by 2005 at least 80 percent of pregnant women have access to information , counseling and treatment to prevent transmission of hiv , which causes aids but such services remain virtually nonexistent in the countries that are most affected by aids , according to the report card that dr piot s agency issued according to the report , in 31 of 38 countries less than 30 percent of women age 15 to 24 could answer a set of standard questions on hiv transmission the questions included condom use , limiting the number of sexual partners and being faithful to one uninfected partner dr piot said the 2005 goals can still be met but only if significantly greater and sustained commitments to the global hiv aids epidemic are realized representatives of 133 countries were expected to speak on aids at the united nations into the early hours of tuesday dr piot observed that the list included 20 heads of state , but none from asia , where hiv infections are rising yet , dr piot said , this is the time to act because it is much cheaper to prevent an epidemic from exploding when health officials deal with a smaller than larger number of infected people the report card found that 93 percent of the 103 countries that responded had established comprehensive national hiv aids strategies and national groups to coordinate the battle against the disease the report card also found that 88 percent of the countries had increased public awareness through the media , schoolbased aids education and peer education programs a bright spot , dr piot said , is that there is enormous global momentum to expand access to hiv aids treatments in developing countries , a prospect that not many would have predicted only a few years ago yet despite a wealth of information on proven interventions like condom use , only a fraction of people at risk of developing aids have meaningful access to basic prevention services only onequarter of subsaharan countries say that the condition of at least half of patients with sexually transmitted infections is appropriately diagnosed although migration increases the risk of becoming infected with hiv , fewer than half the countries have adopted strategies to promote effective hiv prevention measures across their borders aids has also left an estimated 15 million orphans but more than onethird of heavily affected countries have no strategies to deal with them
east rutherford , nj , may 30 mayor jim cassella has been getting calls from reporters all over the country their questions are all along the lines of , what is east rutherford \? the mayor is too polite to say that east rutherford is not ottawa , tampa or detroit bigname cities whose teams have fallen victim to the new jersey nets and new jersey devils , which play at the meadowlands sports complex here instead , he tells people that , with the nets and the devils in the championship finals of the national basketball association and the national hockey league , respectively , east rutherford is only the fifth place in 50 years to be the hometown of both hockey and basketball teams to reach the championship finals in the same season boston has earned the distinction three times , new york twice , and chicago and philadelphia have each done it once it is a distinction that inspires a certain amount of pride here in north jersey among fans who follow the teams there is also a lot of hoping that success for the nets and the devils will at last confer a little geographic distinction , a little thereness , maybe a little respect , to the vast undifferentiated suburban sprawl known as jersey the devils' star goaltender , martin brodeur , acknowledged after his team s victory over the anaheim mighty ducks on thursday that the devils and its fans often felt at least a little eclipsed we 're overshadowed by the other teams in the new york area , mr brodeur said but we 're hoping we can get a little more respect the mighty ducks won the third game , 32 , in anaheim on saturday night the giants and the jets , who share a football stadium next to the nets' and the devils' home , continental airlines arena , in the meadowlands , do not even acknowledge their new jerseyness in their names , but play on under the fiction that they are still new york teams so it is probably a little early to adopt mayor cassella s chosen nickname for east rutherford , nothing less than titletown although the devils already lead the mighty ducks two games to none in the stanley cup finals , the nets are considered underdogs to the san antonio spurs , whom they will face in game 1 of the nba finals on wednesday night in texas and for all their success this year , the devils and the nets have still had a hard time filling the continental arena , even during their division championship runs , while less successful teams like the knicks and the rangers had no difficulty selling out madison square garden the low attendance figures are something of a sore point for both teams the devils refuse to release attendance figures , said their spokesman , mike levine , while in 1997 the nets were caught sending the recorded sounds of cheering fans over the loudspeakers , hoping to fill the arena with noise , if not with actual people even devils fans who turned out thursday to watch the team s victory said new jersey s division champions were underappreciated here , you turn espn radio on , or the fan wfan , the allsports radio station and they 're talking about the spurs and the mavericks or the mets , said pete nedellec , a computer programmer from woodidge , nj his friend joe sangenito , an engineer from butler , nj , offered the refrain from new jersey s unofficial anthem the answer is , he said , we do n't get any respect the problem cannot be that the nets and the devils lack the name of a proper city on their jerseys as the most densely populated state in the country , new jersey almost qualifies as a single place , and being called the texas rangers or the minnesota twins does not seem to diminish the selfesteem of baseball fans in arlington or minneapolis and the new england patriots football team does not even have a state name no , people up and down the state say the problem with new jersey sports is that the state is not one place but two north jersey , a wholly owned province of new york city , and south jersey , where the idea of wearing anything but the colors of philadelphia teams is considered heretical new york is new york , said roy claire , a bread truck driver and catholic youth organization volunteer coach from lyndhurst , nj they 've got madison square garden , they 've got corporate america in new jersey , the quality high school football players do n't even bother with rutgers they go to pennsylvania or ohio ryon wiesenthal , the bartender at yesterday s , a tavern in upper township , outside ocean city in far south jersey , reported that whatever they were doing at the meadowlands , it was not registering with his patrons in fact , he said , not a single customer asked if one of the new jersey teams would be on the bar tv tonight we 're here in new jersey and we 've got new jersey teams , and people do n't really care , he said one patron , joe martin of the philadelphia suburb of cherry hill , nj , said that where sports were concerned , an invisible line divided the state it s like the masondixon line , and atlantic city is the cutoff , he said not even diehard nets fans like tom and john holden , two brothers from hackensack , could get excited about their state having two teams in the playoffs simultaneously they stood outside the nets' training camp in an industrial park not far from the meadowlands for hours today , hoping for an autograph from jason kidd or kenyon martin or dikembe mutombo and even though a nets security guard rudely chased them off the grass into the street as the nets players roared past them in their mercedeses and bmw s , the holden boys thought their vigil had been worth it we love the nets , john , 16 , said love them , john , 14 , echoed so how about those devils \? we hate hockey , john said hate hockey , tom said we 're yankee fans , john said , explaining everything mr claire , the truck driver , has the answer it s going to take a championship two championships , he said let the nets and the devils win their championships this season and the world will notice that , he said , would be a distinction that no place , whether a big city or a little borough of 9 , 000 like east rutherford , has yet been able to claim then , perhaps , there would be no more snide talk about the teams from exit 16w on the new jersey turnpike , or reminders that the nets once forfeited a playoff game because their temporary home , an armory , had scheduled a circus instead could twin championships even stifle the jokes about giants stadium being the final resting place of jimmy hoffa \? mayor cassella warned against hoping too high jimmy

washington , oct 18 a yearlong state department study predicted many of the problems that have plagued the americanled occupation of iraq , according to internal state department documents and interviews with administration and congressional officials beginning in april 2002 , the state department project assembled more than 200 iraqi lawyers , engineers , business people and other experts into 17 working groups to study topics ranging from creating a new justice system to reorganizing the military to revamping the economy their findings included a much more dire assessment of iraq s dilapidated electrical and water systems than many pentagon officials assumed they warned of a society so brutalized by saddam hussein s rule that many iraqis might react coolly to americans' notion of quickly rebuilding civil society several officials said that many of the findings in the 5 million study were ignored by pentagon officials until recently , although the pentagon said they took the findings into account the work is now being relied on heavily as occupation forces struggle to impose stability in iraq the working group studying transitional justice was eerily prescient in forecasting the widespread looting in the aftermath of the fall of mr hussein s government , caused in part by thousands of criminals set free from prison , and it recommended force to prevent the chaos the period immediately after regime change might offer these criminals the opportunity to engage in acts of killing , plunder and looting , the report warned , urging american officials to organize military patrols by coalition forces in all major cities to prevent lawlessness , especially against vital utilities and key government facilities despite the scope of the project , the military office initially charged with rebuilding iraq did not learn of it until a major government drill for the postwar mission was held in washington in late february , less than a month before the conflict began , said ron adams , the office s deputy director the man overseeing the planning , tom warrick , a state department official , so impressed aides to jay garner , a retired army lieutenant general heading the military s reconstruction office , that they recruited mr warrick to join their team george ward , an aide to general garner , said the reconstruction office wanted to use mr warrick s knowledge because we had few experts on iraq on the staff but top pentagon officials blocked mr warrick s appointment , and much of the project s work was shelved , state department officials said mr warrick declined to be interviewed for this article the defense department , which had the lead role for planning postwar operations and reconstruction in iraq , denied that it had shunned the state department planning effort it is flatly wrong to say this work was ignored , said the pentagon spokesman larry di rita it was good work it was taken into account it had some influence on people s thinking and it was a valuable contribution the broad outlines of the work , called the future of iraq project , have been widely known , but new details emerged this week after the state department sent congress the project s 13 volumes of reports and supporting documents , which several house and senate committees had requested weeks ago the documents are unclassified but labeled official use only , and were not intended for public distribution , officials said but congressional officials from both parties allowed the new york times to review the volumes , totaling more than 2 , 000 pages , revealing previously unknown details behind the planning administration officials say there was postwar planning at several government agencies , but much of the work at any one agency was largely disconnected from that at others in the end , the american military and civilian officials who first entered iraq prepared for several possible problems numerous fires in the oil fields , a massive humanitarian crisis , widespread revenge attacks against former leaders of mr hussein s government and threats from iraq s neighbors in fact , none of those problems occurred to any great degree officials acknowledge that the united states was not well prepared for what did occur chiefly widespread looting and related security threats , even though the state department study predicted them senior said the pentagon squandered a chance to anticipate more of the postwar pitfalls by not fully incorporating the state department information had we done more work and more of a commitment at the front end , there would be drastically different results now , said senator joseph r biden jr of delaware , the senior democrat on the foreign relations committee testifying before the senate foreign relations committee on feb 11 , marc grossman , the under secretary of state for political affairs , said the working groups were not to have an academic discussion but to consider thoughts and plans for what can be done immediately but some senior pentagon officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said that while some of the project s work was well done , much of it was superficial and too academic to be practical

cannes , france , march 27 adnan khashoggi , the billionaire wheelerdealer from saudi arabia , was en route from cannes to monte carlo in his chauffeurdriven mercedes when he got a call on his cellphone from a businessman friend in moscow the friend was seeking quick advice on a potential sewage and water treatment scheme for postwar iraq let s talk in a week or so , mr khashoggi told him let s wait and see how this war goes when he ended the call , mr khashoggi explained his caution there is so much hunger to go to iraq , he said but are the americans really going to take over baghdad and get rid of saddam \? or is saddam going to drive them crazy \? even the americans do n't know ! uncertainty is the enemy of investment , and the war in iraq has left arab bankers , investors and deal makers throughout europe unwilling to bet their fortunes on the future of the country while the united states is already soliciting bids from american corporations on reconstruction projects for iraq , and european governments are trying to squeeze themselves into the game , many members of the moneyed class from the middle east are watching horrified and anxious , frustrated and bemused from the sidelines this is not a time of celebration arab tourism to europe has been shaken by the sept 11 attacks rich persian gulf arabs who seek a break now head to lebanon or egypt in fact , there are reports of iraqis leaving europe and heading home to resettle or even to fight it is offseason at the casinos and ski resorts , which are nearly empty the gaming tables of the private , highstakes salon in the casino of monte carlo have few players , and the atmosphere is as somber as an italian funeral marbella , spain , is not what it was after the iraqi invasion and occupation of kuwait in 1990 and the war that followed then , it was vacation time and those wealthy kuwaitis who were not already out of the country fled their homes for an extended stay in the palatial holiday villas dotting the hillside above this seaside resort this time around , the casino is almost empty , the mansions are shuttered and the ferraris are being driven by westerners the handsome king abdulaziz alsaud mosque in marbella , a stone s throw from king fahd s palace and the splendid casa alriyadh villa that belongs to his brother , is almost empty for weekday prayers , with only a few moroccans attending only the richest and the bravest are willing to discuss politics on the record , some citing concern for relatives living in the middle east , others emphasizing the need for discretion in their business dealings one damascusborn investor divides his time among paris , london , the c te d'azur and washington , and a photo of him smiling with president bush and the first lady hangs on one wall but he described himself as stunned that the bush administration did not seem to know that no one in president saddam hussein s inner circle would betray him and that the iraqi people would not rush to welcome the invaders it s significant that not one member of saddam s inner circle left , that there was n't an alger hiss in the whole team , he said the early signs are that people are resisting foreign occupation and that the regime has been given a certain amount of legitimacy because of the war , he said i feel like we 're in the first hour of a long day one major arab investor who has homes in paris , monaco , beirut , lebanon , and amman , jordan , called the war a complete quagmire , a complete mess a parisbased banker who is lebanese asked where is the rice and where are the flowers the americans thought they will be walking into \? there is none arab banks are reporting huge liquidity , with new money pouring in every day , according to arab investors and analysts there is no panic and no major divestments or transfers , but no major investment either nobody knows what to do with his money , said one investment banker my grandmother knew she said , 'put money in gold or in stone' in gold or in property the businessmen and investors here are an elite , sophisticated and generally private bunch , with multiple houses and contacts in the corridors of power around the world , including the united states but universally , the score of investors and businessmen interviewed in france , britain , spain and switzerland rejected the assertion of the bush administration that the ouster of mr hussein would bring stability to the region sounding very much like the arab poor , the businessmen said that the war in iraq was inextricably linked with the palestinian crisis , and that only the creation of a viable palestinian state and a lasting peace between israel and the palestinians would create the climate of stability and investor security they were seeking bush will only become a hero when the united states imposes its will on israel , but only after that , said mr khashoggi , who has a long history of dealings with both israelis and arabs he is seen as a puppet in the hand of the zionist movement if he does n't put pressure on israel , he is going to lose the whole middle east to whom , you ask \? to chaos , like a family that s lost its father every time i want to build something in that part of the world i'm afraid something bad is going to happen and i cross it off my list london is home to a community of wealthy iraqis in exile whose families have suffered at the hands of the iraqi government , and members of this community seem more willing than others to embrace the war i feel huge anxiety because i am torn between seeing iraq liberated and seeing my countrymen dying , said hussein damirji , a 34yearold lawyer and international legal consultant based in london but if we can liberate ourselves from this tyrant , then , god willing , that will lead to a better country liberation is a just cause in marbella , moustafa sherif , 40 , an egyptian financial adviser , said americans did not understand the arab mentality and could not simply impose an americanstyle democracy on iraq you cannot say , after imposing 12 years of suffering , 'i'm coming to save you and give you freedom , ' he said
six inmates in the custody of the new york city department of correction killed themselves during the first half of this year , the highest number of inmate suicides for any sixmonth period since 1985 , city officials said yesterday while that sixmonth spike is unusual , it does not necessarily represent a nascent pattern , said martin f horn , the correction commissioner no inmates killed themselves in the last half of 2002 , he said , and the annual suicide rate among city inmates has remained relatively steady over the past decade still , the increase in suicides , all by hanging , among the city s roughly 13 , 000 inmates has prompted the department to take new preventive measures , including using paper instead of cotton bedsheets and replacing 1 , 900 metal ventilation screens , which suicidal prisoners have used to hang themselves , with collapsible screens the paper bedsheets will be used in cells housing mentally unstable inmates the installation of the new ventilation screens in cells housing new inmates and those under medical observation began in march and should be complete within two or three months , a department spokesman said our goal is to prevent suicides , commissioner horn said in an interview yesterday , but this is one of those things where if a person is determined to kill themselves , you can bang your head against the wall trying to find ways to stop them of the six prisoners who committed suicide this year , none appeared to be at high risk of injuring themselves , said cathy potler , the deputy executive director of the board of correction , an oversight body that sets minimum standards of treatment and care for inmates in the city s custody five of the six were men three , including the lone female victim , were being held at rikers island , she said the other three victims , who were between 20 and 50 years old , hanged themselves in cells at the bernard b kerik complex in lower manhattan , the nowclosed brooklyn house of detention and the state supreme court building in brooklyn , she said though suicidal inmates have often used belts or shoelaces to hang themselves , usually from a ventilation screen , cell bar or lighting fixture , board of correction regulations allow all inmates to keep their personal clothing while in jail , mr horn said since 1993 , 47 inmates have killed themselves , according to department of correction statistics
rota , spain , march 31 the journey north to the iraqi town of nasiriya was almost uneventful for carlos cordova s marine unit as it rolled through the countryside taking mostly sporadic fire from enemy forces but that changed abruptly last monday , march 24 , when his unit got to the banks of the euphrates river , close to the town where fighting had erupted 24 hours earlier after united states marines tried to rescue army comrades , and at least nine marines were killed in the ensuing battle petty officer cordova , a 24yearold navy medic attached to the marine corps' 28 weapons company , was one of the first men hurt last monday , his right forearm sliced through by shrapnel when iraqis launched mortars across the river at the advancing americans we could n't see where it was coming from , petty officer cordova told reporters today at the spanish naval base in rota , where he is being treated at a united states navy field hospital i do n't know if they were soldiers or civilians , but there were some iraqis running around on the other side of the river american forces reported numerous incidents in which iraqi forces dressed in civilian clothes fired or set ambushes , threatening supply lines and targeting maintenance units and resupply convoys when the shrapnel hit as he helped to load a grenade launcher , petty officer cordova said , there was a moment like in saving private ryan , ' when everything went quiet for a minute the 24yearold from sugar land , texas , who is based at camp lejeune , nc , said he did not even realize he had been wounded until he saw blood by his side , a marine was injured in the shoulder capt chris olch said the petty officer will recover the full use of his right hand , though with what the captain called a heck of a scar but petty officer cordova will not be returning to the front , and that bothers him i'm supposed to be taking care of them , he said it s like a family , and to just leave the family , it does n't seem right a week after he was hurt , battle is still raging in and around nasiriya , where the resistance offered by iraqi fighters came as something of a surprise to the petty officer and his comrades rolling into iraq , he said , the company advanced some way without encountering the enemy , and then found themselves under sporadic fire it s not a badlooking country except for all the ordnance lying around it s got some grass , he said i was expecting desert and houses built of adobe there were a few other misconceptions , like the idea of people wearing turbans and sheets jumping in and out of dunes shooting at you the reality of battle was different from what i saw , it was pretty intense none of us was really nervous , some of us were anxious to see what stuff we were going to see , he added once it starts , generally you get a little more alert and paranoid some 50 members of the american military have been treated at this field hospital to date , 15 of them injured in combat a second , 250bed hospital is under construction at this base on southern spain s atlantic coast in case of heavy casualties , said capt pat kelly , commanding officer of the current facility in a war there are going to be casualties , he said we 're preparing to have more , which is just prudent photo carlos cordova , a 24yearold navy medic attached to the marine corps' 28 weapons company , had his forearm sliced by shrapnel \( associated press \)
west point , ny as the glare of a sexual assault scandal fell on the air force academy , the commandant of the united states military academy here invited a group of female cadets to a confidential talk all of them had filed complaints of sexual harassment or assault , and the officer , brig gen leo brooks jr , wanted to hear first hand how west point had dealt with them one woman who took part said that several of the women related pain and disillusionment after summoning the courage to make formal reports , several said they had found themselves facing swift punishment for breaking rules against socializing with upperclassmen and for other lesser infractions committed in the incidents they described the accused assailants , on the other hand , went about their lives , as criminal investigations of the reported assaults unfolded after hearing from the women at the march sensing session , general brooks ordered changes , promising to consider each case separately with an eye toward judging the accused before punishing the accuser for lesser infractions west point officials and current cadets said the session was a sign that their academy is better prepared than the air force academy to listen to victims and quicker to respond but if the episode showed the contrast between the academies , it also revealed similarities as at the air force academy in colorado springs , former and current female cadets here complained of being punished after reporting assaults they also said they faced suspicion and hard choices and as at the air force academy , policies here at west point have deterred women from reporting sex crimes , say former cadets and advocates for sexual abuse victims women who reported assaults said west point had failed to prosecute the incidents as serious crimes each academy has largely refrained from pressing criminal charges against cadets accused of rape , allowing them to resign rather than face courtmartial the colorado springs scandal led the defense department inspector general to investigate not only the air force academy but also west point and the naval academy at annapolis , md , assessing responses to sexual abuse on may 14 the house armed services committee ordered the creation of a task force to explore responses to the problem at west point and the naval academy the persistence of sexual abuse at military colleges points up their uniqueness as institutions , with the turbulent social life of coeducational colleges circumscribed by the rigors of soldierly discipline with its gothic stone buildings rising along the hudson , west point is the oldest and most traditionbound of the military service academies its 4 , 000 cadets , slightly over 15 percent of them women , make up the next generation of military leaders like all the academies , west point has declared a policy of zero tolerance for sexual abuse sexual assaults are criminal actions and are utterly inconsistent with the us military academy s commitment to produce leaders of character , said lt col james e whaley , chief spokesman for west point the academy is fully prepared to prosecute any instance of sexual assault that warrants courtmartial in the 27 years since west point first admitted women , one cadet has faced courtmartial for rape , in 1997 , andrea hamburger , a spokeswoman , said he was acquitted in a survey at west point last august covering cadets in the upper three classes , 28 of 268 women responding , or just over 10 percent , said they had been the victims of unwanted touching or groping , with 11 describing the attacks as more serious the survey did not ask specifically about rape of the 28 women , 17 said they had not reported the incidents maj kent cassella , another academy spokesman , said officials here were satisfied with the survey results despite the large proportion of respondents who said they had kept quiet , the major said the results showed that nearly 90 percent of the female cadets had never encountered any form of sexual assault from august 1999 to february of this year , the authorities here say , they received 15 formal reports of indecent assaults , 4 of them rapes nine of these accusations were substantiated , including two rapes the men in the two rape cases were forced to leave the academy none of the cases led to courtmartial major cassella said that for a west point cadet being forced to leave the academy without an honorable discharge was severe punishment in the two rape cases , he said , the victims had agreed to accept the resignations of their attackers , instead of insisting on prosecution you have to understand , he said the cadet worked all his life to get here by comparison , air force academy officials said they had investigated 56 sexual abuse accusations by women in the last 10 years , 2 of which resulted in courtsmartial earlier this month the air force academy took preliminary steps to criminally prosecute two cadets for indecent assault and rape , the first such steps since the scandal forced a change in academy leadership last month

with the masters tournament a month away , martha burk is solidifying her plans for protests burk , the chairwoman of the national council of women s organizations , applied yesterday for a permit to protest outside augusta national golf club during tournament week , which begins april 7 burk , who has spearheaded the challenge to augusta s allmale membership , requested permission for as many as 24 demonstrators outside the club s main gate in augusta , ga , and for as many as 200 protesters across the street from the main gate burk said she did not fill out a part of the application that she said required her to release the richmond county sheriff s department from any liability connected to a demonstration i believe that they 're asking us not to hold the sheriff s department liable for any scenario that might take place , burk said instead of agreeing to that , we submitted a letter , saying we would like to discuss the constitutionality of the permit process it s possible that we could file a lawsuit on march 11 against the controlling legal authorities if we have n't heard anything regarding the permit by then mayor bob young of augusta did not return a telephone message yesterday sheriff ronnie strength of richmond county , who has the power to approve or reject protest applications and their locations in augusta , has repeatedly said that he will oppose any demonstrations near the club s entrance gates , because of the heavy traffic during the tournament despite the anticipated protests by burk s organization and other groups , burk said she did not expect augusta national to agree to admit women as members before the tournament burk also said she was disappointed that no augusta national members had spoken out after the leader of a ku klux klan splinter organization applied for a permit last week to demonstrate during the masters in support of the club think of what an awkward position that puts some of their members in , burk said but none of them spoke out it s important that the public understand that this issue is n't just about adding one woman member to one golf club it s emblematic of the gender discrimination that takes place every day we never set a deadline for augusta national to invite a female member by this year s tournament if they had just committed to a reasonable timetable , this could have ended months ago photo martha burk \( associated press \)
los angeles , march 20 the beginning of the war against iraq has left officials at the academy of motion picture arts and sciences quietly nervous but publicly optimistic about whether the 75th annual academy awards will proceed as planned on sunday night the official word from academy headquarters today was that sunday s show would go on as scheduled at 8 30 pm , eastern time , in the kodak theater on hollywood boulevard but time still remains for it to be postponed should wider attacks involving american soldiers occur everything we say is set on sand at this moment , said kevin brockman , senior vice president for entertainment communications at abc , the network that is to broadcast the ceremonies we are really attempting to remain fluid like many others , abc and the academy were caught by surprise by the pace of the war s opening salvos all of our intelligence was wrong , mr brockman said everything we thought we knew , we do n't know academy officials said they could comfortably make a decision as late as friday evening to postpone the event , which is expected to draw more than 3 , 500 people from around the world and mr brockman said that in an emergency the decision to postpone could be made as late as the day of the show , just as it was for the 2001 emmy awards after the sept 11 terrorist attacks while it is theoretically possible for the oscars to proceed without being broadcast on abc , that is not likely to happen , mr brockman said i think a decision will be made one way or the other , he said in the end , that decision may hinge on the reaction of some of the telecast s biggest sponsors , including general motors , j c penney and pepsi because of the popularity of the oscar show , abc was able to fill up its advertising slots very quickly and with a contract that guarantees the advertisers no minimum audience so theoretically , the advertisers are locked in here you have this sort of remarkable moment where you have big advertisers who are very key supporters of the network , said seth siegel , chairman of the licensing division of the beanstalk group , a global trademark licensing agency if they say they 're furious and they want out , who is going to tell them they ca n't get out at a moment like this \? eastman kodak , a longtime oscar advertiser , said that the company had reviewed its advertisements for this year and believed they were still appropriate glenn mathison , a spokesman for the charles schwab investment agency , said that the company had a standing order to pull all of its television advertising for seven days after the war s start but that it would proceed with its oscar commercials mastercard says it is staying in , too , as are american express , aol time warner and washington mutual yahoo hopes to introduce a new internet personalsad service during the academy awards it s sweet , it s charming , you 'll smile , maybe you 'll laugh , said terry semel , the company s chief executive pepsicola , however , is developing plans for what would be appropriate during the oscars , and its ultimate decision will depend on what is happening in iraq on sunday , said bart casabona , a company spokesman as of today , though , none of the major advertisers had pulled out , network officials said if they do , a new calculus may be needed at that point , i predict abc would say it s inappropriate for us to be on the air at this moment , so we 're going to delay the show in respect both to our advertisers and to the desire to be united as a nation , mr siegel said toning things down already the academy s decision to tone down the celebrity hoopla surrounding the awards , including canceling the redcarpet arrival of the stars , has reverberated through many of the oscarrelated events that are scheduled around hollywood during the movie industry s most important weekend of the year miramax films , whose 40 oscar nominations , including 13 for the frontrunner , chicago , make it the dominant player this weekend , has always had a nightbefore party at which stars from its nominated films appear in satirical skits , and then a second party on the night of the ceremonies as of this morning , the parties were to go on as scheduled , but without the skits at the moment , the plan is for everything to go on but be more subdued , said harvey weinstein , cochairman of miramax the annual oscar night party given by vanity fair magazine at morton s restaurant in west hollywood , traditionally the weekend s biggest celebrity magnet , is also to continue as planned , but without a redcarpet arrival area or access for cameras and interviewers paramount pictures , whose film the hours has nine nominations , will have its afteroscars party as planned at the pacific design center , a block east of morton s the weekend s other major awards event is saturday afternoon s independent spirit awards , given to achievement in smaller , less mainstream films by the independent film project west many of the major oscar nominees , like julianne moore and john c reilly , are also up for spirit awards the event , under a sprawling tent at the beach in santa monica , will proceed and include a redcarpet arrival area perhaps the only red carpet in hollywood this weekend

miami , oct 12 sammy sosa fell to the ground and the chicago cubs went with him sunday a fastball from the florida marlins' josh beckett tailed toward sosa s head in the fourth inning of game 4 of the national league championship series , sending him sprawling to the dirt and popping up furiously as marlins catcher ivan rodriguez and the homeplate umpire began to cool down sosa , beckett approached them and took the ball from rodriguez as if he had just plopped down quarters for a newspaper beckett went back to the mound and continued shutting down sosa and the cubs his fastball climbed to 100 miles an hour in that atbat , and he finally fooled sosa with a fullcount changeup to strike him out beckett finished with a twohit shutout , tying an nlcs record , for a 40 victory the cubs' lead in the fourofsevengame series shrank to 32 , as beckett sent them back to wrigley field in search of their first pennant in 58 years i'm just used to having the ball in my hand , beckett said that s what i felt like i needed to do i did n't feel like i backed down at all i thought he overreacted , to be completely honest with you i thought it was really stupid that we had to go through that sosa did not accuse beckett of throwing intentionally at him , but he did blame the events of the previous inning and his own history for his reaction sosa was hit on the helmet twice this season , including one scary incident on april 20 when the pittsburgh pirates' salomon torres broke his helmet with a pitch that hit sosa s left ear flap in the third inning sunday , the cubs' starter , carlos zambrano , hit the marlins' miguel cabrera on the elbow with a pitch because of what happened before , maybe that was my reaction , sosa said i have nothing against nobody i like to play the game the way it is but when i do n't like something , i'm going to let him know the cubs still maintain the upper hand , with mark prior pitching game 6 on tuesday against the marlins' carl pavano and , if that fails to produce joy in wrigleyville , the cubs' kerry wood starting game 7 chicago is 50 in wood s and prior s starts this postseason , but the marlins have the cubs' history on their side the cubs have not been to the world series since 1945 , losing three straight games to the san diego padres in 1984 the last time they were within one victory of getting there not only will the marlins have to get past prior and wood , but they will also most likely have to do it without beckett mike lowell , ivan rodriguez and jeff conine homered sunday , lowell s tworun shot in the fifth breaking a scoreless tie and finally tiring zambrano , who was expending physical and emotional energy rapidly zambrano finished each of the first four innings with fist pumps as he walked off the mound beckett , who struck out 11 batters , allowed only three base runners \( two singles and a walk \) , none of whom reached second base he took over the game in the fourth sosa , who had grounded out in his first atbat , dug in against beckett , whose first pitch sailed at sosa s head sosa fell to the ground , and as he struggled to his feet , he yelled at beckett and gestured with his bat cubs in the dugout leaned on the top step , ready in case there was an altercation like the one in the yankeesred sox game on saturday but the plate umpire , larry poncino , quickly stepped in , speaking face to face with sosa as rodriguez , the marlins' catcher , tried cooling him down sosa was focused squarely on poncino then , and beckett walked in and retrieved the baseball from rodriguez i do n't know what he was trying to do , trying to pull a boston red soxyankees thing , beckett said i was so surprised i had to shoot something else back at him it was kind of baffling to me , really rodriguez said he remembered sosa s beaning in april and understood his reaction i know he had an accident , rodriguez said but in this situation , i'm not trying to hit him it was just a pitch that slipped sosa said he told rodriguez you have to understand i 've been hit pretty good in the head a couple of times and i do n't like that anymore that s got to stop sosa took a 32 changeup that he thought was high and stepped toward first base before poncino called it strike three marlins fans among the crowd of 65 , 279 , having overtaken pro player stadium from the noisy cubs fans , trailed a muttering sosa to the dugout with howls beckett , 23 , dominated the san francisco giants in the marlins' first postseason game but was outdone by jason schmidt s threehit shutout beckett pitched poorly in his next game , succumbing to the wind at wrigley field in game 1 in what became a wild opener to this series but beckett may be the most talented of the marlins' young starters , and sunday he dazzled the cubs with fastballs , a tightly spun breaking ball that froze hitters and a changeup that seemed to change speeds at will marlins manager jack mckeon had no relievers throwing because i could n't have anybody in the bullpen that had better stuff than he had in the ninth inning sosa was the cubs' final batter , taking a fastball clocked at 97 mph , swinging through another at 95 mph and finally grounding out to short on a changeup to finish 0 for 4 i could n't think of another guy that could have messed that game up more than sammy sosa if he hit a home run there , said beckett , who swung his arm like a hammer after the final out it was a sigh of relief photos a tworun home run by mike lowell was all the marlins needed on offense to get past the cubs \( photo by associated press \) \( pg d1 \)

anne stanback stepped to the lectern at a room in the legislative office building in hartford on nov 18 , ostensibly to announce the results of a poll her organization , love makes a family , had commissioned on samesex marriage but the massachusetts supreme court had upstaged ms stanback only moments earlier , declaring samesex marriage legal in that state good morning , ms stanback was able to eke out before the audience roared with elation a moment later , someone whispered in her ear , i 've never seen anybody get a standing ovation for saying good morning , ms stanback said maureen murphy , a new haven civil rights lawyer , said the implications of the massachusetts ruling are huge for connecticut the language of the court is so strong about the importance of not excluding samesex couples from the civil institution of marriage , she said i do n't think a legislature from any state can ignore the reasoning of the massachusetts court it s the first court to hit the issue head on and with such strong language the decision was met with more joy for those in favor and greater frustration for those opposed than the day vermont announced it would permit samesex civil unions , because of what is legally termed 'portability' vermont civil unions are recognized only in vermont , as a separate but unequal parallel to marriage in finding that marriage could not constitutionally be denied to samesex couples , the massachusetts court gave any samesex marriage performed in massachusetts portability to another state that does not explicitly prohibit it , which includes connecticut \( thirtyeight states have defense of marriage acts , which define marriage as a union of one man and one woman \) brian brown , executive director of the conservative family institute of connecticut , said the court s decision had galvanized the opposition to battle samesex marriage even more energetically yet several legislators who have opposed samesex marriage acknowledged that gay rights groups' predictions that connecticut may well see some sort of domestic partnership law in the next five years or so indeed , the love makes a family survey found that 81 percent of the 600 residents polled believed that samesex marriage would become legal in connecticut in their lifetimes , whether they agreed with it or not unfortunately , i fear they may be right , said state representative tr rowe , a republican of trumbull and an opponent of samesex marriage society in general is moving sometimes slowly , sometimes rapidly , snowballing lately further and further away from traditional notions of morality as we go further and further from those notions , we 're going to see more and more innovations , things that were unspeakable only a generation ago becoming mainstream where massachusetts addressed its issue in the courts , connecticut gay rights groups have chosen to work through the legislature to pass a bill allowing their members marital privileges a bill extending the rights of marriage to samesex couples failed in legislative committee in april various other bills have been discussed in the legislature , but have not progressed through it now that the massachusetts courts have spoken , many gayrights groups do n't just want a domestic partnership or civil union law certainly , a civil union law would be more appealing to legislators now , said ms stanback of love makes a family , who in october had said she would be satisfied with a civilunion law after a quinnipiac university poll indicated that more than 51 percent of those polled said they would support one but it s less appealing to us now we 're talking about what we wanted to talk about all along full civil marriage this has raised our hopes of the 68 , 873 households in connecticut comprising unmarried partners , 7 , 386 were samesex households , according to the 2000 census proponents of samesex marriage predicted there would be an exodus of homosexual couples across the border into massachusetts less than six months from now , when marriage will be available to them those couples will return expecting their marriages to be recognized ms murphy cited commonlaw marriage as a similar issue connecticut does not recognize commonlaw marriage , but case law exists that has recognized commonlaw marriages from other states if a couple who lives in a state that recognizes commonlaw marriage moved to connecticut , they would be considered to have a valid marriage , ms murphy said ms murphy has many gay and lesbian clients , none of whom has pursued a samesex marriage case in the courts the legislature also has a history of working with the gay and lesbian community on equality issues legislators passed the secondparent adoption act , allowing an unmarried couple to legally share custody of a child they parent together and have contemplated numerous bills for domestic partnerships , civil unions and marriage the advocates for change in massachusetts felt so strongly that they pursued it in the courts , and those opposed to change are talking about passing a constitutional amendment , said john a kissell , the deputy minority leader of the state senate and a ranking member of the judiciary committee he has opposed samesex marriage in the legislature in the past i do n't see those extremes in connecticut , he said we 're a liveandletlive kind of state , moderate in many things , and i see things occurring incrementally here seeing how much change has occurred while i might not necessarily agree with the change i would predict in five years or less the legislature may embrace civil unions or domestic partnership we are moving in that direction groups will continue to gather , to celebrate and to protest love makes a family threw a party nov 19 at cedarbrook cafe in westport , one of the oldest gay bars in new england , where several hundred people cheered the massachusetts' decision the group also sponsored a rally to marry on oct 4 on the other side , mr brown of the family institute of connecticut , who has called this issue the largest battle in the culture wars since roe v wade , is planning a rally to protest samesex marriage at the state capitol building in february , during the opening of the legislative session i do n't think people have even perceived how important this issue will be for the immediate future , in any way you can imagine , sociopolitically , economically , in how we perceive marriage , mr brown said there are interesting implications here that have n't even been teased out we 're working with rabbis , with africanamerican churches , with all kinds of people who are opposed to it this is a brandnew form of political involvement that transcends old ideological labels

hartford , nov 24 lawyers for michael c skakel , who was convicted in june 2002 of the 1975 murder of martha moxley , filed an appeal here on monday in state supreme court the appeal challenges the conviction on seven grounds ranging from whether the state inflamed the jury by referring to him as a spoiled brat during the trial to whether mr skakel should have been tried as an adult since he was 15 when ms moxley was slain mr skakel , 43 , is serving a sentence of 20 years to life if he had been convicted as a juvenile , he would have faced little or no prison time the trial of mr skakel , a nephew of ethel kennedy s , attracted intense media scrutiny due in part to the kennedy name and the aura of mystery that clung to the murder the body of ms moxley , a pretty , vibrant 15yearold , was found under a pine tree in a gated community in greenwich she had been bludgeoned to death with a golf club belonging to the skakel family the 75page appeal says mr skakel should not have been tried at all because the statute of limitations in 1975 was five years the appeal also says prosecutors engaged in a pattern of misconduct during closing arguments , including inflaming the jury by creating what the defense described as a fictional confession by mr skakel during an audiovisual presentation at its closing arguments that showed graphic images of ms moxley s battered body mr skakel s words , culled from a taped conversation in 1997 between him and the ghostwriter of his autobiography , were edited to imply an admission of guilt , the defense said the appeal says the state wrongly suppressed the introduction of a sketch , which it describes as the single most important piece of evidence exonerating mr skakel a composite police drawing of a man observed by a neighborhood security guard on the road near the scene and time of the murder the appeal says the man resembled kenneth w littleton , the skakel family tutor at the time of the murder and once a prime suspect in the murder the sketch was not disclosed by the state until after mr skakel was convicted the appeal also says evidence that incriminates thomas skakel , mr skakel s brother , should have been admitted jonathan c benedict , the chief prosecutor in the trial , who had not yet seen the appeal , said , i'm not aware there is anything in it that was not previously addressed at the trial level the appeal is expected to be followed by a motion for a new trial that argues based on newly discovered evidence that mr skakel was wrongfully convicted a new witness claims that two young men visiting greenwich from the bronx picked up a golf club from the skakel property and boasted about attacking a girl caveman style the grip of the golf club used in the killing has never been found christopher morano , one of the prosecutors in mr skakel s trial who is now chief states attorney , said that despite repeated requests to the defense team , his office had received no information about other possible suspects hope c seeley , one of mr skakel s lawyers , said none would be released until the motion was filed
gertrude ederle , who was called america s best girl by president calvin coolidge in 1926 after she became the first woman to swim across the english channel , died yesterday at a nursing home in wyckoff , nj she was 98 ederle was a symbol of the roaring 20 s , a decade given as much to heroics as to materialism for a time , her accomplishment put her in the public s affection at the level of babe ruth , jack dempsey , bill tilden and red grange ederle did not sustain the lofty place in history of another hero of the 1920 s , charles a lindbergh , who crossed the atlantic a year after her historic swim , or of the golden athletes who appeared regularly before the public and kept their fame alive but her feat , which she did only once and under horrendous conditions , made a memorable contribution in an age when many found it difficult to take female athletes seriously they had to take ederle seriously , because she beat the records of the five men who had previously made the swim from 1875 to 1923 years later , after other men and women had successfully swum the channel , grover a whalen , new york city s official greeter , said that of all the celebrities he had welcomed to town , he could not recall one that made the impact of ederle at her homecoming ederele was born oct 23 , 1905 , in new york city , one of four daughters and two sons of henry ederle , a butcher and provisioner , and his wife , anna her father owned a summer cottage in highlands , nj , and she learned to swim on the jersey shore she called herself a water baby and said that over the years , she was happiest between the waves but she developed a hearing problem when she was 5 , after a bout with the measles the doctors told me my hearing would get worse if i continued swimming , but i loved the water so much , i just could n't stop , she said in the early 1920 s , as a competitive swimmer , she set women s world freestyle records and american freestyle records for various distances from 100 to 800 meters in a single afternoon in 1922 , she broke seven such records at brighton beach , brooklyn between 1921 and 1925 , she held 29 amateur national and world records in what might have been an anticipation of her channel swim , she swam more than 16 miles through tricky currents between the battery and sandy hook , nj in 1924 , she was a member of the united states team that competed in the olympics in paris she won a gold medal as part of the 400meter freestyle relay , and she won the bronze medal in the 100 and 400 individual freestyle events it was no small accomplishment she was swimming with an injured knee and , together with the other female athletes from the united states , she had an added handicap of fatigue they were put up in hotels far away from the center of paris because united states officials did not want them contaminated with what they saw as the city s bohemian morality ederle and her teammates had to travel five to six hours each day to practice in the olympic pool after paris , she began to focus on the english channel the first person to swim it was matthew webb of england , who in 1875 made it in 21 hours 45 minutes of the four other men who succeeded before ederle , none were faster than 16 hours 33 minutes one swimmer , henry sullivan of the united states , required 26 hours 50 minutes ederle first tried to swim the channel in 1925 the women s swimming association provided the financial backing but after she swam 23 miles in 8 hours 43 minutes , the people in a boat who were supposed to look after her thought she might be unconscious in the water somebody yelled , she s drowning ! and they touched her , which immediately disqualified her a perturbed ederle insisted that she had not been drowning at all , only resting , and that she could have easily continued all i could wonder was , 'what will they think of me back in the states \? ' she said she vowed to try it again and told her father and everyone else involved that no matter how she looked in the water , she did not want to be touched she decided not to ask the women s swimming association to back her a second time and raised the needed 9 , 000 herself with the help of her sister margaret , she designed a twopiece bathing suit that would not drag in the water , yet would be decent in case i failed and they had to drag me out , she said shortly after 7 am on aug 6 , 1926 , ederle , smeared with sheep grease , waded into the english channel at cape grisnez , france she could see a red ball on the french shore , a warning to small craft to avoid a sea that promised to be very choppy please , god , help me , she said for a while , she said she sang let me call you sweetheart to the rhythm of her stroke in the boat that moved with her , the crew occasionally held up signs , which said things like one wheel , two wheels , enumerating parts of a car , because she had been promised a red roadster if she was successful fourteen hours 31 minutes later , a world record , ederle reached kingsdown on the english coast if she had been able to swim in a straight line , it would have been a 21mile trip but the sea was so rough , she swam no less than 35 miles ederle always held that her record was never broken , even though in 1950 , another american , florence chadwick , swam the channel in 13 hours 20 minutes that was in a relatively calm sea , ederle said , so it was not a fair comparison
following is a transcript of an address given yesterday by secretary of state colin l powell to the united nations security council , as recorded by federal news service inc mr powell mr president , mr secretary general , distinguished colleagues , i would like to begin by expressing my thanks for the special effort that each of you made to be here today this is an important day for us all as we review the situation with respect to iraq and its disarmament obligations under un security council resolution 1441 last nov 8 , this council passed resolution 1441 by a unanimous vote the purpose of that resolution was to disarm iraq of its weapons of mass destruction iraq had already been found guilty of material breach of its obligations stretching back over 16 previous resolutions and 12 years resolution 1441 was not dealing with an innocent party , but a regime this council has repeatedly convicted over the years resolution 1441 gave iraq one last chance , one last chance , to come into compliance or to face serious consequences no council member present in voting on that day had any illusions about the nature and intent of the resolution or what serious consequences meant if iraq did not comply and to assist in its disarmament , we called on iraq to cooperate with returning inspectors from unmovic and iaea the two united nations weapons inspection groups we laid down tough standards for iraq to meet to allow the inspectors to do their job this council placed the burden on iraq to comply and disarm and not on the inspectors to find that which iraq has gone out of its way to conceal for so long inspectors are inspectors they are not detectives i asked for this session today for two purposes first , to support the core assessments made by dr blix and dr elbaradei as dr blix reported to this council on jan 27 , iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance , not even today , of the disarmament which was demanded of it and as dr elbaradei reported , iraq s declaration of dec 7 did not provide any new information relevant to certain questions that have been outstanding since 1998 my second purpose today is to provide you with additional information , to share with you what the united states knows about iraq s weapons of mass destruction as well as iraq s involvement in terrorism , which is also the subject of resolution 1441 and other , earlier , resolutions i might add at this point that we are providing all relevant information we can to the inspection teams for them to do their work the material i will present to you comes from a variety of sources some are us sources , and some are those of other countries some of the sources are technical , such as intercepted telephone conversations and photos taken by satellites other sources are people who have risked their lives to let the world know what saddam hussein is really up to i cannot tell you everything that we know , but what i can share with you , when combined with what all of us have learned over the years , is deeply troubling what you will see is an accumulation of facts and disturbing patterns of behavior the facts and iraq s behavior demonstrate that saddam hussein and his regime have made no effort , no effort , to disarm as required by the international community indeed , the facts and iraq s behavior show that saddam hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction let me begin by playing a tape for you what you 're about to hear is a conversation that my government monitored it takes place on nov 26 of last year , on the day before united nations teams resumed inspections in iraq the conversation involves two senior officers a colonel and a brigadier general from iraq s elite military unit , the republican guard an audiotape in arabic is played for the security council following is a transcript , as translated by the state department colonel peace we just have a small question general yeah colonel about this committee that is coming general yeah , yeah colonel with mohamed elbaradei general yeah , yeah colonel yeah general yeah \? colonel we have this modified vehicle general yeah colonel what do we say if one of them sees it \? general you did n't get a modified you do n't have a modified colonel by god , i have one general which \? from the workshop \? colonel from the al kindi company general what \? colonel from al kindi general yeah , yeah i 'll come to you in the morning i have some comments i'm worried you all have something left colonel we evacuated everything we do n't have anything left general i will come to you tomorrow colonel ok mr powell resumes his presentation mr powell let me pause and review some of the key elements of this conversation that you 've just heard between these two officers first , they acknowledge that our colleague , mohamed elbaradei , is coming and they know what he s coming for and they know he s coming the next day he s coming to look for things that are prohibited he is expecting these gentlemen to cooperate with him and not hide things
the morning after announcing he would resign as chairman of aol time warner , steve case was asked to feel his shareholders' pain in a personal sense , how badly do you feel about the almost 200 billion worth of shareholder value that has been wiped out \? asked an interviewer on cnn not too bad , apparently his face expressionless , mr case said i recognize a lot of people have bet on this company and are disappointed by the results but it s never over till it s over with that platitude , mr case exhibited what many see as his two great character flaws a lack of empathy and a refusal to accept blame but perhaps more revealing than his answer was the question aol time warner shareholders should n't be looking for an apology from steve case he played the game brilliantly the deal mr case struck in january 2000 made sense financially and strategically for his shareholders just two months before the stock market peaked and internet mania ended america online a company not yet 15 years old , with but a single product and onefifth the revenue of time warner bought time warner where would former aol shareholders be now if not for time warner s assets \? and if former time warner shareholders think the merger was a mistake and many do they 'd be better off bringing their complaints to the office of richard parsons , chief executive of aol time warner mr parsons , after all , helped negotiate the aol deal along with his former boss gerald levin , who has since retired of course , since the merger became official , aol time warner stock has fallen by more than half , and shareholders of the combined company are disappointed but from a strategic standpoint , the aol time warner deal still makes perfect sense the socalled digital future promoted by mr case and mr levin is coming to pass the internet is increasingly a commercial medium , and aol time warner has the content movies , magazines , cable programs and music to make it profitable aol , the world s largest internet provider , remains an ideal match for time warner , the world s largest media and entertainment company still , in a nation where sin , confession , repentance and forgiveness are deeply ingrained in the secular culture , mr case is expected to be contrite as one of aol time warner s largest institutional shareholders put it to me humility always makes you more sympathetic to a person so why wo n't mr case just say he s sorry \? because he does n't seem to think he has anything to apologize for the promise of the merger still burns bright in my head , case said monday morning he continues to believe in his shining vision of aol time warner if others do n't see what he sees , it s because they 're myopic , not because he made a mistake none of this will make mr case very popular but neither does it make him wrong it took more than seven years before wall street acknowledged that the 1990 merger of time and warner was a success by that measure , it may be at least five more years before steve case is recognized as a genius
six months into new york city s smokefree ordinance , there has been a spate of criticism about the wisdom of sticking by such a ban the most notable came in a roundabout swipe from none other than former mayor rudolph w giuliani , who declared during a trip to ireland last month that irish citizens should have the choice to smoke in public places \( mr giuliani later tried to distance himself from his comments \) but if new york as well as other cities and municipalities is ever tempted to rescind its smoking ban , it should look at the goingson in helena , mont the citizens of helena voted in june 2002 to ban smoking in all public buildings including restaurants , bars and casinos soon after , doctors at the local hospital noticed that heartattack admissions were dropping so they , in conjunction with the university of california , san francisco , did a study to measure the potential shortterm effects of a smoking ban helena is a perfect place for such a study relatively isolated , with enough people in the region \( 66 , 000 \) for a meaningful population sample , and only one cardiaccare hospital within a 60mile radius so it was easy to control the study sample and methodology if you get a heart attack in helena , there s only one place to go for treatment the study showed two trends first , there was no change in heart attack rates for patients who lived outside city limits but for city residents , the rates plummeted by 58 percent in only six months we know from longerterm studies that the effects of secondhand smoke occur within minutes , and that longterm exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with a 30 percent increased risk in heart attack rates , says stanton glantz , a professor of medicine who conducted the study s statistical analysis but it was quite stunning to document this large an effect so quickly it was also stunning to witness what happened next the montana state legislature , under pressure from the montana tavern association and tobacco lobbyists , rescinded the ban in december the result heartattack rates bounced back up almost as quickly as they dropped the bottom line of helena s plummeting , then soaring , heart attack rate is painfully obvious secondhand smoke kills only 30 minutes of exposure to it causes platelets in the bloodstream to become stickier when that happens , blood clots form more easily , which can block arteries and cause heart attacks dr richard sargent , one of the study s authors , points out that eight hours of working in a smoky bar is equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day in such an environment , other studies have shown , workers more than double their chances of developing cancer and asthma , and pregnant workers put themselves at risk for miscarriage and premature delivery all of which make mr giuliani s comments particularly ill informed in addition , despite the dire economic predictions that preceded it , the smoking ban in new york city does not appear to have drastically depressed business from march to june , the city created 10 , 000 new restaurant and bar jobs , according to the department of labor the state department of taxation and finance s most recent report of alcohol and beer tax collections \( which measures both onpremises consumption and retail sales \) shows that revenues rose to 152 million this past august , from 144 million in august 2002 and although the tobacco lobby continues to finance a campaign claiming that new yorkers are unhappy with the ban , a poll released earlier this month by quinnipiac university reported that 59 percent of voters in the state favor prohibiting smoking in public places another survey , commissioned in august by antismoking groups , found that 70 percent of new york city voters support it at a time when the city s budget is in tatters , smoking in public places also sets off an enormous domino effect in publichealth spending by creating or worsening illnesses whose treatment costs are eventually shouldered by taxpayers for all of these reasons , new yorkers ca n't afford to be as easily defeated as the unfortunate citizens of helena nor as easily manipulated by the tobacco lobby and the politicians who are in its pocket drawing \( drawing by jonathon rosen \)
berlin , dec 30 the police in hamburg closed the streets around a military hospital on tuesday and questioned everybody going in and out after receiving what they called concrete indications from american intelligence agencies that a terror attack was being planned against the hospital about 100 police officers wearing bulletproof vests and carrying automatic weapons surrounded the hospital in wandsbek , a suburb near the port of hamburg they also checked identity cards of residents at a nearby subway station , the associated press reported american troops wounded in iraq have been treated at the hospital , but no americans are patients there now , german television said a friendly intelligence service told us that there is the danger of a suicide bombing or car bombing , the hamburg interior minister , dirk nockemann , said on television he said ansar alislam was suspected of planning an attack the group is believed to be linked to al qaeda and according to some reports has recruited supporters in europe to carry out suicide bombings a member of the hamburg branch of the german agency for internal security , heino vahldieck , said in a television interview we have never had such specific hints about an attack before we have specific hints that two terrorists have entered germany and that they want to attack a hospital in hamburg another german television report , however , said the information from the united states mentioned american institutions in europe as possible targets but said nothing about the hospital the report , on the national german channel zdf , virtually accused mr nockemann , who faces elections soon , of making a major show to draw attention to his antiimmigrant positions in his statement , mr nockemann said ansar had many supporters in hamburg , adding , this is also why i have been saying for a long time that we need to change the laws to make it easier for us to deport these suspects a counterterrorism official in europe interviewed on tuesday said that in early december intelligence agencies throughout europe began gathering a flood of information about potential holiday attacks , some from qaeda figures captured in recent months who told the authorities about attacks planned for year s end , including ones that might involve hijacked commercial jets the hamburg incident , coming after reports of planned terror attacks on the vatican and the cancellation of some transatlantic flights , underlined a palpable uneasiness in europe but it also highlighted the vagueness of the warnings , accentuated by the absence of information that any terrorist attacks have actually been attempted or foiled on saturday , the italian newspaper libero in milan said prime minister silvio berlusconi mentioned a threat of terrorism against the vatican according to the newspaper , mr berlusconi said a hijacked plane into the vatican an attack from the sky , is that clear \? the threat of terrorism is very high in this instant i passed christmas eve in rome to deal with the situation mr berlusconi s office denied that he had given an interview another italian official told a reporter that on christmas eve , just before pope john paul ii was to say midnight mass , government officials met to discuss intelligence reports about terror attacks , possibly including one on the vatican the official said mr berlusconi attended the meeting along with walter veltroni , the mayor of rome subsequently , the italian press , which expressed skepticism about the information regarding possible attacks against the vatican , said the information originated in a report by a junior police officer in sardinia , who said an attack on the vatican was planned for christmas eve in another investigation , officials in italy said tuesday that four boobytrapped packages sent to european union agencies since saturday appeared to have originated in bologna two packages were discovered in the hague , one on monday and another on tuesday the first package turned up on saturday when romano prodi , the president of the european commission , unwrapped a book that burst into flames in his bologna home he was unhurt a letter bomb arrived at the european central bank in frankfurt on monday , addressed to the bank president , jeanclaude trichet the german police , who opened an investigation of a foreign terrorist organization , said the bomb contained a flammable substance , but it did not ignite when opened the italian press has reported that radical anarchist opponents of the european union , not islamic terrorists , are the lead suspects in the letter bombings

springs in this south fork hamlet made famous by the abstract expressionist jackson pollock and his circle , artists are rallying to stop east hampton town officials from letting the volunteer fire department burn down a former artist s studio as an exercise , to make way for a new community center the artists , members of the artists alliance of east hampton , say they would like the chance to raise money to restore the studio , which has fallen into disrepair , for use as a cultural center , including a gallery and teaching space the studio , a modern design , wood frame structure that originally had living quarters , was built in the mid1960 s by elizabeth parker anderson , a local painter who worked in the abstract expressionist style and died in 1975 the land it sits on was purchased by the town over 20 years ago , and since then has been used mostly by the springs youth association , a townsponsored group that organizes events for local children about two years ago , the building was closed to the public because of its deterioration the artists say town officials have failed to follow through on a promise , made in the late 1970 s , to turn the studio into a cultural center , but instead let it fall into ruin town officials blame the property damage on storms of recent years some say that , in any event , springs needs a community center more than it needs space for artists allene talmage , chairwoman of the springs citizens advisory committee , which advises east hampton on springs issues , and of a separate 20member committee set up to study what to do with the studio , said conceptual drawings for the community center were complete and defended the plan to build it the town has set aside 15 million for the project there is just not any appropriate or available spot in springs that we can utilize except where that building is located , ms talmage said this is nothing against the artists and the art world we wish them well , and we think they should have a place to meet but it s not the responsibility of the springs community to provide them that space she said the springs fire department already had town permission to proceed with their exercise and would do so soon marie rosso , a painter and member of the artists alliance , said she could not understand why the town opposed restoring the studio as a cultural center everybody said , 'why the artists \? she said and to me it is so clear why the artists \? this area would not have existed if the artists were not here the conflict illustrates the changing nature of springs , a fastgrowing hamlet where the desires of a stillthriving artists' community sometimes bump up against the interests of other residents the area has long been attractive to artists , baymen and working families because housing is less expensive here than elsewhere in east hampton but recently , housing prices have risen sharply and the population has grown to about 5 , 000 residents from about 3 , 200 residents in 1980 , adding to what some here say is an urgent need for more space for everyone the studio is on a 17acre property , which also included a homestead dating to the 1850 s the property was subsequently divided into two nearly equal lots in her will , mrs anderson donated the half with the homestead to the town for use as a cultural center the homestead is now a library operated by the springs historical society in 1980 , the town bought the second lot , which includes the studio , from her estate for 85 , 000 as evidence of what they say was the town s promise to turn the studio into a cultural center , the artists cite a 1979 resolution by the town planning board that resolution acknowledged the gift of the homestead and supported the town s purchase of the studio parcel to , in its words , allow greater flexibility in longrange planning for a springs cultural center diana plitt , a painter from east hampton who is the alliance president and also a member of the studio committee , said that in consigning the studio to the youth association , the town failed to carry out the intent of the resolution mrs plitt added that town officials could find another location in springs for a community center we have been looking for a home for the artists of east hampton for many years , and this would be the perfect place , she said diana weir , a town councilwoman from wainscott and the town board liaison to the studio committee , said that neither mrs anderson s will nor the terms of the gift obligated the town to make the studio a cultural center she said that after more than a year of meetings , the majority of the studio committee concluded , on the basis of engineering reports , that the structure was beyond reasonable repair and must give way to new construction of the community center , which they said was much needed allowing the firefighters to burn the studio down would save the expense of demolition and allow the new center to rise on virtually the same site , ms weir said the property plainly is in bad shape last week , the wooden steps leading to the front door were dangerously loose the large , highceilinged studio was littered with debris ceiling tiles in the former living quarters had fallen litterstrewn wood floors showed water damage and a rickety upright piano in a corner only went plink two soccer balls lay in a closet michael landi , a springs artist who lived and worked in the studio from about 1977 to 1981 , said the interior and exterior were perfect when the town took over and asked him to leave it was beautiful he said it was one of the best studios out here the artists blame the town and the youth association for the deterioration mrs plitt estimated that restoration would cost about 400 , 000 an architect for the alliance , stephen lesser of east hampton , said restoration was feasible you still have a good framework , he said meanwhile , the youth association blames the town for the property s decline the town s only obligation to this building was to keep it up , said kelly mckee , president of the springs youth association but they never put any money into it it got to the point where we were forced out because it was n't safe anymore , and we were just using it as a storage area but mr mckee added that the building should not be set aside just for artists , suggesting that the artists became interested in it only when town money was budgeted for the new community center that was a building that the kids and the community were using , he said now they want to say give it to the artists but it s an opportunity where you can make a building people from a to z can use while local artists could teach at the new community center , it probably could not accommodate serious art exhibitions and gallery space if you have artists displaying art , it s not in harmony with kids coming in to play , ms weir said ms weir added that the town was looking for a townowned parcel of land that could be leased at nominal cost to artists for their exclusive use there are several possibilities , but none seem to suit all parties to many artists , the issue is east hampton s commitment to their world a former alliance president , irwin perton of east hampton , who is a painter and sculptor , said past promises by town officials to help artists secure a center were broken we have gotten lip service from politicians for years and years , he said every community in the country has an arts center , but east hampton , which has the largest concentration of artists in any one community , has nothing it drives me nuts photos falling into ruin an artists group in east hampton wants the town to turn the deteriorating former springs studio of elizabeth parker anderson , a local painter

two midlevel enron employees were charged yesterday with engineering a fraud that generated more than 100 million in revenue through the company s shortlived videoondemand business the federal criminal complaint which was filed under seal on monday named kevin howard , who worked as vice president for finance at enron s broadband division , and michael krautz , a division accountant both men were charged with securities fraud , wire fraud and lying to investigators they left enron only yesterday , a spokeswoman said the complaint centers on a single deal known as braveheart , which was devised by enron in 2000 soon after the company entered into a joint venture with blockbuster to build a business to allow customers to download feature films and other videos from the internet yet while the business was still in the developing stages , enron used complex accounting maneuvers to recognize about 111 million in revenue from it the charges were narrower than had been promised by prosecutors to numerous potential defendants , raising questions about the ultimate scope of any criminal case stemming from the dealings of enron s broadband division it was basically an accounting fraud scheme that produced earnings , said john kroger , an assistant united states attorney in the case lawyers for the two defendants said that their clients would fight the charges kevin maintains his innocence and did not engage in any illegal conduct , said jim levine , a lawyer for mr howard we are disturbed that the government is going after somebody like kevin who , while he worked at enron , dedicated all of his energies at doing things that were in the company s best interest tim johnson , a lawyer for mr krautz , said we do n't think the government s complaint is well founded and we intend to fight it mr howard and mr krautz were freed on bond after a hearing yesterday in federal district court in houston the transaction that resulted in big earnings from a business that had not yet produced significant cash flow was not , in and of itself , illegal rather , according to the criminal complaint , a series of secret oral side agreements between enron executives and investors who did not qualify as independent under accounting rules transformed the deal into a crime in essence , enron was able to recognize huge earnings from the business by selling an interest in it that sale , however , involved a series of offthebooks entities tied to enron that were required to meet specific accounting standards to be treated as separate by filing a criminal complaint , rather than a grand jury indictment , prosecutors could include information that legal experts suggested was intended to put pressure on other enron employees to cooperate with the investigation for example , the complaint disclosed that prosecutors had obtained the cooperation of at least 13 witnesses , including 3 who have signed cooperation agreements with the government such deals can entail an agreement to plead guilty to a criminal charge the criminal case , however , is far different from the one that had widely been expected in recent weeks by former enron officials and others involved in it prosecutors have been threatening former enron officials with securities fraud charges related to the broadband division , saying that they had falsely portrayed its business by failing to disclose that a certain technology did not work indeed , some executives were said to have already received letters from the government informing them that they were targets of the investigation in recent weeks , people involved in the case said , some defendants and their lawyers arranged for presentations to government prosecutors to argue against bringing the charges , saying that the technology did indeed work a threatened day of indictment has since passed , and the charges filed yesterday left some lawyers involved in the case wondering whether the momentum had left the other investigation this is not the broadband case that we all have come to know and love , one lawyer involved in the case said yesterday according to yesterday s complaint , mr howard and mr krautz provided guarantees that outside investors in the braveheart transaction would get back their principal and a return the complaint does not specify if that return of capital was to come from enron or a thirdparty investor still , because of such commitments which were not included in the documentation for the transaction none of the ostensible investors had money at risk in the deal , the complaint said as a result , they could not be treated as true equity investors that is important , because , under the accounting rules at the time , such offthebooks entities were required to have a minimum of 3 percent of their capital from independent investors without that minimum , any such entity would , under the accounting rules , be deemed to be enron itself and that is the essence of the fraud described in the complaint enron sold its interest in broadband to itself but pretended that there were outside investors with capital at risk to make the transaction appear to be a true sale
washington , nov 24 congress abandoned its efforts to enact new energy legislation this year as senate republican leaders said monday night that time had run out to resolve an impasse blocking a vote on the measure despite a lastditch effort by the bush administration to rescue the measure , a spokeswoman for the senate majority leader , bill frist , said the proposal would be pushed over until 2004 given the short time frame , we will be unable to bring up the energy bill , said amy call she said dr frist remained committed to the proposal and would work over the recess to try to resolve the differences that prompted a senate filibuster last week against a measure that provides billions of dollars in tax breaks to power producers the stalemate is a significant setback for president bush , a former oil executive who made developing a new energy policy an early goal of his administration but the legislation , which gained new momentum after the blackout in august , ran into significant opposition from conservation groups and lawmakers who complained they had been shut out of the negotiations over the bill energy secretary spencer abraham was dispatched to the capitol to explore the possibility of abandoning a particularly contentious provision that would grant limited legal protection to producers of a gasoline additive blamed for water pollution around the nation vice president dick cheney , who formulated the white house energy policy in 2001 , also made telephone calls to important lawmakers , officials said it is certainly something that is being looked at , said mr abraham about eliminating the immunity for manufacturers of the additive , known as mtbe that provision has become the focus of opponents of the wideranging measure with senators trying to adjourn tuesday , there was little time to work out a compromise the effort to advance the bill was complicated by the senate s concentration on the battle over medicare drug coverage , which was taking most of the attention of top lawmakers in each party some officials close to the talks said democratic unhappiness over losing a close procedural vote that could have blocked the medicare legislation made them less inclined to support an energy compromise because of their reluctance to give the president victories on both major domestic initiatives administration officials said when it became clear they probably could not win on another vote , they decided that it would be better to let the current tensions in the senate ease and try again in 2004 senator pete v domenici , republican of new mexico and the chairman of the joint housesenate conference committee that drafted the energy plan , said monday that he favored taking out the mtbe provision to advance the rest of the bill the question is , do we kill the whole bill and get nothing \? mr domenici said republicans involved in the talks said there was some receptiveness in the house , which insisted on the protection as part of the measure , to reaching a new agreement over mtbe but an aide to the house majority leader , tom delay , said mr delay was not interested we see no need for a giveaway to trial lawyers simply because a minority of the senate wants to filibuster the energy bill , said stuart roy , a spokesman for mr delay under the proposal in the energy bill , manufacturers of mtbe , or methyl tertiary butyl ether , would be protected from product defect suits filed after sept 5 , a date that could disrupt a series of legal actions filed since then the industry says it deserves the protection because the federal government itself promoted the production of mtbe as an additive to make cleaner burning gasoline opponents say the provision could force communities to pay for costs of cleaning up mtbe pollution the senate leadership fell two votes short on friday of cutting off a filibuster of the 31 billion measure , which also seeks to improve the reliability of the power grid , as a coalition of democrats and republicans raised objections to the bill s cost and contents lawmakers and aides said monday that none of the senators who blocked the bill last week had changed their positions the senate democratic leader , tom daschle , who voted for the energy measure because of its proposal to expand the use of cornbased ethanol , said he believed that chances to enact the measure this year were fading i think if senator frist thought he had two additional votes , it would have come back very quickly , mr daschle said at least at this point , i do n't know that he s been successful it was not certain that eliminating the liability waiver for producers of mtbe would be sufficient to win over the two remaining votes when the senate takes up the measure again many critics of the measure have major objections to other parts of the bill and dropping the provision might switch the positions of a few senators who voted to break the filibuster , particularly those from oilproducing states like texas , louisiana and oklahoma though republican officials intend to renew their push again early in 2004 , any effort to change the overall proposal could renew the many regional policy fights that had to be settled to advance the measure this far and those disputes could be amplified in an election year
one of the many nightmares that followed the sept 11 attacks was the thought that more terrorists might be hiding in the united states , ready to strike at a moment s notice the possibilities were endless and frightening millions pass through america s open doors every day , many disappearing without much of a trace after the attacks the fbi discovered that no fewer than 70 , 000 saudi men , their ages ranging from 18 to 35 , had entered the united states between december 2000 and august 2001 none were likely to pose a threat , but how could you really know \? to reduce the chance of another attack , thousands of foreigners were detained on minor immigration violations many were kept incommunicado until they were deported the president ordered the pentagon to set up military tribunals as a swift means to bring terrorists to justice the fbi s mission changed from catching those who had committed crimes to preventing those who might attack from doing so congress passed the usa patriot act , giving the federal government sweeping new powers , not least by breaking down the wall between intelligence information gathered overseas and law enforcement here at home armed with these new powers , the federal authorities scoured the land in search of terrorist sleeper cells the first seeming success came a year after the twin towers were brought down , when the justice department announced that it had identified , investigated and disrupted a qaedatrained terrorist cell on american soil six americans of yemeni descent were arrested in lackawanna , ny , a small town just south of buffalo they were charged with training with a terrorist organization president bush hailed the arrest months later as proof that america was winning the war on terror we have broken al qaeda cells in hamburg , milan , madrid , london , paris , as well as buffalo , ny , he told the nation last january in his state of the union address the story of the lackawanna six , as the young men became known , is the subject of tonight s edition of frontline on pbs based on joint reporting with the new york times \( which on sunday published a 10 , 000word article on the case by matthew purdy and lowell bergman \) , frontline takes us into the complexities of the fight against terror at home through interviews with top government officials , the fbi agents who worked on the case and with one of the men charged , the report recounts how the muslim americans fell prey to a qaeda recruiter in lackawanna , set off for training in terrorist camps in afghanistan , met with osama bin laden when he hailed martyrdom missions , and then returned home in the summer of 2001 , apparently to resume their normal lives the matteroffact exposition of how al qaeda recruits and trains is sobering but the frontline report is more than a chilling tale it is above all a careful account of the quandary that confronts the united states as it seeks to prevent another 9 11 how to thwart an attack without curtailing the freedoms all americans now take for granted the lackawanna six are americans they were born here and went to local schools , and some were married with children in the months just after the fbi received an anonymous letter in may 2001 , saying that the men had gone to afghanistan to train at qaeda camps , the bureau failed to substantiate the charges when asked , the men said they had gone to pakistan for religious training and denied any connection with al qaeda their story did not change after the sept 11 attacks , and without more evidence , there was nothing the fbi could do inside the borders of the united states , there is the rule of law , peter ahearn , the special agent in charge of the fbi s operations in buffalo and western new york , says in the frontline report we had us citizens i was not just going to go up and scoop them off the street yet there were plenty of reasons to worry could this be a sleeper cell \? the fbi and local authorities kept a close watch in the months after sept 11 fbi headquarters were updated on the status of the investigation twice daily the president was briefed frequently but there was not enough evidence to charge the men , and no sign of a terrorist plot the case was finally broken open in the summer of 2002 confronted with evidence obtained through electronic surveillance and other means , the six admitted that they had gone to afghanistan the previous year and pleaded guilty to training with a terrorist organization the successful investigation demonstrated the value of sharing government intelligence with law enforcement officials but even that information could not reveal why the six had gone halfway around the world were they terrorists waiting to strike or just young men who were seriously misled \?

washington , may 1 the house adopted a 15 billion initiative to combat aids worldwide today the vote was taken after conservatives won a requirement that at least onethird of the money promote sexual abstinence before marriage the concession helped solidify support for a measure for aids treatment , research and education that is a priority of the bush administration , and it resulted in a strong bipartisan vote in support of a social measure in the usually polarized house the vote was 375 to 41 in adopting this proposal , we show the world that conviction and compassion go together , said representative henry j hyde , the illinois republican who is chairman of the international relations committee mr hyde compared the aids crisis to the medieval plague the proposal would almost triple federal spending over five years for fighting aids overseas , a significant expansion of united states participation aimed particularly at africa , the measure has been pushed by lawmakers from both parties and aids advocacy groups it received a surprise endorsement from president bush in his state of the union speech , giving it new urgency today s action is an important step toward providing critically needed treatment and care for millions of people suffering from aids and proven prevention programs for millions more who are at risk , mr bush said after the vote he urged the senate to follow suit quickly senate officials said they hoped to consider a similar proposal in committee as early as next week the majority leader , bill frist of tennessee , a surgeon , has been closely involved in trying to pull together a bill , but none has been introduced because of differences over spending and prevention policies lawmakers said the house passage could give momentum to senate action as they counted the toll of dead and dying in their debate , lawmakers said the united states needed to have a greater role in slowing the suffering caused by a disease that has killed an estimated 25 million people , and infected even many more , 30 million in subsaharan africa alone what we are doing today on a bipartisan basis will save the lives of tens of millions of innocent people across the globe , said representative tom lantos of california , senior democrat on the international relations committee under the program envisioned in the house bill , the money would go to drug treatment for people with aids in africa , the caribbean and other regions where cases are sharply increasing to provide care to finance research for a vaccine and to help support children orphaned by the disease at least 55 percent of the money would be for medical treatment the bill also provides up to 1 billion a year for a fund to treat aids , malaria and tuberculosis but in an effort to generate contributions from other nations , it limits the united states share to 33 percent although they were eager to support mr bush , house members opposed to abortion were uneasy about the compromise shaped in negotiations between mr hyde and democrats on his panel because of its call to promote condoms as a way to stem the spread of aids in the critical vote , representative joe pitts , republican of pennsylvania , offered the provision , adopted on a 220to197 vote , that said onethird of money spent on prevention had to be used for abstinence programs he and other republicans cited a significant decrease in aids cases in uganda after that nation adopted an approach that stressed abstinence , fidelity and the use of condoms representative mike pence , republican of indiana , said it was not enough to send billions of dollars to africa without sending values that work democrats argued that requiring abstinence programs could detract from other elements and that condoms were an important cause of the reduced cases in uganda we must support what works , said the house democratic leader , nancy pelosi of california mr hyde argued that the onethird requirement would not stifle the other approaches it simply says as we move forward in this war , do n't forget abstinence , he said the provision was endorsed by the white house lawmakers said vice president dick cheney called house members today to lobby for it the house also adopted a provision that said religious groups and other organizations opposed to the distribution of condoms could not be barred from receiving money advocates welcomed the vote and said the abstinence language would not pose a serious problem one advocate said the important development was that republicans were voting for a measure to endorse condom distribution while democrats backed abstinence programs that is a pretty good start , he said
ronald s lauder , heir to the cosmetics fortune , former american ambassador to austria , once a mayoral candidate , prodigious art collector and major benefactor of jewish causes , knows a lot about art stolen by the nazis , much of it from jews starting in the mid1990 s he became a vocal champion of restitution of the artworks to their rightful heirs , an issue that was then erupting across europe and the united states after 50 years of silence as chairman of the commission for art recovery of the world jewish congress , mr lauder has been a patron of scattered efforts to help jews reclaim what had been theirs in testimony before congress , he called these stolen artworks the last prisoners of war but in an interview he also conceded that he had artworks in his collection whose provenance was at best ambiguous and at worst unknowable and some critics say he has been too slow to check the provenance of his art , even given the historical difficulties of doing it , or to make the information he does have available to outsiders mr lauder has a particular for two turnofthe century austrian artists , egon schiele and gustav klimt , many of whose works belonged to jewish collectors before world war ii many were stolen and lost during the nazi years , and many of their owners were killed in the holocaust could it be that some of the missing drawings , works on paper that both artists turned out by the hundreds , are hanging on the walls of the neue galerie , the sparkling new addition to museum mile that mr lauder opened on fifth avenue 14 months ago \? the answer , mr lauder and experts say , may be unknowable as for me , i am going to doubly , triply and quadruply check everything , mr lauder said in the interview in his corporate office , filled with art , overlooking central park but that does n't mean it could n't happen that someone would present a claim to a work seized by the nazis from a relative mr lauder , who bought his first schiele drawings as a teenager with his bar mitzvah money , says that few people paid attention to provenance when he entered the market in the late 1960 s under the tutelage of serge sabarsky , whose collection also hangs in the neue galerie i was like everyone else , mr lauder said it did n't occur to me it was not a question that people were looking at mr lauder and his curators have since done provenance research on the works in the museum s collection , which belongs to the lauder family , the sabarsky foundation and the museum itself given his public stance on the restitution of stolen art , mr lauder said , i have a responsibility to be more aggressive than most still , the neue galerie has yet to post the results of its provenance research on its web site in accordance with a commitment by the american association of museums two years ago to the presidential advisory commission on holocaust assets the agreement , covering art acquired after 1932 and produced before 1946 , was intended to allow people anywhere a chance to look at american museum collections without having to travel here we are only 12 to 14 months old , and it is taking us more time to get going and do the research necessary , mr lauder said , adding that he would prefer that the museum post all provenance data at once rather than piecemeal specific requests for provenance information on the collection were answered by the gallery , but often the research is sketchy and does not go back before world war ii in some cases the results are limited to the name of a new york art dealer , with no hint of prior ownership but the neue galerie s lapse is regarded as typical of mr lauder , who has several times during his long career become ensnared in contradictions of his own making because of his prominent position in the new york art world he is chairman of the museum of modern art , as well as a founder of the neue galerie and one of the city s best known collectors experts in the field of art stolen by the nazis are reluctant to comment publicly on his record but several , speaking anonymously , noted that his different , sometimes overlapping roles have sometimes clashed awkwardly one said he was inconsistent as a private collector and as head of the modern the issue of holocaustera art , which emerged first in europe , became news in manhattan in 1998 when district attorney robert m morgenthau moved to seize two schiele paintings that had been on exhibit at the museum of modern art , on loan from the leopold foundation in vienna the works , portrait of wally and dead city iii , were claimed by the relatives of their original owners , viennese jews whose collections and property were seized by the nazis dead city iii was eventually sent back to vienna , although some experts continue to challenge its provenance , which is similar to the provenance of schiele drawings in some american museums , including a drawing entitled prostitute at the modern and another drawing , i love antithesis , at the neue galerie
detroit , march 12 nearly a year and a half into the tenure of william clay ford jr , ford motor still finds its management team coalescing , or trying to but , as nicholas v scheele , the company s president and chief operating officer , found out this week , maintaining a united front is hard to do in the face of rumors that top executives are feuding sometimes , this city can seem like the largest little village in the world , mr scheele wrote today in an email message to company officers , urging them to disregard rumors that he was feuding with david thursfield , the company s purchasing chief and executive vice president in charge of international operations let me now address the scurrilous suggestions that david somehow orchestrated leaks to damage me such stories are really beneath contempt , he wrote , adding that none of us can afford to blink , to pause , to stop while the company struggles to return to profitability mr scheele and mr thursfield , two british citizens who serve as top deputies to mr ford , who is the chairman and chief executive , are known for differing styles mr scheele is affable and a consensus builder , while mr thursfield is a cost cutter the two men have insisted that their relationship is in good shape , and they have worked together previously in ford s european operations mr scheele s memo today followed reports of tension after an internal review and reversal of mr scheele s decision to strengthen ties to the wpp group , the company s principal advertising firm , which is run by a friend and employs mr scheele s son mr scheele had previously disclosed the ties to his son , and ford decided only to form a committee to rethink the deal as you will appreciate , mr scheele said in the email message , the past few days have been difficult for me personally the company , meanwhile , is searching for its sixth chief financial officer in four years allan d gilmour , who was brought out of retirement to reprise his role as chief financial officer , appears to be staying long enough to keep a seat warm and last month , mr ford said he would sell a large block of shares of goldman sachs he received in its initial public offering , before he became chief executive a group of board members who reviewed the deal decided to take no action , but mr ford sold the shares and donated the profit to charity considering that he is already forgoing salary and bonus for stock options , he could not be considered a highly compensated chief executive on tuesday , ford stock fell to 660 , a 10year low today , the stock rebounded , rising 48 cents , to close at 708 the company was buoyed by a report from a ubs warburg analyst , saul rubin , a longtime ford bear , who said that the stock was relatively cheap the management distractions have not helped a company whose debt is trading as if it had junk status and that is struggling to return to profitability after losing 64 billion in two years and industry sales , and particularly those of large sport utility vehicles , are coming under pressure as war worries escalate and gas prices rise there any many challenges in the months ahead , both inside and in the world at large , mr scheele wrote in his message today we , as a team , must focus our energies on those we can impact and control photo nicholas v scheele says he is not fighting with david thursfield , above , executive vice president \( reuters \)
las vegas the national football league has made another bad call it has denied the city of las vegas the right to advertise itself during sunday s televised broadcast of the super bowl why \? because we are las vegas the nfl has long had a policy that prohibits gamblingrelated advertisements during televised games and even though our ads promotional spots commissioned by the las vegas convention and visitors authority do not make direct reference to gambling , the league has said that the basic reason for their rejection is simply because las vegas is so synonymous with sports betting and gambling the ads which have already been shown on several cable networks are based on reallife tourist experiences , none of which involve gambling are the commercials provocative even racy \? sure one features an alluring woman on a limousine ride through las vegas but this is vegas , after all will the ads , as the nfl says , have a uniquely negative effect on the public s perception of the game of football \? i am willing to bet the nfl commissioner , paul tagliabue , that they wo n't at any rate , nfl telecasts are constantly interrupted by ads that are n't just negative but offensive what about the beer ads that run during nearly every nfl broadcast \? does alcohol \( or the bevy of the scantily clad women who appear in so many of those ads \) not have a negative effect on the public \? there seems to be a bit of hypocrisy going on here to some degree , nfl games have and always will attract betting almost every newspaper in the country publishes point spreads and the league s own web site is associated with cbs sportslinecom , which lists the odds on upcoming major sporting events and tips on how to bet the nfl needs to face the reality of what is going on outside its stadiums some form of gambling is now legal in almost every state and many states , like california , are hoping to balance their budgets by allowing an expansion of gambling nevada may be the only state where betting on sporting events is legal , but we have always been honest and consistent about what we are and what we offer on sunday i 'll be watching the the super bowl from the comfort of a vegas casino i'm looking forward to an exciting game but it would be more exciting if mr tagliabue would allow the broadcast to include a taste of the city that is like no other
safed cheher , afghanistan maleka , a birdlike woman of 30 with a wizened face , lay on the floor on a flat cushion , wrapped in a woolen shawl hours earlier , she had given birth to her sixth child , who , like three others before him , had not survived afghanistan has among the world s highest rates of both infant mortality and maternal death because of difficulties during pregnancy or during childbirth in this poor farming village in the panjshir valley northeast of the capital , kabul , the death of maleka s son was not unusual that was clear from the relatives sitting with maleka her aunt said she had lost 6 of the 10 children she had borne her motherinlaw had lost one of her six children , another relative had lost four maleka s sisterinlaw was nursing a fragile infant girl , born prematurely just two weeks earlier millions of women across rural afghanistan live in a constant cycle of pregnancy and birth through most of their adult lives with little or no medical care it is not uncommon to meet mothers of 10 or 15 children , and they seem old before their time from the physical strain the combination of poor health and nutrition , lack of skilled medical care , the remoteness of their villages and the cultural traditions that forbid women from seeing male doctors all take a toll on women and their children the maternal mortality rate in afghanistan is the highest in the world , according to dr peter salama , director of unicef in afghanistan final results of a study conducted last year by unicef and the atlantabased centers for disease control and prevention are to be released in coming weeks and are expected to show a national ratio of more than 2 , 000 maternal deaths per 100 , 000 live births afghanistan also has the fourth highest rate of infant mortality and deaths of children under 5 , ranking behind only sierra leone , angola and niger , according to unicef babies whose mothers die in childbirth have only a one in four chance of surviving to their first birthday , dr salama said almost half of the deaths of afghan women from 15 to 49 are caused by complications during pregnancy , or by childbirth itself , the study found the researchers state that 87 percent of the maternal deaths they investigated could have been prevented with better medical care it is not known how many children die during childbirth or its complications , but nearly a quarter of the maternal deaths investigated in the survey resulted from obstructed labor , which means that in most cases the baby died with its mother before delivery death rates vary significantly between afghanistan s urban and rural populations , with the rural areas , where there are few skilled medical professionals and no comprehensive medical care , far worse off only 6 of afghanistan s 32 provinces have hospitals that can perform blood transfusions and caesarean sections foreign health experts working in afghanistan foresee no quick solution to the alarming mortality rates of mothers and young children the entire life cycle of women here is to blame , dr salama said in addition to inadequate medical care , he cited poor nutrition stunted growth , which causes difficulties giving birth a lack of education teenage marriages and women s low social status overcoming these obstacles will take years none of the women in maleka s extended family , for example , has ever made the sixhour journey to kabul , which has the closest maternity hospital , to give birth all delivered their children at home , with just the help of female relatives and , in the last few years , of bibi gul , a village woman with some rudimentary training in assisting at births an illiterate mother of five , mrs gul has been working for 30 months at an outpatient clinic for mothers and children here in safed cheher she arrived just before maleka gave birth , but was unable to help although safed cheher is fortunate in being one of the few villages to have such a clinic , only a small percentage of the women living in the surrounding area visit it , according to myriam modrin , a french midwife working with aide m dicale internationale , or ami , a french agency that runs the clinic if they live far away from the clinic , they have to walk , so they do not come , she said in a society in which women rarely leave their family compound and never show their face to a male other than their husbands or blood relatives , afghan village women rarely see a doctor at all the few doctors who work in rural areas are invariably male female doctors and other health workers tend to work in the cities , given the cultural restrictions on women s movements in villages most village women , for their part , are illiterate and cannot qualify for any medical work beyond that of assistant midwife , said zakia kohistani , an afghan midwife who trains women through ami mrs gul said that when she first began working for the french agency two and a half years ago , she spent months visiting women in their homes with a french midwife , trying unsuccessfully to persuade them to visit the clinic the husbands did not want to send their wives to the clinic , she said when a woman dies or is sick it is no problem for the husband they do not bring them to the clinic
albany , dec 23 a real estate developer who took gov george e pataki and his wife to st barts on a private jet in november stands to benefit from a 150 million railroad spur into the meadowlands in new jersey that the port authority of new york and new jersey approved two weeks ago the approval of the rail spur was good news for mackcali realty corporation , one of the two developers building a 13 billion entertainment , retail and sports complex to be called xanadu that will surround the continental airlines arena , where the nets play the corporation is controlled by the family of earle i mack , the developer who made his private plane available to mr pataki , his wife and a former aide for a trip to the caribbean on nov 10 mr mack , who accompanied the governor on the trip , is a major shareholder and a member of the board of directors of mackcali realty , though he does not manage its daytoday operations mr pataki s aides have said he has reimbursed mr mack for the cost of the flight , though they have yet to say how much he paid following state ethics rules , mr pataki gave mr mack the equivalent of the cost of roundtrip , firstclass tickets on a commercial airliner , which would be far less than the rate of 2 , 000 to 5 , 400 for each hour of flight time airline charter operators say they charge the rail spur to the future xanadu site was approved on dec 11 , a day after the governor of new jersey , james e mcgreevey , announced he had reached an agreement with mr pataki over financing of the project the two governors jointly control the port authority , and such a project cannot go forward without the support of both it is common for the two governors to sign off on each other s capital projects as a courtesy , unless one or the other breaks that tradition , which has in the past led to one governor or another holding a project hostage mr pataki feuded with mr mcgreevey s predecessor , christie whitman , a fellow republican , over some projects , though he and mr mcgreevey , a democrat , have a much better working relationship there is no hard evidence linking the trip that mr pataki took with mr mack , a man the governor considers an old friend , and his decision to let the rail project go forward nor is there any indication the governor even knew that mackcali realty would benefit but advocates for open government said the veil of secrecy mr pataki has wrapped around all his vacations has created a climate of suspicion and creates appearances of conflicts , even if none exist the governor s policy is never to tell the public where he is going , whom he is staying with or who is footing the bill , on the grounds that he has a right to privacy the best way to inoculate the private decisions of a public servant is to make sure the public knows about it , said blair horner , a senior analyst with the new york public interest research group , who has pushed for stricter ethics laws for years if a powerful , influential , wealthy interest underwrites the governor s vacation , the public has a right to know that if the governor did pay for it , we should see the receipts , we should know asked if mr mack had lobbied the governor to approve the railroad project , lisa dewald stoll , mr pataki s communications director , declined to answer because , she said , it implied that the governor had done something wrong i think it is insulting , she said ms stoll said the governor had approved the railroad project as a courtesy to mr mcgreevey , just as the new jersey governor had approved mr pataki s requests the governor is focused totally on the transit projects and port authority projects within the boundaries of new york state , she said mr mack did not return a telephone message left at his office by a reporter on tuesday neither did virginia sobol , the vice president for marketing and public relations at mackcali realty mr mcgreevey touted the new rail line as a boost to the meadowlands xanadu project and said it would make the location the premiere site in the nation and the region he also said it would help new jersey keep the four professional sports franchises that now call the meadowlands home two of those teams the nets and the jets are being courted by new york city mr mcgreevey personally asked mr pataki to support the railroad spur earlier this month in a telephone call , just a few days before the 10member board of the port authority approved it as part of its capital budget an aide to mr mcgreevey , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said mr pataki was not initially keen on the idea we were able to make the case to him that it was going to have regional benefits and i think he went along , the aide said according to a company news release , mackcali intends to develop four office buildings of 440 , 000 square feet apiece and a 520room hotel at the site the other developer , the mills corporation , will build a family entertainment complex , including an indoor ski resort and an indoor carracing venue the rail link to it is to be paid for by the port authority and built by new jersey transit besides taking mr pataki on his private jet for a vacation , mr mack has been a longtime supporter of the governor and a heavy contributor not only to the governor s campaigns , but also to the state republican committee and a committee controlled by the senate republicans in the runup to last year s election , mr mack gave mr pataki donations worth 23 , 980 , and contributed 164 , 500 to the republican state committee and the senate republicans walter ayres , a spokesman for the new york state ethics commission , said that in new york state , public officials who accepted a ride on a chartered or private jet were required to reimburse their benefactor only for the firstclass rate that would have been charged by an air common carrier at the time the transportation was provided mr ayres said he was barred by law from discussing whether mr pataki sought the commission s advice , but aides to the governor say he followed the commission s guidelines to the letter the cost of chartering a private jet from albany to st barts would have been quite high , charter companies said for instance , sharyn richards marks , in charge of sales for richmor aviation , said a fiveday trip to st barts from albany could cost from 22 , 000 for a small beechjet 400a to about 60 , 000 for a larger , more luxurious gulfstream 4

board of education officials in bridgeport said the city s three public high schools would look into creating tutoring programs and family advisory centers as just few ways to improve poor scores on statewide high school tests sonia diaz salcedo , the superintendent of schools , said the board would also work on improving literacy skills , especially in the seventh and eighth grades , after this year s connecticut academic performance test determined the city s students to be deficient in reading , math , writing and science the release last week of the results of the tests given to sophomores at bassick , central and harding high schools last spring show that roughly 5 percent of the 1 , 041 tested had mastered all four areas and 75 percent had mastered none in addition , more than 50 percent were not proficient in reading and almost 75 percent were not proficient in math the scores determine if the schools comply with federal standards but all three schools could fail to comply because only 85 percent of eligible sophomores took the test taking the test was not a graduation criteria at the time of the most recent testing but beginning in 2004 , students will be required to pass at certain proficiencies to receive their diplomas ms diaz salcedo said she believed that the failure of many students to take the test kept the scores down she thinks the new requirement will change things we think the fact that it s going to become a high stakes test , and that there are sanctions attached to it taking it again or taking a remedial course if the scores are poor will make a difference brenda dye , the president of the parents , teachers and student organization at central high school , was disappointed by the results and has concerns about the level of difficulty of the test we need answers from the system , and we need to find out what we can do about it , said mrs dye , whose son is a senior at central the state s department of education is scheduled to release averages and comparisons from across the state in november jeff holtz
cambridge , mass venezuela is in its worst political crisis since the establishment of its constitutional democracy in 1958 at stake is not only hugo ch vez s presidency , but the ability of any democratic leader to govern in the future public opinion polls show that most venezuelans want mr ch vez out of office they have good reasons since mr ch vez s election in 1998 , his administration has mismanaged the economy , fomented violence and concentrated power , threatening venezuela s core democratic institutions in response , a coalition of opposition parties , unions and business leaders has held a crippling general strike for nearly two months that has emptied store shelves , paralyzed the oil industry and pushed the country to the brink of civil war opposition leaders have vowed to continue the strike until their demands for mr ch vez s immediate resignation and new elections are met such a disruptive strategy is misguided it has not only inflicted enormous damage on venezuela s economy and democracy , it has weakened the opposition itself laying siege to the government plays into mr ch vez s own strategy of rallying his supporters by polarizing the country along class lines even if the strike succeeds in forcing mr ch vez to resign or in provoking a military coup , such a victory would likely be pyrrhic the opposition could lose a new election it is highly fragmented , and none of its potential presidential candidates enjoys broad public support if faced with multiple challengers , mr ch vez might win again were the opposition to succeed in a new election , it would still not be guaranteed the ability to govern mr ch vez retains the intense support of an important minority of venezuelans , concentrated among the poor if he were forcibly removed , his supporters would not accept the legitimacy of a new government and would work to undermine it postch vez venezuela would be as ungovernable as it is today argentine history offers lessons about the consequences of trying to save democracy by going around the constitution the 1955 coup against juan per n , a semiautocratic populist much like mr ch vez , did not bring about a return to stable constitutional rule those who supported per n denied the legitimacy of all successor governments and worked actively and at times violently to bring them down those against per n fought back three more presidents fell victim to coups more than 30 years passed before another elected president completed his mandate fortunately , there is an alternative model chile during the mid1980 s , after protests failed to topple the dictator augusto pinochet , chilean democrats embarked on a different course the opposition decided to abide by chile s constitution and wait for a plebiscite in 1988 to determine whether general pinochet would step down opposition parties used the time to build a broad coalition and organized an ultimately victorious campaign because the plebiscite had been general pinochet s idea and was run according to his rules , he stepped down chile became one of latin america s most successful democracies the venezuelan opposition can follow suit mr ch vez s 1999 constitution allows for a binding referendum to remove the president at midterm , or in august 2003 if mr ch vez were to be voted down , a new presidential election would be held within 30 days thus far , the opposition has refused to wait until august it should reconsider the opposition could use the next seven months to organize an effective campaign and agree upon a single candidate for future presidential elections in playing by the rules , the opposition would also be able to maintain the domestic and international legitimacy that it forfeited with a failed coup in april 2002 unlike a forced resignation , a recall election would be constitutional and more peaceful mr ch vez s electoral defeat would most likely demobilize , rather than antagonize , his supporters while mr ch vez might try to cancel or steal the election , he would do so at enormous cost the 2002 coup attempt gained mr ch vez widespread support among latin american governments a blatant move by mr ch vez to disregard his own constitution and block a free vote would have the opposite effect most latin american countries would turn against him and weaken his already fractured government , opening the way to impeachment as argentina s postwar history makes clear , when politicians temporarily suspend democratic rules of the game during crises , they risk weakening democracy to the point of collapse a constitutional solution is the best means of preserving venezuelan democracy it would also benefit latin america recent years have brought tough economic times , which in turn have posed a threat to democracy in the region the forced removal of presidents in ecuador and argentina suggests a possible trend in which mass protest serves as a somehow more acceptable form of coup d' tat mr ch vez s forced removal would only reinforce this , making fragile governments all the more vulnerable the venezuelan opposition should be patient as former president jimmy carter recently proposed , the opposition should lift the general strike and abandon current efforts to remove the president in exchange for an agreement with the ch vez government to choose the day for an internationally monitored referendum in august if the opposition were to force mr ch vez s removal before that , it would risk ushering in a cycle of polarization and violence that could grip the country for years avoiding this and saving venezuela s constitutional democracy is well worth waiting eight months

the jets have never felt quite at home at giants stadium the giants got there first , so their name is on the building , not the jets' the giants have won two super bowls since they moved there the jets , none now , with an agreement reached tuesday on a plan for the giants to finance the renovation of the stadium , the jets may feel even more subservient the deal gives the giants great leverage they are willing to spend up to 300 million , so starting next season , they will keep all their game revenues and the rent the jets now pay the new jersey sports and exposition authority wo n't this be awkward \? it would n't be for us , john mara , the giants' executive vice president , said no one is saying this outright , but the giants will be the jets' de facto landlord carl goldberg , the chairman of the sports authority , said , the sports authority will still be the jets' landlord , but a lot of the talks about economic issues will be between the jets and the giants mara said , we will be dealing with them on lease issues the jets are not commenting on the giants' deal until they review its details goldberg insisted that the jets should not feel glum that the giants have chosen , with the national football league , to take the financial risk of revamping the stadium he hopes the deal will lead the jets to stay beyond the expiration of their lease in 2008 even if the jets are pursuing what they believe will be an even better deal at a proposed stadium on the west side of manhattan i think they 'll feel better , goldberg said one , if the giants find someone willing to buy the naming rights to the stadium , it wo n't be giants stadium anymore that should give them some subliminal comfort second , they 'll get enhanced revenues because of the renovation without making a capital investment i 'd suggest that would be a significant inducement to get them to stay but the jets are still a tenant and feel they pay too much rent last june , they sued the sports authority , saying that they had been overcharged 76 million in rent and demanding that their rent \( 15 percent of gross receipts \) be reduced to what the giants pay \( 10 percent \) the giants got the better deal when they extended their lease to 2026 , and the authority has said the jets can pay less if they stay as long as the giants do the jets rest their claim on a clause that says that if the sports authority gives the giants better lease terms , the jets have to be treated similarly the agency disagrees , reasoning that the lower rent is inextricably tied to the lease extension but the terms have changed again the giants will keep all their game revenues , the jets' rent revenues and take half of all nonfootball revenues should n't the jets be offered the same terms \? i do n't believe so , goldberg said only one team can renovate the stadium two years ago , however , the giants and the jets were discussing a joint plan to renovate the stadium , mara said the jets were looking at manhattan , but still eyeing a potential future in new jersey they were at the table with us , mara said we had n't agreed on how we would split renovation costs but they elected to go in a different direction intriguingly , mara left the door open would it be possible for the jets , if they grew disenchanted with the process in manhattan , to split the costs of renovating giants stadium \? it might be grand , mara said but it s not realistic

rio de janeiro a cast composed almost entirely of unknown actors , a setting that is none too attractive , a lot of violence and no sex scenes if ever a studio wanted a formula for a film to fail , that would be it , said the brazilian director fernando meirelles as he was shooting in the slums here two years ago , mr meirelles worried about the commercial viability of the movie he was making yet city of god , which opens in new york and los angeles on friday , has become a watershed cultural and political event in brazil , and has now been seen by more brazilians than any film in nearly 30 years every aspect , from its unblinking portrayal of criminality to its innovative cinematography , has been endlessly analyzed and discussed , to the point that brazil s new president , luiz in cio lula da silva , is reported to have said that seeing the movie made him change his policy on public security city of god \( cidade de deus \) takes its title from the bestselling novel by paulo lins , which in turn is named for a gigantic housing project built here in the 1960 s and where some 120 , 000 people live today mr lins grew up there , knew the reallife characters portrayed in the book and film , and watched as drug gangs gained a stranglehold over the community the book was the fruit of 30 years of observation and 10 years of research , he said in an interview at his apartment in the middleclass neighborhood where he now lives from the time i was a little kid , i watched what was going on around me , so everything that appears in the book is real , and that reality is exactly what the filmmakers wanted to capture when cidade de deus was published in 1997 , it became an immediate critical and popular success in brazil , in large part because it showed slum life from the inside and did so without condemning the people who live there a friend of mr meirelles gave the director a copy of the book with the suggestion that it might make a good movie as it happened , mr meirelles \( pronounced mereellies \) , who is 47 , was then at a crossroads in his career he had always wanted to make feature films , and had directed several television programs and documentaries , but had drifted into advertising and become probably the most successful director of commercials in brazil i had won clio awards and all the other prizes you can win , but i was at that point when you start asking if there is n't something more , he recalled mr meirelles s proposal to film city of god was one of eight that mr lins received , including some from directors much better known and with experience filming in rio s favelas , or hillside squatter slums but when mr meirelles outlined his calculatedly risky plan to cast amateurs from cidade de deus and other slum neighborhoods , the balance shifted it was the idea of using actors from the favelas that really moved me and won me over , mr lins said the money was almost the same in all of the offers , but fernando s vision of the project was the most interesting once that hurdle was overcome , the sheer dickensian sweep of the novel offered mr meirelles his next challenge at 550 pages , city of god has nearly 300 characters and covers three decades in the slum s history an early 160page draft of the script won a prize at a sundance institute workshop held in brazil , but even so , a dozen drafts were required before a filmable version was completed as a white raised in a middleclass s o paulo neighborhood , mr meirelles faced an additional problem , that of credibility the american equivalent of the situation he confronted would be a native of the upper west side of new york city deciding to go into los angeles' south central to make a movie about black gangs and expecting to be received with open arms to ease his way , mr meirelles decided to enlist a codirector , k tia lund originally from s o paulo , ms lund is of norwegian descent and a brown university graduate but had made several brazilian rap videos in the favelas and had also filmed news from a private war , a highly praised documentary about the drug gangs of rio s slums that whole experience was an eyeopener for me , and i wanted to know what was happening and why no one was doing anything about it , she said i believe that people change through emotional rather than intellectual understanding , and since a feature film like this offers a way to reach many more people in a much more direct way than a documentary , i welcomed the chance to get involved with ms lund s help , mr meirelles set up an acting school in a favela in rio , without letting residents know that they were in fact auditioning for a movie for nearly a year , 200 students drawn from an initial pool of 2 , 000 attended acting classes twice a week , rehearsing scenes with a camera rolling so as to get them used to the idea , mr meirelles said of the cast chosen , only matheus nachtergaele , who plays the drug dealer sandro cenoura , is a professional actor leandro firmino da hora , widely praised in the chilling role of the psychotic drug dealer ze pequeno , is a 23yearold slum dweller who had never acted before the part of mane galinha , a bus driver who vows to take revenge against the gangs after they rape his girlfriend , went to the samba singer seu jorge

so for my second visit , i chose maximum anonymity it was a tuesday in darkest january snow swirled outside , on the wide commercial boulevard that bisects this little union county town taormina was warm and inviting but something of a desert island only three or four tables were occupied none of my guests had heard of the place many weeks had passed since my first visit , and my chance of being recognized was minimal but once again , we were the center of the universe the headwaiter a companionable , consummate pro with a sense of humor as dry as grappa was if anything even more attentive than he was on my first visit \( he turned out to be pasquale di iorio , a native of tuscany who is a teacher during the day and who has been with taormina since it opened four years ago \) and the food was as fine and as varied as anything joe had coaxed from the kitchen taormina \( pronounced tahormeenah \) is the name of an astonishingly picturesque city in northeastern sicily , its steep hillside streets and plunging coastal views depicted in a mural in the restaurant s main dining room but it is also go figure the surname of the chef and owner , sal taormina , 40 , who comes not from his namesake city but from sicily s capital , palermo before coming to the united states , mr taormina spent time in udine , in italy s far northeast , and his goal is to present cucina regionale cooking from virtually every region of his native country the menu changes every day , and specials are each marked with the name of a region sicilia , piemonte , puglia , abruzzo that is not easy , mr taormina said wearily the other day but then he brightened for people who come in here , it s a new experience they do n't always see the same thing one thing worth seeing again and again can be found on the regular menu a great platter of fried long hot peppers that mr taormina says he finds at a farmers' market in newark this dish is not to be trifled with , and certainly not to be eaten alone the peppers , shriveled and dark and glistening , held enough btu s to warm a small village , but the heat was modulated by generous shavings of excellent parmesan moscardini alla griglia , a special one night , was nothing more than whiteandpurple chunks of brilliantly fresh baby octopus , grilled until smoky and crusty and lightly tossed with olive oil and lemon juice one of those elemental , perfect dishes whose tastes and textures will stay fresh in memory for years mussels marinara were fine , too , ample and tender in a robust tomato sauce with subtle sweetness and heat other appetizers were less distinguished , from dull , heavy stuffed artichoke to veal soup that combined stringy meat and timid stock fig with prosciutto , olives and buffalo mozzarella was sabotaged by far too much salt in the dressing first courses are large , and it can come as a shock to realize that you still have a maincourse mountain to climb but joe told me not to miss the rabbit , and as usual he was right on this particular saturday it was stewed in the style of abruzzo , with white wine , herbs and wild mushrooms over silky homemade pappardelle a tuesday special , porterhouse steak , was not of the highest quality , but it was redeemed by a vigorous broiled topping of bread crumbs and hot peppers pork tenderloin might be prepared in the tuscan style one night , sicilian another we had the sicilian version , with pine nuts and golden raisins in a balsamic vinegar sauce the meat was juicy and fullflavored , as it was in beautifully browned pork chops with green beans and julienne vegetables beef liver , ordered mediumrare and served that way , was firm and tangy , with a vinegary tangle of caramelized onions baked lemon sole was mild and meaty , with a leaning tower of mashed potatoes pastas held much less interest penne norma , with eggplant , tomato , basil and aged ricotta , was no better or worse than a thousand versions , and capellini sinatra \( angel hair with shrimps , scallops , olives and capers \) left little impression it s worth whatever dining strategy you can employ to save room for the cheesecake , which is so famous locally that mr taormina sells dozens of them in 14inch wheels at 95 each he wo n't divulge the recipe , but i suspect ricotta , vanilla and lemon are involved the hazelnut gelato called gianduja is lighter and superb , and so is vanillascented panna cotta taormina is the kind of place that sends out a platter of smoky roasted chestnuts along with dessert , whether or not you 're a regular it is decorated in the basic , functional , slightly timeworn style of middling italian restaurants from here to sardinia prices are gentle \( 40 a person is a lot to spend \) , and you supply the wine in short , it is a neighborhood restaurant may i have one in my neighborhood \?

the firstenergy corporation , the utility company whose power lines were the first to fail in the blackout , seems to have ignored regulators' warnings that its antiquated grid could falter the company , based in akron , ohio , has also ignored shareholder demands that its executives improve the company s governance practices while greater attention to corporate governance may not have prevented its woes , firstenergy s persistent dismissal of shareholders' concerns about its entrenched board is a troubling sign of complacency at a company whose every move is under scrutiny seven times since 1999 , a majority of shareholders voted for changes in corporate governance , and in each case firstenergy did not respond this year , more than half of its voting shareholders favored rescinding the poison pill that prevents an unfriendly takeover at firstenergy and changing the company s staggered board structure firstenergy directors serve for three years just onethird of the board is elected each year a majority of shareholders have voted four times to put the company s directors to annual reelections firstenergy has said that its board structure increases the likelihood of continuity and stability in the board s business strategies and policies but many shareholders seem to think that too much board continuity has made it too chummy ten of firstenergy s 16 directors have been on its board or one of its units for 10 years or more john chevedden , a shareholder advocate in redondo beach , calif , says the company has also tried to keep shareholder proposals out of its proxy materials given their response , it is not surprising that they 've had other oversight lapses , mr chevedden said , referring to recent problems at the company s energy operations i think that when a company does n't respond to shareholder votes , that s all the more reason to investigate it more thoroughly and demand more accountability and give greater scrutiny to what the company does the company s bylaws state that its board structure cannot be changed unless 80 percent of the shareholders vote to do so none of the recent votes on the staggered board have met that hurdle but given that 65 percent of those voting last may favored the proposal , the company could certainly be more responsive after the shareholder vote last may , the company did not say how it planned to respond , if at all on friday , kristen baird , a spokeswoman at firstenergy , said the recent shareholder votes on both the board structure and the poison pill were being examined by the directors ms baird said the company was committed to good governance she disputed the view that it battles shareholder proposals firstenergy is not alone in ignoring shareholders' proposals , even ones that win such proposals are nonbinding many companies shrug them off but the securities and exchange commission is weighing new rules that would give shareholders more power in the selection of directors one idea is to identify events that will prompt enhanced shareholder access like a company s refusal to act on shareholders' proposals that win majorities i think this is a company that still has a chance to be responsive to its shareholder vote in its latest year , but the evidence from its past conduct is not very encouraging , said gregory p taxin , at glass , lewis company , an independent research firm in san francisco that focuses on corporate integrity this is a board which has been in place for a long time with provisions that have entrenched it there it is a great example of why we need the nomination reforms that the sec is considering graph losing value tracks daily share prices of firstenergy since august 2000
state , city and union officials have their eyes on a potential new revenue source that could pump up to 1 billion into new york state s coffers , and they are competing to put it to uses as varied as reducing the budget deficit , providing more money for schools and giving raises to public employees the new revenue would result if state officials and leaders of hip health plan , one of new york s largest health insurers , win approval for converting the plan into a commercial company when a nonprofit unit converts to commercial status , it sells stock for the first time , and the money from that sale belongs to the state at a time when every public service and every part of the state faces the prospect of budget cuts , jostling for the money has already begun the city , state and various unions are already trying to lay claim to it , each making arguments to justify why some or all of it is owed to them the jostling is increasingly public and sharpelbowed , and it is likely to intensify when a new legislative session begins next month in albany , and when gov george e pataki releases a new budget proposal everybody has probably spent the hip conversion money 25 times over before hip has even decided , for certain , to convert , said randi weingarten , president of the united federation of teachers , chairwoman of the city s municipal labor council and one of the people lobbying for a role in deciding how the money is spent everybody is so desperate , financially , that everyone wants a piece of this hip s executives , governor pataki s office and leaders of the assembly and senate have all indicated , publicly or privately , that they favor the conversion , which would require passage of a state law several prominent lawmakers predict that such a law will pass in 2004 more difficult would be deciding how to divide the spoils , a step complicated enough to prevent a deal , officials say the state recently cashed in on a similar conversion almost two years ago , the governor and the legislature agreed to let empire blue cross blue shield convert to commercial status , creating revenue that allowed the state to avoid some expected budget cuts and even increase spending in some areas more specifically , much of the money was used for hospitals , to pay for raises for lowlevel workers , in a deal worked out with dennis rivera , the head of 1199 seiu , the politically powerful hospital workers' union since all the powers that rule the state capitol were pulling toward a common goal , that deal went through despite a chorus of criticism from health care advocates and fiscal watchdogs who call the practice bad policy in turn , mr rivera s union , usually staunchly democratic , supported mr pataki , a republican , and some republican legislators in last year s elections this time , the political forces are far less unified about what to do with the money , and since every member of the legislature is up for reelection in 2004 , the issue is highly charged no one involved expects the dispute to be resolved easily assemblyman alexander b grannis , a democrat from manhattan and chairman of the insurance committee , said that none of the interests trying to claim the money had the upper hand the legislators are n't as intimidated by randi weingarten as they are by dennis rivera , especially the members from outside the city , he said and the governor s not up for reelection , like he was the last time hip covers about 1 million members in the new york metropolitan region enrolled in its hmo are 140 , 000 medicaid recipients , making it the largest private insurer of medicaid recipients in the state the region s larger profitmaking insurers , like oxford and aetna , have avoided contracts covering medicaid recipients since they are unprofitable , they say many older health insurers , like blue cross , were created as nonprofit companies with an eye to public service , while most newer companies started as profitseeking units some nonprofit companies fear that health care would suffer if they had to deliver profits and satisfy shareholders , while others have concluded that everyone would benefit if they were free to raise capital in the equity markets in hip s case , the first sale of stock that comes with turning commercial would raise 400 million to 1 billion , officials estimate any money raised from such a sale belongs to the state , as compensation for the insurer s years of tax exemptions , but the state can choose what to do with it lawmakers say that a bill allowing the conversion would almost certainly also address where the money would go , as was done in the empire deal bloomberg administration officials and municipal unions argue that hip is unique and that the money should not automatically revert to the state the insurer was created in the 1940 s to cover city employees , and while it has long covered other clients , city workers remain a big part of its enrollment the city and its workers have contributed much of hip revenues over the years , and four municipal unions are represented on its board as a result , city and union officials say , they have a particular claim on any conversion money
in the strongest attempt yet to create a legitimate alternative to free musictrading sites , america online will introduce a service today that lets users download and listen to a large catalog of songs for 895 a month , users will be able to listen to a catalog of music , now at 250 , 000 songs and growing , on their computers moving songs to cd s or portable players will cost more aol is selling a version of a service from musicnet , which is a consortium of realnetworks the bmg unit of bertelsmann emi and warner music , which like america online is a unit of aol time warner aol refused to introduce musicnet s first product a year ago , arguing that it was too hard to use and did not have enough music now aol says that the service has improved enough to offer it to its 27 million members that represents the most important test yet for the concept of selling music as a subscription service rather than as discrete discs for aol , musicnet also represents a crucial part of its strategy to increase its tiny share of the market for internet users who connect over highspeed , or broadband , connections aol is already promoting its free music content , which includes hundreds of songs , videos and original recordings of musicians in the next few weeks , aol is going to introduce an improved 15amonth service , with a bundle of content and services meant for people who already buy broadband connections from their cable or telephone companies that offering will include a limited version of musicnet that will let users download 20 songs a month and listen to another 20 one time others can buy this limited version for 395 a month the standard 895 version of the service will allow users to listen to an unlimited number of songs on demand while they are connected to the internet through a technology called streaming they can also download the songs to their computers for higher sound quality and the ability to listen to them when not on the internet unlike music downloaded from napster , the defunct free music sharing service , and its successors like kazaa , a subscriber can listen to musicnet s downloads on no more than two computers they also cannot be copied to other devices or sent to other people but a premium version of the service , for 1795 a month , gives users the right to burn 10 songs a month onto a recordable cd these will be in the standard , unprotected format used by all music cd s , and thus those songs could be copied , converted to a popular format like mp3 and sent over the internet at will so far , legitimate music download services have not been a success with consumers , not only because they charge a fee but also because the first versions had very limited numbers of songs and even more draconian rules about what users could do with them musicnet initially had songs only from its owners and some independent labels its main rival , pressplay , was formed by sony music and universal music by late last year , musicnet and pressplay each reached agreements with all the major labels and many independent labels as well an independent service sold by listencom , called rhapsody , also allows users to listen to songs from all the major labels and to burn some of them to cd s for 995 a month rhapsody is trying to attract attention with a limitedtime offer that allows users to download individual songs at 49 cents , half its regular price with its 895 standard tier , aol is undercutting the 995 basic price of pressplay , which is mainly sold by yahoo and microsoft the only other version of musicnet , offered by realone , costs 495 a month for 100 downloads and 100 onetime streams so far , none of these services have attracted more than a few tens of thousands of subscribers somewhat more popular are online radio services that let users pick the style or even artist they want to listen to but not the actual song musicmatch , for example , has 120 , 000 subscribers to its radio service at 295 to 495 a month kevin conroy , the aol senior vice president for entertainment , said its version of musicnet would be far more popular because it would be integrated into the aol service users will simply add the musicnet fee to their existing aol account and credit card numbers and for those who subscribe to the musicnet service , aol s music programming , which attracts 12 million users a month , will be laced with links that will start songs playing mr conroy added that he thought that even some users of kazaa would be attracted because aol s service downloads faster and does not have the errors and delays of the free music trading services right now it takes 8 or 10 searches to find what you are looking for on services like kazaa because so many files are mislabled , he said we have forced people to do illegal things because we have not offered an easy , convenient mainstream way for them to do what they wanted aol said that it had rights to another 80 , 000 songs that it would add to the service in coming months this represents about half the popular music that is now in circulation much of the most popular material , from artists like madonna and the beatles , has not been made available on these downloading services , however but new artists generally sign deals that give labels the electronic rights to their works for example , come away with me by norah jones , which won the grammy for album of the year on sunday , is available on the service for listening and downloading , but it cannot be burned to a cd the labels , artists and music publishers are paid a share of the monthly fees on all of these services in proportion to how much their songs are listened to they also get a share of the fee paid when songs are burned to cd s pauljon mcnealy , the research director for media at gartner g2 , said that with the latest releases of musicnet and pressplay , the music industry has eliminated most , but not all , barriers to creating an online service that will attract music fans this is close to what people will find palatable , he said the musicnet on aol service , he said , will be a good introduction to online music for a mainstream audience , but the limitations are still significant people want to buy their music once and own it forever , he said
with so many consumer purchases proving popular online whether books , concert tickets or prescription drugs the question was eventually bound to arise why not coffins \? funeral industry executives and analysts say that consumers are increasingly interested in being able to shop online for their funeral needs and that some web merchants are stepping up to serve them when you visit casket dealers online , you can look at something over and over again , said jay kravetz , editor of death care business , a trade publication you 're not pressured you have time to look with relatives and friends it s really easier online and it can be cheaper , given that some funeral directors mark up their coffins as much as 300 percent over wholesale , knowing that most consumers are reluctant to haggle or shop around on the web , funeral depot , which sells funeral supplies both online and offline from its hallandale beach , fla , store , is able to earn a profit of about 40 percent by charging double the wholesale price of its coffins and still significantly beating funeral homes' prices the average price of funeral depot coffins sold online is about 1 , 500 i 'll offer the same coffin at a fraction of what a funeral home charges , deliver it overnight for free , and still make substantial profit and walk away the hero , said dean magliocca , president and owner of funeral depot mr magliocca is among the more successful online merchants of funeral supplies , with projected revenue this year of 15 million the bulk of it from his web operation it is a modest number , to be sure , but mr magliocca is not complaining we 're very pleased with our progress , he said it s taken us a little over three and a half years to get us where we 're at , but we 've finally perfected what we do , and we 're starting to generate a lot of revenue with nice margins at the time he started the web operation , mr magliocca had been selling only monuments and grave markers from his storefront i started to hear from families that they did n't have enough money to spend on markers because the coffins were 5 , 000 , he recalled i found out it was n't necessarily because of the wholesale costs mr magliocca , who started the online business with about 400 worth of web publishing software and a lot of elbow grease , offers nearly 300 different coffins , with prices ranging from 745 for an unsealed thinmetal box to 18 , 500 for a solidbronze model that he says looks like it belongs in space , not the ground funeraldepotcom also sells theme coffins made by white light inc , which are painted in various motifs , including an auto racing theme for the whimsical there is a coffin done up like a specialdelivery package and stamped return to sender mr magliocca sells coffins from all leading manufacturers , like hillenbrand industries' batesville casket company and matthews international s york group but he has to buy them from third parties because he says that none of the major manufacturers will sell their coffins directly to him , or to any online coffin merchant , for that matter the problem , which has plagued manufacturers and online retailers in many industries , is referred to in business parlance as channel conflict manufacturers or their distributors either do not trust net sellers to protect the image of their brands , or they do not want to upset their established resellers in this case , funeral homes by allowing online retailers to sell their wares at a discount to work around this problem , mr magliocca has set up a nationwide network of about 45 independent funeral homes that are authorized to sell coffins from wellknown manufacturers and have agreed to ship orders on funeral depot s behalf these funeral homes earn a small percentage of each of these sales business they would not have otherwise gotten and many have received referrals from funeraldepotcom customers who call or send email messages to ask the company to suggest funeral homes in various cities funeral depot s arrangement with the independents has drawn legal fire from at least one manufacturer , batesville , which says it has a lawsuit pending against funeral depot while batesville would not comment on the suit , a funeral depot lawyer said the case focused on whether the company could legally continue to use the batesville name when offering batesville coffins on funeraldepotcom or link to images from the batesville catalog that are shown on other web sites other online coffin sellers are coming up with their own workarounds to secure brandname merchandise kim powers , president and founder of memorial concepts online , which sells coffins and other funeralrelated items on the web , declined to say exactly where her company bought its coffins ms powers , whose threeyearold company is based in ponca city , okla , said memorial concepts was now profitable , despite the fact that she could not sell in her home state in oklahoma , as in nearly a dozen other states , the law prohibits anyone without a funeral director s license from selling a coffin critics say the policy is meant to protect the interests of funeral homes last year , ms powers sued the state , arguing that the law violates , among other things , her right to economic liberty under the united states constitution s privileges or immunities clause in december , a federal district court in oklahoma ruled against ms powers , observing the longstanding practice of federal courts to defer to the judgment of state legislatures when the lawmakers regulate nonfundamental rights , like those involving working conditions or the right to earn a living \( as opposed to fundamental rights , like the right to privacy \) ms powers and the organization that is representing her , the institute for justice , a libertarian advocacy group in washington , are appealing the case to the united states court of appeals for the 10th circuit in denver a similar case brought by the institute for justice on behalf of a noninternet coffin seller in tennessee could help ms powers s cause in that case , in which the plaintiff is challenging a law that is nearly identical to oklahoma s , a federal district court struck down the tennessee regulation , saying it served no legitimate governmental purpose tennessee s attorney general has yet to decide whether to appeal to the united states supreme court even though the oklahoma law prevents ms powers from selling coffins in the state and has cost the company time and money , she said the publicity had been helpful our business has always been very good in other areas , like markers and monuments , she said but since we brought this case , our coffin business has more than quadrupled while buying coffins online may be a way for consumers to save money , it may not necessarily be the best thing for the newly bereaved , according to robert m fells , general counsel of the national funeral directors association mr fells , who said his group was just fine with allowing independent coffin sellers to operate online , said grief counseling experts advised people to visit funeral homes in person to help select coffins or urns as a way to ease the grieving process yet , he said , more and more , instead of going to the funeral home , people are saying , 'i do n't need that i 'll email you' photo dean magliocca , president of funeral depot , at his hallandale beach , fla , store the coffins range in price from 745 to 18 , 500 \( cindy karp for the new york times \)
trenton for filmmakers , planning a shoot is all about the three l s location , location , location when a ski scene calls for a winter mountain , they converge on aspen if neon and slots are the order , they go to las vegas and if they need a good prison , more and more often , they come to new jersey none of the prisons in the state have the sinister ring of alcatraz none of them sound ironically cheerful in english , the way sing sing does in fact , the prisons formerly known as rahway and trenton state have not sounded interesting at all since the mid1980 s , when their names were sterilized to east jersey state prison and new jersey state prison respectively but that has not kept hollywood from calling over the years , a spate of wellknown films has been shot here , and now three new documentaries are swelling the ranks of the new jersey jail genre in how do you spell murder \? , a film that made its debut as part of cinemax s reel life series last month , inmates at the east jersey state prison in rahway teach each other how to read prisoners guide each other through the slow literacy process with patience that borders on tenderness the film was directed by alan and susan raymond and shot over a series of 68 visits also set at new jersey state prison was a new student film , fatal mistakes , featuring an unprecedented interview with a death row inmate , robert marshall the state tried to subpoena raw film of the interview conceived as a statement against capital punishment , fatal mistakes is better known for the drama it sparked when the american civil liberties union helped jason kitchen , a 22yearold filmmaker , win his battle in court a third documentary , going home , also made its debut on cinemax last month shot at the edna mahan correctional facility for women in clinton , it grew out of steven kalafer s visit to an inmate behavioral program called the life skills academy the film focuses on inmates struggling with issues from motherhood to recidivism eighty percent of the women at edna mahan are mothers when incarcerated others give birth in jail some have unfortunate reunions with daughters , who end up joining them behind bars film from visiting day , when hordes of expectant children pass through the gates to see their mothers , is particularly unsettling so why do filmmakers come to prisons in new jersey \? it could be that the unusual programs for inmates lure the cameras or , in the case of fatal mistakes , that undergraduates from rowan university in glassboro do not have the freedom or the finances to go elsewhere whatever the logic , these three films are heir to a distinguished tradition the new jersey jail genre harkens back to a single documentary , scared straight ! released in 1978 , the film features longterm inmates calling themselves the lifers who tell cautionary tales of life behind bars while berating and humiliating a group of cocky juvenile offenders as the film title suggests , the inmates hope to scare the youths out of delinquency but there was a second , unintended , consequence with scenes full of echoing corridors and catwalks , scared straight ! was the first film to put east jersey state prison , still better known as rahway , on the map if you want to film a prison , that s a prison to film at , said bill halk , describing the amenities at east jersey state with a touch of envy mr halk is the associate administrator at the edna mahan correctional facility for women , where the scenery is less intimidating you 've got the dome , you 've got the gates before long , three subsequent scared straight ! productions brought film back to east jersey state there were 10 and 20year specials to check in with the convicts and the former kids , and later , a music video for a song by the lifers the song was a rap number called lifers group world tour rahway prison , that s it because , for the men who wrote it , prison was the whole world the video was nominated for a grammy award in 1992 , pitting the lifers none of whom could attend awards night against the likes of madonna , sinead o'connor , billy joel and peter gabriel by 1992 the new jersey prison craze had taken hold now the distinguished roster of films includes the slasher flick maniac cop sylvester stallone s lock up crazy joe , rounders and ocean s eleven denzel washington seems to have a particular fondness for new jersey s penal institutions , and contributed three more films to the list malcolm x , he got game and the hurricane so how to explain the craze \? some filmmakers say that the prisons in new jersey are just plain frightening the only prison that i 've seen that s scarier than rahway is trenton , said arnold shapiro , the director and producer of scared straight ! and mr shapiro is an expert his films have brought him to many other prisons , including arizona state , nevada state , san quentin , and allenwood in pennsylvania , where he shot a 1993 documentary called bad dads with george foreman but for him , none of them top trenton state , now known as new jersey state prison , which dates to 1831 and is the oldest continuously operating prison in the united states still other filmmakers defer to the lure of east jersey state prison , the rahway of original scared straight ! fame when we first started scouting it , we went there a number of times , said mark kamine , location manager for the hurricane , which was shot there it s a scary place mr kamine added that east jersey state was also attractive to him because its staff had experience with cinema for places that have n't had film shoots , you can get very easily at cross purposes , and these guys really knew what would happen , he said of course , it helps when wardens know what to expect from filmmakers but often , it is harder for filmmakers to adjust to the rules and routines of prison when mr kitchen went to film fatal mistakes at new jersey state prison , he was surprised to learn that because of rules governing capital offenders , robert marshall would remain behind bars for the duration of his interview i was under the impression that we were going to have a contact visit , that i could get next to him and we could get any angle we wanted , mr kitchen said they allowed us to put the camera inside of the cage , but no one could go in there with it the result was a single , mediumdepth view of mr marshall , which remains in the same position throughout the interview lt randy sandkuhl , who has worked at east jersey state prison for 28 years , says prison visitors are often surprised when prison reality does not live up to the cinematic stereotype not everyone is locked up 24 hours a day , lieutenant sandkuhl said they do n't wear striped suits and carry balls and chains and even filmmakers end up learning something unexpected along the way when we were filming scared straight ! ' we were out in the yard , which is the most dangerous place that you can film , mr shapirosaid you 've got hundreds and hundreds of men lifting weights , running the track , boxing , doing all sorts of physical activity when mr shapiro s camera crew lingered a moment too long in the yard , they ended up reentering the prison with a tide of inmates without an escort they received a lesson in science and humanity as we 're coming in , i pick up a conversation that s happening behind me between two inmates , mr shapiro said it begins like this 'in einstein s e equals mc squared , you have mr shapiro paused , then brightened , that broke a stereotype photos new jersey state prison , where sergio r is student in a literacy program , and east jersey state prison , where denzel washington went on location for the hurricane \( photos by alan raymond above george kraychyk \)
in richard greenberg s take me out , which is currently on broadway , denis o'hare plays mason marzac , a hapless , gay money manager who suddenly has as his client the fabulous darren lemming , a baseball superstar who has publicly declared his own homosexuality in this scene , mason , who has started watching the game for the first time , muses on its meaning i have come \( with no little excitement \) to understand that baseball is a perfect metaphor for hope in a democratic society it has to do with the rules of play it has to do with the mode of enforcement of these rules it has to do with certain nuances and grace notes of the game first , it s the remarkable symmetry of everything all those threes and multiples of three calling attention to virtually making a fetish of the game s noble equality equality , that is , of opportunity everyone is given exactly the same chance and the opportunity to exercise that chance at his own pace there s none of the scurry , none of that relentlessness that marks other games basketball , football or hockey i 've never watched basketball , football or hockey , but i'm sure i would n't like them or maybe i would but it would n't be the same what i mean is , in baseball there s no clock what could be more generous than to give everyone all these opportunities and the time to seize them in , as well \? and with each turn at the plate , there s the possibility of turning the situation to your favor down to the very last try and then , to insure that everything remains fair , justices are ranged around the park to witness and assess the play and if the justice errs , an appeal can be made it s invariably turned down , but that s part of what makes the metaphor so right because even in the most wellmeant systems , error is inevitable even within the fairest of paradigms , unfairness will creep in and baseball is better than democracy or at least than democracy as it s practiced in this country because unlike democracy , baseball acknowledges loss while conservatives tell you , leave things alone and no one will lose , and liberals tell you , interfere a lot and no one will lose , baseball says , someone will lose not only says it insists upon it ! so that baseball achieves the tragic vision that democracy evades evades and embodies democracy is lovely , but baseball s more mature
leonardo da vinci enjoys greater name recognition than almost any other artist his interests ranged from music and anatomy to art and the occult his uncanny ability to predict inventions like the airplane , and the rarity and enigmatic nature of his few finished paintings , conjure up the very image of the renaissance man controversial in life , leonardo still provokes a bewildering range of admirers and detractors no other artist is burdened with such baggage , but then , the ambiguity and gaps in our knowledge render him a blank sheet onto which almost anything can be projected that dan brown s thriller the da vinci code has successfully tapped into popular interest in leonardo is resoundingly confirmed by its 18 weeks on the new york times bestseller list in the book , the author unabashedly adapts leonardo s art and theories , which he says on his web site he researched extensively , to his own fictional requirements the discovery of a murdered louvre curator , found in the pose of leonardo s celebrated vitruvian man a figure inscribed in both a circle and a square sets in motion an ingenious plot involving numerological symbolism , verbal puzzles and an alternative version of christianity , wrapped up in the legend of the holy grail even opus dei , the controversial roman catholic movement , surfaces here as a shadowy force , struggling to acquire this potentially explosive information it is all carried off with aplomb , but it also leaves readers wondering how much does this murder mystery have to do with the real leonardo \? the short answer is not much , and the author s grasp of the historical leonardo is shaky one small but telling point comes in mr brown s references to leonardo as da vinci , as if that were the painter s last name , yet it is no surname but simply a reference to the fact that he was the illegitimate son of ser piero of vinci , in the florentine territory like other great artists , with or without last names , leonardo is invariably referred to by his given name and not by da vinci the nomenclature suggests a lack of familiarity with the copious bibliography on the painter , as do mr brown s references to leonardo s enormous output of christian art and hundreds of lucrative vatican commissions leonardo was , in fact , notorious for his meager production and spent little time in rome neither , for that matter , is it accurate to call leonardo a flamboyant homosexual despite a charge of sodomy against him as a young man , the evidence of his sexual orientation remains inconclusive and fragmentary it is also breathtaking to read that the heroine , sophie neveu , uses one of leonardo s paintings , the madonna of the rocks , as a shield , pressing it so close to her body that it bends more than six feet tall and painted on wood , not canvas , the madonna is unlikely to be so supple but that may be poetic license on mr brown s part even the legendary connoisseur bernard berenson was uncertain whether leonardo painted on wood or canvas if mr brown s approach to leonardo is rather broadbrushed , so is his concept of academe the hero , robert langdon , is a professor of symbology , which seems to be the study of symbolism with a dash of numerology thrown in the reader is treated to examples of langdon s lectures in one , the vitruvian man becomes a vehicle for explaining the divine proportion , or golden section , as a fundamental building block of nature this concept was popular in the renaissance and derived from a treatise by the ancient roman architect marcus vitruvius many artists drew the vitruvian man , hoping that it would unlock the secret relationship between the microcosm of man and the macrocosm of the world just how the figure relates to the golden section and its occurrence in art and architecture is never made explicit , but langdon seems to have read some dubious texts , fashionable in the last century , by the german writer adolf zeising and his followers , who saw the golden section everywhere in reality , leonardo s beliefs on the subject are far from clear although he went through a phase of believing that anatomy could be reduced to mathematical certainty , he eventually realized that the relationship between mathematics and art was not straightforward the concept of the vitruvian man was an arresting image but ultimately a fudge elsewhere , our hero lectures to a group of prisoners about the mona lisa there the old canard about the portrait as leonardo in drag appears , and according to langdon , this is a subtle message of androgyny , strengthened by computerized analysis of the painting and selfportraits of the artist again , we know that the sitter was a woman from contemporary documents , and that contrary to popular opinion , there are no definitively documented images of leonardo but the malefemale fusion of the mona lisa is important in the da vinci code , since the plot centers on the quest for the grail and its true nature in mr brown s telling , the grail is not the medieval sangreal , the chalice from which jesus drank at the last supper , but rather a metaphor for the sacred feminine and a form of goddess worship suppressed by christianity at the center of the book , langdon and a crusty old english knight give an impromptu lecture in which leonardo s last supper in milan is exhibit a

washington , feb 3 when all the proposals are tallied in the budget president bush submitted today , they amount to the most ambitious changes in government operations that any president has put forward in decades beyond its scope , the budget differs from those of other recent presidents in two important ways nowhere does mr bush make balancing the budget an important goal and he makes no claim that the era of big government is over , or even nearing an end this is a president of big projects and big ideas , his budget director , mitchell e daniels jr , said today contrast that with the assertion of mr bush s father in his inaugural address in 1989 that we have more will than wallet paying no heed to the notion of a balanced budget , mr bush advocates deep tax cuts on top of the large ones enacted two years ago by contrast , when big deficits began to appear after president ronald reagan drove tax cuts through congress in 1981 , mr reagan approved offsetting tax increases mr bush proposes adding a medicare entitlement , prescription drug coverage but he also proposes enticing retirees into private insurance plans , a big step that other republican presidents have surely dreamed of but never taken he also wants to change medicaid so that many poor people , including some in nursing homes , will no longer be guaranteed benefits the president proposes doubling spending next year for domestic security , including new money for the largest new federal department since the defense department was created after world war ii military spending would rise sharply over the next five years much of the new money would be spent for disputable initiatives like a missile defense system and futuristic ships all this does not take account of the billions of dollars that would be needed to fight a war against iraq and it does not assume any big changes in social security , despite the president s call in his state of the union address last week to make social security more like a private pension except for the first two years of bill clinton s presidency , this is the first time in more than 20 years that a budget has been submitted for a fiscal year in which both houses of congress will be controlled by the president s party no doubt , that will be an advantage for mr bush no one is saying this budget is dead on arrival , the term given to most of the budgets offered by mr bush s three most recent predecessors , who generally faced at least one house of congress controlled by the opposition party in his first two years in the white house , when he did have a democratic congress , mr clinton failed miserably when he tried to push a few ambitious measures , most notably his plan for universal health insurance congress , it was widely said at the time , could not deal with such an extensive undertaking partly as a consequence , republicans won the house and senate in the 1994 elections for the rest of his presidency , mr clinton limited his budget requests to bitesize pieces like encouraging schoolchildren to wear uniforms and cracking down on deadbeat fathers this downsizing of presidential ambition proved to be popular politically , and mr clinton was reelected with ease of course , it is impossible to say whether mr bush will be thwarted by congressional overload if the country goes to war , congress might be too distracted to deal with his bold plans or the distraction could mean that some proposals that are not particularly popular could slip through without much attention being paid the early line is that congress will initially balk at the president s spending priorities large spending increases for the military , domestic security and veterans and not much new money for anything else but eventually adopt the priorities more or less intact taxes are another matter some form of tax reduction will probably be adopted and it will probably be sufficiently like what the president proposed that he can call it the bush tax cut when he runs for reelection next year but the centerpiece of his proposal , an elimination of the income tax for individuals on most stock dividends , has been received with little enthusiasm in congress interviews with a range of lawmakers found none willing to say they thought that this was the best way to use the 364 billion that mr bush wants to allot for the cut it is too early to gauge the congressional response to plans disclosed late last week for new forms of savings accounts in which money would accumulate taxfree and be available for withdrawal without penalty the details of the president s medicare proposal have not been completed but even without prescription drug coverage , medicare is , along with social security , the most popular government program ever devised any president who tries to dismantle it is taking a huge risk mr bush apparently has no intention of pushing any time soon for one of his boldest plans allowing workers to use part of their social security taxes to set up private investment accounts that would cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the first few years alone , and the new budget has no money set aside for the next five years mr daniels said this morning , a balanced federal budget remains a high priority for this president but unlike the submissions of recent predecessors , this budget describes no plans to reach that goal in all the years when large deficits were a fact of life , republican politicians and conservative economists could advocate a balanced budget with no hope that the goal would be reached but confident that steps in that direction would lead to less government spending but when surpluses began to appear in the late 1990 s , these politicians and economists became less enamored of the concept of balance , and mr bush apparently was no exception it is wrong to build surpluses , because these surpluses lead to higher spending , said john f cogan , a top budget official in the reagan and first bush administrations who is now an economist at the hoover institution governments cannot hang onto money representative jim nussle , the iowa republican who is chairman of the house budget committee , made a similar point the goal of a balanced budget , mr nussle said , is no longer the holy grail that it once was
london , may 26 shareholders in britain are wielding new voting rights to register their objections to hefty executive pay packages and their next target may be an american , william f aldinger iii , the former chief executive of household international , who sold the company to the british bank hsbc group in november for 142 billion as part of the deal , mr aldinger s contract with household was terminated , although he was hired as head of hsbc s operations in the united states under a very similar pay package the termination prompted a onetime payout of 203 million mr aldinger s new threeyear deal with hsbc guarantees him 5 million in cash and bonuses per year , plus an additional 205 million worth of shares over the period , unless he is fired for cause or decides to retire without good reason none of the compensation is linked to the company s performance , says stuart bell , director of research for pensions investment research consultants , or pirc , a londonbased shareholder advisory board pirc has advised shareholders to vote against mr aldinger s pay package at hsbc s annual meeting on friday mr bell also objects to the 203 million payout to mr aldinger that came after the deal was completed there was n't really termination of employment , he said it was just sleight of hand the trades union congress , britain s largest labor group , also objects to mr aldinger s guaranteed payouts on saturday , the group urged pension managers controlling hsbc stock to oppose the pay package and wrote in an email message to 1 , 000 pension fund trustees this is our money our pension funds and insurance policies should be invested in a way that supports good businesses not platinum parachutes for failing directors an amendment to the corporate governance act in january has empowered shareholders here it requires public corporations that have holding companies registered in britain to disclose executive compensation packages and then put them to a vote at their annual meetings while the vote is nonbinding , it carries weight here because of its ability to chastise publicly corporations and their leaders glaxosmithkline shareholders proved this month that the amendment had teeth when they narrowly voted down the pay package for the chief executive , jeanpierre garnier , mainly because of a midsize \( by american standards \) 237 million golden parachute he will receive no matter how the company performs to appease shareholders , the glaxo board is being restructured , and mr garnier s package will be reevaluated though most of the outcry came originally from british labor unions and shareholder rights activists , american fund managers , including the giant california public employees' retirement system , ultimately joined the side opposed to mr garnier s deal the trades union congress is also calling for companies to make voting records public several large british fund managers abstained from the vote at glaxo , and at least one voted in favor of the pay deal , the labor group said because voting records are private , individual pension holders will be unable to tell if their savings have been used to support featherbedding for executives , the labor group said hsbc is not the only company that may yet come under fire in the annual meeting season pirc is also encouraging shareholders of tesco , a large british grocery chain , to vote against a bigger severance package for its chief executive , terry leahy kingfisher , a large british retailing company , is revising the pay packages for its top executives before its june 4 meeting , in part to avoid the kind of public humiliation that glaxo suffered a hefty package for an hsbc executive is especially notable because the bank has always had a reputation for thriftiness sir john bond , the bank s chairman , did not pay cash bonuses in 2001 , and gave employees stock instead he often flies economy class and takes the subway to work the value of bonuses , salaries and benefits given to hsbc s top 5 executives and 19 directors in 2002 was 146 million , according to the bank s annual report hsbc says that the payments to mr aldinger are so large in part because he is an american he s a talented executive , and he s been given a package similar to what he s on already , said an hsbc spokesman , jamie harley it is comparable to what his peers get in the united states this latest shareholder vote is fueling a longsimmering debate over what constitutes appropriate compensation for an executive the american standard of receiving tens of millions of dollars a year is still quietly viewed in britain as a bit unseemly , even for the successful leader of a large company salaries for top executives here are about onethird of those in the united states staples of american pay packages , like multimilliondollar stock bonuses linked to duration on the job , rather than performance , or cushy severance packages , are unheardof money , after all , is not a top executive s only reward one might have thought having the responsibility of running a major business would be an extraordinarily satisfying thing to do by itself , says richard singleton , director of corporate governance for isis asset management in london , which controls 95 billion in assets isis voted against glaxo s pay package still , as some british corporations go head to head against american competitors , they have begun to adopt americanstyle severance and bonus packages some executives , including the glaxo chairman , sir christopher hogg , argue that for companies based here to attract top talent , they need to be able to compete with american companies on compensation some bankers and top executives fret that a strong shareholder rights policy could dissuade foreign companies from selling out to british firms , and slow down crossborder deals photo payments to william f aldinger iii by the hsbc group have riled some british shareholders \( associated press \)
the mayoral campaign of 2005 remains in the distance , with a full 28 months before any ballots are cast in the party primaries there are already democrats aplenty hoping to succeed mayor michael r bloomberg , but before they tackle him , there is one among their ranks who is creating some pause fernando ferrer mr ferrer , the former bronx borough president , came in first in the democratic primary for mayor two years ago and narrowly lost the runoff for the nomination to mark green but mr ferrer nonetheless came close to assembling a winning coalition of hispanic and black voters in a way that suggested a new chapter had been written in the continuing ethnic and political realignment of new york and those memories remain fresh in the minds of several potential candidates who say that mr ferrer s plans for 2005 will be a factor in their own deliberations mr ferrer , they say , still has a following among many hispanic voters and more than a few black ones and in a democratic primary that could become crowded , he would be a force to reckon with for anyone interested in entering that race as a result , mr ferrer is very much viewed as the wild card among his potential political rivals he is a proven vote getter who has demonstrated that he has a constituency , said one official who asked not to be named because he does not want attention raised about his interest in running for mayor in 2005 and there are n't too many people planning to run for mayor who can say that and anyone who is thinking of running has to take into account what freddy is going to do adolfo carri n jr , who is mr ferrer s successor as borough president and whose name is often mentioned as a possible mayoral candidate , made it even clearer if freddy called me tomorrow and said he was running , i would be behind him 100 percent , said mr carri n , who has already registered as a potential candidate for citywide office with the campaign finance board if he called and said he was n't running , that would open up an entirely new conversation about what i might do mr ferrer , 53 , maintains that he has not begun to make decisions about a campaign that will not begin in earnest for another year after 25 years of public service , how could i not think about it now \? asked mr ferrer , who is president of the drum major institute for public policy , a nonprofit foundation on the other hand , that election is still a ways off and i have not made any firm decisions while he may be cautious in forecasting his plans or even his leanings mr ferrer often sounds like a candidate , particularly when discussing the job performance of mr bloomberg he s made some mistakes , mr ferrer said the biggest one was getting rolled over by the governor and the city deserves better than that specifically , mr ferrer portrayed mr bloomberg as playing too cozily with gov george e pataki , a fellow republican , to the detriment of the city i think the mayor made some miscalculations , one of which was trusting the governor and so , for example , the consideration of the commuter tax is effectively off the table now while he said the mayor s seizing control of the city s public school system was commendable , mr ferrer added , i'm concerned about the biggest changes in policy in more than 100 years in public education in this city and big budget decisions are being made without public review or public discussion between intermittent jabs at mr bloomberg s stewardship , mr ferrer has continued to have a hand in politics and in the civic affairs of new york city , which has helped to stoke curiosity about his mayoral ambitions he continues to make the rounds of political dinners and has consistently made political endorsements he has not , however , raised any campaign funds , a critical element in the calculus of any mayoral aspirant by comparison , gifford miller , the city council speaker who is seen as a likely candidate for the 2005 democratic nomination for mayor , has raised more than 1 million and william c thompson , the city comptroller , has raised nearly 500 , 000 neither of those two officials has announced plans to seek the democratic nomination but each has made it clear to friends and potential supporters that he expects to do so others who are widely viewed as potential candidates are the manhattan borough president , c virginia fields , assemblyman brian m mclaughlin of queens and united states representative anthony d weiner , who represents parts of brooklyn and queens but with the exception of mr thompson , none of these potential aspirants have run a citywide campaign , as mr ferrer has done on two occasions furthermore , the former bronx borough president is still viewed as the preeminent politician among the city s fastgrowing hispanic population mr ferrer s candidacy for the mayoral nomination in 2001 caused a surge in hispanic voter participation , challenging traditional thinking about political involvement in new york city at the same time , he won more than twothirds of the black vote running for mayor is not an entrylevel job , except for people with several billion dollars , said john h mollenkopf , director of the center for urban research at the graduate center of the city university of new york you need name recognition , the ability to raise funds and the ability to run a campaign , mr mollenkopf said and when you already have those credentials , like ferrer , you 're someone who has to factor in the decision of others who want to run in the meantime , mr ferrer himself insists that there is no reason to ponder a mayoral candidacy anytime soon his work at the drum major institute keeps him involved with people who discuss and study public policy and provides him a forum to speak out on whatever issues he chooses when asked how he feels about being someone whom other potential candidates are watching as a significant factor in the 2005 mayoral race , mr ferrer said i'm flattered but i have no idea what the future holds and for now , i just want to add to the discourse of issues that affect this city photo many politicians are waiting to see if fernando ferrer , the former bronx borough president , will seek the democratic nomination for new york city mayor in 2005 he lost in a runoff to mark green in 2001 \( librado romero the new york times \)
baghdad , iraq , may 10 a team of experts searching for evidence of biological and chemical weapons in iraq has concluded that a trailer found near mosul in northern iraq in april is a mobile biological weapons laboratory , the three team members said today describing their fourday examination of the lab for the first time and on the condition of anonymity , the members of the chemical biological intelligence support teamcharlie , or team charlie , said they had based their conclusion on a thorough examination of the graygreen trailer , with the help of british experts and a few american soldiers the members acknowledged that some experts were still uncertain whether the trailer was intended to produce biological agents but they said they were persuaded that it was a mobile lab for biological production the team leader said that the lab contained equipment that could be used to make vaccines , drugs and other peaceful pathogens , as well as deadly germs for weapons , and that iraq had therefore been obliged to disclose possession of such equipment to international inspectors before the war the failure to disclose such equipment is a clear violation of united nations sanctions and an indication of ill intent , said the team leader , a 20year veteran of special operations forces and explosive ordnance work and a nuclear weapons expert he contended that this could be construed as the kind of smoking gun that his team was charged with finding to substantiate the bush administration s allegations that iraq was making biological and chemical weapons other american experts say they believe that teams hunting for biological and chemical weapons may now have located parts of three mobile labs , military and civilian officials said today those experts said that in addition to the mosul trailer and another one found recently in northern iraq , a smaller trailer was discovered last week by american forces near baghdad they said the smaller trailer , like the one near mosul , had been taken to baghdad international airport for further examination the experts also said they believed that based on intelligence information , there might be as many as eight mobile labs in iraq , adding that the locations of the other five have not yet been determined some members of another team of weapons experts and intelligence officials arrived in baghdad today to survey the labs at the airport and gather additional information about their operation and purpose pentagon officials sent the team to check the initial test results , and if they find they are accurate , to help assemble an ironclad technical case that would counter alternative , peaceful explanations for the trailers some scientists say the trailers could have been used for peaceful purposes , like biopesticide production , but none of them have seen the labs or talked to the experts who reject such contentions all three team charlie members said they were certain that future tests would confirm that the trailer was evidence of a weapons program the team also said they had found a substance in the lab s fermenting machine , which they declined to identify officials in washington , reached by telephone , said they believed that the team had found growth media that might have been used to culture germs more lab tests on the samples are being conducted in the united states and britain , which assisted team charlie in its examination , officials said the team also found that the lab had been cleaned with a caustic agent ammonia or bleach we never expected to find positive samples of pathogens , the team s biological specialist said but to prove that the lab could make biological agents , you do n't need to find such agents the members of the team work for the defense intelligence agency as part the 75th exploitation task force , which has been responsible for the search for unconventional weapons team members said their investigation showed that the lab was partly assembled under the noses of international inspectors a new inspection agency , known as the united nations monitoring and verification commission , returned to iraq late last year after its predecessor agency was forced to leave the country in 1998 the agency conducted inspections in iraq with many restrictions until just before the war the team s chemical expert , a 34yearold former marine , said the team had found identification plates on equipment inside the trailer that had dates from 2000 to 2002 while most of the equipment in the lab was iraqi in origin , some of it was from foreign sources , the team leader said , describing it as generic equipment that could have been easily ordered from several different places the team declined to identify the countries that had supplied such equipment the members said another indication that the lab was part of a biological weapons program was an information plate found on a major piece of equipment from the al nasser company , an iraqi concern that had helped design and equip a major biological weapons plant destroyed after the persian gulf war in 1991

cambridge , mass errol morris , the documentary filmmaker , sees himself as a compulsive investigator , fascinated by history and he remains obsessed with the vietnam war , an event that affected his own life and generation now he has investigated that traumatic episode in the fog of war eleven lessons from the life of robert s mcnamara , which opened on dec 19 in new york and los angeles mr mcnamara s life is emblematic of the country , mr morris said in an interview it s a familiar american story , a horatio alger story that comes to some twisted end a selfmade man whose parents did n't finish high school , who rises to the very , very top a professor at harvard business school , the president of ford , the secretary of defense in the kennedy and johnson administrations , the president of the world bank you also get the feeling of a person who operated with good intentions , mr morris added , speaking at his production company here , the globe department store , with his french bulldog , jackpot , snoozing nearby in a chair to say that he s devoid of ethical or moral sensibilities , i find that too easy , yet he became mired in some truly , truly horrendous things mr mcnamara , who was 85 when interviewed , talks a lot in the film about world war ii , in which he served with gen curtis e lemay , making decisions that led to the firebombing of japanese cities and the deaths of thousands of civilians he talks about the cuban missile crisis at the end we lucked out it was luck that prevented nuclear war he talks about the vietnam war , including the events leading up to the gulf of tonkin resolution of 1964 , the language of which gave complete authority to the president to take the nation to war while on aggressive patrol , the american destroyer maddox had reported being attacked by two torpedoes fired by north vietnamese boats two days later a second attack was reported involving the maddox and the destroyer c turner joy , although the circumstances of the incident were ambiguous and , as presented in the film , what was believed to be an attack had probably been caused by freak weather effects on radar the question was whether there was sufficient evidence to justify president lyndon b johnson s action in calling for the tonkin gulf resolution in talking about the tonkin gulf , mr morris was improbably reminded of his second film , vernon , florida , set in the panhandle vernon features quirky characters like a turkey hunter paddling his boat around in a swamp wishing there were as many turkeys out there as there were buzzards and a couple who show the camera a jar of sand , which they believe is growing there s a richness of themes there that capture a lot of my thinking , mr morris said life being a kind of dream , an odd quest , a strange hopefulness that inhabits people believing in a second attack in the gulf of tonkin with the possibility that none occurred is like wishing there were more turkeys out there , said mr morris , whose curiosity is relentless and , he will add , obsessive the fog of war reflects the sensibility of someone who came of age in the 1960 s and demonstrated against the vietnam war he studied physics , history and philosophy , attending princeton , berkeley and the university of wisconsin , the last two known hotbeds of student radicalism now 55 , he lives peaceably in cambridge with his wife and son he has interviewed a diverse spectrum of subjects from stephen hawking in a brief history of time to a man wrongly convicted of murder in the thin blue line to the designer of execution devices who serves as a witness for holocaust deniers in mr death the rise and fall of fred a leuchter jr his latest film , the fog of war , is stylish images from vietnam are not the usual ones memos and documents from world war ii written in mr mcnamara s hand illustrate the narrative eerie music by philip glass is affecting \( if you 're looking for existential dread , look no further , mr morris said philip glass is your man \) mr mcnamara digresses , laughs at himself , cries when he remembers helping to pick out a grave site in arlington cemetery for president john f kennedy i have this style of letting people talk , of not having a specific agenda , not knowing what you 're going to hear , he said along the way , mr mcnamara makes some startling statements the one that has gotten the most attention is his memory of a conversation with general lemay during world war ii lemay said , 'if we 'd lost the war , we 'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals' and i think he s right but what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win \? speaking by phone from washington , mr mcnamara still sounds a little surprised that he actually agreed to do the film he called the whole idea insane for 40 years i 've been doing tv , and i 've never done anything like this , mr mcnamara said he agreed to a onehour interview for the documentary , which became 2 , then 8 and finally 24 i do n't think he had a particular story line , he said of mr morris we just talked errol s such an extraordinary , interesting conversationalist but mr mcnamara said he liked the film , and the two have appeared together at the telluride film festival and on charlie rose this is not just a film about mcnamara , said peter hall , who teaches political science at the center for european studies at harvard and is a friend of mr morris i think it s a film about moral confusion it s a rumination on the human condition mcnamara is the original whiz kid from the american automobile industry , a statistician in world war ii his natural instincts seems to be to seek guidance from the facts but he discovers that in the midst of war it s not clear what is a fact and what is not a fact and that facts provide no clear guide to moral action mr morris said his feelings about the war had not changed i found it appalling then , and i find it appalling now but mr mcnamara , whom he s grown to like and talks to often , is engaged in a deep question 'am i a good man or a bad man \? what does my life mean \? ' to those who think that mr mcnamara is not tortured about the past , mr morris said , i would respectfully disagree one of the things i find deeply fascinating about mcnamara s account , his life in public service , is the element of caprice , he added on the one hand people believe everything is directed , everything is controlled my own two cents' worth of opinion is that most things are deeply out of control photo robert s mcnamara , left , and the filmmaker errol morris \( photo by associated press \)
it s an early , overcast weekend morning the house is quiet our block is quiet it s still dark outside , and perhaps there are hours of sleep left before anyone gets up as i'm about to shut my eyes again , i try to guess what the weather is like behind the blinds but the silence no patter of rain , no splash of car tires along the streets already tells me what i do n't want to know it s not raining outside at best , just drizzling they said it would rain all day today , and i had gone to bed relishing the picture of late autumnal showers all over manhattan and on the empty fields of wards island and central park and riverside park and dykman field on every inch of land claimed by the west side soccer league i even went to bed expecting a wakeup call breaking the catastrophic news in clipped , takeitlikeaman syllables soccer canceled ! to which i had already rehearsed the strained , doleful response i 'd affect before hanging up and shouting a triumphant yessss ! ! now , there s to be soccer all day long and it s cold outside and , let s face it it s not dawn any longer and , to make things worse , it s my turn to bring snacks for my twins' team and since brilliant me never buys anything ahead of time , i 'll have to rush to the supermarket and shop for odd snacks and hope none of the other parents complain , especially those healthfreak , dogooder couples who gently manage to persuade the other parents that we should all really try bringing oranges , preferably cut in four , and plenty of juice , of course , preferably rich in vitamin c on a morning like this , junk food will do just fine i like to watch how these caring parents , holding starbucks grandes with both hands , sidle up to me and ever so discreetly throw sidelong glances into my bag only to find two dozen krispy kreme doughnuts staring at them in their face ! no one in my family is a soccer fanatic we joined because everyone else joined because everyone said that children in manhattan need to let off steam and have fun for a change plus do n't they look cute running around in their little uniforms \? and the game teaches them teamwork and selfdiscipline , and at the end of the eight or so weeks , there s even an awards ceremony in a jampacked public school auditorium where every child gets a trophy , a handshake and a slice of pizza nobody tells you that many of the coaches do nothing but shout and care nothing about the game except winning nor do they tell you about the referees who strut about the fields in their regulationblack uniforms like implacable mothers superior whose mission in life is to blow their whistles when your child s foot or , worse yet , your own strays on the wrong side of the line and no one will say anything about all the parents who brave the coldest weather , lug the heaviest snacks and find the dampest spot to sit on , confident that therein lies the essence of good parenting and good sportsmanship i 've grown to hate the soccer scene and yet , of all the sports i have played in my life , this is the one i loved the most not a day went by in my childhood when i did n't play soccer is in my blood literally for i 've hurt myself and bled for soccer as a child more than for anything else but the game has changed it used to last hours back then , not a measly four 15minute segments manhattan cannot be host to pickup soccer games ours were improvised games that started with seven or so players , one goal and one goalie for both teams , and then inevitably swelled to 20 and more by the end , with people constantly changing sides parents never came we did n't have referees , and if we did , they almost never mattered , because far better to keep the ball rolling than stop the action outs were easily overlooked hand balls more often than not forgiven there were fights but no one stopped the clock there was no clock there was no whistle all that mattered was speed , cunning and endless passion for the game of course you would n't guess i 'd ever kicked a soccer ball before once i bring my twins to the park , the last thing i want is for people to suspect i know anything about the game how to dribble , how to kick , how to fake kicks , and above all , the one thing no one even dreams of teaching you , even though it is the heart and soul of soccer how to pass i do n't want to be asked to practice shots with the children , and i certainly do n't want to be asked to be a linesman i arrive with a wad of paper on a clipboard affecting the totally distracted air of a writer who is very much on deadline i stay away from everyone i watch the boys huddle no one ever huddled in soccer and i watch them listen to meaningless bromides like watch the ball \( a baseball obsession \) and focus , focus , focus \( an attentiondeficit mantra imported from the classroom onto the playing field \) this morning , before leaving our home , we 'll probably have another crisis regarding a missing shin guard thenthere 'll be the shoelace that is so gnarled up in generations of old knots that the only way to undo it is to use the tine of a fork and all the patience and concentration of a master safecracker in between these minicrises come the larger ones a red gelatinous glob sits on one of my sons' regulationyellow shirts he has pilfered one of the jelly doughnuts and in his haste to gulp it down has managed to splatter the jelly on his shirt he is now spreading it all over with his finger in a lastditch effort to hide the evidence on our way out , i'm already making a list of possible brushfires the coach who knows so little about soccer , ditto the referee , the east side mother who s taking her son to a met matinee after the game and needs to tell everyone about it , the doting father who s videotaped every game of the season and ca n't believe you have n't and yet there is a moment , and it hardly lasts 10 seconds , as i watch the boys play and am sitting by myself in the perfect stillness of an early saturday morning , when it all comes back to me this game that is like no other , that never stops once it starts , that is forever linked to the presence of grass grass you fall on , grass stains on your clothes , grass whose smell stays on your skin all day grass you lie sprawled on as you rest a moment and become one with the earth , the sky , and the voice of your teammates weaving in and out of earshot , reaching you as though from light years away and then suddenly the game comes to life , when you 'd run as fast as you could , dribbled as deftly and as cunningly as your legs allowed , and then that crowning moment , when from some unknown brilliant impulse you did something as selfless as pass a ball to someone and then , from the corner of your eye , you saw him pass it back to you , and you knew , you simply knew , before even kicking the ball again , that you 'd score a goal , and that what had happened on the field just now between one teammate and another was the closest soccer would ever come to love i think back to these days and wonder whether the met mother or energybarcrunching dad would ever understand why i sit away from them they probably suspect i 'll just never get the game drawing \( drawing by john hendrix \)
deep in the recesses of the human heart , lurking guiltily beneath the threshold of consciousness , there may lie a depraved craving for the forbidden taste of human flesh the basis for this morbid accusation , made by a team of researchers in london , is a genetic signature , found almost worldwide , that points to a long history of cannibalism the signature is one that protects the bearer from infection by prions , proteins that can be transmitted in infected meat and attack the nerve cells of the brain prions can be acquired from eating infected animals , as in the case of the mad cow disease that in 1996 spread to people in england , but they spread even more easily through eating infected humans this fact is known from study of the fore , a tribe in the eastern highlands of papua new guinea that started to practice ritual cannibalism at the end of the 19th century dr d carleton gajdusek , who later received a nobel prize for his work , noticed that the fore were being devastated by a neurodegenerative disease known as kuru he linked it with their practice of eating the brains of their dead in mortuary feasts when the feasts were banned by australian authorities in the mid1950 s , the incidence of kuru declined , and no cases have appeared in anyone born after that time the fore became of particular interest to researchers studying prion diseases at university college , london in a report today in the journal science , dr simon mead , dr john collinge and colleagues say they analyzed dna from 30 elderly fore women who had participated in many cannibal feasts before they were banned most of these survivors of the kuru epidemic had a particular genetic signature , which was much less common in the younger population , indicating that it conferred substantial protection against the disease in support of this assumption , none of the patients who have contracted the human version of mad cow disease in britain carry the protective signature the researchers then examined dna from various ethnic groups around the world and found that all but one , the japanese , carried the protective signature to some degree , and that the japanese are protected by a different signature in the same gene various genetic tests showed that the protective genes could not be there by chance , but were a result of natural selection this implies that human populations in the past must have been exposed to some form of prion disease , the researchers say they contend that that prion disease was probably spread by cannibalism besides the example of the fore , there is strong evidence for widespread cannibalistic practices in many prehistoric populations , the researchers say frequent epidemics of prion disease caused by cannibalism in ancient populations would explain the existence of the protective genetic signature in people today , they conclude about half of today s english population has the protective signature , which may be one among several reasons why so few people only 134 in a population of more than 50 million have contracted the human form of mad cow disease , dr mead said an alternative explanation for the protective signature could be that early human populations were exposed to prion disease by eating infectious animals dr mead said he could not rule out that explanation but added that cannibalism seemed more likely the epidemic of kuru among the fore showed how quickly the protective signature could be selected also , there is no animal prion disease that appears to cross the species barrier so easily and dramatically , he said dr mead , a neurologist , said he was studying the kuru epidemic among the fore to learn the incubation time of the disease , a critical factor in predicting how large the cowderived prion disease epidemic is likely to be in england because of the long latency time , some elderly fore continue to come down with kuru dr mead s genetic evidence pointing to widespread cannibalism is likely to influence a longstanding debate among social scientists the subject is controversial because many anthropologists , led by dr william arens of the state university of new york at stony brook , say cannibalism is very rarely practiced , but is much more commonly cited as a slur against enemies the few isolated occurrences in the archaeological record , dr arens said , could have been instances of survival cannibalism , which occurs as an alternative to starvation the genetic signature found by dr mead and his colleagues occurs in the gene that makes the prion protein an abnormal form of the prion protein can make the normal proteins abnormal too , the process that leads to the disease the normal gene itself exists in two versions people who inherit both versions , one from each parent , are protected against prion disease , whereas people who have two copies of either version are susceptible usually natural selection will favor one version of a gene over another the favoring of both versions together is called a balancing selection dr david goldstein , a population geneticist and coauthor of the report , said the genetic evidence alone could not determine whether the balancing selection in the prion gene occurred just once , in the ancestral human population before it left africa , or whether it arose more recently , and many times independently , in each of the world s major population groups
paris , jan 27 habill , habill , habill , chanted tom ford , using the french word for attire , as the fall 2003 men s collections swept out the shabby for the chic but how to dress that is the question that had designers knocking themselves out over the weekend as mere mortals discussed war no matter how coherent and bold many of the shows were , particularly from louis vuitton , dior , yves saint laurent and jean paul gaultier , you had the feeling they took place in a vacuum men , typically the last to flash the cash in a crisis , will want to know why they should change now certainly hedi slimane gave them a reason tonight with a mean dior show i loved it i want everything , said bryan lourd , a hollywood agent , who also praised mr ford s pinstripes and flaring lapels at yves saint laurent nostalgia wormed its way into mr ford s collection in the 1970 s chic of blowdried hair , bugeyed glasses and a silk cravat foaming at the neck and there were times when the clothes looked perversely d j vu , as if the references to the coiffed hair , wide shoulders , elevator heels and pindot velveteen tuxedos were in a 1970 high school yearbook yet , little by little , mr ford is creating a vocabulary at saint laurent men s , where there was none before , with a lean silhouette , the widest lapels in the business and a big belt of glamour mr slimane is of a completely different mind , and the effect of his highly energized show with elton john and catherine deneuve in the front row is to wipe the slate clean even if you do n't see yourself dressed in the style of a german punk rocker , deep in black leather with straps lashed around your hips and chains piled up your wrists mr slimane will at least change your eye he has given his clothes a tougher edge , perhaps owing to the fact that he regularly spends time in berlin , with woven leather shells rising up to the neck , roomy great coats over lowriding leather trousers and a terrific take on the braided military jacket some editors found it hard to fathom how minimalists like mr slimane and helmut lang have become maximalists mr lang also had straps dangling from his clothes , including an unattached zipper and what resembled a parachute harness guests interviewed after the show were equally divided in their opinion , with some praising his avantgarde approach and others questioning what the straps added to the clothes that raf simons , perhaps the most belligerent voice of the fashion underground , sent out an elegant collection of creamy topcoats and suits suggests how real the longing for change is at herm s , the designer v ronique nichanian gave her car coats and skinny corduroy trousers , some in shocking pink , a refreshing hint of 1960 s london , when the young hair boys described by tom wolfe dressed up but no one expressed that unfettered ideal better than marc jacobs he did n't offer much some slouchy car coats , ribbed sweaters and skinny suits with loosened narrow ties but the look was so straightforward in its attitude that it sparkled with rightness besides , with a status label like louis vuitton you do n't need much the label is the point , as mr simons acknowledged when he showed his coats with the label on the sleeve , mimicking a street fad to the stir of celtic music , jean paul gaultier offered his own variation of gangs of new york , and it was a hilarious romp as tanel , a studio assistant and runway favorite , came out in rough leather breaches , dragging a big mink coat mr gaultier made a clever play on the gang theme with sharp tweed suits , highlaced stomper boots and the odd hairy leg breaking through a kilt but the collection had plenty of modern gear , like puffy parkas whatever separate planets men and women occupy , the male sex seems better equipped to laugh at himself , at least on the catwalk even when female models are engaged in something as stupendously silly as the victoria s secret underwear show , they rarely crack a smile you get the feeling they actually believe they 're angels in garter belts and the fact that you rarely see fat women or old women or women whose faces betray character or hard living suggests , too , that adam did n't give eve a funny bone but the men the men at comme des gar ons and yohji yamamoto , anyway , get the joke fashion for men is an innately funny proposition , and the blond adonis type , with or without the blowdried porno hair , simply does n't square with real life rei kawakubo s boiledwool suits at comme des gar ons had a soft , spongy feel the opposite of a stuffed shirt and her models were an intriguing blend of geek and ghoul one even affected a nice sneer , as if to say , arrggh , get me out of here the clothes fit naturally on the body , and probably over time would mold to it like a bespoke suit ms kawakubo has explored tailoring in unconventional ways since the start of her career this time she worked insets of contrasting fabrics into her suits to suggest a tailor s pattern tweed coats had raised , fringed seams , and a loud pair of patchwork pants seemed a comment on conventional countryclub casual though you never can tell with ms kawakubo her collections are a master class in tradition , delivered backward the pimp life as my ideal life , mr yamamoto said after his homage \( if that s the right word \) to the ecstatic street style of pimps in case the message was n't clear , mr yamamoto , who seems as unlikely a candidate for criminal activity as you can imagine , included silver rings that spelled out pimp and yohji across the knuckles one model , who in real life works at the brazilian embassy here , looked like the elderly high roller in ocean s 11 , his jive walk down pat out of his boss leathers , he seemed a courtly old gentleman , mildly fastening his cardigan some guests found it dispiriting that mr yamamoto had resorted to an ethnic stereotype , using a number of large black men and several asians of varying girth and age and , without the pimp motif a wellworn notion he would have been just as effective , if not more , in imparting a sense of scale and macho entitlement it is enough to see aging oak among the youthful saplings the ideal of masculine elegance \( as exemplified by cooper or gable \) has been democratized or diminished by a constant montage of stubblefaced film stars surrounded by their sunglasswearing bodyguards and you have to wonder if mr yamamoto was analyzing how thin the line is between taste and vulgarity , fame and obscurity it should be mentioned that the collection included takes on war and peace , with floral jackets over khaki fatigues maybe it is the threat of war that has caused designers to embrace the ultrainnocence of a privileged boy s life , as dries van noten did in a fine show at a sports club as young fencers clashed swords beforehand , models silently lined up as if for a class portrait were you meant to think of the poets wilfred owen and siegfried sassoon , and the grief of world war i \? inevitably , as the models stepped forward in trench coats , gaiters and regimental vests , khaki tailcoats over tshirts , and bravery ribbons mr van noten kept the mood aloft by treating every garment as a memento , as though he wanted to crowd out a brute thought photos jean paul gaultier s oversize parka and laceup sweater helmut

love by toni morrison 202 pp new york alfred a knopf 2395 no living writer truly benefits from assuming the leaden mantle of greatness the perils are many it may be that the road of excess leads , as blake insisted , to the palace of wisdom , but you can be sure that the road of selfimportance does not writers seldom do their best work when they 've decided they 're addressing the ages rather than the reader at their elbow they nurse misbegotten caprices into fullgrown enterprises they speechify readers begin to approach their work outfitted with elaborate prejudices having become the first africanamerican and only the eighth woman to win the nobel prize in literature , toni morrison is expected to speak appropriately on behalf of two aggrieved groups , and too often , alas , she does her fiction has tilted at times toward the grand and the instructional , and once the swedish academy bestowed its laurels , the response to her books broke down into two categories prostrate worship and gleeful nosethumbing dismissing morrison is just as kneejerk , however , as idolizing her , even if it does offer the petty satisfaction of sticking two sacred cows the nobel committee and multiculturalism with a single pin it does n't help that morrison s output since her celebrated novel beloved in 1989 has been spotty paradise is a better book than most of its reviewers allowed , but marred by a structure that seems complex for complexity s sake alone jazz wilts on the page her nonfiction pronouncements can be positively medicinal , but then polemics the finding of morals and the dispensing of lessons is not this author s sweet spot she does her best writing about bad people , and her new novel , love , hooray , has plenty of those morrison s image is so august it s easy to forget how lurid her fiction can be here s what can be found in the 200 pages of love murder , arson , the maiming of a little girl , fetishism , pedophilia , rape , gang rape , statutory rape , prostitution , blackmail , sadomasochism , defenestration , the corruption of various minors , masturbation and an angry mob containing a kid who throws a bucket of animal waste all over the owner of a nice hotel to know morrison s work and to see the title of this book is to pity its characters her view of love is nearly classical the emotion is as much affliction and delusion as joy morrison begins love , as she does most of her novels , by tossing a few puzzle pieces conversations , scenes , remarks at the reader their significance , at first , we can only guess a teenage girl in a microscopic skirt applies for a secretarial job in a big old house occupied by two elderly women who hate each other s guts they 're squabbling over the legacy of the late bill cosey , the hotel owner mentioned above , a man of wealth and charm they 're the remnants of a cluster of family and staff , women mostly , who clustered around cosey , behaving like court personnel fighting for the prince s smile one of these two combatants , heed , is his widow it takes longer to sort out that the other , christine , is his granddaughter they 're the same age the arthritic heed has the money but not the stamina to leave the premises on her own christine , forced to work as a servant in her childhood home , carries a switchblade and has retained a lawyer to win her inheritance back each devotes herself to thwarting and tormenting the other it s like what ever happened to baby jane \?

is n't it romantic \? an entertainment by ron hansen 198 pages harpercollins 1795 ron hansen s unexpectedly airy new book is about natalie and pierre , an amorous young french couple on a summer vacation they might have gone to the c te d'azur , which is the sort of spot that pierre favors but natalie , a librarian specializing in americana and a confirmed watcher of little house on the prairie , has something different in mind thus begins a jaunt across the american midwest , where corn detasseling is said to be a tourist highlight and the famous name liable to be dropped is that of slim pickens i am so excited to be here , natalie declares upon reaching omaha someone replies , compulsory politeness compels me to ask why when the see america bus breaks down , the lovers are stranded in seldom , neb , a place where they make a big impression pierre assumes that the main street cafe will offer a threecourse , prixfixe meal \( the prefix \? asks iona , the beautiful waitress who has until then been seldom s main attraction oh , its four oh two \) and natalie turns heads by looking exotic , like she hailed from east of omaha and would brook no questioning about it pierre is a snooty , halfbritish vintner with the unlikely last name smith \( they could not pronounce , he says of his french upbringing i was called smeet \) and his previous experience in the englishspeaking world has been limited for instance , one favorite pastime for him and natalie has been spending quiet evenings in the bathtub together laughing over the english descriptions he read in wine spectator now he is marooned in a living \( though ridiculously charming \) hell where the local wine bottles come with cornhusker football scores printed on the back and domaine diddlysquat is considered an acceptable name for the product what s more , he is picking up the argot of seldom much too quickly what game you watching , ref \? he is taught to say by one of his new american friends clearly , mr hansen has more business being in nebraska with is n't it romantic \? than his hilariously gallic main characters do before undertaking this sweet , light , exhilarating flight of fancy , which is accurately billed as an entertainment and praised on its back cover solely by nebraska s former governor and senator , bob kerrey , mr hansen was known for the midwestern emphasis of the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford , desperadoes and the short story collection nebraska , not to mention the gravitas of atticus , mariette in ecstasy and hitler s niece early in this book , mr hansen sets off warning bells by spotting a freakish mother and her goldfishtoting middleaged son on the tour bus nebraska can be fertile territory for cultural condescension , as the cinematic omaha of about schmidt currently makes clear but here s a relief mr hansen s view of his terrain is affectionate and smart , and there are no pitiable losers to be found his screwball seldom is a bright outpost of preston sturges country , and his characters have shakespearean ways of switching amorous allegiance and seeming to fall under spells the town s annual revelry \( known unsurprisingly as the revels \) is only one delirious occasion for lovestruck seldomites to thus cut loose is n't it romantic \? is the kind of book that has pierre being handed a louis xiv costume for this occasion , ready to join the citizens of seldom milling about like 'les mis rables' in the costumes of french chambermaids , urchins , revolutionaries , streetwalkers and parisian apaches , with one lone mahatma gandhi unsure of his history but it s also a book that finds pierre smitten with iona , imitating her outfit of cutoff jeans and a gas station shirt as they wait their turn at the dairy delite the gas station is a place where pierre sacrifices none of his native hauteur even as he pumps gas d'accord estce que je v rifie l'huile \? \( okay shall i check the oil \? \) mr hansen s way of juxtaposing french sophistication with nebraskan savvy is admirably sly are these really escargots , or did you just put cat food on some crackers \? one seldom host is asked as he throws a bachelor party that reflects pierre s tastemaking influence \( even if it also finds guests taking off feed company caps and sailing them across the room \) hell , i do n't know , is the answer we did kind of run short there eventually , this midsummer night s dream devolves into doorslamming farce and the literally entertainmentminded side of its storytelling becomes a shade too blatant for its own good by the time mr hansen lets someone take the numbers off the doors at a rooming house and sends four lovestruck characters scampering around the place , with predictably cute consequences , it s time to heed the momentary worry of one of the participants he s afraid he may have been watching too many sitcoms , an apt concern the rodgers and hart song of the title actually plays in the background as pierre , iona , natalie and a local rancher align themselves for a happy ending \( what else \? \) but even as he prepares to sound wedding bells , mr hansen sustains the wit of this breezy fable along comes the local clergyman , one of the buoyantly sketched minor figures here , with his extreme unction kit in tow i must 've been misinformed , he says photo ron hansen \( harpercollins \)

in a mocking summation , peter gotti s lawyer told jurors yesterday that prosecutors had piled hunches on guesses and had never proved that mr gotti , their star defendant in a wideranging racketeering case , was the leader of the gambino crime family the government has failed completely and utterly and miserably to put any evidence before you that peter gotti is the acting boss of anything , said gerald l shargel mr shargel , perhaps the best known of the lawyers who regularly represent mobsters , wandered the courtroom , gesturing and using fake voices to mimic what he said were government witnesses who tried to trick the jurors into believing there was evidence against mr gotti they ask you to see what they want you to see , he said of the prosecutors they ask you to hear what they want you to hear mr gotti , 63 , is one of seven defendants in a wideranging 68count case that includes allegations of corrupt control of the new york waterfront , illegal gambling and extortion mr gotti is charged with participating in the racketeering conspiracy of the gambino crime family but the specific charges against him center on limited allegations that he laundered money by receiving proceeds of the crime family s illegal acts mr shargel suggested that the prosecutors were most interested in convicting mr gotti , and called him the marquee name of the prosecutors' case after a sixweek trial in which federal prosecutors in brooklyn played hundreds of wiretap tapes , mr shargel worked to turn that same evidence against the government he said there was no proof that mr gotti received cash payments from underlings , and he noted that there were no tape recordings of mr gotti at all prosecutors say that a mafia soldier made regular visits to deliver tribute payments to mr gotti , the older brother of john j gotti , who died in prison last year but none of their witnesses saw payments passed and , as mr shargel repeatedly reminded the jurors , mr gotti was never searched mr shargel said investigators were afraid they would not find any money saying prosecutors had distorted the evidence , mr shargel presented alternate interpretations of government assertions when the prosecutors played tapes of another gotti brother , gene , who is serving a prison term , they claimed he acknowledged that peter gotti was now running the family but , mr shargel denied that assertion and noted that gene gotti also referred to peter , a former sanitation man , with a vulgarity and suggested that he should have continued picking up garbage cans mr shargel s summation followed the final statements of the other six defense lawyers , who picked at the prosecution case , sometimes in exhausting detail one lawyer told the jurors that the government s witnesses were liars , including pathological liars another said a jumpy , hazy surveillance videotape looked like a sonogram one prosecutor delivered a comprehensive summation last week another , andrew m genser , followed mr shargel yesterday with a rebuttal he said mr shargel had tried to distract the jurors , and he urged the panel to put one part of a powerful mafia organization and some of its leaders out of business
on dec 8 , 1941 , the day after the japanese attack on pearl harbor , representative charles a eaton , republican of new jersey , made his case in the house for why the nation should enter the second world war mr speaker , his speech began , yesterday against the roar of japanese cannon in hawaii our american people heard a trumpet call a call to unity a call to courage a call to determination once and for all to wipe off of the earth this accursed monster of tyranny and slavery which is casting its black shadow over the hearts and homes of every land last year , senator sam brownback , republican of kansas , made the case for war in iraq this way and if we do n't go at iraq , that our effort in the war on terrorism dwindles down into an intelligence operation , he said we go at iraq and it says to countries that support terrorists , there remain six in the world that are as our definition state sponsors of terrorists , you say to those countries we are serious about terrorism , we 're serious about you not supporting terrorism on your own soil the linguist and cultural critic john mcwhorter cites these excerpts in his new book , doing our own thing the degradation of language and music and why we should , like , care \( gotham books \) they not only are typical of speeches made in congress on both occasions , he argues , but also provide a vivid illustration of just how much the language of public discourse has deteriorated riddled with sentence fragments , runons and colloquialisms like go at , senator brownback s speech is still intelligible , but in mr mcwhorter s view , it is emblematic of a creeping casualness that is largely to the nation s detriment we in america now are an anomaly , mr mcwhorter said over lunch at a restaurant in midtown manhattan this week we have very little sense of english as something to be dressed up it s just this thing that comes out of our mouths we just talk mr mcwhorter , 38 , a professor of linguistics at the university of california at berkeley and a senior fellow at the manhattan institute , a policy research group in new york city , is hardly the first to complain about americans' brazen disregard for their native tongue but unlike many others , he says the problem is not an epidemic of bad grammar as a linguist , he says , he knows that grammatical rules are arbitrary and that in casual conversation people have never abided by them rather , he argues , the fault lies with the collapse of the distinction between the written and the oral where formal , wellhoned english was once de rigueur in public life , he argues , it has all but disappeared , supplanted by the indifferent cadences of speech and ultimately impairing our ability to think this bleak assessment notwithstanding , mr mcwhorter , an intense , confident and perhaps not surprisingly loquacious man , is not a curmudgeon or a fuddyduddy nor , for that matter , a nerd , despite a r sum that bristles with intellectual precociousness selftaught in 12 languages including russian , swedish , swahili , arabic and hebrew , which he initially took up as a philadelphia preschooler when he was 4 he is a respected expert in creole languages \( in his spare time , he is compiling the first written grammar of saramaccan , a creole language spoken by descendants of former slaves in suriname \) a college graduate at 19 and a tenured professor at 33 , he has published seven previous books , including the controversial best seller , losing the race selfsabotage in black america \( the free press , 2000 \) , in which he accused middleclass blacks of embracing antiintellectualism and a cult of victimology an africanamerican who is an outspoken critic of affirmative action , welfare and reparations , he has aroused the ire of many liberals and earned a reputation as a conservative but none of these exploits , he is at pains to show , should be taken to mean that he is not hip his conversation is peppered with knowing allusions to pop culture britney spears , tori amos , television sitcoms , rap and broadway \( i'm the world s only straight musicaltheater castalbum fanatic , he joked \) an experienced bassbaritone who plays cocktail piano and has performed in amateur theatrics , he illustrated a point about contemporary english usage by singing two lines from stephen sondheim s new musical , bounce in many ways , he insists , he is a typical product of america after the 1960 s , the decade to which he dates the beginning of the nation s linguistic decline i cannot recite a single poem , he said you can take a russian teenager and say recite some poetry , and they will give you strophes of pushkin we ca n't do it the only equivalent for an american under a certain age is literally dr seuss or theme songs until the 1960 s , he maintains , informal cultural expression like the experimental prose of beatnik writers was relegated to outsider status but by the end of the decade , he insists , that had changed the counterculture went mainstream , ushering in the laidback new linguistic regime
nasiriya , iraq i 've been roaming iraq , turning over rocks in my unstinting effort to help the bush administration find those weapons of mass destruction no luck yet but i did find something related , here in the city where it seems \( contrary to early pentagon leaks \) that pfc jessica lynch did not mow down iraqis until her ammo ran out , was not shot and apparently was not plucked from behind enemy lines by us commandos braving a firefight it looks as if the first accounts of the rescue were embellished , like the imminent threat from wmd , and like wartime pronouncements about an uprising in basra and imminent defections of generals there s a pattern we were misled none of this is to put down private lynch , whom her iraqi doctors described as courageous and funny in the face of unrelenting pain they said that she told abdul hadi , a hospital worker who had befriended her , not to take risks for her because he was needed by his 17 children ms lynch is still a hero in my book , and it was unnecessary for officials to try to turn her into a hollywood caricature as a citizen , i deeply resent my government trying to spin me like a pingpong ball staff members of nasiriya s main hospital told me , as they have told other reporters , how surprised they were when military officers brought an american woman by ambulance private lynch was unconscious , with broken legs , a head wound and other injuries , apparently sustained in a vehicle accident during a firefight she was nearly dead , recalled saad abdulrazak , the deputy hospital director , who received her the iraqi doctors were enchanted by this blonde warrior , who as she recovered spent her time alternately crying and joking i do n't know how much to credit the iraqis' claims that they gave her the best room in the hospital , that they went to the market to buy orange juice for her with their own money , that they brought clothes so that she would have something to wear but they did n't minimize iraqi brutality indeed , they told of an execution of a handcuffed american male \( i 've put a fuller account of this execution and of ms lynch s saga at nytimescom kristofresponds \) the hospital staff also said that on the night of march 27 , military officials prepared to kill ms lynch by putting her in an ambulance and blowing it up with its occupants blaming the atrocity on the americans the ambulance drivers balked at that idea eventually , the plan was changed so that a military officer would shoot ms lynch and burn the ambulance so sabah khazal , an ambulance driver , loaded her in the vehicle and drove off with a military officer assigned to execute her i asked him not to shoot jessica , mr khazal said , and he was afraid of god and did n't kill her instead , the executioner ran away and deserted the army , and mr khazal said that he then thought about delivering ms lynch to an american checkpoint but there were firefights on the streets , so he returned to the hospital \( ms lynch apparently never knew how close she had come to execution \) by the morning of march 31 , all of the iraqi military at the hospital had fled the hospital staff members said that they then told ms lynch they would take her to the americans the next day that same night , the american special forces arrived i met the americans at the hospital entrance , said dr hussein salih , adding that mr abdulrazak then led the americans to private lynch the staff members all said that there was no resistance , and that they welcomed the americans is this account the truth \? i do n't know , but every time i voiced skepticism , the doctors and staff all insisted go ask jessica ! she 'll tell you the us military has refused to make private lynch available , although that may be out of respect for her privacy in any case , she is said to have no memory of her capture my guess is that saving private lynch was a complex tale vastly oversimplified by officials , partly because of genuine ambiguities and partly because they wanted a good story to build political support for the war a repetition of the exaggerations over wmd we were n't quite lied to , but facts were subordinated to politics , and truth was treated as an endlessly stretchable fabric the iraqis misused our prisoners for their propaganda purposes , and it hurts to find out that some american officials were misusing private lynch the same way
london , june 21 they are young , hip , south asians in their 20 s who glide seamlessly between two cultures , carefully cherry picking from the west to modernize the east they can just as easily listen to justin timberlake , the pop star , as rishi rich , the hindu musical dynamo they eat halal meat but wear jeans and tshirts to cafes now these young indians and pakistanis are pushing the cultural boundaries created by their parents and grandparents one step further they are reshaping the tradition of arranged marriages in britain while couples were once introduced exclusively by relatives and friends , the aunt bijis , as muslims call their matchmakers , are now being slowly nudged out by a boom in asian marriage web sites , chat rooms and personal advertisements south asian speed dating hindus one night , muslims the next is the latest phenomenon to hit london , with men and women meeting each other for just three minutes at restaurants and bars before moving on to the next potential mate arranged marriages are still the norm within these clannish , tightknit communities in britain , but , with the urging of second and thirdgeneration children , the nature of the arrangement has evolved , mostly by necessity what the young indians and pakistanis of britain have done , in effect , is to modernize practices that had evolved among the urban middle class in india in recent decades , allowing the prospective bride and groom a little more than one fleeting meeting to make up their minds the relaxation that had crept in since the 1960 s allowed the couple , after an initial meeting before their extended families , to meet alone several times , either with family members in another room or at a restaurant , before delivering a verdict now , the meetings take place in public venues without the family encounter first the term we use now is 'assisted' arranged marriage , said maha khan , a 23yearold london muslim woman the whole concept has changed a lot parents have become more open and more liberal in their concept of marriage and courtship gitangeli sapra , a trendy , willowy british sindhu who at 25 jokes that she is on her way to spinsterhood , is an avid speed dater with no qualms about advertising her love of modern arranged marriages she even wrote a column about it for the sunday times it s not based on love , she said , which can fizzle out ms sapra had attended 10 of the more formal arranged meetings awkward , drawnout affairs in which the young man , his mother and several other relatives came over to meet the young woman and her family she wore her best indian outfit , a sari or elegant indian pants and top she sat quietly , which is almost impossible to fathom , considering her chattiness when called upon , she poured tea , and then talked briefly to her potential mate in a side room the matriarchs do the talking , she said over a glass of wine at an italian restaurant you sit there looking cute and like the ideal housewife to be honest , it s an easy way to get a rich man , with my mother s blessing , she added , with a laugh none of them worked out , though , and ms sapra has moved on to speed dating , with the blessings of her mother the very concept raises the hackles of some more oldfashioned parents , but many are coming around , in part out of desperation if ms sapra finds someone on a speed date , she will quickly bring him home to her mother the abiding principles behind an arranged marriage still remain strong lust does not a lasting marriage make and family knows best but parents and elders , eager to avoid alienating their children , making them miserable or seeing them go unmarried , have shown considerable flexibility this is especially pronounced among the middle class , whose members tend to have integrated more into british life the notion of arrangement has become more fluid , said yunas samad , a sociology professor at bradford university , who has studied marriage in the muslim community what is happening is that the arranged marriage is becoming a bit more open and children are getting a bit more say in this so it becomes a nice compromise there is the comfort of family support and a choice in what they are doing it s a halfway house , not completely traditional and not completely the same as what is happening in british society , he added to the surprise of parents and elders , this new hybrid between east and west has actually stoked enthusiasm for an ageold tradition that many young people privately viewed as crusty and hopelessly unhip now they see it as an important way to preserve religion and identity , not to mention a lowmaintenance way of finding a mate it s like your parents giving you a black book of girls , said ronak mashru , 24 , a london comedian whose parents are from india the young people also recognize that arranged marriages in which similar education and income levels , religious beliefs and character outweigh the importance of physical attraction can well outlast love marriages the fallinginlove system has failed , said rehna azim , a pakistani family lawyer who founded an asian magazine , memsahib south asian unions are viewed as marriages between families , not individuals divorce is anathema , while respect and standing within a community are paramount a lot of people have much invested in making a match work similarly , several customs have survived dating decisions have to be made relatively quickly , often after the second or third meeting , and , ms sapra said , once you 've said yes , there is no turning back dowries remain common and background still matters , too our mums look at the cv s , said vani gupta , 30 , a speed dater they figure out whether we 're compatible on paper right job , right background , right caste it s nice to know your parents have done the work for you you feel more secure these middleclass women , most of them educated professionals or university students , are looking for more modern men , who accept working wives and help around the house but a mechanic wo n't try for a lawyer and a lawyer would not look for a mechanic , she said ms sapra , for example , is looking for a fellow sindhu , and a gujarati indian typically seeks another gujarati muslims still keep it mostly within the family and the same region of pakistan cousins still frequently marry cousins , or at least second or third cousins , and many british pakistanis still find their brides back in pakistan but now more men are marrying white british women who convert to islam , and others insist on finding a muslim bride here who speaks english , eats fish and chips and watches east enders , a popular soap opera parents and elders have had to adapt , in large part because the number of potential partners is much smaller here than in their home countries rather than see an educated daughter go unwed , parents and elders have accepted these more modern approaches women are not going to be put back in some kind of bottle , professor samad said ms azim said parents can say my child had an arranged marriage , and he can say , 'yeah , it s arranged but i like her' photo hindu women

washington , june 16 until last week , most americans familiar with freddie mac or fannie mae probably had a vague image of benevolent government agencies helping young couples get their first mortgages but after freddie mac replaced its top management , it became clear from the severance pay that this was no ordinary government work bureaucrats do not receive 24 million golden parachutes freddie mac and its big sister , fannie mae , are governmentsponsored enterprises in washington that have become two of the largest and most profitable companies on wall street they say that their special privileges promote the american dream and that their profits reflect sound management their critics say the companies promote what is more like the washington dream private benefits for the well connected , and potentially enormous public costs for taxpayers if either company makes the wrong bets when buying and selling mortgages now critics from alan greenspan to ralph nader see an opportunity to challenge two institutions that have long been virtually untouchable after the shakeup at freddie mac , which came during an internal inquiry of its accounting practices , outside investigations were announced by federal prosecutors , regulators and lawmakers the freddie mac board fired david w glenn , the president , and forced leland c brendsel , chairman and chief executive , and vaughn a clarke , chief financial officer , to resign freddie mac said today that it was preventing mr brendsel and mr glenn from selling restricted stock or exercising stock options until its regulator , the office of federal housing enterprise oversight , reviews their compensation packages it is also preventing their unvested options , restricted stock and restricted stock units from vesting the power of freddie mac and fannie mae on capitol hill has stemmed partly from their importance to homeowners and the housing industry because they own or guarantee more than a third of the home mortgages in america , any threat to their operations could raise the cost of mortgages and hurt wellorganized constituencies in every congressional district their power also stems from their political operations the profits from wall street are used to recruit politicians from both parties as executives and to hire lobbyists 19 lobbying firms last year for freddie mac 23 for fannie mae , according to politcalmoneyline freddie mac s chief internal lobbyist , mitchell delk , is known for having fundraisers for members of congress , though those are personal activities separate from the company , said douglas robinson , spokesman for freddie mac the lobbying ability of fannie and freddie is second to none in washington , said representative richard h baker , a louisiana republican who is chairman of the house subcommittee that oversees the companies they have not only unlimited financial resources but good personnel who maintain good relations with many members of congress when their interests are threatened , the response is almost armylike they 're tactical , and they 're everywhere besides helping the young couples in their advertisements pay for homes , fannie mae and freddie mac have also helped pay for the purchase , renovation and upkeep of the headquarters for the democratic and republican parties in washington since 1999 , politicalmoneyline says , fannie mae has contributed over 25 million to house the parties' national and campaign committees , while freddie mac has contributed more than 6 million fannie mae has a tradition of recruiting government veterans with nongovernment salaries its chief executive , franklin d raines , who interrupted his career there to serve as director of the office of management and budget under president bill clinton , received more than 11 million in compensation last year , according to the company the vice chairman of fannie mae s board , jamie s gorelick , who was deputy attorney general until 1997 , received more than 4 million last year officials at freddie mac and fannie mae have been frank about the need to manage what they call politicial risk just as much as they manage the financial risks of their portfolios chuck greener , a former spokesman for the republican national committee who is a senior vice president at fannie mae , said we 're passionate about our mission and the public role it fulfills consequently , we feel it s important to communicate with congress and policy makers the public mission of fannie mae and freddie mac is to promote homeownership , especially among lowerincome americans although they do not directly write mortgages , they buy them from the primary lenders , sell them to other investors and guarantee them against default supporting that mission poses no direct strain on the federal budget , another reason the companies are so popular on capitol hill the support takes the form of indirect subsidies worth more than 10 billion a year , according to a 2001 study by the congressional budget office besides exemptions of 1 billion worth of local taxes and securities fees , the budget office found , the companies save more than 9 billion a year thanks to an implicit subsidy the ability to borrow money cheaply because of the widespread assumption that the federal government would cover any losses , even though it is not legally

federal investigators are searching for a laptop computer that disappeared last week from a supposedly secure biocontainment building at the plum island animal disease research center , its acting director said yesterday the possibility is extremely remote that the computer was contaminated with a dangerous animal virus and that it got outside the building , said the acting director , marc s hollander it poses no danger to the public , he said , because the laboratory studies exotic viruses that do not infect humans still , the disappearance of the computer the second time a computer has been reported missing over the past year has renewed questions about security on the island , which is supposed to operate under stringent regulations because of precautions in the biocontainment area , the laptop in all likelihood was not contaminated , federal officials said even if it were , it posed only a very small threat to animals , mr hollander said viruses live from a few minutes to a week at most , he said , and no outbreaks of animal illnesses have been reported since the laptop was reported missing eight days ago nor do the computer s data pose an intelligence breach , mr hollander said , because none of it was sensitive material that could be exploited the data can be easily reconstituted , he said still , the center is taking the incident very seriously , mr hollander said he said it underscored the need to continue efforts already under way to tighten safeguards the center recently installed 13 video surveillance cameras , but mr hollander said that more were needed , including some inside the biocontainment area the security measures are scheduled for completion by the end of the year after being owned by the federal department of agriculture for nearly half a century , the center was made part of the department of homeland security this year the new agency takes full operational control tomorrow plum island , off the north fork of eastern long island , is patrolled by armed guards and is reached by the center s boats workers wear identification badges , and visitors must be authorized the computer was discovered missing on sept 22 , after a fourday hiatus when regular operations were suspended because of hurricane isabel after two intensive searches failed to turn up the computer , the investigation was taken over by law enforcement agents for homeland security some residents of eastern long island have said that they were worried about hazards at the center and that they were afraid that it might expand into bioterrorism research on human diseases center officials have said that they have no such plans and have stressed that safety is a priority for over a year , the center has been roiled by a strike of workers for the contractor that runs the operations , but now a new one is being chosen another laptop computer was taken from the center last october by a worker hired during the strike who then disappeared for three days that laptop was not from the biocontainment area , but it did hold information about the center s computer system the laptop was retrieved and computer access codes were changed , the center said but its hiring procedures were criticized when the worker turned out to have an arrest record
ernst young , the accounting firm that is under fire for advising executives at sprint to set up tax shelters related to their stock option transactions , has reversed its opinion on how companies should account for such options the major accounting firms , including ernst young , maintained for years that options should not be deducted as a cost to the companies that grant them , but now the firm says that options should be reflected as an expense in financial statements ernst young made its change of heart public in a letter on tuesday to the financial accounting standards board , the organization that makes the rules for the accounting profession the board , along with the international accounting standards board , its international counterpart , is trying to develop standards that are compatible for domestic and international companies both boards say the rule on accounting for stock options needs to be aligned both organizations have asked the industry to comment on proposals to change current accounting methods , which do not require companies to account for options as expenses in its letter , ernst young said it strongly supported efforts by both groups to develop a method to ensure that stockbased compensation is reflected in the financial statements of issuing enterprises the firm expressed reservations about methods that might be used to value options , but it noted that the current environment , in which investors and regulators are scrutinizing corporate governance practices , requires that the accounting for options provide relevant information to investors beth a brooke , global vice chairwoman at ernst young , said the letter had been in the works for some time and was unrelated to the recent turmoil surrounding its advice to the sprint executives we 've been discussing this issue across our global network for several months , she said by advocating that the cost of options be deducted from corporate income statements , ernst young is taking the lead on what is an extremely divisive issue none of the other top accounting firms have come out as strongly in support of treating options as an expense for years , shareholder advocates have asserted that accounting practices on stock options permit companies to misrepresent their financial positions by not deducting the cost of options , companies can report costs that are artificially low and earnings that are artificially high , these people said but when the financial accounting standards board tried in the mid1990 s to require companies to deduct option costs from their financial statements , corporate executives started an aggressive lobbying campaign on capitol hill against the measure the accounting board retreated from its position and wound up requiring only that companies publish a calculation of the cost of options in the footnotes to their financial statements after the collapse of enron and worldcom , and in the wake of other corporate scandals , however , clarity of corporate financial statements became a top priority among investors and regulators making the costs of options more explicit in financial statements has also become a priority among shareholder advocates taking a position even remotely in favor of reporting expenses for stock options may create problems for ernst young because many of its clients strongly oppose the idea , some accountants noted executives at many companies oppose the treatment of options as expenses because that would reduce their reported earnings and could depress their share prices ernst young s three largest competitors stopped well short of advocating the deduction of companies' option costs in their comments to the accounting board kpmg , for example , said that while it supported compatible accounting standards among domestic and international companies , it would object to a u s standard on stockbased compensation that adopts the iasb model solely to achieve convergence without the full due process of the fasb executives at technology firms , which have relied heavily on option grants to attract workers , continue to oppose the deduction of stock option costs in a letter to the financial accounting standards board from technet , a lobbying organization made up of executives at 200 top technology companies , the group stated while there is virtually uniform agreement that an employee stock option represents something of value to an employee , there is absolutely no agreement among accounting experts that the issuance of employee stock options represents a corporate expense we believe that requiring employee stock options to be treated as an expense would lead to misleading financial statements because no accurate , reliable and tested method of valuing stock options currently exists ernst young , in its letter , said the need for more relevant compensation expense information exceeds the risks associated with the reliability and comparability of the measurement of compensation expense

near the beginning of contacts , william klein s shrewd 15minute film about the challenges of photography , he does some melancholy math say you have been lucky enough to make 250 memorable pictures in your career , a success rate that only preeminent artists can claim given a shutter speed of 125th of a second per picture , how much experience have you really captured \? he crunches the numbers and concludes that what the public sees amounts to two seconds of a photographer s life half a century of work can add up to two blinks of an eye leave it to this brainy and pugnacious artist , who turns 75 this year , to find a shadow on the peak of success for william klein to feel good about himself , it sometimes seems , he has to feel gloomy , embattled and misunderstood the next two months will offer a chance to sample more than a few seconds of mr klein s influential work an expatriate based since 1948 in france , he is coming home this week to new york , his native city , where he is orchestrating a festival for himself that will showcase the remarkable scope of his life s production and prove that it will last a lot longer than two seconds the diverse body of work he has produced over the last 50 years as a photographer , filmmaker and graphic designer can be viewed as a relentless series of taunts , to himself and to us an aggressive anxiety about the limits of photography , and about his reputation in the united states , has been his signature since the 1956 publication of his landmark book , life is good and good for you in new york he gets in the face of his subjects , and thus in ours , jamming as much experience of the world as he can down the camera s throat the focus for the events is paris klein , his huge new book of photographs from distributed art publishers arranged across double pages , it is as uncomplimentary a portrait of the french as donald rumsfeld could ever dream of as usual , mr klein rubs our faces in urban grime and dares us to be offended he photographs the cynosure of fashion and fine dining as a tawdry circus , a place where haussmann s boulevards have become parade grounds for raucous freaks , and the aging haute bourgeoisie still wear hats but eat with plastic forks off paper plates it s a new yorker s razz of paris , just as his 195455 photographs of new york were inflected by a gallic film noir sensuality this dual identity has allowed mr klein to move easily between two worlds and yet cast himself as a perpetual outsider i can speak perfect french , he said by telephone from france but i 've always kept my accent i'm a 100 percent american good or bad , there s something about america that still turns me on a group of single images and blownup , painted contact sheets from the paris book can be found at mr klein s elaborate installation that opens on wednesday at herm s on madison avenue \( through may 9 \) meanwhile , a selection from his book tokyo 1961 is already on view at howard greenberg s gallery 292 in soho \( through may 3 \) breaking with the humanitarian aims of photojournalists like w eugene smith , as well as the long line of artists who have portrayed japan as a manicured zen garden , mr klein took an irreverent attitude toward life in the orient , as it was then called in grungy , wideangle views of tokyo streets he made no pretense of understanding what he saw he felt like an alien in japan , and his pictures do n't hide that fact none of these projects , though , show how surefire he can be when he s really on his game to see that , a visit to street smarts , now at the philadelphia museum of art through july 13 , is called for a greatesthits collection of pictures he made over several decades in various cities new york , paris , tokyo , rome , moscow , london , madrid and beirut they are for the most part recent \( 1979 \) prints it matters little in the classic picture barbershop , rome , 1956 , mr klein has so deftly composed the ritual ablutions of about a dozen italian men that even in reproductions the visual elegance of this caricature makes you grin it can take minutes to tell the real from the reflected heads in the shop s wilderness of mirrors the work of mr klein s painting teacher in paris , fernand l ger , and of henri cartierbresson , from whom he bought his first 35millimeter camera , stands behind the picture but on a scale of 1 to 10 , this feat of photographic dexterity rates about 98 i'm completely comfortable in a crowd , mr klein said i like the street i went to this school at 23rd and lexington i was always crammed in with people running to catch the subway antipsychological and antiintimate , mr klein has never gone in for photographic confessions unlike his contemporaries robert frank and richard avedon , he has n't featured his family in his work i do n't have this nan goldin fascination with people i know , he said with irritation i'm private i do n't want to show my wife i'm a loner i do n't hang out or belong to a group i never want to photograph friends he laughed the few friends i have
baghdad , iraq , may 3 in an attempt to bring a semblance of order into their lives , some parents sent their children to school today , braving the hazards of a city with few buses , piles of flyinfested garbage , no phones , few jobs and little money , food or water but on the first official day of school since the war began many more students and teachers stayed home , fearing for their safety because overstretched american soldiers have been able to inspect only a fraction of the iraqi capital s school buildings for weapons and unexploded ordnance as iraqis continued to complain about the lack of a visible government or a police force to secure their streets , a newly arrived team of united nations officials regrouped at the compound they abandoned on march 18 on the eve of the americanled war on iraq despite the bush administration s lack of enthusiasm for a united nations role in the reconstruction of the country , the officials said they would reestablish their aid programs and arrange the delivery of more than one million tons of food over the next three months ramiro lopes da silva , the organization s aid coordinator for iraq , said he did not intend to set up a shadow authority that would compete with the american civil administration but mr da silva acknowledged that the united nations faced a rather fuzzy situation our duty is to fill in the gaps , not to duplicate efforts , he said we think we can bring added value confusion and frustration reign in most sections of baghdad , a city of about 45 million people many businesses have yet to reopen and people are complaining of skyrocketing food prices and the lack of paychecks to buy staples the government , which used to be iraq s biggest employer , is still almost completely shut down , leaving the american occupying force as the primary hope for employment hundreds of angry iraqis demonstrated today at the palestine hotel , where most foreign journalists here are staying , demanding order and jobs many protesters complained that they had filled out job applications only to learn that few if any jobs were available the few bright spots here were the clusters of children , dressed in blue and white uniforms , who hiked to school to resume classes that had come to a halt seven weeks ago they arrived with high hopes randa muayed , a girl of 10 whose hair was neatly held with an orange headband , was sure school would be different now the americans will bring us bananas , randa said bananas and oranges and apples at al kamshly elementary school in the middleclass area of wahda , where she is a student , the teachers spent three days last week cleaning the twostory building to prepare for their 800 students only 30 children showed up at 8 30 am , but they were greeted with effusive hugs and kisses and for the first time in their lives , they did not have to begin the school day by pledging their love and devotion to saddam hussein still , the teachers had not had a chance to remove all of the pictures of mr hussein they had their hands full just cleaning up the chicken bones , fish skins , blood and discarded uniforms left by the fedayeen fighters who had camped in the school during the war every window was broken , said suhair alhasanni , a physical education teacher they broke the lock and came in here and when the headmistress called to them and asked what they were doing , they said , 'that s not your business' amid the giddy delight , though , there were tears one student , a fifthgrade girl named ala , had been killed in the american bombing of baghdad no ! cried one of the teachers when she heard the news not her there was more sad news to discuss the school s bus driver had also been killed , shot by american soldiers when he apparently failed to stop at checkpoint while bringing his family into the city in the first days after baghdad s fall everyone had a story and was eager to tell it the principal , bushra cesar , had splurged on friday and bought a satellite television dish after a lifetime with only iraqi state television to watch , ms cesar was so enthralled with the choice of foreign channels that she stayed up all night flipping from station to station i saw the world for the first time , she said i saw where we were i saw presidents and cities and people from everywhere ! the whole world ! hoda kamel , the school s english teacher , could not stop herself from laughing as she denounced mr hussein , whose sayings and selfcentered version of iraqi history filled the country s textbooks before , mrs kamel said , none of the staff members dared say a bad word about the iraqi leader for fear that a colleague or a child would denounce them to the secret police the fear was intensified by not knowing who among them was a spy it could be her or it could be the headmistress , so we ca n't speak , said mrs kamel , drawing her finger across her lips like a zipper top secret none of the teachers have been paid since february and they feared that their salaries the equivalent of 3 to 10 a month would not be enough to live on in the new iraq , even if they receive the money jay garner , the former lieutenant general who heads the american occupation administration , has promised to pay civil servants an emergency allocation of 20 each but nobody knew when or how it would appear as the teachers gathered in the corridor to exchange stories , a tank pulled up outside the school mr john , mr john ! they cried in welcome as lt john rowold strode into the building john , tomorrow you will bring us money \? asked mrs kamel , the english teacher the lieutenant , head of a team from the third infantry division that has been assigned to patrol the neighborhood around the school and deal with the residents' problems , shook his head maybe within about two days , he said there was some administrative screw up you should call mr jay garner , ms hassani scolded him what is he doing \? we have no money but general garner , whose nearinvisibility in baghdad has not diminished the iraqis' expectations that he may soon help them , works in ways that are still mysterious to soldiers on the street like lieutenant rowold i 've got these few blocks and every day i send in a report , the lieutenant said before climbing back onto his tank and heading down the street to deal with a crowd of angry retired iraqi army officers who had been promised their pension money from a local bank lieutenants like me from all over the city are sending him reports , he said i hope he s getting them the united nations officials said iraq s immediate needs were food and chlorine to purify drinking water , which could be supplied from the 10 billion worth of basic necessities that had been ordered before the war under the oilforfood program those goods will now be delivered , the officials said donor countries have also been asked to give an additional 22 billion for immediate food and medical assistance after 12 years of sanctions on iraq , 6 out of 10 people had come to depend solely on their government for food the united nations officials said iraq could avoid a crisis only with outside help to reinstate its public health services , a food rationing program and a sanitation system basic services have collapsed or are at risk of collapse if we do n't put them back into shape rather quickly , mr da silva said photos the reopening of schools in baghdad brought familiar scenes to al kamshly elementary suhair alhassani , a teacher , gave yusef iliya , 9 , a returning kiss , above , while a drawing of saddam hussein holding a rifle remained on the wall some students moved a bench into a classroom and other schoolboys shook hands with a gi guarding the school \( photographs by ruth fremson the new york times \) \( pg 27 \)
washington , dec 14 president bush on sunday hailed the capture of saddam hussein as a turning point in the history of iraq and a hopeful day for its people , but he warned americans that the violence against united states forces occupying the nation would continue in a threeminute televised address shortly after noon from the cabinet room of the white house , mr bush struck a tone of cautious optimism that had none of the exultation of his may 1 speech aboard the aircraft carrier abraham lincoln declaring major combat operations in iraq at an end this afternoon i have a message for the iraqi people , mr bush said somberly you will not have to fear the rule of saddam hussein ever again but the president added i also have a message for all americans the capture of saddam hussein does not mean the end of violence in iraq we still face terrorists who would rather go on killing the innocent than accept the rise of liberty in the heart of the middle east the president s careful demeanor hid the elation at the white house about the capture of the man who had been locked in conflict with the bush family for the last dozen years president george bush drove mr hussein from kuwait in the persian gulf war in 1991 , and mr hussein tried to retaliate by assassinating him after he left office , a fact noted by his son in his 2002 address to the united nations general assembly the capture was both a personal and political victory for president bush , who had been frustrated that a man he had described as an archenemy of the united states had eluded american troops for so long the capture also came at the beginning of the president s 2004 reelection campaign and steals ammunition , at least for the moment , from the democratic presidential candidates who had criticized the war and the american occupation the capture was also seen as aiding the mission of former secretary of state james a baker iii , who is to leave monday for a fivenation trip intended to reduce iraq s foreign debt and to attract support for american policies in iraq from european leaders who opposed the war he can make the argument that the tide is turning , a senior administration official said mr bush and other administration officials seemed eager to make the capture of mr hussein an occasion to turn the spotlight on the iraqis themselves they put the acting leader of the iraqi governing council at the lectern in baghdad with l paul bremer iii , the top american administrator in iraq a senior official said that when world leaders told mr bush over the telephone on sunday that the capture was a great day for the united states and the other coalition forces , mr bush corrected them he said , 'no , this is a great day for the iraqi people , ' the senior official recounted in his televised speech , mr bush cast the capture of mr hussein as a critical development in his desire to bring democracy to a nation that lived under dictatorship for 35 years the capture of this man was crucial to the rise of a free iraq , mr bush said it marks the end of the road for him and for all who bullied and killed in his name for a majority of iraqis , the president added , this event brings further assurance that the torture chambers and the secret police are gone forever but several white house aides acknowledged that the capture raised new concerns , too , among them that iraqis might tire of the american military presence more quickly now that they feel they do not need protection from mr hussein mr bush did not mention al qaeda in his speech , and notably put most of the responsibility for the attacks in iraq on baath party members still loyal to mr hussein mr bush has previously also suggested that terrorists crossing the border from syria and iran were to blame he also did not refer in his speech to the search for unconventional weapons , the major stated reason that the united states invaded iraq , but intelligence analysts said mr hussein s capture could give new life to the hunt white house and defense officials said mr hussein would remain in american military custody for a considerable time , undergoing interrogation but while the white house officials said they were comfortable with plans reached last week for a war crimes tribunal to be established in baghdad to deal with the captured members of mr hussein s government , they have not publicly committed themselves to using that tribunal to put mr hussein on trial we have n't had a chance to think about it , a senior administration official said mr bush was first informed of the capture at 3 15 pm saturday by defense secretary donald h rumsfeld , who called the president at camp david to tell him that he believed that american forces had apprehended mr hussein as recounted by scott mcclellan , the white house press secretary , mr rumsfeld began by telling the president that the first reports are not always accurate mr bush then interrupted , mr mcclellan said , saying that this sounds like it s going to be good news mr rumsfeld responded , mr mcclellan said , that gen john p abizaid , the senior american commander in the middle east , was confident that american forces had mr hussein the president then said , well , that is good news , mr mcclellan recounted but both the president and his defense secretary still expressed some caution , mr mcclellan said , and agreed that the man captured might be an impostor mr bush asked mr rumsfeld how general abizaid knew it was mr hussein , and mr rumsfeld got off the phone to gather more information mr rumsfeld quickly called the president back to say that confirmation came from what mr mcclellan called some identifying marks a short time later , mr bush called vice president dick cheney and condoleezza rice , the national security adviser , to inform them of the news ms rice then called colin l powell , the secretary of state george j tenet , the director of central intelligence and andrew h card jr , the white house chief of staff saturday night , several senior members of the administration ran into each other during the course of prechristmas parties , but they evidently did not mention the news that was on everyone s mind we did n't want to jinx it , one of the officials said
poison a history and a family memoir by gail bell 276 pp new york st martin s press 2395 like goblin fruits , poisons flourish their seductiveness under appetizing colors they lurk inside the plumpest

become impervious to all things that harm mortal creatures \( but she holds him by his heel , and that , as we know , stays vulnerable \) gail bell quotes the great protoscientist paracelsus' perception that all substances are poisons there is none which is not a poison the right dose differentiates a poison and a remedy from the apothecary and the herbalist to the witch and the murderer is but a little step bell , an australian pharmacist , knows intimately the dangers of the medicine cabinet she also inherited a secret history her father warned her against opening the box full of small glassstoppered bottles that had come to him from his father , william macbeth , a traveling healer , a layer on of hands , a maker of a patent tonic and author of a treatise on preventing premature decay never , never do that you could die , bell s father said , snatching the vial she was about to sniff in 1927 , 3yearold patrick macbeth died of drinking strychnine he was the second of william macbeth s sons to die within a year , so bell was told , and on good family authority , that their father had done away with them her book , poison , measures out , in small loving spoonfuls , grains of information about this private family story there is a riveting aside when she remembers how long ago , when i was stuck in the back room of an old pharmacy compounding medicine in a trance of boredom , i put a glass to the common wall between the dispensary and the surgery next door to better hear the muffled voices that hummed off and on all day this secret listening in , to which she confesses with blushes , continues as she eavesdrops on the rivalries and sorrows among her own immediate kin fractures appear it is surprising how very recent history , in a country keen to own a past , should so quickly fall into ruins but gail bell s father was orphaned at 10 , and sent , as a kind of indentured child laborer , to a small farm the shame in which the aspirations of british colonial gentility can wrap an emerging national identity created a great silence around william macbeth family lore , bell writes , is the dead zone of secrets , severity and things withheld but , as she discovers , her grandfather was clearly a charmer , a dandy who wore a morning suit and drove expensive cars his is also a pioneer story , for frontiers have always offered opportunities to snakeoil merchants and druggists , long before the coming of viagra , have promised sexual vigor \( unfortunately bell could find no trace of macbeth s strengthening tonic , tested in the highlands of scotland on the descendants of the great warriors of culloden \) bell s narrative method weaves in and out , sometimes frustratingly , and at times the reader longs for a steadier , more ample texture it would have been interesting , for instance , to hear more about a quack s role in and around suburban sydney and the summer resorts of the blue mountains but bell is less interested in social history than in the practice of storytelling itself her book gradually turns into an oblique , suggestive meditation on family memory , on story and history , fantasy and fact , and opens up into an inquiry into the intricate cheating games romancing and revenge play with the truth in the plague , albert camus writes that every prisoner and every exile experiences the profound suffering of living with a memory that has no purpose bell s relatives obeyed the emotional dynamic that requires painful memories to have a rationale since bell has constructed her story as a tease , a quasisuspense tale of decryption , it would be a spoiling act to disclose the outcome but it conforms to the general thrust of her book , that poisoners fascinate us far in excess of their incidence , that the bitter pill , the medicine bottle labeled drink me issue above all an invitation to the fabulous imagination bell tells an emblematic tale of a circus elephant that died of arsenic poisoning lurid suspicions of dark strangers from out of town were soon circulating but eventually an analysis of the poor beast s stomach contents revealed weedkiller bell s poisoners are the boogeymen we love to fear the strangers who hide razor blades in apples , the gypsies who steal babies she does not explore the complex difficulty that presents itself so urgently today , that such false texts and madeup

over the centuries , the ink has gone to the discoverers , the men who found or claimed or opened new territories but we 've gotten to a place in history where the preservers are the ones who deserve the ink one of those was margaret murie , better known as mardy , who died on sunday at her ranch near moose , wyo , at the age of 101 when olaus murie , a federal wildlife biologist , went north to study caribou , one of the natural resources he discovered in alaska was the first woman to graduate from the university of alaska mr murie married her in an alaskan village in 1924 , and they honeymooned deep in the wilderness , an adventure recounted in ms murie s book two in the far north the muries recognized in each other a mission bigger than marriage it is largely thanks to their efforts that we have an arctic national wildlife refuge to protect today mr murie died in 1963 , three years after president dwight eisenhower established the refuge but ms murie helped extend the idea of protecting wilderness areas to the whole nation she was an unflagging proponent of the wilderness act , signed in 1964 , and she helped shape the alaska national interest lands conservation act , signed by president jimmy carter in 1980 that legislation set aside 104 million acres of land in alaska and doubled the size of the arctic national wildlife refuge ms murie did none of these things alone but her zeal and her belief in the idea of wilderness made it possible for many other people to believe in it and defend it zealously , too thanks in part to her work , great swaths of land were set aside with a single presidential pen stroke it may seem as if such enormous achievements lie beyond our scope in the world as we know it but our job now is to maintain both the will and the conscience needed to protect the wilderness our predecessors set aside verlyn klinkenborg
clicker shock is slowly becoming a thing of the past online merchants have improved how quickly they disclose the actual selling price of goods and services after taxes , fees and shipping charges have been added on in the early years of ecommerce , when merchants considered low prices the primary way to attract customers , such charges were often hidden many steps into the buying process now , aided by new technology and compelled by competitive pressures , merchants are becoming more upfront about what they charge and online travel merchants , who have lagged the industry in this respect , are gradually improving their price disclosure policies , as well for example , travelocity , a unit of sabre holdings , this spring rolled out what it called a total pricing approach for car rentals , with the complete costs for car rentals shown as part of the search results when online customers searched last week for a oneday car rental at the denver airport , the results showed a daily rate of 1791 by clicking on a tab titled total price users were shown a rate of 2516 , which does not include optional charges for prepaid gas or insurance on the car rental pages of expedia , a travelocity competitor , a similar search yields a lowest rate of 1799 on the car details page , in a list of other information , is a link for taxes and insurance there , users learn of a 13 percent sales tax , an 11 percent concession recovery fee , and a facility charge of 220 a day nowhere is the total charge of 2450 shown not even when the customer books the reservation according to travelocity s chief operating officer , michelle peluso , the company s new system took roughly a year to develop we knew customers wanted to see the total price , she said we have tons of information from our call centers about the frustration consumers feel when they 're at the rental counter and they see all those extra charges to show its online visitors the total price , travelocity worked last year with its parent company , sabre , which distributes information about car rental , hotel and airline inventory to travel agents like other socalled global distribution services , sabre had long relied on a system in which suppliers listed base rates for their services , with taxes and other fees shown separately , as on expedia under the new approach , car rental suppliers agreed to calculate the fees and taxes up front , so sabre and travelocity could quickly show both the base rate and the total rate ms peluso said travelocity chose not to show the total rate first , or exclusively , because its competitors are still showing only the base rate because none of our competitors have this , she said , we did n't want our customers to look and say we 're more expensive the results have , so far , been positive , ms peluso said the rate at which car rental browsers have booked has increased significantly since the new system made its debut , she said and the total number of customer service calls per booking has gone down dramatically , she added , so we 're building loyalty both expedia and orbitz , another travel site , said last week that they would create similar pricing approaches in their car rentals section this month according to barney harford , an expedia vice president , the company will put the actual price on the car details page , after a user has selected a base rate from the search results we have n't ruled out putting that price on the first page , he said there are some technology projects we have under way to try to do that a more interesting problem awaits in the hotels category , where online travel agents have continued the industry tradition of showing a base rate , then adding fees that can total 25 percent of the base this happens even though the online travel agents often know the actual price for a room online travel agencies have in recent years adopted the socalled merchant model , in which they negotiate a set price with hotels including all taxes and fees and then mark up that wholesale price before selling the room to consumers expedia , like its competitors , shows the actual hotel rate only after a customer has selected a room from the search listings thus , a 149 room at the radisson lexington hotel in new york became a 175 room one click later mr harford said expedia s philosophy is to be as up front as possible however , he added , there s an overwhelming industry trend not to show actual prices first again , he said pricesensitive shoppers might stray to other sites if expedia showed the higher prices first but , he added , the company has n't ruled out showing the base price and actual price on the first page others in the industry see nothing wrong with initially shrouding the actual price take hotelscom , which , like expedia , is a unit of interactivecorp bob diener , president of hotelscom , said hotel taxes and fees generally added 10 to 20 percent mr diener said it would not make sense for his site to show the final price first , because consumers know there 'll be taxes added on when they 're ready to purchase , they 'll see the taxes anyway , mr diener said it s very easy to see it s just another click away but according to phil terry , chief executive of creative good , a internet consultant in manhattan , the company that moves first to a full disclosure policy on prices will have a significant , if temporary , advantage over the competition if everyone s doing it , you can ride along with the false sense that there s no problem , because customers do n't know they can expect something else , he said but a company can get a real advantage here , if they can figure out the operational and marketing issues and make a change most online merchandise sellers , mr terry said , have in the last year accepted the wisdom of displaying shipping and handling charges earlier in the process , partly because a few retailers broke ranks and began doing so a few years ago amazoncom has a longstanding policy of displaying shipping charges as soon as a product is in the shopping cart and can be grouped with other merchandise for shipping crutchfieldcom , an electronics retailer , has for years presented a chart of shipping rates on its product description pages whether online travel companies will similarly opt for full price disclosure during the initial stage of every transaction remains an unsettled question but ms peluso of travelocity said her company would try to be first to break the hotel industry tradition showing total price for hotels is significantly more challenging than for cars , but it s absolutely critical for us to get there , she said customers are more loyal to sites that do n't have any surprises at checkout photo travelocity is a leader among online merchants in trying to make it easy to see the total cost , including taxes and fees , of renting a car

many ferris wheel fans stay on the wonder wheel at the coney island boardwalk for more than one stomachflipping ride , but none take as many spins as kato , who most days rides the wheel from the moment it opens at noon until it closes at midnight then it s time for kato to get to work not that he has a long commute kato is a dog , a mix of german shepherd and akita , and when he s not riding the 150foothigh wonder wheel , which towers over the cyclone roller coaster , he s guarding it he s on the night shift , said dennis d vourderis , who with his brother , steve , owns the ferris wheel and 21 smaller rides and attractions surrounding it from midnight to noon , kato walks around the fencedin wonder wheel compound but when he s offduty and it is not raining or too cold , kato prefers riding the wheel to heading home to the dog run he shares with the park s three other guard dogs many people first spot kato as he spins past in his specially modified cagelike car , while they are waiting in line they think it s quite comical , dennis vourderis said they try to get his attention , and then they see his head pop up sometimes he just barks at people in line before he started working at the wonder wheel about 10 years ago , kato led a more traditional canine existence he was a pet of one of the workers at the ride , anthony castello , who lives in gravesend , brooklyn mr castello said that when his landlord told him he could not have a dog , he gave kato to the vourderises although kato shares his guard duties with other dogs , he is the only one allowed to ride as is the case in many workplaces , the plum assignments are the hardest to get the dogs have to work for it , dennis vourderis says and kato has seniority while the vourderises are pleased with kato s work , it seems that in one respect he may not measure up to a predecessor , sunshine , also a shepherd mix who rode the wonder wheel until she died about a month before kato arrived mr vourderis said that when his father , denos , bought the ride from its original owner , fred garms , in 1983 , mr garms had said of sunshine , when she hears anything wrong with the wheel , she starts barking kato has his own customized car , one of eight stationary cars \( sixteen others swing back and forth as the wheel spins \) the vourderis brothers removed the benches to allow more room for kato , and for an allday buffet of water and dog food there is no restroom , though when he has to go to the bathroom , he starts barking , dennis vourderis said when the ride stops , kato comes off he said that no one is allowed to ride with kato i would n't like to sneak up on him at night , mr vourderis said he s not a vicious attack dog , but he is a guard dog wheel workers say that many riders ask what kato is doing , not out of fear , but out of concern for the dog they 'll say , 'is n't he scared \? ' 'wo n't he get sick \? said reggie pryor , the park s manager mr vourderis said that last summer an aspca inspector and a camera crew from a show on the cable television network animal planet arrived to investigate after a complaint that a dog was being mistreated because he was in one of the wonder wheel s cars hour after hour he said that when he took them over to see kato , he was laid out there , cool as a cucumber this dog s got it better than most humans , mr vourderis said he s comfortable up there and having a good time , and it s at least 10 degrees cooler up there than it is down here the kids all ask about the dog who rides the wonder wheel , said steve vourderis s wife , stacy , who sells tickets but when things are busy , mr pryor said , he and his staff do not have the time or energy to explain after you 've been asked for the 150th time in a day , he smiles , we just tell people he has a season pass photos the 150foothigh wonder wheel at coney island a worker checks on kato between rides at the wonder wheel , where the dog has his own car \( photographs by nancy siesel the new york times \)
tonight at avery fisher hall the national chorale is opening its season with carl orff s carmina burana nothing special about that the national chorale and several other local amateur choruses , not to speak of hundreds or thousands more around the country and world , sing carmina burana most every year o fortuna , as the opening chorus would have it good luck for orff and his heirs except that fortuna does n't refer to good fortune , but to fickle fate and orff s fate has been far more fickle than the seeming success of carmina burana might suggest it s easy to see why this score is so popular a bawdy , romantic evocation of medieval lives and loves , it rewards lusty singing , it pleases audiences and it has cachet as a certified 20thcentury choral masterpiece but cachet in only some quarters orff \( 18951982 \) is not a wellrespected composer connoisseurs think he is derivative of stravinsky in his bawdy \( russian \) medieval phase , especially with les noces , in which stravinsky depicts a traditional russian peasant wedding worse yet for orff s reputation , most people who think about such things assume he was a nazi before carmina burana got so popular in modernday new york , it was vastly popular in late1930 s germany nazi propagandists trumpeted it as a celebration of german folk vitality and hence of the aryan spirit but i come to praise caesar , not to bury him i love orff s music , which ranges far beyond the catchy choruses of carmina burana and modern scholarship has shed new light on orff s politics , which were far more complex than simple stigmatization would have us believe carmina burana was first staged in frankfurt in 1937 , and was violently attacked by the nazi party newspaper , der v lkische beobachter , as degenerate music akin to negro jazz \( which some upperlevel nazis enjoyed avidly in private \) this disapproval did not constitute an outright ban , however , and several notable conductors , among them karl b hm and herbert von karajan , championed the score nazi opinion was hardly unanimous in cultural matters the traditional nationalist conservatism of alfred rosenberg , reflected in the initial carmina burana review , gave way to the more modern trendiness of joseph goebbels the nazis needed composers they could crow about after so many of germany s good ones , jewish and nonjewish , fled the country eventually orff s score began receiving good reviews from the german press , and by 1939 it had attained a popularity equal to the status it now enjoys worldwide orff was not a nazi , although he collaborated with party members and even , egregiously , consented to write new incidental music to a midsummer night s dream after the beloved score by mendelssohn , a jew , was deemed tainted after the war he clearly exaggerated his antinazi activities to american interrogators but politically he seems more guilty of careerism than racial fanaticism \( michael kater , the author and scholar , documented that orff was oneeighth jewish \) the american musicologist kim kowalke has shown that a decade before carmina burana orff used the same vigorous , supposedly aryan musical idiom in settings of leftwing political poems by bertolt brecht and others after the success of carmina burana orff turned out catulli carmina \( 1943 \) and trionfo di afrodite \( 1953 \) , forming a trilogy first performed at the salzburg festival in 1953 neither successor lived up to the popularity of carmina burana , however , and neither is often heard outside of orffcentral , which was the salzburg festival but in recent decades has been his native munich lamentably , more interesting orff compositions are less known , and taken together they suggest a powerful and individual sensibility that easily transcends charges of undue indebtedness to stravinsky there are versions of monteverdi operas and ballets from the 1920 s , and the ravishing school work , composed with gunild keetman , an unapologetic nazi this music is so charming and pedagogically sound that it is still used worldwide today , limited only by the expense of the required instruments , largely xylophones and percussion years ago angel records released a now outofprint album called music for children , consisting of selected school work songs in english it was so lovely that i gave it to all my friends for christmas but orff s heart was on the stage his catalog contains all manner of stage works , oddly none designated as operas some are ambitious and strange , like de temporum fine comoedia , which had its premiere at salzburg in 1973 some are quirkily bavarian , and others are still popular in german opera houses , like der mond \( 1939 \) and die kluge \( 1943 \) orff s libretto for die kluge , composed as things were starting to go seriously wrong for hitler , includes the following lines , sung by clever vagabonds and cited here in william mann s translation fides is struck dead justitia lives in great penury pietas lies on straw humilitas cries blue murder superbia is the winning candidate patientia has lost the battle veritas has flown up to heaven honor and virtue have crossed the sea purity goes abegging tyrannis wields its scepter far and wide invidia has broken loose caritas is naked and bare virtue s been driven out of the country dishonor and wickedness have stayed behind one wonders what the firstnight audience in frankfurt back in 1943 thought of all that for me orff s greatest works are the three settings he made of greek tragedies for chanting opera singers and huge , percussiondominated orchestras antigonae \( 1949 \) and oedipus der tyrann \( 1959 \) were sung in h lderlin s german translations of sophocles prometheus \( 1966 \) was in the ancient greek of aeschylus these were honorable attempts to evoke the actual performance of greek tragedy , which we know to have been sung the tragedies gain awesome power when done this way the cosmic , measured outpourings of the orchestra and the stately chanting of the singers , rising to impassioned cries , are constantly gripping you can hear all this for yourself either in ferenc fricsay s febrile , intense live recording of antigonae from the 1949 salzburg premiere , the microphone placement oddly favoring the singers , or from the orffsupervised studio recording of the same work under ferdinand leitner , which is more balanced when i directed the lincoln center festival , i found a fellow orff enthusiast in kurt masur in the 1990 s the festival was locked into an arrangement with the new york philharmonic mr masur and i wanted to do antigonae , but the strange instrumentation proved intractable most of the philharmonic would have had to be paid for doing nothing antigonae is scored for six pianos and four more played by two people each , 16 mallet instruments , six flutes , six oboes , six trumpets , nine double basses and all manner of exotic percussion , including six large javanese gongs so enjoy yourselves guiltfree , you singers and audience members at tonight s carmina burana at lincoln center it is perfectly legitimate to like this music but if you do like it , you might want to venture further into orff s world the rewards there are great photo carl orff is much more than a single composition \( photo by columbia records \)
a few weeks ago i passed ben howland in the corridor of the metrodome in minneapolis his pittsburgh team had suffered a heartbreaking upset loss to marquette in the third round of the ncaa men s basketball tournament while howland seemed deeply discouraged , he did not seemed crushed there had been speculation for weeks that howland would leave pittsburgh after four seasons to move back home to california and become the head basketball coach at ucla howland wore an expression i thought of a man who had completed a mission and was taking on a larger one almost a week before the championship game , howland announced that he had agreed to become the ucla coach during a recent whirlwind coasttocoast recruiting trip , howland said that i had misread his emotions he said he was devastated by the loss i was really trying to be strong for my players , he said my players were crushed we had a real shot at winning the national championship this year i worked very hard to keep all the ucla talk to a minimum by completely playing it off i did n't want that to get in the way of the focus of our team i'm telling you now , if it would have meant the opportunity for us to continue to go on and win the national championship or get to the final four , i would have sacrificed the opportunity for my dream job for my playershowland s departure was the first of three major coaching changes in the process he became , perhaps unjustly , the symbol of a flawed system that allows coaches to leave for greener pastures but requires their former players to stay put or sit out a season if they leave a number of players have been critical of howland s move to ucla and roy williams s move from kansas to north carolina the most consistent criticism is how unfair the system is to incoming freshmen i told recruits last year , i had no intention , i totally intended to be at pitt forever , he said the only job i would have left for is this job it s being played up to be a bigger deal than it really is if a kid is really saying , 'there s no way i'm going to go to kansas because roy williams left' and he wants to stand up and do that , kids can get out of their letter it s just a matter of being strong about it i am less concerned with incoming players than the players left behind or players being inherited whether it is basketball or corporate america , inherited personnel live a precarious existence that usually has an unhappy ending should not the athletes whom howland left behind at pittsburgh have the same rights as howland to seek greener pastures \? howland thinks not i think it would be chaotic , he said a freeenterprise system , with players being able to bolt when their coach bolts , would hamper movement howland disagrees then you 're saying the coaches can never leave to go anywhere , that roy williams ca n't go home to north carolina , his alma mater , howland said i ca n't go home an hour and a half from my mom and dad where all my family lives because the whole team is going to leave and you 're not going to have a team to field the next year , because everybody can leave howland added , i worked my butt off to get an opportunity like this , which is a onceinalifetime opportunity howland is part of a threeprong makeover of the ucla athletic department that began last april when dan guerrero became the new athletic director guerrero fired bob toledo , the football coach , then dismissed steve lavin last month as the basketball coach he hired karl dorrell , a former ucla wide receiver and a former denver broncos assistant coach , to replace toledo howland was the big hire basketball is the face of ucla athletics the tradition and history of ucla basketball is second to none , howland said la is the secondlargest tv market in the united states it would be good for college basketball for ucla to be successful on a yearinyearout basis again for a lot of reasons williams left kansas to pursue his dream in chapel hill bill self left champaign to pursue his dream in lawrence howland left pittsburgh to pursue a dream in los angeles but ucla fans have dreams , too they dream of dynasties and championships it ca n't happen the way it did with coach wooden , howland said you think about 10 championships , 5 of them with walton and jabbar those guys are no longer fouryear college players anymore in this culture in this economy , it s not going to happen unfortunately , it s not that simple photo ben howland left pittsburgh to become the ucla coach \( associated press \)
merrill lynch moved yesterday to repair the damage from its latest burst of management turmoil by rehiring robert j mccann as a vice chairman overseeing its brokerage and moneymanagement operations mr mccann , a longtime merrill executive who left five months ago and joined axa financial in june , will rank second only to e stanley o'neal , the chairman and chief executive merrill hopes that mr mccann s return will allay concerns about the high rate of turnover in the executive suite since mr o'neal beat out three rivals for the president s job in 2001 mr o'neal s victory in that derby set off a series of departures of executives who were considered his enemies and even some who were seen as his confidants over the last two weeks , merrill s vice chairman , thomas h patrick sr , and the president of its investmentbanking unit , arshad r zakaria , have resigned abruptly hiring mr mccann allows mr o'neal to reassure merrill s directors that there is no shortage of managerial talent to back him up still , mr o'neal , who became chief executive in december 2002 , reiterated that he does not intend to fill the president s position , a slot traditionally reserved for the heir apparent to the chief executive , for five years henry mcvey , an analyst with morgan stanley , said he saw the move as intended more to calm existing nervousness , not so much as an indication that mccann is the next president of the firm mr mcvey said he thought that mr mccann would try to improve links between merrill s brokerage and assetmanagement units and add to the menu of investment products merrill offers to its customers probably , o'neal is looking for somebody who can be the oil in the machine , somebody who provides some of the familiar leadership that employees are looking for , mr mcvey said in less than two years , several senior executives have either quit or been forced out unlike mr mccann , most of the others have gone away so angry at mr o'neal that they probably could not work with him again in interviews and meetings with employees yesterday , mr o'neal and mr mccann said that they had stayed in contact and maintained cordial relations through mr mccann s departure in march and his brief employment as a vice chairman of axa financial i regretted losing him at the time , mr o'neal told employees yesterday , adding that he was very happy we were able to attract him back to the firm mr mccann , 45 , said he had no intention of leaving axa until mr o'neal came calling and would not have left for any other job on wall street christopher condron , the chief executive of axa financial , and other axa officials were disappointed but understanding , mr mccann said in an interview an axa financial spokesman said we wish him well in his new position mr mccann said had not yet heard about mr patrick s departure when mr o'neal called him , hoping to lure him back over dinner last week and more conversations during the weekend , mr o'neal drew up the new job for mr mccann , offering him a significant promotion from the position he had held last year when you 've been at merrill since you were 23 and stan reaches out in this way and offers a position of such authority , you have to give it serious consideration , he said current and former merrill executives predicted that mr mccann s rehiring could create more friction at the top of the firm james p gorman , who runs the firm s brokerage unit , and robert c doll , who runs its assetmanagement business , have reported directly to mr o'neal now , they will report to mr mccann , who will report to mr o'neal but merrill officials dismissed talk of added friction mr gorman said in an interview that he would stay at the firm and that he welcomed mr mccann i think it s going to work well , mr gorman said we clearly need more senior leadership in a company of this size and complexity mr mccann was popular among the stock traders and sales people he grew up with at merrill along the way to running the firm s equity business mr o'neal picked him to run the firm s research department after some of merrill s analysts ran afoul of eliot spitzer , the new york attorney general merrill agreed to pay 200 million in penalties to end a broad investigation into analysts' conflicts of interest but mr mccann , who reported to mr patrick , wanted a bigger role and more responsibility when none was offered , he quit , landing later at axa now he is in the running to be the next president of merrill and , possibly , its next chief executive , though mr o'neal clearly

brussels , may 21 the european commission fined deutsche telekom 126 million euros , or 147 million , today for overcharging competitors for access to its local phone network the commission , the yearround executive arm of the european union , said that from 1998 to 2001 , deutsche telekom charged competitors more for access to its network than it charged its retail customers saying that this made it impossible for rivals to compete , the commission concluded that deutsche telekom was abusing its dominant position during this period the company attracted regulators' attention before other former state telephone monopolies because germany was the first european union country to try to deregulate its telecommunications market , opening it to competition but five years after deregulation was introduced , deutsche telekom still controls 95 percent of the german phone market that includes fixedline phone links , highspeed internet access and data transfer services the commission noted that while wholesale rates were reduced in 2002 and again at the beginning of this month , deutsche telekom was still unfairly squeezing rivals' profit margins it gave the company two months to reduce wholesale rates further , or face further sanctions many new entrants have tried to compete with the incumbent operator , said mario monti , the european competition commissioner none of them has been able to reach a significant market share deutsche telekom said it did not understand the rationale of the commission s decision all prices are set by the german regulator , a spokesman , hans ehnert , said he added that the company would check the situation before issuing a more detailed response to the decision the commission acted in response to complaints from 16 competitors in 1998 and 1999 it declined to disclose the names of those filing the complaints , but these are said to include companies that set up fiber optic telecommunications networks in western german cities including cologne , d sseldorf , dortmund and hanover the rivals' fiber optic lines do not extend beyond local phone exchanges , which is why they need access to deutsche telekom s last mile phone lines to homes and businesses to compete for subscriptions to services like highspeed internet access a european union law on opening local phone networks was passed at the end of 2000 , but progress in other european markets has been even slower than in germany a survey conducted by the commission in november showed that only one million phone lines in the 15 nations of the european union had been opened to competition some 855 , 000 of those are in germany and britain has only 1 , 500 local phone lines where rivals are competing with the bt group , formerly the monopoly widely known as british telecom in many countries , there is almost no takeup by competitors , the commission s spokesman on competition matters , tilman l der , said the fact that we are taking action against germany today does n't mean there is a special problem in the german market it just means that deutsche telekom was legally obliged to unbundle its local loop before other former state monopolies mr monti warned other former monopolies that similar antitrust investigations against them could follow we are determined to be vigilant on any infringements of this nature , he said photo a european commissioner , mario monti , warned of more inquiries \( associated press \)
the arrest of mikhail b khodorkovsky , the head of yukos , the largest oil company in russia , and the country s richest man , is bound to unnerve even the most stolid of investors in russia , bankers and market observers say two words , predicted one investment banker in moscow , when asked how he thought investors would react capital flight mr khodorkovsky was arrested by special forces , who took him off his private jet and straight to court he was charged with fraud , forgery and tax evasion , and could be held for up to two months before prosecutors decide whether to pursue a trial lawyers for mr khodorkovsky said they would file an appeal this week if mr khodorkovsky remains in jail , some analysts estimate that the russian stock market could drop 5 to 10 percent on monday , and that oil stocks would remain under pressure for months a drop of that amount would mean the russian stock market will have sold off roughly 20 percent from highs set earlier this month even the united states ambassador to russia , alexander vershbow , said on sunday that the arrest of the yukos chief could negatively affect russia s investment climate and raise new doubts among both foreign companies and potential investors the arrest escalated a government investigation that began last summer into yukos , an inquiry that company and analysts have said was politically motivated mr khodorkovsky , one of the russian oligarchs a class of powerful , selfmade businessmen who emerged in the mid1990 s apparently fell out of favor with president vladimir v putin , who wants the oligarchs to steer clear of politics others who have inspired the wrath of mr putin , like vladimir gusinsky and boris berezovsky , two media tycoons , live in selfimposed exile mr khodorkovsky s arrest comes after a charm offensive begun by the russian government to woo foreign investors into russia s oil sector for more than a year , the russians have portrayed themselves as a more stable supplier of oil than the middle east , and the government and private companies both have shown a greater willingness to cooperate with foreigners earlier this year , bp , the oil company , announced that it planned to invest more than 6 billion in a venture with the russian company tnk the russians sponsored an oil industry conference in september in mr putin s hometown of st petersburg , where he met executives from the world s largest oil companies moreover , it has been reported that exxon mobil , the world s largest publicly traded company , has been negotiating with yukos to buy a sizable stake yukos had indicated its willingness to sell up to 40 percent of the company to a foreign oil giant , a stake that at current prices would be worth about 25 billion it remains unclear what the arrest would mean for exxon mobil s interest in yukos , and a spokesman at the american company declined to comment on the negotiations and the arrest but experts of russian oil expect the arrest to have a chilling effect on foreign interest in the sector as a whole the government probably wants to send the ultimate message with the arrest of khodorkovsky that foreign companies are not welcome , said julia nanay , an expert on the russian oil business and a senior director at pfc energy , a washington consulting firm it is saying , 'it s too difficult for you all to be here as long as russia has experimented with free markets , its citizens and its leaders have shown profound ambivalence about foreigners investing in the economy , especially the oil and gas industry many russians consider their patrimony the detention of mr khodorkovsky seemed to become a greater possibility , one that he himself discussed publicly , as the news of foreign companies negotiating to buy part of yukos became more credible i believe there is no more significant indicator of the dangers facing foreign investors than the khodorkovsky case itself , because the state procuracy has shown its willingness to depart from rule of law , said robert r amsterdam , with the toronto law firm amsterdam and peroff , who represents two of mr khodorkovsky s yukos colleagues who were arrested earlier this year this is the signal that politics has trumped even the appearance of rule of law not only would the sale of a slice of yukos put control of some of russia s oil wealth in foreign hands , ms nanay noted , it would also legitimize the wealth that many russians feel that mr khodorkovsky and others amassed unfairly through the insider deals that had shaped russian privatization in the mid1990 s until now , the russian oil companies have very ably revived production in fields where output plummeted with the dissolution of the soviet union , all without significant foreign investment to develop new fields and more difficult fields , if russia really wants to increase production and export more oil , it would make sense for foreign companies to come in and develop them , ms nanay said but i do n't know if the russian government has made up its mind that wants to increase production from where it is russia s business elite fretted that mr khodorkovsky s arrest signaled a broader attack on them , rather than the conventional wisdom , that the oil baron was a rival to the kremlin s power the russian union of industrialists and entrepreneurs , an organization similar to the business roundtable in the united states , organized an emergency meeting on saturday to parse out a reaction and their answer , said anatoly chubais , the head of ues , russia s largest electric utility , was unequivocal mistrust russian business not only oligarchs but also medium and small businesses mistrust the political leaders in russia , he told a weekend television program i want business to understand if it has a future , or if its future is similar to khodorkovsky s fate but those fears may be overstated the big picture is about getting this place strong economically and embedded with the west , said alasdair pm breach , chief economist at brunswick ubs in moscow the arrest of khodorkovsky is a logical followthrough of this buildup of conflict between him and the president , he added , explaining that if another oligarch had been arrested , it would actually have been worse strategists said that investing in russia is still predicated on politics people forget that this is an emerging economy , said chris j weafer , chief strategist at aton the question for investors is are you investing in a bigger venezuela or something that turns out like malaysia \? as majority owner of yukos , mr khodorkovsky s net worth totals roughly 8 billion , according to forbes magazine in 2002 , forbes listed 17 billionaires from russia , up from none in 2000 now the fate of yukos may ultimately rest in mr putin s hands it may be that exxon mobil or another company still comes in as a white knight to buy yukos the question , says mr breach of brunswick ubs , is whether putin wants that to happen photos mikhail b khodorkovsky , the chief of yukos oil , was arrested over the weekend on charges of fraud , tax evasion and forgery his lawyers plan to file an appeal \(

indianapolis , dec 14 the atlanta falcons' media guide describes michael vick as houdini in cleats against the indianapolis colts on sunday at the rca dome , vick pulled a disappearing act in only his second start of the season , vick performed none of the tricks that have made him one of the nfl s most exciting players it was the colts , not vick , who seized the spotlight they led by 240 at halftime and went on to win , 387 , earning their fourth playoff berth in the last five seasons in three years of playing , this was the worst game that i ever had , said vick , who was 6 of 19 passing for 47 yards and ran 4 times for 30 yards why \? i do n't know but i'm looking forward to bouncing back the colts \( 113 \) knew exactly why vick was not himself on defense , they applied constant pressure , sacking him four times twice on the first series of the game and intercepting him once on one play , colts linebacker rob morris chased vick out of the pocket and matched him step for step does this make morris the nfl s fastest man , a title often reserved for vick \? technically , i guess so , morris said with a laugh i must have had an angle on him vick , who missed the first 12 weeks of the season with a broken right leg , said , we really could n't get the running game going in his first start of the season , last week against the carolina panthers , vick rushed for 141 yards while vick fizzled , colts quarterback peyton manning sizzled , passing for five touchdowns on the colts' first offensive play of the game , manning hit reggie wayne for a 14yard touchdown later in the first quarter , a 4yard strike to brandon stokley gave the colts a 140 lead the two scores also gave manning , who entered the game with 23 touchdown passes , an nfl record he is the first player in league history to pass for at least 25 touchdowns in six consecutive seasons he entered the game tied for the record with dan marino and brett favre i think , as a quarterback , if you are throwing touchdowns , you are helping your team score points and you are helping your team win , said manning , a sixyear veteran who was 25 of 30 passing for 290 yards against the league s worst defense manning noted that the falcons \( 311 \) were coming off a tumultuous week five days ago , they fired coach dan reeves wade phillips has taken over for the remainder of the season , but he had little time to prepare for sunday s game while vick said he did not think the firing of reeves had an impact on the falcons , philips had a different take my worst fears came to be in that the coach gets fired in the middle of the week and there s a big letdown , phillips said i felt like there was that in the first half the falcons played atrociously in the first half , compiling 28 yards of total offense though vick said his leg was not bothering him , he ran the ball only twice for 1 yard during the first 30 minutes maybe i did n't run enough , he said the colts , meanwhile , fired on all cylinders during the first half marvin harrison caught a 17yard touchdown pass and had 101 receiving yards , while edgerrin james rushed for 106 yards on 15 carries all before the break harrison finished the day with 117 yards and 2 touchdown receptions , and james ended with 126 rushing yards it was the 17th time the twosome exceeded 100 yards in the same game the falcons scored midway through the third quarter , on t j duckett s 17yard run it s just a great feeling , said colts coach tony dungy , referring to the colts making the playoffs 'we wanted to come out and play well mission accomplished

sag harbor when the novelist william gaddis died in 1998 , literary critics ranked him as one of the premier 20thcentury american novelists he was compared to james joyce and herman melville he won the national book award twice and a macarthur genius grant for all that , his books were never widely read , considered too complex to attract a broad audience those who knew gaddis and the readers who managed to plow through his immense , complex books knew him foremost for his satirical wit but his friends are not entirely sure that gaddis , who once said his sense of irony was born of indignation , would have been entirely amused by a recently discovered stone carver s error in his epitaph this is just extraordinary because , of all the people who care about that kind of thing , there was gaddis in the center of them all , said carol phillips , a longtime friend and former managing editor of vogue magazine gaddis spent his last years in three mile harbor in east hampton his children commissioned the gravestone for his burial plot in oakland cemetery in sag harbor on the stone s front are carved his name , the dates of his birth and death , and his children s nickname for him , papa the back bears an excerpt from the recognitions , his 956page first novel , published in 1955 the attribution misspells the book s title the recongnitions i would hope he 'd get a big laugh out of it , ms phillips said of gaddis , not sounding convinced that he would have it certainly is an ironic wrapup for the life of such a meticulous writer deering yardley iii , who made the gaddis funeral arrangements and carved the headstone , said it was placed at least a year ago but the typo was not reported until last month , by an acquaintance of the late writer who happens to own the adjacent cemetery plot years ago , rosemarie haag bletter , an architectural historian , was married to a friend of gaddis she and her current husband , martin filler , an architecture critic , own a weekend house in southampton and bought a burial plot in sag harbor one night last month , on the way to a cocktail party , they made a detour to visit their plot like any sort of real estate in the hamptons , a plot in oakland cemetery carries some prestige george balanchine is buried there , as are the photographer hans namuth and other wellknown hamptonites who are scattered among more than three centuries' worth of local residents mr filler and ms bletter discovered that the gaddis grave was next to theirs , so they lingered a moment to read the quotation on the back of his headstone and the sun , which had kept so close all the day , sought before leaving it to fill the sky with color , a soft luster of pink , and then purple against the pure blue color which refined the clouds to their own shapes and then failed , discovering in them for minutes the whole material of beauty , then leaving them without light to mock the sky , losing form , losing edges and shape and definition , until soon enough with darkness , they disappear entirely ms bletter spotted the typo in the attribution first she said , 'oh my god , there s a mistake , mr filler said it s weird , a total blackhumor nightmare , to have a typo on a writer s tombstone , he said , not laughing at all word of the error circulated quickly among mr gaddis s many literary friends , reportedly reaching his children , matthew gaddis and sarah gaddis , within a few days they did not return calls for comment mr yardley , the stone carver , said he was unaware of any typo but recalled the gaddis stone for its unusually lengthy epitaph later , his brother , kenneth yardley , who is secretary of the cemetery association , said sarah gaddis approved the gravestone template but , he added , he hoped that the yardleys will be permitted to fix the mistake he said gaddis s friends and children have certainly visited the grave in the years since the stone was erected and none caught the mistake , until now they 're all so familiar with the passage that it probably needed a fresh eye , he said dorothy sherry , another of gaddis s writer friends , said she thought he would have been upset at first he would have thought that going down through time with a typo on his grave would have been awful and then he would have laughed , i 'd hope but it s pretty much set in stone now , is n't it \? she added photo william gaddis s tombstone misspells his novel the recognitions \( photo by deirdre brennan for the new york times \)
uniondale , ny , jan 30 what s going on here , islanders coach peter laviolette wondered just after the first period tonight he had seen his team pepper the canadiens with 15 shots from up , down and sideways he had seen montreal produce only six shots and yet , the canadiens led by 10 is this going to be one of those nights \? laviolette asked his assistant coach , kelly miller in a way it was , but not in the anxious way laviolette had wondered about after being shut out for more than twothirds of the game , the islanders struck for a pair of handsome thirdperiod goals 65 seconds apart and went on to a 31 victory at nassau coliseum the victory leapfrogged the islanders over montreal into the seventh potential playoff spot , of eight , going into the fourday allstar game break and it sets them up nicely for after the break , when they will play four of the first five games at home the canadiens are a tall , physical team , years removed from their classic socalled firewagon style of attackoriented play but they finally gave way to the islanders' scoring gems the islanders broke into the scoring column on a play set up by aleksei yashin s goalward rush he could not get off a shot , so he carried the puck behind goalie jos th odore after circling the net , yashin lateraled the puck to oleg kvasha , who rapped it home for a 11 tie but the islanders soon were hit by a penalty playing shorthanded normally dims a team s chances but the islanders are one of the league s best at scoring while a man short , and they did it for the ninth time this season , only 65 seconds after the tying goal it was rapped in by michael peca it was pretty fortunate to find the fivehole , the speed that it was going , said peca , using hockey terminology for the area between the goalie s pads the islanders have become a dangerous shorthanded team since laviolette arrived last season we had to change the mentality when we got here , he explained instead of the islanders' defense collapsing when it is shorthanded , we change the pressure we force it outward peca s tiebreaking goal was punctuated in the final minute by mark parrish s 20th score of the season into an empty net , sealing the 2 points for the islanders it did n't start off so well , though parrish hit the post once with a shot , and for most of the opening period his islander teammates hit th odore with a startling array of shots the islanders shot low and high , to his glove side , to his pads 15 shots in all , and none went in the canadiens were more efficient they had six shots at goalie garth snow , but found him down on the ice for one lapse , producing the period s only score it was fashioned on a centering pass from jo juneau to niklas sundstrom , who whacked the puck home while snow was flat , unable to make a saving move snow , who raised his record to 581 , will be the goalie for the immediate future because chris osgood \( 17134 \) is nursing an ankle sprain for another few weeks slap shots with the exception of a strike season , the islanders have not had a winning january in 10 years they were 8402 this month the islanders have a winning record at the coliseum over the canadiens , 282460 , but are 14349 in montreal

campaign finance filings put the number of people running for the new york city council this year at 127 , a relatively large field of candidates for a year in which none of the 51 incumbents are stepping down council members seeking reelection usually have a builtin edge in name recognition and fundraising that can discourage potential challengers but this year s council races are atypical for one thing , the incumbents have served less than two years , apparently causing insurgent candidates to see them as vulnerable for another , city council terms usually last four years , but they have been shortened to two years , as they are periodically , to allow the city to draw new council districts to reflect the population shifts in the 1990 census and finally , there has been uncertainty about whether incumbents will or will not be running for some of the seats last year , the council amended the term limits law to allow six members , including speaker gifford miller , to run for reelection this year that change in the laws was overturned by a state supreme court justice , and it was unclear in the weeks that followed whether the candidates could seek reelection last month , the appellate division of the state supreme court ruled in favor of the incumbents the court of appeals , the state s highest court , is expected to decide this week whether it will consider an appeal the tally of the candidates this year comes from the number of those who have said they will participate in the city campaign finance program in order to participate , candidates had to have their forms postmarked by monday the program matches most contributions of 250 or less with city funds at a 4to1 ratio for candidates who agree to spending limits two years ago , 301 candidates for city council seats registered to participate in the program but that was the first election when incumbents were affected by the city s term limits law , and more than three dozen seats had no incumbent seeking reelection this is a far cry from two years ago when hundreds of candidates had been planning their campaigns for years , said evan stavisky , a political consultant who usually works with democratic candidates on the other hand , with a third of the council running for reelection for the first time , some challenges have materialized and some came out of the woodwork at the filing deadline in the bronx , larry b seabrook , the incumbent councilman , appears to be on the way to face a rematch of the democratic primary of two years ago in that year , he won the nomination by slightly more than 100 votes over shirley saunders , a democratic district leader and an aide to representative eliot l engel ms saunders has registered with the finance board for this year s election also , in the bronx , two candidates filed with the board to oppose the incumbent , maria baez they include israel ruiz , the former city councilman from that district , and iris baez , whose son anthony was killed in a confrontation with police officers in 1994 in queens , five candidates have filed papers with the board in a district where they would challenge councilman allan w jennings jr last month , the queens democratic party took the unusual step of not endorsing mr jennings , the incumbent , saying it considered his behavior to be too unorthodox and unprofessional mr jennings said the party was taking action against him because he was too independent of the organization the party endorsed yvonne reddick , the district manager of community board 12 and a democratic district leader in queens in brooklyn , three candidates have registered to challenge councilman kendall stewart two of them have run for office before omar boucher , who ran for state senate last year , and sam taitt , who ran against mr stewart for the council seat two years ago in manhattan , councilman miguel martinez seems likely to face ydanis rodriguez , one of his opponents from the democratic primary of two years ago mr rodriguez is a former public school teacher who now directs a college preparatory program
salaheddin , iraq , feb 26 at the first meeting of top iraqi dissidents on iraqi soil in nearly a decade , an american envoy pledged today that the united states did not want to rule iraq and would rely on a broadbased opposition to govern the country if american forces invade zalmay khalilzad , president bush s envoy to the iraqi opposition , told the more than 50member advisory committee of the iraqi national congress that the iraqi people should govern their own affairs as soon as possible he told delegates privately that the transition to a democratic iraqi rule could start within two months of the end of a war mr khalilzad also delivered diplomatically calibrated statements designed , on one hand , to encourage turkey to join the coalition against saddam hussein , but , on the other , to warn turkey that it must respect american demands that all military movements in northern iraq and elsewhere be coordinated with washington , and that turkish troops agree to leave iraq after a war we would definitely like turkey to be part of the coalition , but we do n't accept any unilateral movement by any country , he said after the meeting the turkish parliament is scheduled to vote on thursday on whether to permit american combat forces to be based in turkey washington hopes to use the turkish bases in the event of a war with iraq but iraqi kurds deeply mistrust turkey , their powerful neighbor to the north , which has historical claims to some iraqi territory and a desire to control kurdish separatist forces there some kurdish leaders have vowed to fight turkish forces if they enter iraq without their permission mr khalilzad s presence here seemed to reassure the kurds , who oppose turkey s desire to send a large number of soldiers into northern iraq , ostensibly for border and refugee control during the persian gulf war of 1991 , more than a million kurds fled iraqi forces and washington imposed a noflight zone that has allowed the kurds to control northern iraq addressing the overwhelming hostility of some four million to six million kurds to a turkish military presence in their country , mr khalilzad also said that the concerns of our kurdish friends in northern iraq have been fully factored into our discussions with turkey with aspects of a turkishamerican political , military and economic agreement still under negotiation , turkey did not make it easy for either mr khalilzad and his small american delegation , or many of the 300 journalists and others here for the conference , to cross the border into iraq turkey refused to approve the full number of security officials that washington had requested to protect mr khalilzad , and delayed his arrival here by at least a day , american officials said wayne downing , a retired general and the administration s former head of counterterrorism , was recently turned back at the border , iraqi dissidents said the meeting itself was repeatedly delayed by political disputes with washington and the periodic reluctance of turkey , iran and syria to permit some delegates and the journalists to enter northern iraq from their territory as host to the gathering , the opposition also overcame a series of obstacles , including a history of internal feuding , terrorist threats from baghdad and militant islamists , and snowstorms that made the turkish and kurdish mountain passes treacherous the iraqi delegates , which included representatives from iraq s mosaic of ethnic groups , tribes , religious sects and ideologies and at least three women wore business suits and buried longstanding political rivalries and grievances in their prepared speeches today they often interrupted mr khalilzad s remarks with applause particularly wellreceived were his statements stressing america s commitment to a democracy and the right of all iraqis to choose their government you , the iraqi opposition , have dedicated decades of your lives to liberating your country , he said that moment is near the american envoy also sought to reassure ahmad chalabi a secular , shiite leader of the iraqi national congress and other delegates that washington did not favor replacing mr hussein with another general , through a military coup or any other means none of us want saddamism without saddam , mr khalilzad said mr chalabi and his supporters had previously criticized the administration s reported plans to impose a postwar military rule on iraq for as long as two years in an interview tonight , mr chalabi said mr khalilzad had told him that in the event of a war , the united states would be largely responsible for disarming iraq of weapons of mass destruction , debaathification a reference to mr hussein s ruling baath party and neutralizing the iraqi military but he also said that there must be no gap of sovereignty by iraqis in iraq that iraqis must be sovereign in iraq at all times , mr chalabi said hoshyar zebari , a leader of the kurdistan democratic party , which is responsible for the area where the conference is being held , noted that mr khalilzad had pledged that the administration would work with several task forces on plans for iraq s future , including a political task force that would advise on how to move quickly to a democratic iraq photo special envoy zalmay khalilzad , second from right , with opposition leaders jalal talabani , of the patriotic union of kurdistan abdelaziz alhakim , of the council of the islamic revolution in iraq massoud barzani , of the kurdistan democratic party , and ahmad chalabi , of the iraqi national congress \( ruth fremson the new york times \)
a dozen or so men walked out of the hyatt regency by the dallas airport last wednesday night holding in their hands the fate of the world s largest airline they were tired and anxious and hoarse , having spent 12 straight hours bargaining at a conference table in the hotel s basement over their heads , the silver jets of american airlines veered toward the runways , doing the work of the very company they were trying to save one man , donald j carty , walked from the hotel undoubtedly thinking ahead to his next meeting , this one with american s board of directors not only was the future of the airline at stake , but so was his job as the company s chairman and chief executive the leaders of american s three unions drove off to catch some sleep before the next morning s conference calls , when they would try to sell a new set of wage and benefit concessions to their boards what happened in that hotel , and the paths that diverged from it , ultimately pulled american airlines back from the brink of bankruptcy while ending mr carty s career at the company after more than two decades the boards of all three unions agreed by friday morning to accept 162 billion in annual wage and benefit cuts mr carty resigned at american s board meeting gerard j arpey , the 44yearold president and chief operating officer , was promoted to chief executive , while edward a brennan , a director at american and former chairman and chief executive of sears , roebuck , became chairman in one sense , the recent events that led to the fiery clash between mr carty and union leaders were unexpected because mr carty had tried to improve labor relations during his tenure as chief executive and just less than two weeks ago , the unions had come around to meeting him on substantial concessions but in another sense , the conflict was a consequence of the bursting of the late1990 s economic bubble that has wreaked havoc at many big companies to avoid bankruptcy , american had to ask workers to take cuts to make up for the excessive growth and wage hikes it encouraged before 2001 yet , the company continued to dole out what many people perceived as lavish pay to its top executives , then hid some of the benefits during negotiations , aware perhaps of how abhorrent enronera corporate behavior had become to average wageearners the outrage first exploded a week and a half ago , when workers learned that mr carty had hid from union leaders new executive benefits while he was negotiating for deep concessions the benefits socalled retention bonuses paid to seven executives and a 41 million pretax payment to a protected executive pension trust fund had been approved by american s board last year , but not disclosed until the company made a securities filing late on april 15 , just after two unions had already voted to take concessions and a third was finishing its vote infuriated , the transport workers union and the association of professional flight attendants said they would hold new votes , while the allied pilots association refused to sign off on the concessions mr carty retracted the cash bonuses on april 18 and apologized publicly last monday , although he said the company would keep the 41 million payment in the executive pension trust fund the unions were still fuming without their approval of concessions expected to take effect may 1 , the airline which lost 104 billion in the first quarter edged toward bankruptcy on tuesday afternoon , representative martin frost , a democrat in the dallas area , got a call from james little , president of the ground workers' union at american could congressman frost call a meeting of all the parties and act as a mediator \? mr little asked , as mr frost later recalled american executives immediately jumped at the chance , he said the groups walked into the hyatt around 9 the next morning mr frost and three other local members of congress first met with union leaders for an hour in the meteor room in the basement the union leaders said they were angry that mr carty had put them in an untenable position with their workers by duping them during negotiations i ultimately suggested to them , 'you do n't have time for another vote , ' mr frost said 'you ca n't take a 30day vote the company ca n't survive with the uncertainty' the union leaders then left the room in came mr carty , mr arpey and a couple of other managers mr carty admitted to the members of congress that he had made a big mistake , mr frost said , and wanted to find a way to work it out all of the parties sat down at the conference table at 11 am and began talking the union leaders told mr carty he had to give them something they could take back to their members , mr frost said an hour later , the executives and union leaders told the members of congress they were ready to negotiate among themselves mr frost said that a few of the union officials said they wanted mr carty to step down but none of the unions pushed for that
the nation s accounting rule makers took steps yesterday intended to make it harder for companies to hide debts and assets from their shareholders at the same time , the securities and exchange commission adopted rules aimed at changing other practices thrown into a harsh light by recent financial scandals the accounting group , the financial accounting standards board , adopted new rules for the accounting of specialpurpose entities , which are usually created to buy certain corporate assets a significant number of entities will be consolidated into the financial statements of the companies that created them , said edward w trott , a member of the board who led the effort he said the new rules certainly would have forced consolidation of the entities used by enron before that company collapsed enron s collapse gave specialpurpose entities such a bad name that the new rule even comes up with a new term , variable interest entity , or vie , to describe such vehicles they get that name because different investors in them have interests that will vary with the success of the enterprise under the old accounting practices , auditors permitted companies to keep such entities off their balance sheets if an outside investor put up all the equity , so long as that equity amounted to at least 3 percent of the total assets the new rule creates a guideline of 10 percent , but says that the auditor must assess whether any level of equity capital is enough to support the enterprise , given the nature of its assets , or whether a guarantee from the sponsor , like enron , is necessary for it to borrow the money it needs if the auditor believes that the guarantee is in fact needed , then the sponsor will have to consolidate the entity on its balance sheet even when companies are not required to consolidate an entity , more disclosures will be required concerning the maximum loss that the entity could cause mr trott said that one strategy he expected companies to use was to seek multiple guarantees in that case , if three companies provided the guarantees , none of them a majority , none of them would have to consolidate the people who really want to not have a consolidated vie can accomplish that , but they will spread the risk to more entities , mr trott said and those parties will be providing more disclosures i think this will improve financial reporting does it solve all the problems of consolidation \? the answer is no an earlier version of the proposed rule had a provision saying that if the equity owner operated a real business and consolidated the entity , then the company providing the guarantee would not have to do so that was scorned by critics as a rent a balance sheet provision and it was removed from the final draft now that entity would still have to be consolidated by the company providing the guarantee if that would otherwise be appropriate the sec votes came on rules the commission was required to issue under the sarbanesoxley law , passed last summer in response to a wave of corporate scandals the rules set forth requirements for the way a company can issue pro forma earnings numbers and make clear that it is illegal to issue such figures in a misleading way they also bar company executives from selling company stock at a time when employees in the company s 401 \( k \) plan are barred from doing so the most contentious of the new rules concerns company disclosures on whether the audit committee of its board has a financial expert on it an earlier version of the rule defined such an expert as a person who had been involved in auditing or preparing financial reports of a similar company the new version expands that definition to include many other people with financial expertise the rule requires a company to identify the financial experts on its audit committee , or explain why it does not have any it also states that being identified as a financial expert will not expose a director to any additional responsibilities or possible legal liabilities
beijing , april 3 in early march , when a new mystery illness started hopscotching around the globe , chinese health officials looked on in silence , as if to say , this has nothing to do with us at that point , china was already four months into an outbreak that officials later acknowledged was the same disease , severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars yet they insisted that the situation was fully under control , shared none of their data and declined to join international investigations only in the face of intense international pressure are the chinese now releasing valuable information to scientists from the world health organization , who were allowed in the country just a few weeks ago this week , the chinese government announced its count of new sars cases for march , bringing china s caseload to 1 , 190 , with 46 deaths the highest figures for any nation it also announced that the who team had permission to travel to the southern city of guangzhou , the epicenter and origin of the epidemic but once again , china s penchant for burying bad news and manipulating statistics for political ends has increased human suffering in the late 1950 s and early 60 s , historians estimate , tens of millions of farmers starved in the aftermath of mao zedong s disastrous experiment in collectivized agriculture during the great leap forward the policy continued unchecked because local officials , eager to please their superiors in beijing , reported only bumper harvests today , sars has presented these same kinds of officials with a similar choice to save people or save face with their bosses and until recently they chose the latter by january , chinese doctors in guangdong province already understood a lot about the disease s spread and how to control outbreaks if three months ago , they had shared that experience or allowed international experts in to aggressively look for the germ responsible , would so many be dying from canada to vietnam today \? world health organization officials greeted china s decision to now share such information with elaborate praise , although robert breiman , the team leader , acknowledged that earlier is better for disease investigations but many chinese have been disappointed in a statistical coverup that seems more suited to the maoera china of three decades ago i would have expected that with so much international pressure , the government would have quickly released more information they are sensitive to this but this time they 've still been tardy , said prof mao shoulong , a public administration expert at people s university in beijing the government s general attitude about public disclosure is that when there s a problem , unless there s a rule that requires disclosure , you do n't speak out statistical legerdemain is part of chinese practice and is widespread economic indicators are routinely inflated and disease cases or protest statistics are conveniently rounded down the lack of openness about the epidemic here was particularly confounding , experts said , because when the chinese released their data this week , the figures were encouraging in many respects the number of cases in guangdong province decreased throughout march , suggesting that sars outbreaks might burn themselves out but old habits die hard and chinese officials' secretive attitude on sensitive health matters stems , in part , from their longstanding emphasis on not wanting to cause panic among citizens or allow chaos in society and local and provincial officials do not want bad news occurring on their watch , since promotion depends almost entirely on pleasing their superiors to this end , statistics are often massaged or collected halfheartedly if the results are likely to be negative for example , the government has never collected good figures on the number of poor farmers with hiv in rural china , who were infected through unsanitary though officially sanctioned bloodselling schemes in the 1990 s government estimates are in the tens of thousands , though most researchers put the number at a million or more the problem is particularly serious with new or emerging medical problems , where reporting is not mandatory sars has now been placed in a category that requires daily reporting , the who team said with information captive to politics , the magnitude of a problem sometimes only emerges after years of denial in a 1975 disaster that only recently came to light , vast floods on the huai river killed tens of thousands when poorly constructed dams proved inadequate to contain floodwater to prevent news of the devastation from spreading , province officials diverted planes from the affected region , not wanting to upset or anger the ailing chairman mao of course , in a country now teeming with cellphones and computers , it is increasingly difficult to suppress bad news fully while the chinese press today started to run articles on the subject , until now such articles had been rare and appeared only in the englishlanguage editions most chinese learned of the epidemic not from their government but from cellphone messages in guangdong , cellphone users learned about a patient who had spread it to doctors as well as an ambulance driver phones are a mechanism of trust , professor mao of people s university said a friend passes on information and the friend believes it because of trust that he is a credible source of information , then adding , but another big reason why the people trusted their phones is the inadequacy of public information in the economic sphere , a result is that investing in china is a risky business as a health matter , poor statistics mean that serious unreported public needs are often ignored with sars , china s initial lack of openness means that the world health organization researchers on the way to guangzhou are playing catchup though they are grateful to have made what progress they have we are hoping to be a conduit to the rest of the world , which is anxiously awaiting to learn about china s experience , dr breiman said
willie mays played in 24 allstar games and , before most of them , he had a conversation with hank aaron and , before more than half of them , roberto clemente was part of the discussion , too mays said he , aaron and clemente would talk about how they needed to play as deep into the game as possible , pushing and prodding the national league until the outcome was determined imagine that \? three players who would later go into the hall of fame strategizing as if they were about to play threeonthree basketball against the irritating brothers from the house next door blow this exhibition game , willie basically said to hank and roberto , and nl will stand for neighborhood losers for one exasperating year we knew we had to keep playing until the game was decided one way or the other , mays said we played 10 , 15 innings sometimes the allstar game was important to us we were n't worried about setting records we were worried about winning the 72yearold mays , who might be the greatest living player unless it is his godson , barry bonds , did not care about other allstar records but he owns more than any player mays has more hits \( 23 \) , more atbats \( 75 \) and more runs scored \( 20 \) than anyone , and is tied for the most games played \( 24 \) , the most victories played in \( 17 \) , the most extra base hits \( 8 \) and the most total bases \( 40 \) he batted 307 with three homers and was twice named most valuable player they did n't mean much to me , mays said every time we won , that s what mattered and , behind the speedy , slugging mays , the nl won a lot mays and aaron combined to go 1651 when they played together as allstars while mays , aaron and clemente were 1021 when they played on the same team mays could not pick his favorite allstar memory , saying , i have a lot of them indeed ted williams once said the showcase game was created for mays it s a great compliment coming from the other club , mays said when someone from the other club is noticing , you do n't always know how to read it you do n't play for them you play for yourself i did n't take those things that seriously ted was one of my best friends mays still watches several games each night on his satellite dish and is familiar with all of the players in tuesday s allstar game in chicago , although he did not talk about any players who might have been snubbed when mays was asked if he thinks current players approach the allstar game with as much passion as he did , he raced away from the question as if he were chasing a ball at candlestick park i do n't do that , mays said you guys have to do that for yourselves i can only tell you what i did , how i played and how my teammates had fun obviously , mays s nonanswer was an answer he mentioned how players from his era received a ring or maybe a 125 gift certificate for being allstars , but distanced himself from discussing the lucrative bonuses some allstars earn these days interestingly , mays was blas about the new policy of letting the game determine homefield advantage for the world series you play three in one place and four in the other place , mays said it s only one game the homefield advantage in baseball , to me , i do n't understand i had to play as well on the road as i did at home after mays was gracious enough to field questions for 15 minutes , he asked if i had ever seen him play i answered affirmatively and mentioned being 8 years old when mays retired as a met in 1973 oh , you did n't see me when i was playing , mays said really playing obviously not my bad lopez , 94 , recalls '34 game al lopez will be 95 years old next month , but the former brooklyn dodger was still keen enough to speculate how the 1934 allstar game might have been a little different if babe ruth had played the entire game in right field ben chapman , ruth s replacement , cut off chuck klein s liner and held him to a runscoring single , which lopez termed a crucial play as the al won , 97 if ruth was playing , lopez said , i do n't think he catches it lopez can dissect ruth s defensive abilities so casually because he is the only living player from the second allstar game there are none from the first game so lopez , who played against ruth and lou gehrig and with frankie frisch and pie traynor , has memories that are golden naturally , lopez s most vivid memory of the game was carl hubbell s dominating stretch in which he struck out ruth , gehrig , jimmie foxx , al simmons and joe cronin lopez , a catcher who was 0 for 2 , was gabby hartnett s backup , so he witnessed hubbell s performance from the dugout it was amazing , said lopez , a hall of fame manager for the indians and white sox he was throwing a great screwball it was a pitch that guys did n't see too often lopez received no traveling expenses for the game at the polo grounds , but he did get a trophy he remembers the thrill of catching dizzy dean , which was slightly more memorable than the 74 he shot as a 74yearold golfer lopez has long felt that the allstar game should be a fun event , not a fierce competition and definitely not a game to decide the home field for the world series

united nations , june 2 the united nations weapons inspection office provided a postscript to its truncated mission today , suggesting in a new report that many open questions remain about whether and when saddam hussein s government destroyed its chemical and biological agents the report by the office of hans blix , the executive chairman of the united nations monitoring , verification and inspection commission , also noted that none of the vehicles on iraqis' prewar list of legitimate vehicles that could be mistaken for mobile biological weapons labs bore any resemblance to the two mobile facilities found recently in iraq overall , the report said , despite some late and limited iraqi cooperation , the long list of proscribed items unaccounted for and as such resulting in unresolved disarmament issues was neither shortened by the inspections , nor by iraqi declarations and documents in particular , the report said , there was no clear evidence how much anthrax and vx nerve gas iraq had possessed , and how much it had destroyed this assessment does not resolve the question regarding the total quantity of anthrax produced and destroyed by iraq , the report said as for vx , it said , accounting issues remain concerning the chemical the report , which was distributed to security council members today , seemed to have traveled through a time warp from the prewar period of bitter disputes between antiwar and prowar camps a time when every finding in earlier reports was cited in support of one side or the other but today , after allied inspectors have been combing iraq for weeks with little but the labs to show for it , there was scarcely a ripple of reaction to the united nations report the focus in the discussion of unconventional weapons in congress and elsewhere has shifted to the credibility of the intelligence work that led the secretary of state , colin l powell , to declare to the security council on feb 5 that iraq possessed large stockpiles of such weapons at a news conference in rome today , mr powell reiterated his conviction that there was no evidence that iraq had destroyed the unconventional weaponry it admitted to assembling before the persian gulf war in 1991 speaking alongside foreign minister franco frattini , he said there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq it was n't a figment of anyone s imagination iraq used these weapons against iran in the late 80 s , he continued iraq used such weapons against its own people in the late 80 s when the gulf war was over in 1991 , we found such weapons and destroyed some of them inspectors were in iraq for years and were forced to leave iraq in 1998 without getting the answers that were needed with respect to what weapons remained , where they were and what programs were still under way
landstuhl , germany , april 2 on the treacherous road to baghdad , serving behind the front lines is no guarantee of safety two marines who are being treated at a military hospital here were part of a supply company , shuttling ammunition and food to infantry units , when they were wounded in nasiriya last week they were hit after a command post they had set up at an abandoned gas station came under fire from nearby buildings these marines , who spend their days repairing trucks and cooking meals , suddenly found themselves ducking mortar fire , grenades and machine gun fire we were n't infantrymen , said first lt james uwins , who described the attack , in which he was wounded by shrapnel we were cooks , bakers and candlestick makers on the night of march 25 , however , the supply company of the second battalion , eighth marines , became a fighting force lieutenant uwins and his gunnery sergeant , bill hale , described a desperate encounter , with grenades and mortar fire raining down on their compound from three sides several marines scrambled to the top of earthen walls around the gas station to return fire others huddled between their trucks and a line of corroded oil tanks , trying not to get hit tracer fire crisscrossed the inky sky , accompanied by the harsh whistle of bullets the sky looked like a jigsaw puzzle , said sergeant hale , who was knocked off his feet by a thunderous explosion and is in a wheelchair with leg injuries it was like watching fireworks on the fourth of july , except that the flashes were 10 feet above your head sergeant hale , 35 , served in the first gulf war , but never fired his weapon he had been expecting little more in the way of action this time this battle was only supposed to last six hours , he said the attack was a fearful end to a day that had already been rife with problems the supply company had pulled into the gas station in late morning , after staying up most of the previous night , fixing vehicles that had broken down or been stuck in the mud during a torrential rain storm lieutenant uwins ordered a team of combat engineers with bulldozers to pile up earthen walls around the compound for good measure , he asked that a suspicious house across the road be destroyed by no means was it an unsecured area , said lieutenant uwins , a goodnatured 26yearold from south pasadena , calif in fact , it was looking like a good place to spend a few days after the marines had established machine gun posts on the four corners of the compound , lieutenant uwins and sergeant hale , who had scarcely slept in three days , began thinking about getting some rest suddenly , a rocketpropelled grenade blew through the passengerside door of an armored truck parked next to them shrapnel tore into lieutenant uwins s legs , peppering him up to his flak jacket the shrapnel in the leg took me out of the fight , he said i was pretty much a bystander after that sergeant hale , who was not injured in that explosion , managed to crawl behind a small concrete wall next to the tanks he applied a tourniquet to the left arm of one of his men , who had also been cut by shrapnel he and six other marines were pinned down by the gunfire sergeant hale spotted a possible escape route , leading to a sheltered area on the south side of the compound but it required leaping two small concrete walls and sprinting through an exposed area he sent his men in pairs , as other marines laid down a wall of covering fire then it was his turn when the last man got across , he gave me a thumbs up and said , 'gunny , we 're clear , we got you' sergeant hale took a deep breath and raced toward his mates after 25 feet , he heard a deafening explosion the next thing i know , i'm airborne , he said i was playing superman for about 15 to 20 seconds landed flat on my back after staring skyward for a few seconds , sergeant hale rolled over and tried to stand up , but collapsed two of his men dragged him to safety by the time the troops were able to call in an artillery strike to put down the iraqi attack , 31 of the 120 marines who had been trapped at the gas station were wounded miraculously , none died for sergeant hale , the future is uncertain he sustained injuries to his back , right leg and knee sergeant hale , from pennsauken , nj , has the castiron demeanor of an 18year veteran of the marines he says he will walk again the only question is , will i be able to walk normally , or like a cripple \? he said will i able to run around in my backyard with my son \?
after once owning shares in 18 companies , james keener , a 43yearold veterinarian from geneseo , ill , sold the last two of those holdings a few weeks ago these days , his money is in mutual funds dr keener used to watch the nightly business report on public television and do his own stock research now he watches the local news and leaves the details to his financial planner i think it s pretty darn hard for the little person , he said if enron crashes and a lot of people in wall street did n't see that coming , how is an individual investor supposed to know \? compared with the body blows that individual investors like dr keener have absorbed over the last three years , the 14 billion that 10 wall street firms agreed to pay this week for their role in the stock market bubble may be a slap on the wrist some financial experts say that the 7 trillion in stock market losses since the broad averages peaked in march 2000 have long since taught investors not to rely on the judgment of wall street analysts others say that hope s inclination to spring eternal means that for each newly cautious dr keener , there is an investor ready as ever to jump at the hint of a big market score either way , experts doubt that some of the new practices mandated by the wall street settlement like the requirement that brokerage firms make independent stock research available to customers will matter much to small investors i'm not sure , after all the dirty laundry was hung out , how much retail investors are looking at investment bank research anymore , said kei kianpoor , the chief executive of investarscom , an independent research firm that tracks analysts' stock picks burton g malkiel , the princeton economist whose widely read book , a random walk down wall street , argues that individual investors cannot expect to beat the market , said that he hoped the settlement would nurse a healthy distrust of most research by the time an individual investor gets information , whether it s tainted or not , it s already in the market price , he said there is some evidence that investors have a newfound interest in independent thinking about stocks for example , subscriptions to the research services of value line , well regarded by financial planners for its independent analysis , are up , even from the marketpeak days of early 2000 a charles schwab survey of active stockholders , to be released later this spring , found that 78 percent valued research from independent firms over analysis by wall street firms with financial ties to the companies they are rating yet it is harder to gauge how much interest investors have in following any of this advice it s still true that most individual investors do n't rely heavily on analysts , said jay r ritter , a professor at the university of florida who specializes in behavioral finance the most common is from friends , acquaintances and word of mouth some experts said that there is no evidence investors' behavior has been changed by the exposure of corporate and wall street wrongdoing americans have remarkably poor longterm memories , said lawrence e mitchell , a george washington university law professor whose books include one on corporate scandals i believe when the economy comes back and the market starts to rise again , as it inevitably will , people will jump right back in will they be more careful investors \? i kind of doubt it careful investing takes work a continuing study by the yale school of management that tracks investor confidence in stocks suggests a blithe spirit prevails , despite market losses more than 90 percent of those surveyed said that they believed that the market would rise in the next year , a level of support that has hardly changed in two years harold evensky , a financial planner in coral gables , fla , said he was surprised that none of his clients had called to discuss the wall street settlement , but he guessed that for many investors , it merely reinforced the downturn s harsh lessons investors have learned that it s not so easy , he said that there probably are no gurus that investing does indeed involve risk mr evensky said that while some people had abandoned the stock market , more seemed chastened but still eager to get back in these individual investors readily acknowledged their part in pumping up the market what he described as an aggressive na vet after all , he said , the market s boom and bust were fueled on investors who were willing to disconnect from what common sense told them was reality terrance odean , an assistant professor of finance at the university of california at berkeley , recalled that four years ago , when investors were riding high , his criticisms of executive compensation failed to resonate among business school students now sentiment has changed , he said , expressing his conviction that investors who have ridden the market down will not want to repeat the experience i 'll be surprised if we get another spate of the intensive speculation that we got in the late 1990 s in the near future , mr odean said you need more new investors to come of age , because there were a lot of people who really got their fingers burned it s going to be some years before you 'll have some significant fraction of investors who have never experienced a bear market dr keener , the illinois veterinarian , said he had become a more cautious investor and believed that other people had , too then again , he conceded , investors probably could help inflate another bubble under the right circumstances i hope they wait until another five years , he said , explaining that he would like the chance to ride the runup the way he had with an internet stock or two in the late 1990 s and then i 'll retire photo james keener , a veterinarian , once researched his investments but now leaves the details to a financial planner because it s pretty darn hard for the little person \( todd mizener for the new york times \)
muriel denton stood in her beauty salon on eastern parkway cradling a snapshot of a man with a white beard who smiled and squinted into the winter sun he s not no john doe , ms denton said in a soft caribbeanaccented voice he was n't dirty or anything i used to wash his hair sometimes as she was speaking , the man in the picture was lying in the morgue of kings county hospital he had been killed by a car outside her salon on a balmy evening just before halloween his name was carlos carlord williams , though people simply knew him as carlos , and he was homeless , with no known family and no savings beyond whatever he had panhandled on the day of his death but if carlos was homeless , it was only in the literal sense for over 30 years he slept most nights on a bench outside ms denton s shop near franklin avenue in crown heights , brooklyn , greeting people coming out of the subway , and stopping in at local stores to say hello and run errands every so often , a homeless person puts down roots that become so entwined in a community that the person becomes a fixture and , in the most important way , finds a sort of home latenight commuters feel a little safer knowing that someone familiar has an eye on them children stop to chat , and when they grow up , they wheel their own babies up to say hello carlos was able to do more for our community than a lot of men who had homes , said jennifer ladson , a 42yearold single mother when she could n't accompany her son jamal , now 16 , to the barbershop , carlos would do it he would take care of the children and the women , ms ladson added , and i hope the men learn from this , take a page out of carlos s book any neighborhood fixture inspires speculation , and carlos s life had many gaps people had heard he was a veteran they had heard he 'd been a science teacher \( in some versions , an english professor \) there was a cousin who used to stop by , and rumors of a sister who worked on wall street people of a certain age remember when carlos boxed at the eastern parkway arena , now closed , where floyd patterson trained ross larry , 53 , recalled seeing carlos in alligator shoes and sharkskin suits in the early 60 s around that time , vera walker , 76 , remembers him living on park place and taking three little boys to the main library and the brooklyn museum others say he had just one child , a girl it did n't really matter sometime in the 60 s , his wife and any children he had were killed in an apartment fire carlos tried to run in and save them , but they would n't let him , said hedy lide , who works at maiman s pharmacy , across the street from carlos s bench after the fire , he rarely talked about his family , and started living on the street some people surmised that his memories of the fire prevented him from going to a homeless shelter , even on the coldest nights he could n't stand to be closed in instead , he sat on his bench , reading poetry and the bible he was known for his honesty shopkeepers could give carlos a few hundred dollars to run an errand , and only after returning the exact change would he ask for a dollar or two for himself in return , the neighborhood looked after him in winter people brought comforters on holidays they invited him in for food it would be freezing out , ms lide said , and you 'd see him walking around with a new coat , and you 'd say , 'carlos , where 'd you get that coat \? ' and someone done gave it to him , she said the police said there had been complaints in the past about homeless people at that corner , but none of them were directed specifically at carlos , who died there on oct 28 one minute he was standing in the doorway of the pharmacy , chatting with the regulars near the chair where he often ate his breakfast a few minutes later , a car knocked him to the ground on eastern parkway and another ran over him neither driver was charged news of the accident traveled fast balloons soon decorated carlos s bench , along with posters that said we miss you , carlos and we 're sorry plastic roses were tied to two nearby trees on a protrusion in one trunk was an old black banana , which carlos , who liked to feed the trees a little of whatever food he had , had placed there a week or two earlier neighbors were told that if no one claimed the body within 30 days , it would be buried in potter s field crown heights , an africanamerican and caribbean community , is not a rich area but store owners took up collections two weeks after the accident , ms denton of the beauty salon had compiled a carlos contribution fund list , with the names of local residents and dollar amounts 25 , 20 , 30 by the end of that week , the fund was at 500 , enough to make a local funeral director , william armstrong , take note he cut his regular price by a third , and applied for money under the state s nofault insurance benefits program to cover the rest on a late sunday afternoon two weeks ago , more than 100 neighbors filed into the armstrong funeral home on st john s place below deep red curtains and huge white bouquets , carlos lay in a suit and tie , his beard and hair neatly trimmed , his features surprisingly delicate a young woman named nicole clemons lifted the white gauze over the casket , tucked a dollar bill inside , and patted carlos s arm you know , he was always asking for a dollar , she explained among the mourners were children and the elderly , women in ruffled dresses and large hats and men in jeans and sweatshirts the group included a woman who had driven three hours from delaware , a formerly homeless man who used to sleep on a bench next to carlos , and an elderly man from panama , where carlos was born there were whispers , later confirmed , that geoffrey a davis , the brother of the slain councilman james e davis , had come to pay his respects another attendee , letitia james , who recently defeated geoffrey davis in his bid for his brother s seat , promised to make up any unpaid bills for the service and the burial in forest green park cemetery in morganville , nj amid the eulogies and gospel singing , there was also acknowledgement that carlos could be a pain carlos would ring my bell at 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 at night and he 'd want a dollar , said doris wellington , 78 , drawing laughs of recognition and if i let him in , he wanted two dollars charles henderson , a postal worker wearing a tie pin and holding a fedora , gazed at the coffin and murmured something about not just walking by a homeless person on a bench because that same person you see there could be you tomorrow photos carlos williams , far left , had no roof over his head , but he made countless friends children wrote him notes after he died last month , left , and two weeks ago more than 100 neighbors paid their respects at his funeral , inset and bottom \( photos by top , chester higgins jr the new york times above and inset , vincent laforet the new york times \)
there are some hardships that most small businesses face a crumbling economy , cranky customers , sluggish suppliers , errant employees , annoying accountants and , of course , the internal revenue service then there are the problems that have afflicted a relatively small number of unlucky entrepreneurs , like losing their businesses because of terrorist attacks that has happened to olga diaz twice ms diaz is a hairdresser who owned a beauty salon in the marriott hotel in the world trade center it was completely destroyed on sept 11 , 2001 her previous salon was on the 44th floor of tower 1 in the trade center terrorists bombed the parking garage of the complex in 1993 though the damage from that attack was less physically devastating than the subsequent one , it was nearly as bad economically , ms diaz said recently for one , all her employees quit now , located a block from ground zero , she has once again reopened olga s salon and spa , using her innate persistence and new skills like applying for loans and grants i was determined that no one was going to knock me down , she said plus , what else was i going to do \? while her case is extreme , ms diaz s journey has been similar to those of hundreds of businesspeople in new york city who are still coping with the aftermath , financial and emotional , of sept 11 indeed , the shock waves from the attack on the trade center are still being felt at small businesses nationwide , especially in industries like travel and tourism nationally , small businesses are generally cautious in today s business climate , said marc m goloven , an economist with j p morgan chase , the wall street bank and securities company new york , he said , is not terribly different from the rest of the country , except that the local economy is still contracting for example , the city s unemployment rate is still rising sharply it just hit 88 percent , while the national unemployment rate increased slightly to 6 percent in april , from 58 percent in march among the city s small businesses , mr goloven said , the hardest hit have been those that cater to travelers and tourists and financial workers like stockbrokers , banking managers and insurance executives all of those people were ms diaz s major clients and had been so since she went into business in 1984 born in puerto rico , she studied fashion in new york but relied on cutting hair to feed her family after a stint working at a barbershop in the trade center , she bought the salon on the 44th floor the place was bustling a bar and restaurant on the same floor drew a lot of customers , and they had to pass by me , she said many became clients , and she eventually had seven employees that changed after the 1993 bombing , which killed six people and injured more than 1 , 000 it really created a big problem for me , financially and emotionally , ms diaz said her employees , who had to walk down from the 44th floor in heavy smoke , were too traumatized to return to the salon tight security made it impossible for casual customers to walk in , and it discouraged even longtime clients though the port authority of new york and new jersey found ms diaz a better location in the trade center , her lawyers missed a crucial lease deadline , she said , and in 1995 she ended up working out of her apartment then , through a friend , she heard that the hotel , at 3 world trade center , might be willing to house a salon after much persistence and phone calls , a 20 , 000 loan and all her credit cards , ms diaz opened her salon there in 1996 it was a tiny little corner , almost a closet , she said , adding that after her renovations , a lot of people used to call it a jewel box customers included hotel guests , workers from the two towers and people who came to the hotel for weddings and other events , she said it was going well and everything was paid for , she added her only concern was whether the hotel would renew her lease then , once again , terrorists struck , this time with more catastrophic results none of ms diaz s employees were killed , but many customers died , and she cannot talk of them without weeping when she heard of the early morning attack while visiting her mother in florida , she said i went on my knees and i cried i knew my clients did n't have a chance she lost not only her chairs , equipment and etched mirrors , but also her records , licenses and client lists and she was displaced from her apartment for three months \( she lives in battery park city , near ground zero \) despite everything , she said , i started looking for a new place right away i was on a mission to survive but finding a spot was hard and paying for it harder her insurance on the salon had lapsed while she looked for a new broker the united states small business administration turned down her loan application \( fewer than half of those who applied were accepted \) she eventually got a 25 , 000 grant from seedco , a nonprofit assistance corporation in manhattan , and a small but critical loan from the brooklyn economic development corporation in august , she reopened her salon on the second floor of a building on cortlandt street near ground zero , in a space she found herself for the most part , ms diaz is back to worrying about the things smallbusiness owners worry about that the signs on her building are so cluttered that passersby will not see hers that competition from less expensive nail places will put more pressure on manicure prices that the poor economy will prompt more customers to pinch pennies there are still lingering 9 11 issues one is that the grants she and others received have been declared taxable and , of course , there is the possibility that not enough people will return to the wounded streets of lower manhattan to make her business a go but she is optimistic little by little , people are coming back , she said i see this thing as a longterm situation i keep high hopes photo undaunted olga diaz has reopened her beauty salon a block from ground zero \( carrie boretz for the new york times \)
albany , nov 4 gov george e pataki nominated a republican trial lawyer from manhattan on tuesday to fill a vacancy on the state s highest court the nominee , robert s smith , belongs to the conservative federalist society but has also argued against the death penalty before the united states supreme court if ratified by the state senate , the governor s decision to put mr smith , who is 59 , on the court of appeals would mean not only that the sevenmember court would retain a republican majority but that none of the judges would come from the northern or western part of the state mr smith would also be one of the few lawyers in the court s history to be appointed to the court without having any experience as a judge the last was the current chief judge , judith s kaye , whom former gov mario m cuomo put on the bench in 1983 mr pataki s decision came as a shock to law professors and others in legal circles who watch the court of appeals for months , word had circulated that james m mcguire , the governor s counsel , was mr pataki s favorite candidate for the opening , but when the commission on judicial nomination released its list of seven approved candidates in midoctober , mr mcguire s name was not among them mr smith s was in choosing mr smith , governor pataki passed over three sitting judges on the commission s list among them was justice eugene f piggott jr , the presiding justice of the state appeals division , fourth department , in buffalo and a prominent republican justice piggott had the strong support of politicians from western new york and was widely viewed as the frontrunner before today s announcement , experts on the court said smith really was the stealth candidate through this whole thing , said prof vincent m bonventre , a law professor at the university of albany who wrote his dissertation on the court governor pataki said tuesday he was not worried about mr smith s lack of experience on the bench he also said he had used no oneissue tests to decide among the seven candidates the nominating commission had recommended neither party affiliation , nor position on the death penalty , nor other political leanings influenced his choice , he said i do n't believe in litmus tests , mr pataki said i believe in people of character , wisdom and intelligence people who understand the law , and that is what we have the governor added he had the utmost confidence in mr smith s abilities i absolutely believe that bob smith will become one of those outstanding legal minds and judges who people a long time from now are going to say , 'thank god he is on the court of appeals' during his long career , mr smith argued several precedentsetting cases before the court of appeals but it was his work on behalf of two convicted murderers sentenced to death in texas and virginia that received the most attention in 2001 , he won an important decision from the united states supreme court in the case of johnny paul penry , a mentally retarded man condemned to death in overturning the death sentence , the court accepted mr smith s argument that the jury had not been allowed to take into account all the mitigating evidence regarding mr penry s mental status yet mr smith says he has mixed feelings about the death penalty himself when he agreed to take on some death penalty cases without pay in the late 1980 s , he said , he was firmly against the practice , but since then his views have become less firm despite the fact that i have done a lot of death penalty work , i do not have rigid views on the death penalty , he said tuesday as his nomination was announced in any event , obviously , as a judge my personal views on those matters are my private views he said that he began adult life as a liberal democrat , but became a republican in 1988 and has become active in the federalist society for law and public policy studies , whose members are committed to a limited role for the federal judiciary he is also a big donor to republican campaigns since 1999 , he and his wife , dian g smith , have given 60 , 000 to governor pataki , and 51 , 000 to the state republican committee mr pataki maintained on tuesday that he did not know mr smith s political affiliation when he made the decision to nominate him , a decision he said he made the night before since 1995 , mr pataki has named five judges to the court of appeals , all staunch republicans one of them , judge richard c wesley , retired to take a position on the federal bench , leaving the current opening the republicancontrolled senate still has to approve mr smith s nomination , but if history serves as a guide , senate majority leader joseph l bruno is unlikely to object to the governor s choice , his aides said the other candidates the governor decided against were justice steven w fisher , a queens democrat justice helen e freedman , a manhattan democrat guy miller struve , a republican lawyer who served as a deputy to the

abidjan , ivory coast , may 10 this much is known about the bizarre and horrifying airplane accident in congo on thursday the russianmade cargo plane that sits on the tarmac today at the airport in the capital , kinshasa , took off from here on thursday evening , and returned , not much later , after a rear door came unhinged in midair some of the passengers were sucked out of the plane and thrown to their deaths but everything else is more uncertain today than it was on friday , when the first reports of the accident came in that includes how it happened , when it happened , how many were on board and how many lived and died the estimates of total casualties range from none to 7 to more than 120 the plane , an ilyushin 76 , was being used to ferry congolese soldiers and their families from the capital to the southern city of lubumbashi , home to a large military base the country s communications minister , kikaya bin karubi , who told reporters on friday that the death toll was seven , said today that the number could rise once a preliminary military investigation was concluded some survivors , interviewed in a kinshasa hospital , said many more passengers had been killed unidentified airport officials , quoted by wire service reports on friday , had put the number of casualties at 129 crew members were not available for interviews no one seemed to know exactly how many people were on board it could take months to sort out the real number of fatalities , and in this part of the world , that is hardly unusual commuters , whether on bus , ferry or plane , often cram in illegally , so an official manifest , if one exists , would be dubious from the start in a country like congo , ravaged by nearly five years of war , most people have no choice but to travel this way the road network is so poor , the fleet of passenger planes so poorly maintained , that to get from one place to another requires cramming into a cargo plane , even one with a record as dubious as the ilyushin 76 since being drafted into service in 1971 , it has racked up a record 45 accidents , with 393 deaths the confusion around the circumstances of the accident and the death toll resurrected memories of a ferry disaster in senegal last fall sailing from southern senegal to the capital , dakar , the joola , as it was called , was packed to more than three times its capacity initially , the death toll was placed around 800 it crept up to 1 , 200 some months later the official number , coming nearly five months later , placed the number at 1 , 863 , making it the second worst maritime disaster in history
although it could take months for nasa officials to learn what caused the destruction of the shuttle columbia , they focused yesterday on the possibility that some of its protective tiles had failed , dooming the craft a small piece of speeding debris hit tiles on columbia s left wing during the shuttle s blastoff , space agency officials said though the incident was analyzed at length and dismissed as insignificant , they and other experts said it might have set off a train of problems that ended in the destruction of the spacecraft and the death of its seven crew members ron dittemore , shuttle program manager , said today at a nasa briefing that the impact had been analyzed by experts nationwide , who concluded that it did not represent a safety concern the technical community got together and across the country looked at it and judged that to be acceptable , mr dittemore said in hindsight , though , he added , the impact was on the left wing , and all the indications of trouble seemed to emanate from the craft s left wing the experts cautioned that it was too soon to draw firm conclusions about what went wrong even if the wing tiles failed , they said , some other factor might have turned this problem into catastrophe there are a lot of things in this business that look like the smoking gun but turn out not even to be close , mr dittemore said eugene e covert , an aerospace expert who helped investigate the challenger disaster for the federal government , said , it s foolish to speculate he added , however , that engineers might never learn exactly what went awry while experts regard damage to the protective tile heat shield as the likeliest culprit , they said there were at least five other possible causes , in this general order of decreasing likelihood an explosion of the ship s fuels and oxidizers , which are kept under high pressure collapse in the shuttle s structure , which is aged faulty navigation setup for the fiery reentry , caused perhaps by a computer problem a collision with a speeding meteoroid or piece of space debris terrorism , perhaps by a technician at the launching site the operation of all of the shuttle s myriad systems is monitored constantly and streams of data flow into nasa computers scientists will mine this trove in the days and weeks ahead , sifting for clues you can look at the data bank in houston as the biggest black box in the world , dr covert said but it will take time the final report on what destroyed the challenger , which exploded in flames minutes after launching on jan 28 , 1986 , was issued nearly five months after the disaster , and experts still debate details of how a leaky booster rocket turned the shuttle into a ball of flame also , challenger blew up while still within sight of the florida launching pad , where longrange cameras recorded many details of its destruction by contrast , columbia experienced its problem high in the atmosphere , and though amateur observers reported seeing debris falling from the shuttle , government cameras were not tracking it nasa officials discounted reports that the shuttle was following an unusual reentry course for security reasons because the israeli astronaut , col ilan ramon , was aboard there was nothing unusual about this trajectory at all , said rob navias , a nasa spokesman at the johnson space center in houston it was a standard reentry profile mr navias declined to speculate on causes , saying only that the computers were perfect all the way down and that nasa was impounding all mission data for the investigation but private experts said one of the likeliest causes of the columbia disaster was faulty protective covering or tiles , which cover the shuttle s nose , wings and belly and protect it from the intense heat of reentry on jan 16 , as columbia lifted off , a piece of insulating foam on its external fuel tank came off and was seen apparently hitting the left wing of the shuttle leroy cain , the lead flight director in mission control , assured reporters on friday that engineers had concluded that any damage to the wing and tiles was minor and posed no safety hazard we took a very thorough look at the situation with the tile on the left wing and we have no concerns , whatsoever , mr cain said but experts say a loose tile or protective surface might have started burning that triggered catastrophic failure during the fiery heats of reentry it could have started as a wing problem , said james e oberg , an expert on the shuttle program and a former nasa engineer wing problems quickly become whole spacecraft problems mr oberg said flight controllers might have been able to compensate for the tile problem by having the shuttle turn slightly no more than 10 degrees to shift some of the brunt of reentry to the undamaged right wing instead , the craft began losing tiles over california , he said mr dittemore said at the news conference that the first indication of trouble came shortly before 9 am eastern time when the flow of data from temperature sensors in the hydraulic systems of the left wing abruptly ceased a series of other data failures occurred seconds and minutes later
baghdad , iraq , june 7 a leading shiite muslim party announced today that it would not join a political council to help rule iraq if its members were appointed by l paul bremer , the american administrator the supreme council for the islamic revolution of iraq was the first political group to say it would boycott the proposed framework for an interim administration hamid albayati , spokesman for the council , said in an interview today that we ca n't be part of an appointed administration he said he had conveyed the group s decision to aides of mr bremer in discussions this week the setback for the delicate political dialogue that has been under way here since mr bremer arrived last month occurred on a day of continuing violence against united states occupation forces an american soldier was killed and four others were wounded near saddam hussein s hometown of tikrit when gunmen opened fire on them with rocketpropelled grenades and small arms , a military spokesman said american officials also said today they had detained the former deputy commander of the iraqi national police , accusing him of seeking to recreate a baath party cell within the reconstituted iraqi police force gen muhammad habib almashadani was arrested friday on charges of subversion and corruption he had earlier been barred from returning to any police job after american officials reconsidered their initial reliance on former highranking members of the baath party to rebuild the security forces here mr mashadani was a relative of mr hussein s former interior minister , mahmoud diab alahmed almashadani another member of the mashadani clan was arrested on may 31 and accused of conducting clandestine baathist meetings in the iraqi police academy the inability of the american and british occupation powers to agree with iraqis on how to take the first steps toward democratic governance , the threat of a resurgence of the baath party and the series of smallscale guerrilla attacks attributed to diehard remnants of mr hussein s government are adding to frustration levels here mr bayati s statement exacerbated the uncertainty on the political front in the interview , he said he was speaking for the group s leader , ayatollah muhammad bakr alhakim , who returned to iraq last month after a decade in exile in iran , where his badr brigades militia force has been closely linked with iran s revolutionary guards , and have been an irritant to alliance troops ayatollah hakim is part of the sevenmember leadership council that includes kurdish leaders from the north along with prominent exiles such as almad chalabi and iyad alawi the group so far has carefully avoided taking a position on whether it would participate in an interim administration in iraq if it were appointed by the allied powers the group s decision to boycott the council raises the immediate question of whether the unity of the former iraqi opposition groups is breaking down over the question of whether to cooperate with mr bremer ayatollah hakim s group is one of two religious parties seeking to speak for the majority shiite population in iraq the other is the more secular daawa party ayatollah hakim has made his base in najaf , site of one of shiite islam s holiest shrines najaf is also the home of grand ayatollah ali alsestani , who this week criticized american and british forces for turning the liberation of the iraqis into an occupation he also called for elections of an iraqi commission to write a new constitution all of the groups have pressed mr bremer to allow iraqis to select their own interim government , but none had flatly stated a refusal to join the body that mr bremer has outlined as consisting of a 2530 member council appointed by him one reason that the iraqi political groups have been reserving judgment is that mr bremer has been amending his proposals to meet their demands that he confer a greater measure of authority and independence to the political council that he would like to appoint in july but mr bayati said today that ayatollah hakim s council has decided that it cannot cross the red line of allowing occupation forces to appoint iraqi leaders iraqi leaders have to be selected by iraqis , he said he added that he did not inform mr bremer of the group s decision friday night , when the leadership council and 10 other prominent iraqis met with the american administrator for a lengthy closed discussion but he stated the group s position in a series of interviews he gave today and added that he believed that other iraqi leaders on the sevenmember council were telling mr bremer the same thing in private
keep it simple eliminate inessentials cut the rhetoric these are the principles that should be adhered to when considering ground zero but for better or worse , we are living in baroque if not byzantine times some of our most impressive contemporary architecture reflects this all eight designs chosen as finalists for a memorial of the world trade center disaster bear strong traces of it , to a greater or lesser degree each of them suffers as a result seen as a group , these finalists make the strongest possible case for simplicity as the most suitable aesthetic for ground zero none of them deserve to be built in their present form a few of them , however , have the makings of a good beginning if one of these , titled reflecting absence , enjoys an advantage over the others , that is because it has the greatest potential to be the least designed by michael arad of new york , the project features two reflecting pools , situated within the footprints of the fallen towers there s more too much more , by far but the design has the signal virtue of focusing the viewer s attention where we want it to be focused on the symbolic pair of shapes that have come to represent the simultaneity of public and private loss the design has problems , too there s a surfeit of hard paving in the plaza surrounding the pools the pools are flanked by low buildings that appear visually irrelevant to the memorial task they enclose steps that lead down into subterranean galleries for viewing cascades of water that flow from voids in the pools above it will not be possible to judge how these underground spaces would work until more is known about plans to install a shopping mall at ground zero all of us have been to suburban malls with waterfalls i would n't object to being remembered by one when i die , particularly because they do have a tendency to dry up after a few seasons the question is whether we have the right to choose that fate for others i 'd be reluctant to i do appreciate the idea of descent into the earth , though , even if a mall awaits us there for some people , shopping is heaven , for others hell in that sense malls are universal but the fact that we should have to ponder the eschatology of retail points up , yet again , the frustration of trying to appraise pieces of the ground zero plan in isolation from one another , and in illogical order i found myself thinking about the obstacles the jury must have faced while i was looking at another of the eight entries suspending memory , designed by joseph karadin with hsinyi wu , both of new york , reverses the concept of the arad scheme it envisions a garden within each of the footprints , surrounded by an immense pool of water but this plan , too , is overburdened with features columns of concrete and glass capsule biographies of the victims a memorial bridge with references to the pentagon attack and the crash of the hijacked plane in pennsylvania as these features pile up , the project comes to seem more and more like an artifact of the memorial industry , less like a heartfelt response more to point , the overembellishment would in all likelihood limit the range of emotions visitors would be allowed to feel this is an old olmsted principle , and it happens to be a sound one it is precious to be alone with your thoughts in a public space anything that compromises this experience is as unwelcome as sale signs in a shop window as for the other designs , they all offer an excess of spectacle there are no embarrassments , unless beauty is embarrassing , but perhaps , in this context , it is everything here is wonderfully polished each finalist could be the winner in a dozen memorial competitions but that is not really a compliment , is it \? memories do n't want to put on their party clothes so soon some people get through mourning quickly others devote their lives to it there s no wrong or right way as in this city , it is a novel experience for us we do n't know what stage of mourning we 're supposed to be at yet it is a tribute to this competition that we begin to engage such issues seriously from the start , there s been a red queen logic to the design process first the architectural renderings ! then the master plan ! now it must be acknowledged that the memorial competition has been an exception to the darwinian carnival that the public has been treated to thus far anita contini , director of the memorial competition , deserves credit for lifting the design process to a higher level of discussion amazingly , she has managed to create an island of credibility within the dubious political tempest that has been buffeting the site for more than two years unlike the chaotic design study conducted last year by the lower manhattan development corporation , here the jury s decisions were cultural , not capriciously political to an extent , however , the overproduction exhibited by all of the finalists is a reflection of political will it suggests that the experiences of 9 11 are far from digested how could they be , in such a short period of time \? and yet , you ca n't fault the designers or the jury for this all of us , it seems , are merely passengers on this superfasttrack express that our public officials have devised for our mourning experience one might also suspect that the relative youth of the designers has been a disadvantage yet it need not have been , as we are reminded by the presence of maya lin on the competition jury ms lin was still a student at yale when she designed the vietnam veterans memorial in washington none of the designs begins to approach the caliber of this youthful work collectively , however , they help to clarify the direction the design should take

kuwait , march 16 as the american military makes its final preparations for war in desert camps to the north and hulking warships linger off the coast to the south , teenagers here have been spending their free days riding water scooters on the pearl blue waters of the persian gulf nearby , nino , a hip italian restaurant , is always crowded gas masks and discount chemical suits are on sale in the shopping malls alongside the luxury goods of louis vuitton and hermes , but the baubles have been selling better this country could be days away from serving as the launching pad for an americanled invasion of iraq , the country that invaded it in 1990 yet , aside from the military helicopters whirling by overhead and men with machine guns atop armored vehicles posted in front of important buildings , kuwait city could not be more tranquil we can see the big ships in the distance and we know war is coming , said feisal muhammad aleidan , a kuwaiti fisherman but when we go out on the water , we just want to worry about the fish ali shumari , who was shopping in the busy alleyways of the old city market , agreed people are worried about their business , not about war , he said another kuwaiti , abdul karel , said there is nothing to be afraid of with the help of god and bush we will be ok according to the ministry of the interior , though , kuwait is on its highest state of alert it has instituted the equivalent of the department of homeland security s colorcoded warning system if the sirens installed throughout the country sound in an intermittent tone , danger is approaching residents are advised to calm down and control their emotions when the siren sounds in the wave tone , danger is currently taking place nevertheless , no one interviewed here had prepared a hiding place or bought a gas mask undoubtedly , the hundreds of thousands of american and british troops that have taken over the northern third of the country are a comfort but with news that iraq s weapons are close enough to inflict damage on kuwait city , one might expect to find more jitters the oddness of the mood was best captured by a recent headline in the arab news streets breathe easy as 'mass death' troops deploy part of that reassurance may be a function of the approach the government has taken to addressing public concerns on the one hand , it publicizes the purchase of 200 , 000 gas masks and the arrival of the czech army and its biological and chemical detection units \( the mass death troops \) that are now patrolling kuwait city at the same time , the ministry of information has been sending text messages to all the cellular phone users in the country with messages like , let us unite against our common enemy , a reference , no doubt , to iraq the combination of public security pronouncements and assurances that everything will be fine seems to have induced a state of hypnosis moreover , kuwaitis say this is a war that was supposed to have started five or six times since december , so they see no reason to get excited until the fighting actually begins the local fish markets in kuwait city and fahaheel are still as crowded and chaotic as ever the fishermen are not scared they are upset that war has not come yet they say a recently imposed curfew restricting boating activity at night , which was put in place to guard against terrorist speed boat attacks on allied ships , has severely hurt business because , they say , the best fishing is done at night two american schools closed a month ago , but most of the other schools are still open while some wealthy kuwaitis have already left the country to sit out any war , the streets and malls are not significantly less crowded but some of kuwait s residents have no choice but to stay there are 23 million people in this country who are not citizens , and for many them , leaving even if it were possible would probably mean never being able to work here again many immigrants express fear , particularly of chemical weapons against which none of the immigrants interviewed had any protection , but they are resigned to their situation if i leave when war comes , what is my situation \? said varsi krishne , who is from india and whose sponsor holds his passport no more job for many , kuwaitis and immigrants alike , the formulation of fear takes the form of a sort of fatalism what can we do \? asked nawaf alwad , a young kuwaiti whatever happens will happen by the protection of allah , we will be fine photo owners of fishing boats in kuwait city say business has been hurt by security rules banning boating at night \( james hill the new york times \)

last weekend was n't warm weather , but the next day may be they are a fascinating family i think all families are creepy in a way it is a testament to arbus s power as a photographer that we can imagine the print of this woman and her family without seeing it a few strokes of the pen are enough for us to recognize her as an arbus subject by the late 60 s the photographer herself could recognize one at a glance she did n't need to meet the woman s husband to know that the whole family offered prime material for her often savage art the creepiness of family ties , so uncertain and yet so binding , was a theme throughout her career , and is the connecting tissue for a provocative show here at the mount holyoke college art museum family albums \( also the title of the catalog from yale university press \) is based on a book arbus whimsically proposed three years before her death in 1971 but never developed , namely that her photographs as a whole might be said to make up an enormous and unusual family album in her words , a noah s ark of humanity two curators , anthony w lee and john pultz , have amassed more than 50 portraits she made on assignment , in this case primarily for esquire magazine , and organized them in categories fathers , mothers , families , partners and children while not nearly as comprehensive as the arbus retrospective that opens later this month at the san francisco museum of modern art , family albums , which runs through dec 7 , does include one offering that the larger show does not the complete record in contact sheets , proof prints and final prints of a previously undocumented portrait commission for scholars of arbus , stymied since her suicide by her estate s iron grip on her work , the 322 unknown images are a gold mine never before has it been possible to examine her photographic strategies in such detail the show features lots of fresh material \( like the letter quoted above \) , and what it lacks in size it makes up for in latitude , having been organized without the oversight of the arbus children the portrait commission on display was purely a moneymaking venture an actor and theater producer , konrad matthaei , wanted arbus , like himself a rising star in select artistic circles , to photograph him , his wife , their three children and some relatives for what he called a record of a family being together \( it was his wife , an alumna of mount holyoke , who brought the pictures to the attention of the museum \) according to mr lee s catalog essay , the pictures were made at the matthaeis' new york town house on dec 27 and 28 , 1968 each portrait session lasted four to five hours from the contact sheets , it appears that arbus concentrated first on konrad jr , 3 , the only son and apparently the family darling he is pictured by himself , with his father and other relatives , in a full 48 frames , an effort that fails to yield what arbus was after a proof print , apparently selected by her as the most promising of the lot , shows the boy beaming sweetly atop his hobby horse arbus moves on she tries impromptu shots of the family seated at the dining room table and of mr matthaei and his brother singing at the piano , then switches to formal portraits where everyone is seated on a couch behind a glass coffee table one of her common strategies was to show people in their bedrooms but four images of mr and mrs matthaei seated there do n't seem to have pleased her she focuses on the christmas tree , a subject she had photographed with memorable results in a long island home in 1963 again , no dice stories abound of arbus as a predator , swooping down on strangers and probing faces closeup for signs of weakness or despair there is none of that behavior on display here mostly she keeps a polite middle distance from the matthaeis although mr lee argues that arbus was a controlling presence , telling the children to hold poses for long periods in one room after the other , only in a couple of frames one of the teenage daughters posed with leg bent against an open door do the subjects look uncomfortably coached i work from awkwardness , arbus once said the teenage matthaei girls , visibly ill at ease in their no longer childish bodies and no doubt eager to change out of their holiday dresses and flee their parents , seem to hold arbus s deepest sympathy she must have felt a connection to their cosseted new york world , so similar to the one that she and her brother , the poet howard nemerov , had grown up in and hated arbus notes the wealth on display the monet and the renoir on the walls , the silk damask chairs with care , as though the plush surroundings could set off her pampered subjects' character in the best picture from the sessions , the 11yearold marcella stares out , grimfaced beneath her bangs , locked in a frontal stance as if she were an egyptian queen posing for her funeral portrait
what is the new york stock exchange \? is it a quasigovernmental regulator , one with authority over every substantial brokerage firm and most of the major companies in america \? or is it a profitmaking company , beset by competition on all sides \? the answer is that it is both but when it comes to executive pay , in recent years it has acted like the latter it is not clear just how richard a grasso , the exchange s chairman since 1995 , got so rich it does not seem to have occurred to anyone at the big board that it would be a good idea to disclose how he amassed almost 140 million , which he is withdrawing from the exchange that secrecy is unlikely to last william h donaldson , the chairman of the securities and exchange commission not to mention mr grasso s predecessor as the big board s chairman has demanded details while letting it be known he was shocked by the numbers it appears the board gave huge bonuses in 2000 and 2001 to mr grasso , whose contract required his bonus be comparable to those given top executives of investment banking firms mr grasso then deferred most of the compensation , investing some in mutual funds and some at a guaranteed 8 percent that would be paid unless he quit so what s wrong with that \? it may be unfair , but there is a tradition that regulators earn less than the regulated smalltown bankers earn more than alan greenspan s salary of 171 , 900 mr donaldson makes 142 , 500 it seems hard to believe now , but in 1990 some doubted mr grasso s ability to assume the mantle of wall street spokesman he was passed over for the top spot , which went to mr donaldson in fact , since mr grasso did get the top job in 1995 , his bald pate has become an internationally known symbol of american capitalism he has made the routine opening and closing bells into celebritystudded media events the last annual report prepared under mr donaldson had two pictures of the chairman mr grasso s face appears 29 times in the 2002 report , including pictures of him with condoleezza rice , arnold schwarzenegger and tony the tiger the reports show that compensation expenses were held down by mr donaldson but rose much faster than revenue under mr grasso mr grasso has performed admirably the big board has done a better job than many other markets in adjusting to new technologies and keeping market share the recovery from sept 11 was impressive but the exchange needs public confidence that it is a vigilant watchdog , ready to enforce rules against brokers and even the companies that list on it it needs the sec to act sympathetically in deciding thorny market structure issues that could decide which markets prosper none of those goals were enhanced by the disclosure of mr grasso s good fortune sec officials were angered that he got a new contract before the big board reported on how its governance structure needed to be changed the nasdaq stock market , which wants to be a private company with stock options and all the other accouterments of a private company , is separating itself from nasd , which will remain a regulator mr grasso has been adamant that the big board should remain a regulator but the exchange may not be able to have it both ways in an atmosphere of suspicion enhanced by the new mutual fund scandal it does not look good for a board that includes big wall street executives to be paying multimilliondollar bonuses to a regulator , even one who is also doing an excellent job of running a business graph shows percent change in compensation expenses at nyse since 1991
paul zindel , who drew on memories of his troubled childhood on staten island for a prizewinning play with a tonguetwisting title , the effect of gamma rays on maninthemoon marigolds , died yesterday at the jacob perlow hospice at beth israel medical center in manhattan he was 66 the cause was cancer , said his daughter , lizabeth zindel mr zindel had been a high school chemistry teacher for six years , demonstrating basic chemical reactions and explaining concepts like atomic numbers and covalent bonds , when the effect of gamma rays opened in houston as with other plays that were staged before he quit teaching in 1969 , he had written it in his spare time and seemed to relish his outsider status he never went to the theater , he said , until he was already a published playwright the effect of gamma rays on maninthemoon marigolds was one of the most discouraging titles yet devised , clive barnes said in his review in the new york times the play focused on an abusive , beleaguered mother and her two daughters , one with unexpected scientific talent , the other with instincts that mirror the mother s mr zindel contrasted the marigolds one daughter grows for a science project marigolds that had been exposed to radiation , and grow abnormally to the family , which mirrored his own our home was a house of fear , mr zindel once said mother never trusted anybody , and ours was n't the kind of house someone could get into by knocking on the front door a knock at the door would send mother , sister and me running to a window to peek out he said his mother conditioned him to believe that the world was out to get him , and he retreated into a secret world of puppet shows in cardboard boxes mr zindel was born on may 15 , 1936 , in the tottenville section of staten island his father was a police officer who abandoned the family mr zindel s mother , a nurse who also worked as a shipyard laborer , hatcheck attendant and dogbreeder , took in dying patients as boarders mr zindel did not read much as a child and said he he wrote for people who did not like to read he wrote plays and sketches in high school , including one about a pianist who recovers from a serious illness and is acclaimed for playing the warsaw concerto at carnegie hall for this literary achievement , i was awarded a parker pen , mr zindel recalled in 1970 he also took a creative writing course with the playwright edward albee while he was an undergraduate but his bachelor s and master s degrees were in chemistry , both from wagner college , which later awarded him an honorary doctorate the effect of gamma rays , first produced in houston , opened off broadway in 1970 the following year , it moved to broadway , where it ran for 819 performances it won mr zindel an obie award in 1970 for best american play and a pulitzer prize in 1971 , and he wrote the screenplay for the film version , which was directed by paul newman and starred joanne woodward it has been revived by the jean cocteau rep at the bouwerie lane theater in manhattan the next performance is april 4 mr zindel wrote several other plays in the 1970 s and 1980 s , though none was the success that the effect of gamma rays was he also wrote novel after novel for teenagers his first , the pigman \( 1968 \) , focused on two alienated teenagers who take advantage of an old man another situation that was autobiographical , he said he followed the pigman with a string of works that included my darling , my hamburger \( 1969 \) , i never loved your mind \( 1970 \) , pardon me , you 're stepping on my eyeball \( 1976 \) , confessions of a teenage baboon \( 1977 \) and the undertaker s gone bananas \( 1978 \) mr zindel married bonnie hildebrand , a novelist , in 1973 they were divorced in 1998 besides his daughter , he is survived by a son , david , of los angeles , and a sister , betty hagen , of edison , nj for his novels , mr zindel said , he reworked experiences from his highschool teaching days , but in the effects of gamma rays , the character beatrice really conveys my mother and the house i lived in like my mother , beatrice was a scorned woman whose husband had left her , and who was left to raise two kids who were like a stone around her neck she felt that the world was lurking out there to ridicule her clothes and to attack her with unkindness she seemed to think he had done the same thing when he read the play to her at the end of it she said , 'how could you \? how could you expose me to the world as a kleptomaniac and a manicdepressive nurse \? ' he recalled in an interview last year with school library journal i felt so badly the way she had been hurt but then she asked , 'who is going to play me on television \? ' when i told her eileen heckart who won a golden globe award and was nominated for an academy award for the 1956 thriller the bad seed she said , 'oh ! well , that s wonderful , then' my mother only cared which actress was going to play her photo paul zindel \( gerry goodstein , 1989 \)
it is not quite the eyepopping experience the people at the new borgata hotel casino spa in atlantic city had in mind still , officials there say they are not too concerned about the miniepidemic of shattering window panes in the hotel tower over the past several weeks , about 10 of the shimmering gold outer windows have shattered on the 43story tower , says michael facenda , a spokesman for the borgata all are being replaced , mr facenda said , and none of the glass has fallen he said that those golden panes all 10 , 000 of them are only outer coverings , and that none of the inner windows in the 2 , 002 guest rooms at the hotel have been affected we were told that as many as one percent of the windows might fail , said mr facenda , noting that they did not yet have a particular reason why the glittery windows , which cost about 2 , 000 each to replace , were shattering the assumption is that things like this will happen , and none of our guests have been affected , said mr facenda robert strauss
looking straight up from the midtown pavement , new york city seems like a fortress of granite , so solid and secure but looking straight down at the city from 1 , 000 feet above , the metropolis seems almost naked in its majesty every landmark the empire state building , the chrysler building , the statue of liberty looks as though it could be molded not with concrete but with marzipan that impression of vulnerability is , in a way , the reason for the aircraft providing this view of the city yesterday a black hawk helicopter , whose pilot could have been talking about wartime when he assured the passengers that the vibration is normal when those two jetliners came from nowhere to pierce the world trade center towers 18 months ago , they also pierced the city s veil of invincibility for a few months afterward , the defense department conducted roundtheclock air patrols above new york , but they ended as the country paused for the intermission between the first act of terrorism and the second act of war once the war began , the federal government resumed patrolling the city s skies , though with a different approach rather than have fighter jets arcing overhead , the department of homeland security has deployed several helicopters , including a couple of black hawks , and a couple of cessna citation ii jets to patrol the air defense identification zone , which extends about 30 miles from each of the area s three major airports these helicopters and small jets do not carry any weapons instead , according to officials of the federal bureau of immigration and customs enforcement , they provide an earlywarning system for anything suspicious in the air they 're traffic cops in the skies , dean boyd , a bureau spokesman , said albeit cops without guns the strategy essentially works this way sophisticated radar planes , normally used to monitor drugsmuggling traffic in the south and in the caribbean , are now being used to detect suspicious aircraft long before they reach new york , as far north as the border with canada if a suspicious plane manages to invade the restricted air space , a uh60a black hawk perhaps the most powerful helicopter used by law enforcement will approach the aircraft to seek identification , possibly impede its flight path , and direct it to land if the pilot ignores these instructions , then the helicopter s crew can alert the military the strategy was applied first in washington , in january since then , more than 100 intruders small planes that have entered restricted air space have been detected in washington and here , none posing any threat while the plan has other components , its darling is clearly the 11ton black hawk to promote its strategy , the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement gave rides aboard a pair of black hawks to members of the media \( a third black hawk was available in case of emergency \) reporters and photographers were buckled in and instructed on what to do if they felt the onset of nausea look to the horizon this was a new horizon for genaro rodriguez and drew salkeld , the pilots of one of the black hawks normally they guide their helicopter over the puerto rican landscape as part of the bureau s drug interdiction program but two weeks ago they were summoned to new york to participate in a different kind of surveillance we 're looking for planes , boats and cars , anything suspicious , mr rodriguez said it s the same as drugs , except with drugs you usually see the bales the two helicopters , laden with media , rose from the runway at teterboro airport in new jersey and made their way toward manhattan they flew side by side , their 47foot frames casting small shadows upon the murky hudson river waters they looped around the statue of liberty like two bees circling a green flower , swapping positions so that all cameras aboard could frame the meaningdrenched shot of a black hawk juxtaposed before an american symbol of freedom it passed over the staten island ferry , which looked like a child s bath toy , then headed north toward the united nations , which looked like an upright deck of cards from a black hawk hovering several hundred feet above the east river , the city appeared endless , its farthest stretches of brooklyn and queens blurring into the early april haze the precise instructions crackling over headsets seemed orderly the city below did not before heading toward ground zero for another symbolic shot , the helicopters glided slowly past the very top of the empire state building those in black hawks looked down at the tiny people gathered on the observation deck of what is now the tallest building in the city and those on the observation deck looked up at the latest additions to the new york skyline photo black hawk helicopters looped the statue of liberty during a patrol demonstration by the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement \( keith meyers the new york times \)

najaf , iraq , april 2 in the giddy spirit of the day , nothing could quite top the wish list bellowed out by one man in the throng of people greeting american troops from the 101st airborne division who marched into town today what , the man was asked , did he hope to see now that the baath party had been driven from power in his town \? what would the americans bring \? democracy , the man said , his voice rising to lift each word to greater prominence whiskey and sexy ! around him , the crowd roared its approval yet when the first round of welcomes to american soldiers and journalists were exuberantly , even affectionately completed , the people in the crowd had a more urgent request than liquor they wanted water there has been none in this town for four days again and again , people pointed to the sky , tilted their heads back and pointed to their open mouths a boy , age about 6 or 7 , approached an american reporter and said the two words that were uttered over and over america good then he kissed the reporter on the cheek , shook his hand and pointed to the sky , pleading for water neither soldiers nor reporters had water for the town the infrastructure has been brought down by nearly a week of battles in and around the town for now , there is no shortterm prospect for any relief , although military officials note that the town s landing strip could easily accommodate c130 cargo planes this is the first town of any major size that the americans have fought for and taken control of , but najaf itself is of little importance to the military mission here the troops need it to secure supply lines for the invasion of baghdad the paramilitary fighters of saddam hussein s baath party have been driven out , and arms caches have been destroyed the shiite muslim population of the town , long oppressed by the baath , poured out of their homes on tuesday with tips about weapons hiding places and training grounds the shiites seemed mildly to wildly grateful for the presence of the americans , but were curious about what it will amount to so , too , was one american military official , who said he wondered how he would know when he was done in najaf kase , an iraqi civil engineer who would not give his last name , was part of a crowd that gathered outside a former ammunition center for the baath party will you stay \? he asked most of the troops from the 101st will not be staying , at least after the last of the paramilitary fighters has been routed or driven into hiding the american soldiers will be moving north to assist in seizing territory around baghdad , and perhaps going into the capital a contingent of special forces troops will remain here , but to support some other civil authority , not to run the town the military has sought meetings with a major shiite leader here , ayatollah ali alsestani , who has so far declined to speak with american officials the cleric is said to have been kept under house arrest for a decade or more , but was freed within the last day after his guards fled as the american cordon around the city drew tighter lt col chris hughes said he had been talking with an emissary of the imam about governing arrangements for the city now that the baath party had been routed the cleric sent a message to colonel hughes , saying he would give his response on thursday in the view of kadhim alwaeli , an expatriate who returned to the city today with the american troops , the ayatollah s unwillingness to publicly embrace the invading force reflects a broader uncertainty about american steadfastness after the first persian gulf war in 1991 , the united states government encouraged shiites in the south of iraq to rebel against president hussein but provided little tangible support when the iraqi government harshly repressed the uprisings , mr waeli , who had been part of the insurgency , fled to saudi arabia mr waeli returned today as a member of the free iraqi forces , a group of iraqi natives attached to a civil affairs unit of the army he said the local shiites were concerned that the americans would not secure the peace and wanted to know , are you going to be here or are you going to leave us \? for now , the american troops are here they will continue to hunt down paramilitary fighters in and around the town eight iraqis were killed on tuesday by american and british troops the roads leading out of the city had been freshly seeded with land mines , apparently by paramilitary fighters anticipating the american arrival , and a team of engineers known as sappers in the army moved methodically through the mines just before the sun went down , the engineers cleared the third of such fields , detonating them with c4 explosive the troops had discovered a factory where such land mines were made , but the ones exploded at the end of the day on tuesday had been made in italy , said lt col duke deluca europeans are antiwar , but they are procommerce , colonel deluca said
the unknown night the madness and genius of r a blakelock , an american painter by glyn vincent illustrated 362 pp new york grove press 2750 among 19thcentury american artists , names like winslow homer , thomas eakins , thomas cole or frederic church may be familiar , but not ralph albert blakelock , although contemporary painters often appreciate his work some unabashed enthusiasts even proclaim his genius , admiring his abstract treatment of nature and his mysticism he has inspired relatively little scholarship , but his life merited a cameo portrait in paul auster s novel moon palace \( 1989 \) , in which a character describes blakelock as one of the greatest men we 've ever had , and there he was all broken apart , on the verge of losing his mind he used to tell me about his travels out west , wandering through the wilderness for weeks on end , never seeing a soul three years he was out there blakelock s life rose to tragic proportions it encompassed the youthful adventurer heading west to camp with american indians when his contemporaries sought the salons of europe the prolific father the marginalized and exploited painter the delusionary confined to a staterun mental hospital the victim exploited by a con artist as the focus of a charity claiming to support his impoverished family while actually benefiting only herself unethical behavior by new york s medical , legal and art establishments , with doctors and lawyers failing at the very least to protect the vulnerable artist from fraud , while art dealers and collectors take advantage of the helpless , mentally ill father of eight surviving children the biggest surprise may be that such a subject has had to wait so long for the biography that glyn vincent provides in his first book , the unknown night born in 1847 , the grandson of poor immigrants from england and son of a policeman who became a homeopathic physician , blakelock grew up in new york he passed the competitive entrance exam to the free academy \( later known as city college \) , but soon left school to devote himself to art an uncle who was a music teacher , choirmaster and amateur landscape painter encouraged the boy s interest in art and provided opportunity for painting at his summer home in arlington , vt by the fall of 1867 , though not yet 20 years old , blakelock managed to get a painting accepted by the jury of the national academy of design , which then was the most prestigious place to exhibit although not singled out by the press , he was invited to submit work for exhibition again the next year after four showings at the academy that did not attract enough attention to begin an economically viable career , blakelock decided in 1869 to expand his horizons while most of his contemporaries chose to study in europe , he elected to go west , where some artists , like thomas moran and albert bierstadt , had joined army expeditions and government survey teams blakelock , however , traveled alone , on horseback , sleeping under the stars , encountering the sioux , the assiniboins and other tribes he made a second trip west in 1870 , stopping in wyoming among the uinta tribe in the scenic snake river valley his last journey , to northern california , took place in 1871 he would never forget these experiences , which fed his imagination american indian subjects would inspire him for the next quarter of a century in february 1877 , not quite 30 , blakelock married cora bailey their first child was born in july cora proved to be a devoted mother and an accommodating wife as eight more children followed in rapid succession , she seems to have inadequately understood that so many progeny taxed the limits of her husband s ability to support their family later she would lament that to raise cash to support his growing family , blakelock was often forced to turn out potboilers by 1882 , blakelock and his family had moved in with his uncle , then living in east orange , nj so acute was their poverty that he went to work in a factory , painting trinkets and massproduced landscapes unconventional though he was as an artist , this was humiliating luck soon seemed to change in 1883 , blakelock received a commission for a major painting from a silkmill magnate he began to get positive notices from critics and fellow painters he continued to maintain a studio in new york , often renting space in buildings populated by some of the most prestigious artists of the day but art dealers proved reluctant to intercede for the eccentric blakelock , leaving him to scramble to sell his pictures nor was the national academy quick to elect him to membership as a result , he often sold paintings for much less than fair value for comparable work the humiliation of having to haggle for even paltry remuneration may have precipitated a mental decline cora reluctantly agreed to have blakelock hospitalized in 1899 , after enduring several violent episodes at home and his claims that he was the duke of york ironically , blakelock s reputation seemed to take off shortly afterward one of his landscapes won an honorable mention while on exhibit in 1900 at the american pavilion in the grand palais in paris several private collectors organized shows followed by significant sales such attention , in turn , prompted the first major article to be written about his work
elmont as thomas r suozzi , the nassau county executive , toured elmont and north valley stream in a minibus filled with local community activists earlier this month , one sight took him completely off guard smack in the middle of hoffman avenue , a quiet street of wellmaintained singlefamily homes , was what can only be described as a construction vehicle graveyard rusting hulks of trucks and pieces of heavy demolition equipment were piled next to an abandoned shell of a house , with fullgrown trees reaching up through some of the older vehicles this is unbelievable , mr suozzi said , as he led the community leaders and members of his economic development staff through the lot vittorio mevo , a homeowner from across the street , ran up to mr suozzi and gave him an earful he said he had complained about the eyesore for 37 years and had been told repeatedly that because the property was used as a contractor s parking lot long before the area was zoned residential , the commercial use was grandfathered and therefore allowed but the grandfather died two years ago , mr mevo said , referring to the property s owner so how can it still be grandfathered \? mr suozzi laughed and vowed he would get the site cleaned up before leaving , he and mr mevo were chatting in italian , like two old friends sharing an espresso mr mevo shouted a hearty ciao bello ! to mr suozzi and said to himself , maybe he can really do something the visit and the tour were part of mr suozzi s latest attempt to develop a longterm vision for economic development in nassau county , including reviving older downtowns , redeveloping polluted sites , expanding the tax base , preserving open space , building moderatepriced housing and promoting tourism he cosponsored a redevelopment drive in roosevelt last spring , then announced late last year that he had divided the county into 35 economic development zones and would seek the input of residents and local officials in drafting specific projects for each area he said he chose elmont and north valley stream as the next zone he would tackle because the area is an important gateway to nassau county his next round of visits began late last week in bethpage and plainedge , and he plans to tour and meet with residents from each of the 35 zones by the end of the year after the bus tour , mr suozzi met with more than 300 residents at a town hall style meeting in which he laid out his overall goals for economic development in the county and spelled out specific plans for elmont and north valley stream at the top of the list was cleaning up the truck site on hoffman avenue mr suozzi and his plans were , for the most part , well received the meeting was part pep rally as he extolled the county s virtues , part sales pitch as he promoted his economic development initiatives , and part therapy session as he listened to the complaints of homeowners it was really just a gripe session at some level , said chris rosado , president of the elmont chamber of commerce but i know suozzi made a big impression a lot of people were really impressed that he and his people had really done their homework on our community but even mr suozzi s best intentions for elmont and north valley stream are hampered by several factors first , the cashstrapped county has no money to put into new projects second , the town of hempstead , not the county , has jurisdiction over many of the residents' top concerns , like the proliferation of accessory apartments in areas zoned for singlefamily homes and third , unlike other communities , the area has no real identifiable downtown to revive and instead has four commercial areas that lack any kind of distinct character mr suozzi said he would seek to make better use of existing resources and promised to work with town and local officials to bring improvements to the area none of this is going to change next year , he told the crowd repeatedly the reason politicians do n't do what i'm doing tonight is because you do n't get immediate results and a lot of this is pieinthesky stuff , but it can happen the procedure has changed somewhat since the initiative in roosevelt last may , when the county and the town of hempstead joined together to hire sustainable long island , a huntingtonbased nonprofit group to develop a new vision for roosevelt with the input of local residents and leaders in elmont and north valley stream and the 34 economic development other zones mr suozzi has drawn up , county officials are on their own town of hempstead officials did not participate in the tour or town meeting , although county and town officials said they planned to work together to revitalize the area the strategy is similar to the one adopted in roosevelt to quickly tackle some highprofile , easilyfixed problems and then move onto broader issues with lasting impact but nine months after the roosevelt planning process was started , people from the area say precious little has happened the only thing that came out of that was they put up some new lights on nassau road , said wilhemina funderbunk , a roosevelt resident for 39 years and selfdeclared skeptic she allowed that officials had also helped clean up part of a rundown strip mall that had been a source of many complaints they went out and cut some weeds , but it did n't put a dent in anything , she said
when a city emergency medical technician pulled up in an ambulance on the brooklyn street where gidone busch had just been shot by the police in 1999 , he asked a group of officers if everyone was ok , he testified yesterday yes , was the answer from a police sergeant , except for a small bruise on the sergeant s arm , he said it was only then , the technician told the jury , that he noticed on his own that someone was bleeding to death on the sidewalk the testimony of the technician and his partner yesterday was among the strongest the busch family s lawyers have presented to bolster their claims in the civil suit against the city they contend that the shooting was unjustified and that the officers focused immediately afterward on inventing an account that would keep investigators at bay on a good day for the family s lawyers , the trial yesterday also included a claim by a civilian witness that one police officer worriedly shouted what did i do \? after mr busch died and after the judge allowed the city to call one of its witnesses out of order , he ended up bolstering central elements of the family s case the medical technician , michael sweeney , a new york city police officer who was working a second job , said he and a partner answered a call to an address on 46th street in borough park on aug 30 , 1999 they had been told they were needed to help an emotionally disturbed person who was wielding a hammer when mr sweeney saw the group of officers , he said he shouted , is everybody ok \? he said one officer in the group , sgt terrence o'brien , answered , he got me in the arm , but i think i'm ok none of the officers said anyone had been shot , mr sweeney said , but he said that he soon noticed the body nearby and rushed to get medical equipment i realized he was in cardiac arrest and we had to move fast , he said sergeant o'brien , who has said he was injured by the hammer , is one of five officers defending against the lawsuit , along with the city , in brooklyn federal court mr sweeney s partner , michael esposito , another emergency medical technician , also testified yesterday he said that when their ambulance arrived , none of the officers said anything but he said he turned , saw yellow crime scene tape , and there was a body on the floor another witness , shimon charach , a volunteer paramedic for a neighborhood corps , told the jurors he was about 100 feet away at the time of the shooting he said he ran toward mr busch s body and screamed i'm an emt , but that officers refused to let him get close mr charach also said that shortly after the shooting , he was at nearby maimonides medical center , where some of the officers who were involved in the shooting were taken mr charach , a 36yearold teacher , said that at the hospital he saw a group of officers in a receiving room he said one of the officers was slumped over and was holding a handgun by its barrel he said that officer was saying oh , what did i do \? what did i do \? other officers surrounded him and and pulled him into another room , mr charach said the witness said he could not identify any of the officers he saw at the hospital and acknowledged under crossexamination that he could not say what the officer in the hospital was referring to by some accounts of the shooting , mr busch was faced by officers with drawn guns and one or two shots were fired after a brief pause , by these accounts , other shots were heard mr busch was shot 12 times , including in the lungs , liver , heart and intestines the lawyers for the city were aggressive in crossexamining some of the family s witnesses yesterday , but they stumbled with their own witness because of a scheduling issue , the judge , sterling johnson jr , permitted them to interrupt the presentation by the family s lawyer , myron beldock , to call lazar eichenstein , a 27yearold man from borough park , where mr busch was living mr eichenstein , who said he saw the shooting , quickly supplied the testimony the city lawyers evidently wanted it looked like the police officers were afraid of mr busch , he said , bolstering the city s argument that mr busch was menacing officers with the hammer and that they fired to save themselves but mr eichenstein also gave the family s lawyers testimony to support their claims of an unnecessary shooting he said mr busch was six to eight feet from the officers when he was shot and was not moving toward them , as they have claimed mr eichenstein also said it seemed to be a long time before anyone arrived to help mr busch , who was bleeding on the sidewalk i was watching his shirt getting red , he said more and more red
reykjavik , iceland the windblown tourists turned their heads just in time to spy the broad , glossy back of a minke whale jutting through the waves a beautiful viewing , said einar orn einarson , the guide on the whale watching boat , the elding the minke whale is getting curious there he goes now one o'clock look one o'clock but just a few nautical miles away on this rainy day , iceland s fishermen were pursuing a more traditional brand of whaling after a 14year hiatus , iceland s mythic whale hunters had bagged their first whale , also a minke , as part of a new scientific research program that falls outside the 1986 ban on commercial whaling for icelanders , whaling is as much about national identity as it is about safeguarding economically vital stocks of fish that they worry may be depleted by an expanding population of whales whale hunters have been harpooning the giant mammals since the 15th century here , and whale meat remains a local delicacy killing a whale , icelanders are fond of saying , is no different from shooting a deer or reeling in a marlin the photograph in the next day s national newspaper summed up the island s elation over its plunge back into whaling \( which the vast majority of people here support \) it showed the skipper of the boat , with a toothy grin , holding aloft the whale s bloody heart lying at his feet was the dead whale but the photograph and the international outcry over iceland s whale hunting are just the sort of publicity that tourism advocates in iceland fear as they seek to draw visitors to this beautiful , remote island of 290 , 000 people already , they say , visitors have canceled trips and bombarded them with outraged email undeterred , iceland s marine research institute , a government agency , plans to oversee the hunting of 38 minke whales by year s end and a total of 200 over two years , a number it pared back from 500 the scientists are planning to analyze the whales' stomach contents and determine just how much fish a typical minke whale eats scientists believe the 43 , 000 whales that live in the vicinity of iceland eat a total of one million to two million tons of fish each year a more precise figure , the icelandic government says , will help it better manage the island s precious fish stocks if there are plenty of these animals , and we kill them properly and have a welldesigned program , there is nothing in our ethics that goes against this , said johann sigurjonsson , director of the marine research institute but tourism officials say that whale watching brings in more money than whale catching ever did of all the tourist attractions in the area , none has grown faster in the past five years than whale watching , which lured 62 , 000 passengers to boats last year this decision is , if anything , a step backward , said asbjorn bjorgvinsson , manager of the husavik whale center and chairman of the whale watching association it can severely damage our business washington , which consistently opposes killing whales for scientific research , is reviewing the remote possibility of sanctions , even though iceland is breaking no laws we believe the necessary scientific data can be gathered by wellestablished nonlethal means , said rolland schmitten , the united states commissioner to the international whaling commission at the same time , the environmentalists are rallying opposition to iceland s decision , trying to persuade icelanders that killing whales is not the same as killing cod , and that iceland would not benefit economically from whale hunting despite the controversy , iceland s actions fall squarely within international law the international whaling commission banned commercial whaling in 1986 a ban that iceland acceded to in 1989 but it exempted whaling for scientific reasons and for subsistence several countries and native peoples hunt whales , including the alaskan inuit , who have landed 280 bowhead whales in the past five years japan , which hunts under the research banner , is killing 644 whales this year and selling the whale meat domestically norway is the only country permitted to hunt whales for commercial gain because it officially objected to the moratorium and has shrugged off international criticism norway has found a limited market in whale meat , raising questions about whale hunting s profitability but whale hunting is not purely an economic issue to icelanders for us , as a nation , we need to have the right to harvest the nature around us , said mr einarson , a former whaler who is now the guide and captain on the elding modern society is drifting apart from nature and people are not understanding the circle of life here we understand it and they are reluctant to let environmentalists subvert their traditions the average icelander and the government seem to look at it as a statement , said vignir sigursveinsson , 49 , the manager of elding adventures if we give in with the whales and let greenpeace and the environmental groups control this , then what is next \? cod fish \? they wo n't let us fish so the whales can eat photos a whale killed off the west coast

president bush s budget would increase by a third or more the number of audits of taxpayers suspected of hiding income received from their businesses , partnerships , investments and offshore accounts the administration identified five areas to which more resources would be devoted to stem tax cheating abusive corporate tax shelters , unreported income among higherincome taxpayers , failure by employers to turn over taxes withheld from paychecks or even to withhold them , misuse of trusts and offshore accounts to hide income , and tax denial schemes that are based on claims that the tax code does not apply to most americans the proposal is a first step toward reversing a long decline in enforcement of the tax laws it could bring in billions of dollars owed to the government and would also help the states , which rely on internal revenue service enforcement much more than on their own audits but the proposal for irs financing falls far short of what charles o rossotti , the last irs commissioner , said in november that the service needed to enforce the tax laws adequately under the bush plan the irs would get an additional 133 million for these audits and other law enforcement work in these five areas over all the irs would receive 104 billion , a 525 percent increase , but still less per tax return , after adjusting for inflation than it got five years ago law enforcement , which includes audits , takes up almost 40 percent of the irs budget the additional money would target the real problem areas in a fair and evenhanded manner , restoring confidence in the tax system for hardworking taxpayers , said pamela olson , assistant treasury secretary for tax policy at the same time the irs goes after those who cheat , ms olson added , the irs must provide better service to lawabiding taxpayers and respect every taxpayer s rights it can and it must do both but according to the formula mr rossotti recommended in his final report to the irs oversight board , the agency would need an overall increase of more than 7 percent , as opposed to the 525 percent proposed by president bush , to start closing the law enforcement gap over the last five years , demands on the irs have grown in several ways congress has made the tax code far more complex , while at the same time imposing complicated new procedures to protect the rights of taxpayers a growing number of promoters now teach people to exploit those procedures to thwart audits and the collection of taxes , according to mr bush s budget congress also ordered better service to cooperative taxpayers without extra money to handle these duties , the irs diverted money from audits , which in turn lowered the risks of cheaters being caught the treasury department did not detail how much of the extra money would be applied to each of the five areas of cheating it said only that with 133 million more it could increase audits of individuals who make more than 100 , 000 from 125 , 000 last year to 166 , 000 next year , a onethird increase , at a cost of about 3 , 200 per audit for some tax dodges the number of audits would increase by more than a third for others , the figure would be less the department also proposed tougher rules to make both promoters of tax shelters and the companies that buy them keep more records and make more disclosures the use of artificial losses in foreign currency transactions to make capital gains vanish is one of the most popular tax dodges so are corporate transactions that inflate interest deductions entrepreneurs who place their business in a trust , because promoters persuaded them that it will make profits immune from taxes , are another area covered by the budget proposal the extra money would also increase audits of those who buy into the growing number of fraudulent schemes asserting that it is legal to stop paying taxes if one uses a pure trust , renounces his social security number or declares himself a sovereign citizen or a citizen of the state in which he lives \( but not the united states \) another fraud , known as the 861 position , asserts that wages paid by americanowned companies are exempt from tax none of these claims have been upheld by any judge anywhere , but the treasury department has acknowledged that the frauds have flourished in recent years promoters of these schemes often cite as evidence that taxes need not be paid the statements of those senators and representatives who in the last five years have described the irs in terms like rogue agency run by jackbooted thugs and other remarks that the promoters twist into assertions that the irs is not a legitimate agency of the government this year the vast majority of tax cheats the irs identifies will get away without paying mr rossotti s report showed that the irs has only enough money to pursue about a fifth of individual cheats
washington , aug 4 the bush administration , looking for ways to press israel to halt construction of a barrier separating its citizens from palestinian areas , is considering a reduction in loan guarantees for israel that were approved by congress this spring , administration officials said today any such punitive step by the united states toward israel would mark a change in president bush s longstanding efforts to avoid any kind of confrontation with the government of prime minister ariel sharon aides to mr bush and mr sharon have gone out of their way for months to say that they have few disagreements and that all have been resolved amicably such talk was reiterated last week during mr sharon s visit to the white house what is at issue in the administration s possible action is 9 billion in loan guarantees approved by congress in the spring they are intended for housing and commercial projects and were part of a package that also included 1 billion in military aid to help israel cope with the effects of the iraq war administration officials , who disclosed the potential move , said that it was being considered in response to a campaign by palestinian leaders , who say the barrier has cut palestinians off from farms , homes , schools and workplaces the palestinians also contend that it is aimed at establishing a de facto border for israel in the west bank and the gaza strip the future boundary of israel and a palestinian state is supposed to be negotiated in talks between the two sides an israeli official said tonight that word of the administration s move , which was first disclosed in the israeli newspaper haaretz , had not been transmitted to mr sharon s government this takes us by surprise , he added the barrier consists of concrete walls , barbed wire fences , ditches , sensors and other devices designed to keep palestinians from crossing into israeli territory or jewish settlements under attack in the last two years by suicide bombers president bush has suggested that while the barrier may be justified in security terms , it has created problems in the current phase of israelipalestinian negotiations after his meeting with mr bush last week , mr sharon promised to look for ways to make the wall less onerous to palestinians , perhaps by building more gates aides to the israeli leaders say that the disagreement between mr sharon and mr bush over the barrier has been friendly under the law passed by congress , none of the money from the loan guarantees is to be spent to help jewish settlements in the west bank or gaza indeed , the law requires that if israel spends any money on such settlements , the loan guarantees must be reduced by that amount , american officials said officials added that what is being considered is whether money spent to build the barrier constitutes money spent in an illegal way some officials argue that it is , at least to the extent that the barrier veers into the west bank and gaza to protect settlements an administration official said today that a growing consensus in the administration has led to the conclusion that the loan guarantees must not be used to pay for the barrier or to free other israeli funds to build it the feeling is that we do need to do something about the fence , said an administration official the last time any of this money was frozen , though , was under mr bush s father , and it led to a low point in americanisraeli relations since taking office two and a half years ago , president bush has sought to support israel strong backing has also come from religious conservatives in the republican party some , including representative tom delay , the house majority leader , have even suggested that mr bush should not press israel to adopt the peace plan calling for a palestinian state the administration has nonetheless persisted in criticizing israel s barrier as harmful to the peace plan it was not clear tonight how much domestic criticism from either conservative republicans or democratic supporters of israel would be stirred up by any move to reduce the loan guarantees nor was it clear how much of a reduction would be approved or whether it would affect money that has already been spent , which has been in the tens of millions of dollars reiterating the guarded american criticism of the barrier , secretary of state colin l powell said today that a nation is authorized and it is within its rights to put up a fence , as it sees the need for one , but that the israeli barrier created difficulties because of the peace negotiations speaking to radio sawa , an american governmentowned radio station broadcasting in the middle east , mr powell said the united states was concerned when the fence crosses over onto the land of others he said the united states was in discussions with our israeli friends to make sure the barrier did not become a hindrance to the peace efforts but he made no mention of reducing assistance
baltimore , may 16 with funny cide having completed his final prerace gallop this morning at belmont park , barclay tagg s work is all but done the trainer of funny cide , tagg has done everything he can to prepare the new yorkbred gelding for a peak effort in the preakness stakes on saturday the man on the spot now is the pimlico race course superintendent , john passero it will be his responsibility to create a fast and fair track for funny cide and the rest of the field his job may not be an easy one pimlico was pelted by heavy rain through most of the day today , which turned the main track into a sea of slop and led track management to take races off the turf and to cancel a steeplechase race the rain eased up toward late afternoon , but the storm was not expected to end until late tonight the forecast for saturday called for cloudy skies and temperatures in the high 50 s passero , regarded as one of the best in his business , was confident that the main track would be fast by the time the preakness is run but he added that his prediction would probably change if the rain continued into saturday morning the bottom line is , with this track , if the rain stops , it only takes an hour , maybe an hour and a half , for that moisture to disappear , passero said the track will come right back this thing bounces back it s a great racetrack it is unlikely that a wet racetrack will hurt funny cide s chances in his lone start on an off track , he ran a strong second behind empire maker on muddy ground at aqueduct in the wood memorial on april 12 though he finished second , it was one of the stronger races of his career he seems to have liked this kind of track in the mornings , tagg said he 'll either like it or he wo n't there s nothing i can do about it so far , he has n't seemed to mind any kind of track peace rules , considered the main challenger to funny cide , did not fare well in his lone start on a wet track then trained by gary contessa \( and now trained by bobby frankel \) , he was fifth in an aug 24 maiden race at saratoga run in the slop it was the only time in his ninerace career that he finished out of the money you can say that he was n't as good in that race as he s been in most , but i 'd chalk it up more to a bad trip , contessa said he was on the inside the whole way , and that was the wrong part of the racetrack to be on i would n't be worried about it he trained incredibly well over every kind of racetrack the wet weather also caused tagg to change his shipping plans originally scheduled to depart his home base at belmont park at 3 30 am saturday , tagg , not wanting the weather situation to get worse , abruptly changed plans and put funny cide on a van a little after 9 o'clock this morning funny cide arrived at pimlico about five hours later tagg insisted today that the preakness would not be a twohorse race between funny cide and peace rules the oddsmaker at pimlico disagreed he made funny cide the 75 morningline favorite , with peace rules the second choice at 85 third , at 51 , is the entry of scrimshaw and senor swinger besides funny cide and peace rules , none of the other horses in the field of 10 appear to have the class or the talent to win the race , but that has not kept several rival trainers from trying to steal this one those two wo n't run around there by themselves , said d wayne lukas , the trainer of scrimshaw and ten cents a shine they 're not that overpowering , and i know it and their trainers know it the other horses are too good to just be chasing the two favorites besides , trips are so important , and they both got great trips in the kentucky derby but history suggests the preakness will adhere to form while only one favorite has won the kentucky derby since 1980 , the second leg of the triple crown has been dominated in recent years by horses with low odds four of the last 10 runnings of the preakness have been won by the favorite the six preakness starters who did not run in the kentucky derby may also have their problems since 1983 , only two horses who passed up the derby have won the preakness those are two more reasons most handicappers have focused their attention on peace rules and funny cide , with only peace rules given a strong chance of keeping the derby winner from winning the second leg of the triple crown the two horses have tactical early speed , which sets up the possibility of a virtual match race from start to finish photo peace rules on a muddy pimlico track yesterday the second choice for the preakness , he did not fare well in his one race on an off track \( reuters \)
a driver rammed a white van into the front doors of four firehouses in brooklyn early yesterday morning , injuring no one but damaging one of the doors so badly that the fire company inside was unable to respond to two calls , fire officials said although the same van appears to have struck all four firehouses , fire officials said , the driver has not been identified , and the motive is a mystery you ca n't describe this as anything but outrageous , said fire commissioner nicholas scoppetta , who spoke at a news conference several hours after the attacks outside the firehouse of engine company 210 in fort greene that firehouse was the most heavily damaged and the last to be struck they not only endangered the lives of firefighters , they endangered the lives of everyone in this community that fire company missed two calls as a result , the commissioner said one was a medical emergency , to which emergency medical services was able to respond , and the other was a report of a fire at the brooklyn navy yard that turned out to be a false alarm none of the four firehouses was among the six that are scheduled to be closed today however , commissioner scoppetta said there would be heavy security , including police officers and fire marshals , at all the firehouses in the vicinity of those being closed and at those that were struck yesterday if some irrational person decides to do anything like this in the near future , that person will be arrested , mr scoppetta said with the exception of the two missed calls , the engine companies at all four damaged houses were able to respond as usual yesterday , officials said mr scoppetta added that the driver appeared to have backed the van into firehouse doors , rather than ramming them headon the engine 210 firehouse is on a narrow street lined with parked cars , so it would have been difficult for any vehicle to build up much speed before striking the door officials said the first firehouse to be struck housed engine 217 , at 940 dekalb avenue in bedfordstuyvesant the van rammed the firehouse door about 4 40 am , causing only minor damage the driver then struck the firehouse of engine 235 , about 12 blocks southwest , at 206 monroe street , also in bedfordstuyvesant , again causing minor damage , officials said the doors of those two firehouses had to be removed to be repaired , and they were expected to be back up by last night the van next rammed the door of the engine 230 firehouse , about 15 blocks north at 701 park avenue there , the impact pushed the door into the firehouse , and it will have to be replaced , mr scoppetta said about 5 25 am the driver struck the engine 210 firehouse at 160 carlton street , about 20 blocks west in fort greene there , the door was damaged so badly that the firefighters who were sleeping inside at the time had to spend an hour removing the door before the engine could get out , mr scoppetta said photo fire commissioner nicholas scoppetta spoke yesterday outside engine company 210 in fort greene , brooklyn \( andrea mohin the new york times \)
for the new york police department , the new year began with an exceptional set of events four fatal shootings of civilians by officers in just the first two days but as police officials grappled yesterday with the many lingering questions that surround the recent cases , experts said the shootings obscured a larger reality that the new york police had been largely successful at curtailing unwarranted gunfire by officers indeed , three decades ago , such shootings were considerably less rare in 1973 , new york police officers shot 176 people , or more than four times as many as they shot last year , according to police statistics fiftyfour of those people died , compared with the 12 shot dead by the police last year the analysts attributed the decline to improvements in training , adjustments in patrol tactics and a tighter scrutiny of police conduct , which often accompanied the public outcry from controversial fatal shootings , like that of amadou diallo in 1999 police officials also cited the recent decline in crime as a factor , suggesting that fewer guns on the streets had made chance , and often deadly , encounters between officers and armed men less likely the recent year with the largest number of offenders killed was 1990 , said michael farrell , a deputy commissioner of the police department , and that was also the peak year for murder though police shootings have declined consistently since then , individual incidents , like the shooting of mr diallo , have nonetheless fueled a public perception that some officers are reckless in their handling of firearms mr diallo , an unarmed west african man , was shot and killed in february 1999 by four officers who fired 41 bullets , hitting him 19 times , after they mistakenly thought he was reaching for a gun the shooting sparked weeks of protests and months of debate over whether police patrol tactics had become too aggressive the dispute also appeared to curb officers' use of their guns , several experts said in 1998 , the year before mr diallo was killed , new york police officers shot 62 people , 19 of them fatally in the following year , shootings by officers fell by a third , to 42 , with 11 deaths paul g chevigny , a professor at new york university school of law who has studied the deadly use of force , said , the sense is that commanders cautioned people that there was a lot of public sentiment out there and that because of that , officers became extra careful mr chevigny said it was not entirely clear why shootings by new york city police officers had dropped in recent years but , looking at the longer term , mr chevigny credited work by patrick v murphy , a new york police commissioner who in 1972 created a set of administrative standards to guide police officers on when they should or should not shoot until that time , the only guideline in place had been the state penal code , which regulates criminal conduct mr murphy is also credited with introducing the internal review procedures that now follow all incidents where officers discharge their weapons , regardless of whether anyone is shot mr farrell said the comprehensiveness of these reviews emphasized to officers how serious the department views the discharge of a firearm under the process , each incidence is investigated by what the police call a borough shooting team , which turns over its report for further analysis to the firearms discharge review board for a final determination the police commissioner has the final say , however , on whether an officer is disciplined over the years , experts say , the police have overhauled their firearms training so that it concentrates more on when to shoot , not just how there has been increasing investment in more and better training for tactics , mr farrell said for example , police officials said increased emphasis was put on helping officers avoid shootouts by teaching them defensive maneuvers mr farrell said recruits in the police academy now receive 12 days of firearms training , divided between shooting fundamentals , learning the law on the deadly use of force and mock exercises in which the trainees practice making the splitsecond decision on whether to shoot several decades ago , the police began using a mock tenement building at their firing range on rodman s neck in the bronx , known as the funhouse , where

baghdad , iraq , april 19 on the gilded marble tablets posted at the gateways of a score of presidential palaces , it was known as the era of saddam hussein yet in the 26 days of american warfare it took to bring that era down , the hallmark of mr hussein s rule was revealed not as one of grandeur , but of gangsterism and thuggery on the pediments of his palaces , mr hussein mounted 30foot bronze busts of himself as saladin , the mesopotamian warrior who conquered jerusalem with his islamic army in the 12th century but mr hussein s legacy , revealed with merciless clarity in his last , desperate weeks in power and in the looting of those palaces that followed , was not one of historical accomplishment , as he claimed , but a chronicle of terror , greed and delusion writ large in effect , mr hussein and his entourage inverted what was said of the dying dignity of a 17thcentury english king , that nothing so became him in life as the leaving of it of mr hussein , who may yet be alive , perhaps hiding somewhere in baghdad with the last of his loyalists , a truer epitaph would record that nothing characterized the way he ruled iraq , for nearly 24 years , so much as the bullying , mendacious and cowardly way in which he and his associates behaved as their power collapsed in the end , some of the closest witnesses to those last days were 150 western reporters , photographers and broadcast technicians who were sequestered throughout the war in the palestine and sheraton hotels on the eastern bank of the tigris river in the heart of baghdad , and taken from there by iraqi officials on closely guided tours of the city from the hotels' upper floors , they had a panoramic view across the muddygreen river to the government quarter , and the palaces , ministries and security headquarters that symbolized mr hussein s grip on power the reporters had a grandstand seat as american bombs and cruise missiles pulverized mr hussein s heavily guarded compounds , encompassing whole districts of baghdad , where he and his family enjoyed the gilded privileges of ancient caliphs in the war s closing stages , the hotels' balconies gave an unimpeded view as american tanks blasted their way from their first foothold in baghdad , the former saddam international airport , into the republican palace presidential compound that was the white house of mr hussein s iraq but what the reporters saw was more than the power of america s arsenal , and the inability , for all their boasts about america finding the graveyard of its imperial ambition in iraq , of mr hussein and his cronies to mount more than a delaying action on the road to their downfall mr hussein himself remained remains , if still alive the furtive , vainglorious figure he ever was , proclaiming from secret sanctuaries his solidarity with his people in their hour of trial , the certain defeat of the enemy , and his unshakable belief in iraq but there were no churchillian scenes of mr hussein visiting the wounded , or clambering atop rubble left by airstrikes instead , the 65yearold iraqi leader appeared on television , until cruise missiles knocked it off the air , in videotapes recorded from a small , lowceilinged room , white sheet against the wall , like a leader of an underground group taunting those hunting him down twice in the last days before american troops seized baghdad , iraqi television showed him on the streets , surrounded , as ever , by adoring crowds the leader revered by his people , but doing nothing , at least nothing that was visible , to help them even at the last , mr hussein s priority was only himself in the late afternoon of wednesday , april 9 , marine corps tanks entered eastern baghdad from the south and took control of the district by the river that encompasses the palestine and sheraton hotels within three hours , after attempts by iraqi men with sledgehammers and ropes had failed , the marines brought up an m80 recovery tank with a long boom to assist in hauling down a 30foot castiron statue of mr hussein in firdos square , behind the hotels if any one moment marked the end of mr hussein s rule , it was the sight of the statue s legs cracking , its torso tumbling , and the severed head and body being pelted with garbage and shoes the ultimate arab insult by the hundreds of iraqis who had gathered to celebrate their freedom to be in the square at that moment was to know , beyond doubt , that iraqis in their millions hated mr hussein , that the truth about iraq was the diametric opposite of all that he and his acolytes had maintained , and that all else that was said about him in the years that went before was the product of relentless terror good , good , bush ! the crowds chanted down , down , saddam ! men and women wept , and reached out to shake the hands of the marines , or simply touch their uniforms thank you , mister ! they cried , again and again hours later , the crowds still milled about the fallen idol , spitting and mocking yet during the whole sequence , it now appears , mr hussein was barely five miles farther north in the district of adhamiya , one of the last safe strongholds for him in baghdad , in the neighborhood of al safina beside the abu hanifa mosque

rush limbaugh s opinions about race , the news media and a black quarterback led to his resignation wednesday as an espn football analyst , but he is fortunate he may never get a sports job again , but he can return to his millions of radio listeners who have heard tougher , more incendiary comments on his talk show than those he made sunday about donovan mcnabb of the philadelphia eagles he is luckier than others in the sports business who have made racially insensitive or misogynistic comments , and lost their careers jimmy \( the greek \) snyder , a cbs football analyst , and al campanis , a longtime los angeles dodgers executive , made disparaging remarks about africanamericans in sports ben wright , a cbs golf commentator , made remarks about the impact of lesbianism on women s golf marge schott was removed from running the team she owned , the cincinnati reds , for uttering intolerant ethnic and racial sentiments , and john rocker , then a reliever for the atlanta braves , has not recovered from the maelstrom he created through his slurs the announcer howard cosell was briefly tainted by the reaction to his calling a black football player a little monkey , but survived limbaugh said mcnabb was overrated , then added , the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback can do well black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well the swift end to limbaugh s job at espn after only five appearances on sunday nfl countdown demonstrated the difficulty he faced in transferring a meticulously defined , politically conservative persona to an established sports program that is about as controversial as the cover 2 defense his own syndicated television program was not a rousing success his politically charged style is better heard , and not seen his listeners know what to expect , said robert thompson , a professor of media and culture at syracuse university but he comes to espn , where he s not the main act , and he s dealing with a different audience that is n't necessarily tuned in to him he did something that he s used to doing , but in a different area where it could n't go unremarkedupon in the short period from sunday afternoon to late tuesday , espn s public relations strategy was to back limbaugh , to emphasize that his comments were focused on the news media and not motivated by politics or race privately , espn officials knew from reviewing the tape that limbaugh had ignited a fire \( thousands of negative email messages poured in \) , but they continued to stress that he was hired to shake things up , to challenge the opinions of his colleagues that achievement , one espn executive said , worked for a quarter of the season on wednesday , limbaugh defended himself on his radio show , but the espn defense was looking weak and terribly na ve calls for his dismissal came from congressmen and presidential contenders talks between limbaugh and espn about his exit strategy began , and he quit around 11 pm eastern time yesterday , untethered and unapologetic , limbaugh told the national association of broadcasters' convention in , of all places , philadelphia , that we live in a country where there is a first amendment , you can offer opinions , but you ca n't , you know , in certain places and at certain times , you ca n't he said espn did not want to deal with the visceral opposition he is used to flaying with glee keith appell , a public relations executive who has worked on republican campaigns , said limbaugh should not have resigned can a prominent white person in america criticize a prominent black person in america without being told his speech is impermissible \? he asked he s got a right to be wrong , but he should n't lose his job because some hypocritical , pinheaded congressmen and presidential candidates become the speech police appell said cosell s remark was inarguably worse than what limbaugh said but cosell survived in part because of his civil rights credentials appell asked , does that mean if you 're a liberal you get a pass on it , and if you 're a conservative , you do n't \? there remain unanswered questions about what espn knew about limbaugh s record of racial commentary when it hired him an espn spokesman would not say what it knew what is known is that the network was enamored of his largerthanlife personality , his ability to articulate his views and his provocative style but steve rendall , senior analyst at fairness and accuracy in reporting , a leftofcenter media watchdog group , said limbaugh s past was a known quantity to disney , which owns 80 percent of espn and 100 percent of abc they did n't hire him off the cuff , rendall said he launched his syndicated show from wabc radio he was vetted for 'monday night football' then he s hired by espn the seriousness of his candidacy for monday night in 2000 has always been in question he was impressive in his audition , but he also served the purpose of producing springtime buzz for the program dennis miller was hired instead fair s compilation of limbaugh s offenses include playing the movin' on up theme song to the jeffersons when discussing carol moseley braun , the former united states senator and current democratic presidential aspirant , and saying the naacp should have riot rehearsal they should get a liquor store and practice robberies fair says it has recordings of many of limbaugh s comments , but it was impossible to verify them independently i wo n't say he s a racist , rendall said , but he knows where the line is and spends a lot of time near it he brandished the race card when he discussed the merits of donovan mcnabb he brought race into it that none of the other panelists on countdown michael irvin and tom jackson , who are black , or steve young and chris berman , who are white reacted to the racial element of limbaugh s remarks was difficult to fathom equally surprising was the failure of the producer to instruct them to respond , if not immediately , then after the ensuing commercial break the oversight produced the impression that espn was happy to let rush be rush and reticent to tackle an inflammatory issue based on what he said , why is he there \? asked kellen winslow , a former san diego chargers tight end who is executive director of the fritz pollard alliance , a group seeking greater minority frontoffice opportunities in the national football league he does n't know football he s a political agitator who s done nothing but agitate the limbaugh issue and espn s raw and dour depiction of a fictitious football team in the playmakers series are not pleasing the league in an interview with the philadelphia inquirer published yesterday , jeffrey lurie , the eagles' owner , accused espn of institutional racism and of taking racial potshots at the league about limbaugh he said , when you hire somebody like that , this is what you 're going to get photo rush limbaugh , speaking at a broadcasters convention , was unapologetic over the remarks that led him to resign \( photo by associated press \) \( pg d7 \)
baghdad , iraq , april 14 order took a slightly firmer hold on baghdad today as american soldiers and a few iraqi police officers patrolled the capital s devastated streets together for the first time , but looting , shooting and burning continued almost a week after saddam hussein s government fell a few more shops reopened , though many had little to sell , and more cars plowed through intersections where the stoplights were still dead there were fewer looters , but also much less to loot in this moment between chaos and calm , emotions here are occupying equally unsettled ground there is growing joy in the realization that mr hussein is really gone but anger that american troops have not stepped in strongly enough to prevent further destruction in the city the situation of iraqis is as if one eye is crying and one eye is laughing , said sayid hashem alshamaa , a shiite leader at the kadhimiya shrine here in baghdad two american soldiers were reported killed today and two others were injured in what was described as a grenade accident at a checkpoint in southern baghdad but none were reported killed by snipers or in combat with the threat diminished by a few notches , united states soldiers seemed more relaxed , chatting more with ordinary iraqis one humvee along a highway was crowded with iraqis talking calmly with the soldiers , a scene that would have been unlikely several days ago but the general situation remained tense in saddam city , a shiite neighborhood now renamed sadr city in honor of a slain shiite cleric , some radicals called for the founding of an islamic state as gun battles erupted again today between rival groups , some of them , residents say , from other arab nations checkpoints manned by gunmen under the control of shiite religious leaders were still in place along the main roads there , taking the role of regular police officers to help consolidate the calm , 20 iraqi policemen set out on the first joint patrol with american marines in eastern baghdad this afternoon several looters were reported arrested during the patrol in the last two days , in response to impassioned pleas for more order , american marines have also begun patrolling on their own to stop looters there were reports tonight that an american soldier shot dead a looter in eastern baghdad today , though the accounts could not be confirmed despite the efforts to restore calm , sporadic gunfire resounded from the banks of the tigris river into the night electricity was still cut off , and many iraqis said that prevented them from reopening shops and schools this afternoon , an interior ministry building where identity cards were issued was set alight , and at dusk three thick black plumes of smoke hung over the nearby tigris looters also made their way into the central bank , carting off hoards of cash the entire national store of children s vaccines against polio , german measles and a number of other childhood diseases was destroyed by thieves who ripped out crucial refrigeration systems lath akram , the storekeeper for the vaccines in a section of the iraqi health ministry , said there is no vaccine at all nothing , nothing , no equipment seventy percent of the children will die if they do not receive the vaccines ambivalence toward the presence of americans seems to have lessened little in the week since they arrived here the feelings were evident on a bridge over the tigris when a squad car of four uniformed iraqi police officers , one of the first such patrols , worked to disperse looters ripping apart a metal guardrail a crowd gathered and demanded to know if they were working for the americans no , no , said one of the officers , abbas adel , 26 we 're working for the iraqi people the crowd did not believe him well , yes , we are working under the control of the americans , but only until things settle down , mr adel said but we are still a real iraqi police force in all , there seem to be more problems and dangers than the american soldiers here can handle and they are largely receiving the blame for it in the sliekh district in northern baghdad , a row of houses exploded in a blast that sent up a huge plume of smoke , injuring what an ambulance driver said was 40 people the craters were rimmed with iraqi shells , and it turned out that many of the surrounding houses in this purely residential neighborhood had been used to store tons of ammunition for the iraqi army a nearby kindergarten and high school were also piled high with ammunition some residents said the explosion had been caused by children playing in the ammunition others said it was the work of forces still loyal to mr hussein either way , they said in anger and frustration , american soldiers had the responsibility to end the danger quickly since the americans are the only people who have control in this country , it is their job to search all the empty houses and schools to make sure they are safe , said hazwan rawin , 45 , who lives near the houses in which the explosions took place the united states military tried to put an iraqi police force on the street today , an effort that culminated with the joint patrols by american soldiers and iraqi policemen this afternoon the effort got off to a shaky start this morning when about 3 , 000 former policemen gathered for a little over 100 jobs the men , who only a few weeks ago were enforcers for the hussein government , began jumping up and down on a portrait of mr hussein , declaring their formerly unquestioned leader nothing and a dog chaos ensued finally , marine officers ordered the new americananointed police chief , gen zuhair abdelrazak alnami , to start over with a list of approved policemen the twist of events was not lost on the americans to restore order , they were relying on the forces of very the government they had come to overthrow we 're going to have to use some of these people , it s a reality , said maj mark stainbrook , a marine officer overseeing the operation photos food being stored yesterday at a mosque in saddam city in baghdad \( ali haider associated press \) \( pg b6 \)

desire and delusion three novellas by arthur schnitzler selected and translated by margret schaefer 264 pp chicago ivan r dee 2850 none of the moderns saw very much of the 19th century there is , however , an odd twilit group of writers who straddle the centuries but carry any amount of 19thcentury baggage intact , among them the viennese playwright and story writer arthur schnitzler \( 18621931 \) when peter gay recapitulated his magisterial study of the 19thcentury bourgeoisie , he called it schnitzler s century other premoderns for me would include poets like yeats \( born in 1865 \) , cavafy \( 1863 \) and rilke \( 1875 \) , and prose writers like chekhov \( 1860 \) , hamsun \( 1859 \) and svevo \( 1861 \) they are on the cusp they are still sequential , social writers they come before abstraction , atonality , anomie and the cult of difficulty things may be out of kilter chekhov and yeats are largely about that but they still believe in kilter , or remember it in his lifetime , schnitzler was hugely popular and scandalously controversial his plays were given big productions , and when they were n't his reigen \( or la ronde \) had to be pulled in 1921 in vienna and berlin after it unleashed antisemitic and neopuritanical sentiments why , then it was even bigger news collections of his stories and novellas the list of titles fills two pages sold 40 , 60 , even 100 printings not now , sure , and not in english still , many people saw stanley kubrick s eyes wide shut or david hare s blue room and wondered about the author they were adapted from two selections of schnitzler s fiction are on the market in new translations by margret schaefer desire and delusion , comprising three novellas , flight into darkness , dying and fr ulein else and , from 2002 , night games , containing the novella of that name , dream story \( the original of frederic raphael s screenplay for the kubrick film \) and seven shorter stories the work is shapely and , as we would say , delivers , and if your tastes run to some of those premodern authors , or maupassant , or the shorter dostoyevsky , then it is probably for you the shorter stories have more in the way of obvious action they turn on things like duels and gambling debts , seduction , dishonor and sudden death none of it is particularly serious it s as though even in his prose , schnitzler were still putting on a spectacle , with protagonists but not characters the officers and professional types and married women and harlots seem to cry out for actors and actresses to lend them a little reality schnitzler himself noted that he was more interested in cases than in individuals this can be attributed to his analytical cast of mind his father was a doctor , and he himself practiced but i feel it is a literary shortcoming \( after all , chekhov was a doctor \) but this is still social writing one reads the more extravagantly cynical stories \( baron von leisenbohg s destiny , say \) with suspense , pleasure , sometimes amusement , though without any more profound attachment as a writer , schnitzler has two somewhat contradictory principal gifts he is very methodical , and he loves to surprise in the novellas in desire and delusion , the emphasis is on the methodical , perhaps as a deeper , more reputable quality in literature in flight into darkness , it s the morbidly suspicious nature of robert , the central figure , finally erupting in a murderous attack in dying , a much better story , it s the progression of felix s fatal illness , and its effect on felix and his sweetheart , marie the illness , or the prognosis , destabilizes their relationship , making it almost a m nage trois here schnitzler is absolutely believable if there s a shock , it s the shock of truth , not a coup de th tre the fluent array of feelings is kaleidoscopic marie did not stir from the sickbed what an endless afternoon it was !

less than an hour after playing his final game last wednesday , michael jordan stepped into the back of a media room , an unlit cigar hanging out of his mouth , and heard allen iverson , the diminutive philadelphia 76ers star , say that jordan was the reason he began playing basketball moments later , after they crossed paths on the way to and from the podium , jordan assured the throng of reporters that because of players like iverson , the nba would be fine without him in his next game , iverson assured everyone more emphatically , turning in a performance in philadelphia s game 1 playoff victory over new orleans on sunday night that was perhaps as impressive as jordan s record 63point postseason gem against boston on april 20 , 1986 scoring 55 points , the 6foot iverson became only the sixth player to score at least that many points in a playoff game , joining jordan , elgin baylor , wilt chamberlain , charles barkley and rick barry the basket looked like an ocean , iverson said i was throwing rocks in it iverson s virtuoso performance was the most productive one on an impressive playoff weekend the nba could not have asked for a better start to the postjordan era , as four stars , none older than 27 , led their teams to victory by scoring 40 or more points dirk nowitzki scored 46 points to lead dallas past portland tracy mcgrady ran through the toughest defense in the eastern conference and scored 43 points to lift orlando over detroit , and paul pierce made 21 of 21 free throws and scored 40 in boston s comefrombehind victory over indiana last season , there were four individual performances of 40 or more points in the entire postseason , a total of 71 games , and two of them were by shaquille o'neal throw in kobe bryant s 39point game against minnesota he scored 28 in the first half and stephon marbury s buzzerbeating 3pointer in phoenix s overtime upset of san antonio , and six of the league s eight games last weekend included something notable those guys are doing what superstars are supposed to do , said barkley , now a tnt analyst they 're taking their teams to another level by being aggressive the playoffs is a time for stars those stars gave a welcome ratings boost to the nba on tnt , as the cable network had a 31 percent increase in viewership over last season s opening weekend can this individual explosion continue \? since the nba switched to a 16team playoff format in 1984 , the record for most 40point performances in a postseason is 16 , set in 2001 that year , eight players reached at least 40 points in a game neither barkley nor jeff van gundy , the former knicks coach and an analyst for tnt , see a 40point binge on the horizon it just means a lot of guys played defense like i did , barkley said , jokingly i do n't think it s going to be very many 40point games when you look at the finished product i thought all of the games were fun to watch those guys put on tremendous displays but i do n't think there s going to be like 25 40point games at the end of the playoffs van gundy said the opposing coaches would make adjustments , and that was evident on monday night , when indiana limited pierce to 14 points and only 5 freethrow attempts when van gundy coached the knicks against jordan s chicago teams in the 1990 s , the plan was to play jordan oneonone for the first three quarters and then doubleteam him in the fourth to get the ball out of his hands van gundy expects to see more of that , but there could be drawbacks dallas , for example , has so many other options in michael finley , steve nash and nick van exel that paying too much attention to nowitzki could prove costly the same goes for bryant because of o'neal iverson s incomparable quickness makes it tough to doubleteam him mcgrady , who lacks a topflight partner in orlando , would seem to be the most vulnerable to the doubleteam i think all four teams that got hurt by the big scoring night by the best player are going to have to consider some timely double teams , van gundy said i do n't think you want to allow , especially in the fourth quarter , the best player to get the majority of the shots , particularly when they 're on a roll it s harder against a lot of these guys because they 're perimeter players and the further you doubleteam away from the basket , the more you expose the basket area to advantages for the offense , he added but i think all the coaches will probably go back and replan their fourthquarter defense to make sure that other people have to shoot the ball late although iverson s 55point effort reminded some of jordan s performance against boston in 1986 , the scoring spree of the 24yearold nowitzki had his coach , don nelson , thinking of one of the legends jordan went against that day when he scored 63 points in a doubleovertime loss to the celtics i told him at the end of regulation that he 'll eventually be one of the best to play the game , nelson said of nowitzki eventually , he 'll be able to do the things that larry bird did maybe jordan was right maybe the nba will be fine without him photos four players scored at least 40 points last weekend , including orlando s tracy mcgrady , above , who scored 43 points , and dallas s dirk nowitzki , who scored 46 \( photographs by getty images \)
bridgewater , nj enough already about the curse of the bambino it is superstitious it is silly and it should also be clear by now to new england that the red sox did not turn eternally luckless until they traded albert \( sparky \) lyle thirtyone years ago they sent lyle , a budding cy young awardwinning closer , to the yankees for danny cater forget ancient history , forget babe ruth , this was the deal that sentenced the red sox to decades of endgame and lateseason meltdowns when i heard about the trade , i went to say thanks to dick o'connell , the general manager , because the red sox were the team that gave me my start in the major leagues , lyle said earlier this week in the dugout of the somerset patriots , the central new jersey team he manages in the independent atlantic league i remember knocking on the door and , you know , he must have thought i was going to kick his butt because i kept knocking and he would n't come out o'connell would n't come out , and for the better part of three decades and counting the red sox have n't found that special someone , that sparky lyle or goose gossage or mariano rivera , to bring in what , then , is another yankeesred sox series , another showdown of the perennial no 1 versus the pathological no 2 beginning this afternoon at yankee stadium without a simple debriefing on their bullpens \? one team has one and the other team does n't , lyle ascertained , with the kind of smartmouthed commentary that made his 1979 book with peter golenbock , the bronx zoo , the must read it was not that the yankees have n't had their own setup issues this season , but there is always the matter of relativity the yankees have sprung leaks the red sox have endured floods rivera , closer nonpareil , recently found his groove , and the yankees relocated first place the red sox have spent a halfseason trying out a rookie , brandon lyon , and have blown enough games like last night s 65 defeat at tampa bay after leading , 53 , in the eighth to last a season while rivera was averting disaster in the ninth inning at shea stadium last saturday night , shutting down the mets after they had rallied from 90 to 98 , the red sox were blowing all of a 92 lead against florida and losing , 109 lyon , who had an encouraging earlyseason run , surrendered a threerun home run to mike lowell in the ninth inning , and , up at fenway , it was d j vu all over again soon , young lyon was n't the closer anymore the job went to byung hyun kim , the korean righthander who has his own set of yankee stadium baggage , packed into consecutive nights from the world series with arizona two years ago will kim , who closed competently for the diamondbacks before they converted him to a starter , be more longterm solution than inseason bandaid , or will he be another victim of sparky s scar \? history tells us that the red sox , from time to time , have been teased dick drago was good enough in 1975 to get them to the world series in 1986 , calvin schiraldi showed promise until he was one out away against the mets rick aguilera flourished in 1995 ditto tom gordon , who saved 46 games in 1998 none finished what they started in the postseason or stayed around boston very long the few guys they did have , they wound up letting go , lyle said the way the red sox traded him , at 27 , entering his prime , and after 53 saves in his previous three seasons the way they let dennis eckersley , a fading starter , slip away before someone else had the idea of making him a closer , and one with perhaps the best location and control anyone has ever had the red sox are always searching for answers this season , they were supposed to be embracing the philosophy of bill james , their newly signed consultant , who advocates bringing your best reliever into the game at its most crucial point , as opposed to saving him for the ninth his theory is interesting and may yet be tested , but it does n't resolve the problem of not having what lyle called that monster guy to bring in , no matter what inning it is as long as rivera is healthy , he is the difference , with his cutter and his quiet confidence his expression never changes , lyle said you know he s coming after you with his best pitch , and it s always strike one , strike one , strike one lyle threw his slider , without fear and without much regard to pitch count , as in the 1977 playoffs at kansas city when he was working overtime on fumes and billy martin asked the shortstop , fred stanley , about lyle s stuff he could n't get my grandmother out , stanley said martin looked at his lefthander , who said , i'm not facing my grandmother of course the story was peppered with profanity , punctuated by laughter this mustachioed 58yearold who once enjoyed planting himself naked onto birthday cakes still has impish eyes and a smile that makes you think tobacco juice his point was that closing , in the end , is more about attitude than it is about art recently , lyle lost his best closer , 35yearold scott aldred , to pawtucket , the red sox' class aaa farm team big guy , good fastball , heck of a curve and he s not afraid to throw it , lyle said they should bring him up to the big club , see what he can do i mean , who else do they have \? byung hyun kim , for now , as boston s long search for another sparky continues this weekend in the bronx
and none of them would take out the trash mayor michael bloomberg was a little late for anne ford s book party at the four seasons restaurant last week , and when she heard he was arriving , ms ford went down to the entrance to meet him ms ford , flanked by a gaggle of pals , was wearing a ruffled silk lilac dress by roland nivelais the mayor , flanked by his security detail , was in pinstripes and how did they know one another , a guest asked we went out together , ms ford said sure , it was years ago , the mayor said we had dinner upstairs the group trooped , and it was not until the party was almost over that we were able to ask ms ford the allimportant question about the town s most prominent bachelor so \? we met at a dinner party he has been a friend for a long time and very supportive , ms ford said we dated once or twice it was n't heavy dating was he charming \? oh , yeah , he was fun we had a good time together the last time we went out to queens he was running then and we were covering the territory and here at boldface we think we live the glamorous life ! but to the party , celebrating ms ford s book , laughing allegra , in which ms ford tells of raising a child who had severe learning disabilities at the party allegra ford , 31 gloria vanderbilt and her son , the cnn anchor anderson cooper charlie rose tom brokaw myrna blyth dominick dunne and julian niccolini , an owner of the four seasons , whom we at boldface think of as naughty niccolini we were also impressed to see so many of the men in ms ford s life in the same room former husbands gianni uzielli and chuck scarborough and her old friends , the former governor of new york hugh carey and michael kramer of the daily news is the smoking thing impacting you at all \? the mayor asked mr niccolini i keep saying we have to have lunch , mr dunne said to ms vanderbilt what book are you working on now , we asked mr brokaw i'm not going to tell you , mr brokaw said we did better with arnold scaasi what is mr scaasi doing now \? i make couture clothes for very rich and thin ladies , he said why only thin \? they take care of themselves , they exercise constantly , they have their faces , stomachs and hips done and they look great and they are very intelligent it seems to us that men can get away with having a distinguishing belly i have never seen a distinguishing belly in my life , mr scaasi said mr scaasi has a bit of one i am 65 years old and that is what happens , and life goes on and you drink vodka , mr scaasi said the party winds down all my exhusbands and boyfriends were there , is n't that great \? ms ford said to her publicist our last publisher buried us without a party another book party we 've been meaning to tell you about the one for the joy of funerals , a collection of short stories by alix strauss , held earlier this month at the frank e campbell home on madison avenue there were three funerals going on at the time of the event at the entrance to the room there was a floral decoration in the shape of a horseshoe , like one we had last seen at the funeral for john gotti one of the first entries in the guest book was mom and dad strauss inside , a closed coffin was flanked by a poster for the book , and guests sipped champagne ms strauss , a blonde in a slim black pantsuit , told us that the book came out of experience as an only child , going to funerals i never got to see family members , unless it was at a funeral , so to me , a funeral s just like a big party , she said of course , there s always one less family member , and it s not a catered event or anything and we gather she s primarily a magazine writer who has done massmarket books for teenagers including one on britney spears \? yeeees , ms strauss said we do n't really talk about here she interrupted herself you know what , though \? we do the happy britney spears dance every time a great large check comes so , you know , when someone says , 'here s 15 , 000 , can you write a book in a month and a half , ' you pretty much say , 'ok , ' you know \? we give ms strauss points for the month s most innovative gift bag , which included vodka , overthecounter sleeping pills , tissues and waterproof mascara

children were left with sherry l murphy , a cousin of ms williams in all , the state s division of youth and family services investigated 10 allegations of abuse or neglect against ms williams over a 10year period , officials said , including charges that the children were not being fed and that their home was dirty and infested with rodents agents reported that all but three allegations were

senator bob graham of florida ended his bid for the white house on last night after months of struggling to attract enough money and support to mount a competitive campaign he is the first of the 10 democrats in the race to drop out i have made the judgment that i cannot be elected president of the united states , mr graham said on larry king live on cnn the announcement , squeezed into the final minutes of a program about the entertainers siegfried roy and their tigers , brought a surreal end to a period of intense disarray and confusion at the graham campaign the senator once appeared to be among the most formidable contenders , and many democrats were flummoxed by how a candidacy that had seemed so promising could fail to catch fire a former twotermgovernor and thirdterm senator , mr graham remains popular in florida , a state that is considered crucial to winning the presidency in 2004 a respected capitol hill veteran with national security expertise , he was chairman of the senate intelligence committee at the time of the sept 11 attacks and voted against authorizing the war in iraq delayed by heart surgery , however , his duties on the intelligence committee and the war in iraq , mr graham entered the contest late and never managed to catch up , he said all of those things combined to make it difficult for us to have the time and to close the gap in organization and fundraising , which have led to this difficult decision , he said mr graham said he would not yet endorse another candidate he also said he had not made up his mind whether to run for a fourth senate term next year but mr graham , who has been considered as a running mate by a few democratic nominees , left open the door to running for vice president if asked i am prepared to do whatever i can to contribute to a democratic victory next november and a moving of this nation onto a new and better track , he said known as courtly and mild mannered in the senate , mr graham became something of a bombthrower on the campaign trail , frequently going further than his rivals in upbraiding president bush for what he called national security lapses even so , he failed to capture the attention of voters increasingly unhappy with mr bush s approach mr graham had hoped to finish fourth or better in the iowa caucus , in january , and then use that as a springboard to a better showing in the sun belt states , starting with south carolina his departure could help some of his fellow moderates in the race the senator , a multimillionaire , tried to capitalize on his background growing up on a farm to appeal to the rural voters considered increasingly important to democratic victories but mr graham trailed his rivals badly in raising money , which proved fatal to the campaign mr graham is expected to report bringing in about 2 million for the most recent quarter , less than what gen wesley k clark says he has been able to collect in just two weeks it had been clear for some time that mr graham s bid was becoming an increasingly steep uphill battle , and many supporters and prominent democrats said it was no longer a question of whether he would leave the race , but when two fundraising coordinators had recently left the campaign , as had a spokesman mr graham had said he planned to realign the staff after making a decision about the future of the campaign mr graham became increasingly remote in recent days , huddling with close advisers and family members , many of whom were involved in the campaign , and holding few public events for days the campaign staff had been in a state of suspended animation , unsure of whether they would soon be moved to iowa , south carolina or let go entirely at a budget meeting at the end of last week , several top aides presented him with options for going forward at his miami lakes headquarters mr graham had been putting up a brave front in the face of increasing evidence of difficulties at a fundraiser in coral gables last week , mr graham told reporters that leaving the contest was not on the table and that the campaign was going very well over the weekend , he appeared very much the candidate , telling democratic party loyalists how he would win later , he told reporters that he had discussed his struggling campaign with former president bill clinton and the senate minority leader , tom daschle , as well as other senate colleagues and that none had encouraged him to quit still , he repeatedly refused to say he would not bow out of the race we have a number of options that we are considering , he said then we are looking at the ways to be the next president of the united states but along the campaign trail , he appeared unable to sway large groups of voters , and he had been unable to affect the race

washington it was officially just a preliminary hearing at the department of transportation but it had barely begun when the judge scolded the lawyers for dhl airways , the cargo airline for dhl worldwide express moving his eyeglasses to the tip of his nose , ronnie a yoder , chief administrative law judge , stared sternly at the lawyers as he expressed outrage over letters he had received from dhl airways employees , accusing him of conspiring with its two big competitors , fedex and united parcel service , to put dhl airways out of business i assume that none of dhl s host of counsel had anything to do with this , he said one letter , the judge said crossly , asked of him why are you so nearsighted \? why are you trying to destroy my job and my family s future and who are you working for \? while the dhl airways lawyers squirmed , lawyers and lobbyists for fedex and ups grinned and gloated in the spectator seats this round is going to us , one whispered the preliminary hearing , held last tuesday , was part of a longrunning battle in which fedex and ups have joined forces against dhl worldwide express the outcome could reshape the 30 billion domestic air freight industry fedex and ups want the court to determine whether dhl airways is operating illegally public hearings are scheduled to begin in late summer under federal law , foreigners are prohibited from controlling any domestic commercial airline although dhl airways appears to be controlled by americans , fedex and ups contend that it is really controlled by deutsche post , the german governmentrun postal service that owns dhl worldwide express , the largest international air shipper deutsche post is in effective control of dhl airways through a new york city subwaylike map of companies and officers , said david a bolger , a ups spokesman they want to have dual citizenship to run their airline anywhere they want a clear violation of international and us law the battle is unusual partly because fedex , which is based in memphis , and ups , based in atlanta , are such strange bedfellows the coke and pepsi of the cargo world , they are archrivals but they are working toward a common goal to shut down , or at least slow down , dhl worldwide express in the united states the timing for ups and fedex , which collectively control nearly 80 percent of the domestic shipping market , is urgent dhl worldwide announced in late march that it plans to acquire airborne , a seattlebased rival to fedex and ups the combination would enable dhlairborne to be a viable competitor in the united states delivery business the battle also comes as ups is challenging fedex s domination of the air shipping market and as fedex is aggressively building a ground operation to steal market share from ups , leaving them with little tolerance for a new rival ups and fedex worry that deutsche post will subsidize a combined dhlairborne , enabling it to price shipping services at a severe discount that would clearly jeopardize the ups and fedex duopoly , which has dominated domestic shipping for nearly two decades ups and fedex say deutsche post plays fast and loose with the law , pointing to a settlement it made with the european commission after it had been found to have illegally subsidized dhl worldwide express in europe in the early 1990 s to undercut the competition a combined dhlairborne hopes to take market share from ups and fedex s small and midsize business accounts , which tend to have higher margins than large corporate accounts and which are typically heavily discounted using a novel legal argument , ups and fedex have decided to focus their attention on grounding dhl s airplanes they say that even if american citizens technically own dhl airways , the ownership structure is just a ruse because dhl airways derives almost all its business from dhl worldwide express therefore , according to this theory , dhl airways is controlled by foreigners and operates illegally in this country they are trying to create new legal theory here it s absurd , said carl donaway , airborne s chief executive , who will become the chief of dhl worldwide sunited states operations it s very transparent that this is about protecting the duopoly klaus zumwinkel , the chief executive of deutsche post , declined to comment for this article but he has been a vocal critic of fedex and ups at a recent conference in germany , mr zumwinkel accused the united states of applying what he called discriminating measures to protect their transportation and logistics market fedex and ups , two of the largest corporate political donors , are certainly not averse to putting pressure on washington after losing an attempt to ground dhl airways in 2001 , ups and fedex successfully lobbied congress in april to force the department of transportation to hear their case they were able to have an amendment added to congress s warspending bill , despite vocal opposition from the white house and two republican senators , john mccain of arizona and trent lott of mississippi , who feared the change s impact on aviation policy
bras lia the country s leading newsmagazine calls it the most radical and voracious partisanization of the state bureaucratic structure in brazilian history since taking office at the start of the year , president luiz in cio da silva has stuffed government ministries and agencies with political appointees , many of them unseasoned , and the country is now feeling the effect of their efforts to learn on the job mr da silva s workers' party had limited administrative experience , even at state and municipal levels , when it began to govern this nation of 175 million people one result , critics contend , has been confusion and immobility , as thousands of posts have been filled with party loyalists complaints of delayed and inefficient services are multiplying , and even with budget cuts , some government ministries are so unsettled that they seem likely to end the year unable to spend money allotted them the workers' party has created a model in which militancy in the party or a labor union counts more than administrative experience or an academic curriculum , said l cia hipp lito , a political scientist who has studied the bureaucracy for 20 years they 've gone way beyond the policymaking level and deep into the management level with inexperienced people who do not know how to run the machinery of state and are committing one folly after another party leaders reject accusations of incompetence and deny that any housecleaning or disruption of the bureaucracy has occurred but they also say that in emphasizing political loyalty as a criterion for appointments , they are merely doing what other parties have done in the past there has been no division of spoils or dismissals for political reasons , jos genoino , president of the governing party , said in an interview at the party s headquarters in s o paulo the state apparatus is functioning normally , and where we have made changes , it has been with people from within the civil service the egalitarian structure the workers' party has traditionally favored may be contributing to the perception of chaos , political analysts say mr da silva has on several occasions been publicly contradicted by his own cabinet ministers , whose own declarations have sometimes been rebutted by their subordinates , leaving doubt as to who makes policy and what that policy actually is it is the logic of a social movement transferred to the structure of government , and that has grave consequences , said edson nunes , author of the political grammar of brazil and a professor of political science at candido mendes university in rio de janeiro the workers' party does n't recognize the idea of hierarchy , and since everyone is a comrade , you have a lack of command and rank and even of loyalty to the minister during the presidential campaign last year , mr da silva , a former factory worker and labor leader , was openly contemptuous of the technocrats he said had mismanaged the brazilian economy and turned a blind eye to corruption a lathe operator can do a better job , he said repeatedly in stump speeches , promising a new era of efficiency and honesty but to fill so many posts , the government has in fact quietly eased job qualifications the prerequisite of a college degree for some senior posts has been dropped at the national health foundation , a decree that required five years of experience in health care for regional directors was summarily changed to a preference in august , the government was widely criticized after news reports that the national cancer institute had been forced to reduce its activities because of shortages of basic supplies , even bandages as a result of those lapses , which were attributed to administrative incompetence , hospitals that had been performing 20 operations a day were doing none and chemotherapy treatments for some patients were suspended the country is paralyzed , the columnist newton rodrigues complained recently in the rio de janeiro daily jornal do brasil while mr da silva s own popularity rating remains high , several recent polls indicate that a majority of brazilians now consider his government to be mediocre or bad the party has also tried to extend political control of regulatory agencies created in the mid1990 s and meant to be nonpartisan they 've outsourced political power , mr da silva complained early this year in reference to the agencies' independence in setting utility rates and the price of gasoline after investors in those and other enterprises expressed concern over what they perceived as efforts to force agency directors out so they could be replaced with workers' party loyalists , the government retreated somewhat but a recent legislative proposal intended to place a presidential appointee with supervisory powers in each agency has reawakened those concerns a requirement that all enrolled members of the workers' party give a portion of their salary to the party s coffers is also drawing scrutiny the percentage rises when a party member takes a government job , meaning that each political appointment strengthens the party s campaign war chest all told , the leading newsmagazine veja recently calculated , the party will have raised more than 10 million for municipal elections next year , a huge sum by brazilian standards , through such levies mr genoino called that figure too high , but said he could not provide his own estimate and denied that there was any conflict of interest or ethics it s much better for a political party to be sustained by its members than by companies , he said these contributions are voluntary and more symbolic than quantitative , but it seems natural to me that everyone affiliated with a political party should give something
that man an insider s portrait of franklin d roosevelt by robert h jackson edited by john q barrett illustrated 290 pp new york oxford university press 30 franklin delano roosevelt by roy jenkins completed with the assistance of richard e neustadt 186 pp new york times books henry holt company 20 in the decade after franklin delano roosevelt s death in 1945 , washington was noisy with the earnest clatter of typewriters public servants of all stripes labored to publish their recollections of roosevelt soon hemingway and steinbeck were yielding space on america s shelves to fdr s cabinet secretaries , speechwriters and sons , as well as his secret service agent , his physician and , for good measure , his cook the fdr memoir remained a fertile genre through the mid1950 s by the time it waned , roosevelt s writers had contributed innumerable clunkers , but also a few classics , like robert sherwood s roosevelt and hopkins and harold ickes s secret diary it turns out that robert h jackson , who served as roosevelt s attorney general before being appointed a justice of the supreme court and , in 194546 , senior american prosecutor at nuremberg , was working on an fdr memoir of his own when he died in 1954 the unfinished manuscript , which jackson titled that man , passed to his son and spent the next halfcentury in a manhattan closet in 1999 , when jackson s son died , his family discovered the draft and enlisted a law professor and jackson scholar , john q barrett , to prepare it for publication the result is a lively , revealing and suddenly relevant book jackson s memoir sheds new light not always flattering on important events and on a president who too often appears only in silhouette a felt fedora , an upwardtilting chin , a cigarette holder clenched in a grin jackson conceived of that man as a topical treatment of interesting incidents rather than a history or diary the end product , stitched together by barrett , augments jackson s manuscript with fragments of a draft autobiography , transcripts of oral history interviews and other documents though the sutures are visible , barrett s selections are well chosen and annotated , and sparkle with what jackson himself called impish candor actually , that man is about two men jackson and roosevelt , both native new yorkers , first met in albany after the 1910 elections jackson was an apprentice lawyer from upstate , roosevelt an untested aristocrat in the state senate fdr struck jackson as all amateur a hothouse plant just set out among weathered and hardy rivals in 1934 , roosevelt , having undercut this impression , presumably , by getting elected president , called jackson to washington to join the administration over the next seven years , before being elevated to the supreme court , jackson played key roles in promoting fdr s ruinous courtpacking plan , in urging him to seek a third term and in shaping the destroyer deal that in 1940 sent outmoded american ships to britain in exchange for naval and air bases on british territories that man displays none of the affectations of intimacy , the straining for a seat at the table , that cheapen so many presidential memoirs past and present jackson s relationship with roosevelt was genuinely close and candid one of the delights of this book is a memo that jackson dictated for his files in late 1937 , after a 10day yachting trip with roosevelt and a handful of advisers jackson offers a rare glimpse of fdr at ease , back before presidential vacations became a sort of public theater , performed in denim workshirts in front of photographers on the yacht , roosevelt was away from curious eyes , jackson recalls we were completely isolated roosevelt mixes martinis and takes his men sightseeing but is never far from his work he combs through pages of news , reads the mail that is dropped twice daily by naval plane and considers ways to keep fiorello la guardia , the mayor of new york , out of the governor s mansion in fishing contests , playing cards and conversation , jackson writes , roosevelt was and wanted to be an equal he asked no favors and granted none he played the game on its merits he was able to avoid all pose though jackson is loyal the book s title appropriates , with a wink , an epithet used by roosevelt haters who could not bear to utter the president s name he does not exalt his subject like many of his contemporaries , jackson lauds roosevelt s great gifts as a leader the profound selfassurance that lifted the nation during the depression the prescience in preparing for war the bold , persistent experimentation that roosevelt called for as a candidate and delivered as president yet jackson is frank about fdr s failings among them is the president s erratic management style his habit of committing himself in a hurry and making snap judgments on insufficient information , especially on economic matters this is not an indictment it is an observation , offered impartially i do not , jackson writes , set myself up as one to appraise the mental processes of the president a credo with few , if any , adherents today
the sailmaker s daughter by stephanie johnson 255 pp new york st martin s press 2395 with his many sons and almost feral daughter , olive , the ship s chandler hughie mcnab is the kind of character who only rarely appears in the fiction of the british empire a local tradesman for whom the south seas have become home , not a posting from which he will return perhaps you could find him in conrad a minor character , at best i can imagine marlow ordering some canvas from the family workrooms in suva , the capital of the fiji islands , and picking up a bit of gossip to patch a hole in a story though even marlow may never have gotten as far as this distant colony , an archipelago for which new zealand is the nearest big place stephanie johnson has dedicated this taut and canny book to her grandmother , who was born in suva and died in auckland , where johnson now lives that suggests she has relied on some family memories , but the the sailmaker s daughter has nothing claustrophobic about it , as is often the case with novels drawn from a private history the mcnabs have been born with brine instead of blood , and their story is like a splash of seawater in the face it stings , it refreshes , and you go on feeling it long after you 're dry it s november 1918 , and hughie s second wife , adela , lies dying of the spanish flu one son from his first marriage is already dead in france another has come home shellshocked , a mournful , smokepuffing specter but the house is too crowded for adela to die in , so hughie sends olive away , along with a pair of the younger boys and his own old boot of a mother , to stay with his sister , maud , and her husband on taveuni , another of the fijian islands that s a lot of characters to keep track of , but the real complications in this ambitious novel lie in what the characters have to say to themselves johnson intercuts the voices of half a dozen firstperson narrators with her own thirdperson account of olive s adventures , providing dramatic interior monologues from one adult or another adela or grandmother mcnab , hughie or an english lady visitor , the repellent agnes perkinsgreen so we learn of the young adela s career as an actress in new zealand and watch as , on her deathbed , she gets out her old tubes of greasepaint , then gallantly , grotesquely paints on the face she used to have we see hughie sitting in his shop at midnight on nov 11 , armistice day , taking up a sail hook and beginning to sew a seam in the dark with every stitch a step towards the hook , three stitches to an inch , with every stitch a wish for adela to convalesce i must be drunk family secrets emerge , and hidden loves a plenitude of stories all going on side by side , with each voice sharply distinguished from the others but it is 12yearold olive who fills most of these pages , a girl with an allergy to aprons though her voice is filtered through johnson s own , her tale is nevertheless that of all children her growing awareness of the limits of the adults around her and of her own childhood s end one night , when the world seems to stand apart from her , she skips stones across a lake , trying to make a deal with providence , bargaining that however many skips the stone makes will be the years mother lives from tonight three and a bit except that her mother does n't even have three days olive has always been able to count on a touch of second sight she is aware , for example , that the war is over before the news reaches the colony by the book s conclusion , however , she realizes that there would be no more visions and knows she must begin to understand her world without them johnson is hardly sentimental about the end of olive s childhood still , the touch of wordsworthian mysticism with which she depicts it does seem more palatable in a historical novel than it would in a book set in the present day no detail in the sailmaker s daughter seems innocently chosen every word goes to map that foreign country we call the past , to define the uncanniness of people who are less like us than they at first appear olive s visions are part of the period s own understanding of childhood , a time of the soul s union with the physical world around it it is a world that for this young colonial seems not edenic so much as elemental new and at times malign , but still filled with the very pulse of life and other moments here only increase our sense of a gap between past and present , the gap that in itself provides the subject of all historical fiction johnson insists , for example , on noting those things over which the fiction of 1918 drew a decorous veil things that in this novel are quite frankly gynecological other scenes carry a more explicitly political burden , and perhaps a literary one too fiji s plantations were worked by a force of indentured indian laborers , and when , toward the end of the book , olive s aunt maud goes on trial for striking one of her servants , the courtroom scenes come loaded with echoes of a passage to india except that everything here is underplayed , in a way that forster himself would have approved of what would be neartragedy in india becomes something close to farce in fiji another strand in the book calls up both charlotte bront and jean rhys , though johnson s madwoman can live in the sun with her fierce memories of the english lover who abandoned her the sailmaker s daughter is n't perfect its narrative slackens a bit just before the finish , as if the wind had died , and as much as i like its allusiveness , some passages are almost too bookishly cunning the novel could use a touch of recklessness yet although it s written in a language too sinewy for lyricism , it s like a piece of chamber music in a minor key , full of the sounds of boats and waves and the eerie melody of olive s coming adolescence at the end of the novel , she hears some strange noises in the next room and decides that it s time to ask about all

negotiations on a proposed land swap involving the world trade center site and new york city s two airports , which had been mostly dormant since late summer , have gained new momentum in recent weeks , officials involved in the rebuilding effort in lower manhattan said yesterday the port authority of new york and new jersey , which owns the trade center site , and the city of new york , which owns the land beneath the airports , remain far apart on how much the port authority would pay the city in such a swap but two officials in the rebuilding effort , who spoke on the condition that they not be identified , said that both the port authority and the city had showed renewed interest in the swap since mayor michael r bloomberg unveiled his proposals for the revitalization of lower manhattan last month the renewed interest was first reported yesterday in the new york post the land swap was originally proposed in august by the bloomberg administration although port authority officials said they were intrigued by the idea , they complained at the time that the offer lacked details the officials said yesterday that the two sides remained far apart on how much the port authority should pay the city the city has sought more money for back rent , to make up for what it considers to be the low payments for the airport concession , as well as payments in lieu of taxes on the trade center , payments that were under negotiation before sept 11 , 2001 asked about the talks at a news conference yesterday , mr bloomberg said well , talks continue none of these things happen overnight there are a lot of conflicting interests , and you have to try to balance all of them greg trevor , a port authority spokesman , said yesterday , we look forward to continued discussions with new york city toward a resolution that will benefit the people of the city and this region the bloomberg administration has been trying to renegotiate its lease for the operation of the airports with the port authority that agreement guarantees the city only 3 million a year for the airport concession , although the authority paid an average of 23 million a year over the last 10 years the city has reportedly been hoping to collect as much as 660 million in back rent such a deal would deliver the port authority from managing what has become one of the most arguedover parcels of land in the country also , if less than the 11 million square feet of destroyed office space is restored on the site , it will be less valuable many new yorkers have urged city and state officials to take over the redevelopment of the trade center site from the port authority residents of the city are split , however , on who they think should have more influence over the site s development in a poll of 1 , 003 new york city residents conducted by the new york times last week , 39 percent said they believed mr bloomberg should have more influence , while 35 percent said they believed gov george e pataki should the poll s margin of error was three percentage points

washington , nov 18 the chairman of the securities and exchange commission told congress on tuesday that he supported a plan for an overhaul of the way mutual funds govern themselves , forcing their chairmen and threequarters of their directors to be independent responding to a crisis both in the mutual fund industry and at the commission , which until recently never looked for trading abuses , the sec chairman , william h donaldson , outlined proposals beyond those he announced on friday the proposals would require more independent directors , 75 percent of the board , up from the current 50 percent they would require directors of funds to perform annual evaluations of their effectiveness and would permit them to hire their own staff so they would not rely too heavily on the fund s investment advisers they would also require funds to disclose more details about their fees mr donaldson s plan did little to discourage some lawmakers from pushing legislation that would go beyond the steps being considered by the commission representative richard h baker , a louisiana republican who heads a subcommittee of the financial services committee , said he expected that the house would soon take up a measure he has sponsored that would tighten regulation we all regulators , legislators , investment advisers , mutual fund managers , brokerdealers , the financial press and investors have spent much time lately wondering how the current abuses could have happened , mr donaldson said in testimony before the senate committee on banking , housing and urban affairs a significant reason is because the industry lost sight of certain fundamental principles including its responsibilities to the millions of people who entrusted their confidence , the fruits of their labor , their hopes and dreams for the future to this industry for safekeeping he also acknowledged that the commission had failed to find problems early enough none of the current cases against a dozen mutual fund firms came about as a result of inspections by the sec officials say that the inspectors were never assigned to look for abusive trading practices like those that have been revealed , although a recent industry survey by the commission found that such practices might be pervasive for too long , the commission has found itself in a position of reacting to market problems , rather than anticipating them , mr donaldson said there are countless reasons for this not the least of which include historically lagging resources and structural and organizational roadblocks the time for excuses has long passed he said that in two weeks , the commission would vote on proposals to end afterhours trading in mutual funds and to require greater disclosure of fund policies on quick markettimed trades while representative baker pushes his bill in the house , the senate is not expected to take up a measure before next year some lawmakers have filed bills , but senator richard shelby , the alabama republican who heads the senate banking committee , has said he is not convinced of the need for new laws in a letter to mr shelby and his counterpart in the house , treasury secretary john w snow and alan greenspan , the chairman of the federal reserve , urged congress to ensure that mutual fund fees are fully subject to the competitive tests of the marketplace they also said that any new disclosure requirements for the funds should be designed to provide investors with real value rather than serve mainly to increase costs and decrease returns mr donaldson said that on dec 3 , the commission would consider a proposal to end late trading by setting what he called a hard 4 o'clock cutoff , after which any purchase or sale orders would be priced the next day and the commission will probably adopt a measure requiring mutual funds to spell out their policies on certain kinds of quick trading , or market timing , and strong compliance programs , including a chief compliance officer , for the funds after those actions , the commission is expected to consider mr donaldson s proposal for more independent directors and chairmen the investment company institute , the industry s main trade organization , has said that there is no need to require boards to be led by independent chairmen the president of the institute , matthew fink , said 4 of the 12 mutual fund companies that had acknowledged being under investigation had independent chairmen , suggesting that it did not matter whether the leader of the board was independent or part of senior management john collins , a spokesman for the institute , said a recent check of fund companies controlling nearly 90 percent of the industry s assets found that 20 percent of the boards had chairmen or lead directors who were independent in the senate , lawmakers questioned mr donaldson about how the commission had missed the problems and had been overshadowed by state regulators he acknowledged the agency s shortcomings while defending it against criticism from state officials both democrats and republicans on the committee asked mr donaldson whether the agency had sufficient resources and expertise to find and fix market problems he replied that the commission was preparing to open a unit to anticipate new areas of market problems clearly , we can improve the effectiveness of the way we go about doing things , he said we did not inspect for late trading and market timing nor has the commission inspected for that for many years the extent of this has come as a surprise to us , he added mr donaldson tried to deflect criticism from state officials , like attorney general eliot spitzer of new york and william f galvin , secretary of the commonwealth of massachusetts , that the commission had been too quick to settle complaints of wrongdoing in the case it brought against putnam investments , the nation s fifthlargest fund company senator christopher j dodd , democrat of connecticut , pressed mr donaldson about the relationship between the sec and state regulators we ca n't have you and mr spitzer and the guy in massachusetts screaming at each other in a public forum every day , mr dodd said what are we going to do about that \? how are you going to solve that \? let s get right to it what are you going to do \? mr donaldson replied we 're doing everything in our power to work with state regulators and that includes all of them unfortunately , we ca n't control what certain state regulators decide they want to say publicly i believe that it s very counterproductive in a brief telephone interview after the hearing , mr spitzer said that he had criticized the recent settlement between putnam and the sec because it was not a deal that i substantively agreed with we are on the same team and working together , he said but the lack of us being on the same page resulted from the fact that we were not consulted prior to the settlement this was not the paradigm of the way things should work photos william h donaldson , left , told a senate panel yesterday that the boards of mutual funds needed more independent directors \( photo by

east rutherford , nj jon barry has an excellent view of the nets , not only of their play but into their collective mind as well for barry is a veteran guard for the detroit pistons , who came into the meadowlands last night to play game 3 of their eastern conference finals series , down two games to none and barry observes the opponent sometimes eyeball to eyeball on the court and sometimes from a few yards away , on the bench we had two doubledigit leads against them going into the fourth quarter at home , he said yesterday morning at a team shootaround , and we were n't able to get it done in each case , the nets stormed back and dramatically took the lead with less than two seconds to go in each case , the pistons had last shots in each case , they could n't convert the worse they play , the worse it is for you , said barry , who did not get into last night s game because the odds are that they 'll do something good down the stretch they have that confidence as a team , they have that focus much of their mentality comes from jason kidd , barry said it s no secret that he s the engine of the team he recalled how kidd , the nets' dazzling point guard , was shooting poorly in game 2 , but you know he s still capable of making the big shot , and at any time he can take over a game which is what he did to us , twice in the nets' 9785 victory last night , kidd did n't wait for the final minutes to assert his nervy and spectacular dominance it was a 2point game with 13 seconds to go in the first quarter when kidd sank a 3point shot for a 2823 lead , sending the pistons to the bench at the break with hangdog expressions he did it again with 25 seconds to go in the second period , taking the ball on a fullcourt drive and scoring , to give the nets a 5746 lead the half ended that way , and the pistons retreated to the locker room with glazed eyes kidd seemed impatient last night to alert the pistons that he was in no mood to give them any more lastminute hopes , as in the first two games he now directed the nets with the confidence and the precision of a toscanini as they won decidedly kidd wound up with game highs of 34 points , 6 assists and 4 steals , and he added a teamhigh 12 rebounds teams , like countries , have a culture , or mentality , that emanates from leadership , from experience , from the harnessed mindset of their citizens the nets , behind kidd , are demonstrating that they have a particular resolve , which is consistent with winning teams in their last four games , the nets beat the celtics in double overtime to sweep the semifinal round series , and then they beat the pistons by two points in each game in detroit 7674 and 8886 but beat them they did and last night s victory was their ninth straight in the playoffs dating from april 29 and their firstround series against the milwaukee bucks a hugely impressive feat , given the intense , hurlyburly world of postseason professional play tayshaun prince also has a good view of the nets , as good as barry s , in fact , for prince is the 6foot9 rookie forward sensation who has moved into the pistons' starting lineup , after not having played coach s decision in a about half the team s games during the season if they 're down by 20 or up by 20 , said prince , who scored just 4 points last night , you see the same team they keep putting pressure on you and you have to go to kidd to see what drives them kidd s not afraid to make mistakes richard hamilton , the pistons' swingman , said about the nets they 're on a mission they came up short last year in the championship , and they 're trying to get back to it the nets are now just one game away from returning to the nba finals , a place they found themselves in a year ago , only to be swept by the lakers the nets seemed to have lost to the lakers before the opening tipoff , intimidated by the shaq and kobe show that will not happen this year this is a more experienced , more confident , more skillful team and they have a leader on the court of unsurpassed ability and stamina and will barry , before the game last night , said that his team , a relatively young team , went into the previous series against philadelphia up two games to none , and we thought we had it made they wiped us out in the third game , he said teams sometimes have a tendency to let down but i do n't see the nets doing that they know how much trouble we 'd be in if we lost tonight and the pistons understood that kidd was not about to let his team forget that either not last night , not in any game that is on the way to the lustedfor finals it has proved to be detroit s most formidable hurdle photo richard jefferson and the pistons' ben wallace the nets took control early in last night s victory \( g paul burnett the new york times \)

dallas , jan 15 timothy goebel , the kinkyhaired quad king , quietly issued a bold proclamation today , hoping to stretch the expanding athletic boundaries of men s figure skating shrugging off a hip injury that kept him off the ice in the fall , goebel announced that he would try to land four quadruple jumps saturday in his long program at the united states figure skating championships here in salt lake city , he became the first to land three quadruple jumps in olympic competition , earning a bronze medal , which he keeps zipped in an olympic backpack under his bed goebel is under equally modest cover this week while he continues to redefine the quadruple standard , he is still not atop the marquee here none of the men are the men are preparing the ice for the women , literally preceding them in the short program thursday and the long program saturday the favorites , goebel , 22 , and michael weiss , 26 , seem to understand that they are still the undercard to the sparkling drama surrounding sarah , sasha and michelle yep , i think so , weiss said with a laugh goebel agreed the fact that we play second fiddle to the ladies' events , it s always been that way , he said i think , really , it s changing , because the men are coming back and doing more stuff , more exciting things , and the basic level of women s skating really has not improved in a long time i really do n't care if they are the showcase , then they are i do n't come into a competition to be the star or anything i come in to do my job that matteroffact approach has been the knock on goebel since he first landed three quadruple jumps at skate america in 1999 he has been seeking an equilibrium between physicality and artistry ever since weiss , seventh in the olympics , emphasized the importance that judges place on balance while sidestepping the quadruple gauntlet goebel had thrown down in a news conference 15 minutes earlier that s one more than he s done in the past , so he s trying to push the sport technically , weiss said it s really based on the whole package , but the quads have to be there now everybody continues to push the bar i'm trying the quad lutz again , and doing quad toe , triple toe in weiss s long program , his quadruple lutz is his first jump , coming about 20 seconds into the program he has landed only a handful of clean quadruple jumps in major competition before he twofooted two quads but skated strongly to win the lalique cup in november quads have become routine for goebel don laws , weiss s new coach , who was scott hamilton s coach in 1984 , understands that the quadruple is becoming increasingly important it s inside of his bones , that s all it s not yet in his muscle memory , laws said of weiss , who edged goebel for the national title in 2000 the defending national champion , todd eldridge , 31 , declined to attend these championships , citing a dispute over money with the united states figure skating association goebel , the 2001 national champion , surpassed both eldridge and weiss at the olympics , becoming the first american man to win a figureskating olympic medal since 1992 he skated his long program to an american in paris , which he is reprising for these championships because a pulled muscle and tendinitis in his hip hindered his preparation for a new program but there is one notable change goebel has replaced his second triple axel with a quadruple toe loop he plans two quadruple salchows and quad toe loops , an indication that he is physically ready i just want to do something different , goebel said it gets stale to do the same elements in every program men s skating in the united states does not need that conception , especially in competition with the flashy leaders from russia , aleksei yagudin and yevgeny plushenko dick button , the abc analyst and dean of figure skating , was optimistic that american men s figure skaters are coming close to achieving that allaround success and is firm about what they need to do you have to have the presence on the ice , which comes after quadruple jumps , he said you have to be able to stand in this world and pull yourself up out of the crowd you have to have those quadruple jumps that sing that s why timothy goebel is up there now he needs to land in style figure eights tiffany scott and philip dulebohn , second in the nationals the last three years , have an early lead going into friday s long program in the pairs stephanie kalesavich and aaron parchem are in second place tanith belbin and benjamin agosto won the original dance in an upset photo denis petukov and melissa gregory in ice dancing last night they are in third place after two events \( reuters \)
a tsunami in a tea bowl that was japan in the late 16th century , a time when people were thinking extra big and ultra small the tempests of social and political change were very real so were the tea bowls funky , wildstyle , fanatically valued little things in a world gone suddenly , thrillingly askew during the brief momoyama era \( 15731615 \) , warlords torched cities and arranged flowers emperors and nouveau riche tradesmen rubbed shoulders dangerous young men of high ambition and thwarted dreams prowled the streets doors were flung open to the west , admitting a flood of bibles , guns and gold as for art , what was low became high what was ugly became beautiful what was new became everything modern japan was born these topsyturvy conditions are the background to turning point oribe and the arts of 16thcentury japan at the metropolitan museum of art , a carefully shaped and focused show of modestsized objects and cumulative weight agitation is not played out overtly here in japanese art , it seldom is but it is there under the surface of decorative ceramics , paintings and textiles , fluttering like an arterial pulse indeed , as is the case in most elite cultures , blood was an essential ingredient of momoyama art the most violent figures in a violent time were art s most avid patrons the first of the era s two ruling warlords , oda nobunaga , thought nothing of wiping out at a stroke 20 , 000 devotees of a resistant buddhist sect his successor , toyotomi hideyoshi , nearly destroyed korea in his monomaniacal attempt to conquer china the words on nobunaga s official seal say it all rule the empire by force equally overreaching in political power , these two men were also alike in their aesthetic taste , which revolved around an intimate social event , the ritualistic serving of tea the custom , imported from china , had a long history in japan but in the momoyama , it became an epochchanging fashion , a choreographed , almost sacramental art overseen by specialists the most famous of these was sen no rikyu \( 15221591 \) , who served as tea master to hideyoshi and is credited with perfecting the tea ceremony style described by the word wabi , or simplicity whether in response to the era s shaky economy or to the dematerializing ethos of zen buddhism , he moved tea drinking from the courtly parlor to the rustic garden hut he exchanged fine chinese porcelains for handmolded japanese ceramics , the models being those of the potter raku chojiro rikyu turned the preparation and savoring of tea into an exacting but egalitarian performance that , theoretically , anyone , of any class , could master the strippeddown visual style that resulted is still the one westerners tend to think of as quintessentially japanese but the met show , organized with the museum of fine arts in gifu prefecture in japan , proposes a somewhat different view it suggests that the story of momoyama art only begins with rikyu , and that the period s most revolutionary trends emanated from another , younger tea master , furuta oribe \( 1543 441615 \) oribe \( pronounced ohreebeh \) studied under rikyu when both men worked for nobunaga and after rikyu s death he committed ritual suicide on orders from hideyoshi , for reasons still mysterious his prot g succeeded him oribe both preserved and altered the wabi style , creating a mannerist version of its classicism under his aegis , plain ceramics were jazzed up with all kinds of surreal , mad hatter twists foursquare tea bowls were squashed and stretched cracked pots that in another day might have been kiln rejects were cherished monochrome was replaced by a palette of rich greens and yellows the exhibition neatly catches the futuristic zaniness of the oribe look right at the start the entrance to the japanese galleries has been lined with silvery bamboo screening that transforms it into the anteroom of a spaceship at its far end sits a single magnetic object , a ceramic jar meant to hold water for tea shaped as a sagging stack of bulges and coils , blushy red and mossy green , it is at once organic and unearthly and embodies a novel concept of beauty for a traditionflouting time those traditions are succinctly illustrated in displays nearby one offers a selection of antique chinese porcelains favored for tea drinking before the momoyama the other has examples of raku ware , including a hefty pitchblack bucket of a tea bowl said to have been owned by rikyu himself with the chinese link established , the show moves on to document the first contact between japan and the west this was a moment of intense culture shock for many japanese , who had never seen anyone but other asians as depicted on a folding screen by kano naizen \( 15701616 \) , visiting portuguese merchants are truly otherworldly , buffoonish in their flaring pantaloons and unnaturally tall , like clowns on stilts they received a fascinated welcome hideyoshi gave personal tours of his castles to a group of proselytizing jesuits japanese artisans whipped up christian liturgical items from lacquerware inlaid with motherofpearl to send to europe such work stood at a far remove from traditional japanese art at the same time , it had a certain consonance with the chargedup domestic styles developing under oribe
senior executives at global crossing began efforts to disguise the company s financial difficulties months earlier than previously disclosed , giving them more time to sell their shares , according to a securities lawsuit filed this week the lawsuit , which consolidates several classaction complaints on behalf of investors who lost billions of dollars on global crossing stock and bonds , names as defendants more than 20 executives and directors , including gary winnick , who resigned as global crossing s chairman last month the suit was filed in federal district court in manhattan the claims go beyond previous disclosures of the frenzied atmosphere at global crossing before its financial collapse early last year , and they set the stage for a legal battle expected to take years the suit also names as defendants several investment banks including salomon smith barney , part of citigroup that raised money for global crossing and recommended its securities to their clients john c coffee jr , an expert in securities law and a professor at columbia university law school , said damages in the case could reach into the billions of dollars , potentially raising the bar for awards in corporate securities fraud complaints defendants disputed the claims yesterday terry christensen , a lawyer for mr winnick , said , all that has happened is that pursuant to an order of the court , the various allegations in 70 different complaints have been consolidated into a single complaint mary ellen hillery , a spokeswoman for salomon smith barney , said , we are familiar with the allegations and believe them to be without merit lawyers at debevoise plimpton are representing other defendants they were not available for comment according to dozens of former employees interviewed by the lawyers who filed the lawsuit , global crossing , which spent an estimated 15 billion to build an international fiber optic network , came under financial pressure in early 2000 because it had lost numerous customers it soon became dependent on swaps of nearly useless communications capacity , those employees say global crossing was a creation that was established to mislead its own investors , said jay w eisenhofer of grant eisenhofer , the law firm representing the lead plaintiffs in securities fraud complaints against global crossing if global crossing was , as the lawsuit contends , frantically trying to save its business in mid2000 , that would suggest that the wider crisis in the telecommunications industry caused by an oversupply of fiber optic capacity became more severe earlier than commonly acknowledged some information in the complaint has already been made public , like a memorandum written on june 5 , 2000 , by leo j hindery jr , who was global crossing s chief executive at the time , to a handful of directors in it , he said , the stock market can be fooled , but not forever , and it is fundamentally insightful and always unforgiving of being misled by the fall of 2000 , according to the lawsuit , global crossing was regularly using swap transactions , which had little purpose other than to increase revenue at the end of each financial quarter mr eisenhofer said global crossing s executives acknowledged the swap transactions after the bankruptcy filing when the company filed a document to adjust revenue for 2000 by more than 230 million the lawsuit describes a deal with lucent technologies in early 2000 in which lucent , a communications equipment company , wired money for a deal to global crossing s beverly hills , calif , office instead of its bermuda headquarters according to deborah maust , a former employee of global crossing s treasury department who was interviewed by lawyers putting the lawsuit together , she and her colleagues became suspicious because lucent had wired global crossing the exact amount of money that the global crossing office in beverly hills office had wired to lucent earlier the same day a lucent spokeswoman , mary lou ambrus , said the transactions had involved real and separate contracts for different amounts related to network equipment and telecommunications services these were not swaps , she said according to the lawsuit , several employees , including susan dullabh , global crossing s treasurer in beverly hills , questioned dan j cohrs , the chief financial officer , about the lucent deal and were told by mr cohrs that it was none of their business mr cohrs and joseph perrone , global crossing s executive vice president for finance , are among the executives named as defendants in the complaint who are still with the company a spokeswoman for global crossing , tisha kresler , said yesterday that the company would not comment on the complaint because it involved continuing litigation among the other claims in the lawsuit is that mr winnick made more than 860 million from selling the company s stock , or at least 100 million more than previously disclosed a spokeswoman for mr winnick , marcia horowitz , declined to comment the complaint is one of several challenges faced by global crossing as it seeks to reestablish itself as a viable concern two asian communications companies have agreed to buy global crossing out of bankruptcy but have not completed the acquisition global crossing is also dealing with an investigation by the securities and exchange commission and a difficult market for the sale of communications services photos leo j hindery jr wrote a memorandum warning some global crossing directors on june 5 , 2000 \( monika graff \)

any doubts regarding the fierceness of women s freestyle wrestling could have been immediately silenced yesterday with one look at tina george s right wrist , which had just served as a snack for elvira rasulovamursalova of kyrgyzstan but george , a fivetime united states champion , was dealing nicely with the indignity of being bitten apparently , there s no crying in women s wrestling at first , i thought it was an accident , george said sometimes that happens but when i realized she was trying to chew my arm off , i got mad the best revenge was not retaliation , but a clearcut victory george , already well ahead in the match at the time rasulovamursalova pretended to be mike tyson , finished off her carnivorous opponent to earn a 102 decision in round 3 of the world championships of freestyle wrestling at madison square garden a little extra motivation never hurts , but it s doubtful george needed it like all the members of a dominant united states women s team , she has been just too tough for her opponents throughout this competition , whether they have wrestled by the rules or not through the first two days of the threeday event , the united states women s team is 220 , and all seven members will compete in today s semifinals in the day session the championships will follow in an evening session george defeated mabel fonseca of puerto rico , 73 , in last night s evening session the united states men s team will have two participants in the semifinals , cael sanderson and kerry mccoy we talked about taking it one match at a time and performing , the united states women s coach , terry steiner , said if we do that , we feel we have a legitimate shot of medaling in every weight to medal at every weight , you have to perform , and we 've been doing that so far george , a private in the army and the 2002 army female athlete of the year , is one of the brighter stars of the american wrestling program , which has made admirable strides in a few short years the first recognized women s wrestling championship took place in 1987 , and two years later , the united states sent its first women s team to a world championships , with the members having to pay their way the sport has been gaining momentum ever since , with 20 women training under steiner s watch at a facility in colorado springs the sport s biggest break came in 2001 , when it was announced that women s wrestling would be part of the 2004 olympics for athletes like george , the growth of the sport has meant a welcome change of lifestyles no longer are they competing in obscurity or having to take odd jobs to scrape by kristie marano , who is single and has a 5yearold daughter , had supported herself by working as a waitress at a friendly s restaurant in colonie , ny i waitressed and did all the other stuff after work , she said i made it work with more experience and better training opportunities , the women s team appears to be improving with each competition sara mcmann was an 110 winner over kristine odrina of latvia in the day session afterward , she was beaming , aware that she is on the cusp of becoming one of the best in the world in her weight class and perhaps good enough to earn an olympic medal my confidence has been raised a lot , said mcmann , who wrestled on the men s team at loch haven university in pennsylvania i 've gone and i 've wrestled all these girls and i know their styles i 've practiced against some really outstanding wrestlers at our training center though none of the american women s wrestlers were taking their success at this competition for granted , most were eagerly awaiting the olympics an olympic gold medal would make anyone forget about those days when she was serving malts at friendly s there used to be maybe four or fives girls at a tournament it s nice for people to see how far we 've come , marano said we 're not just out there goofing around

scarsdale , ny , june 2 climbing into the plush seats of a white stretch limousine , often with a secret stash of alcohol in the trunk , has long been part of the prom night experience here in this wealthy suburb but not this year on prom night , june 12 , scarsdale high school seniors in slinky strapless gowns and uncomfortable bow ties and cummerbunds will have to be dropped off at school by their parents , attend a preprom party organized by the pta and then climb aboard buses along with faculty chaperons these new restrictions are part of a broader effort at scarsdale high school to control the binge drinking that some say is rampant in the suburbs and has led to death and injury , as well as embarrassing excess at schools throughout westchester county in the academic year just drawing to a close we have an extraordinary interest , in this year above all others , in making sure kids are safe , said the school s principal , john klemme i need to be able to say at the end of the day that i did everything to keep this event as clean as it can be limousines were also banned for the first time this spring in rye and valhalla , which like scarsdale had serious alcoholrelated problems at schoolsponsored events this school year educators agree that excessive drinking plagues many affluent suburbs , on long island , in new jersey and across the nation over the years , some have turned to mandatory busing and other promrelated restrictions but experts say that they have never seen such a flurry of change as that unfolding in westchester schools in scarsdale , rye , valhalla and other westchester towns also tweaked prom night rituals in other ways , like holding preprom parties on school grounds to discourage drunken house parties , and requiring each student to be dropped off and picked up at school by a parent none of the schools can stop the teenagers from hiring limousines for allnight partying after the prom but at least under these rules , a 17yearold girl who has been starving herself for days to fit into a skintight dress cannot start drinking at dusk and continue until morning in scarsdale , the new restrictions followed a homecoming dance in september at which scores of students arrived intoxicated , 5 were hospitalized with acute alcohol poisoning and 27 were suspended still , the seniors have been seething for months , since a letter went home in february from the principal , mr klemme , and the pta president , michelle lichtenberg , upending their prom plans without any of the student feedback that is customarily a part of decisionmaking here all but a few members of the class signed a petition excoriating the administration for ruining this most festive of nights the controversy dominated the school newspaper , with one oped piece complaining that we are being treated as seventh graders on the way to a bat mitzvah several students said they would prefer breath analysis tests when they arrived at the glen island harbor club in new rochelle to losing the right to ride with their friends from preprom to postprom parties there was talk of a protest rally and a counterprom instead the seniors called a meeting , closed to school officials , to vent their anger and draft a list of demands but mr klemme held firm , at least on the exclusion of limousines from school property and the mandatory buses that is a fait accompli , he said rye high school was motivated to change its rules because of heavy drinking at last year s junior prom five parents were called to pick up their drunken children one girl wound up in the hospital having her stomach pumped the principal , jim rooney , responded unequivocally , holding an assembly on the following monday morning and telling students that there would be no future proms unless they could collectively come up with a strategy that would insure everyone arrived sober and left sober putting the students in charge at the outset seemed to make the process in rye less contentious than it was in scarsdale for us to take the reins gave us adult responsibility , said pamela jordan , the senior class president grace buckley , the vice president agreed it was hard to get everyone to understand what had to happen , she said but it was rewarding to get to fix our own mistakes the process did not begin until the fall to give students a chance to calm down and stop insisting that a majority should not be punished for what a minority had done first , the student leaders researched mandatory buses and preprom parties at other schools they presided over many fractious assemblies , tinkering with details students would get to choose which teachers rode the buses as chaperons friends could sign up together and be guaranteed seats on the same bus the school , not the students , would pay for the buses the student officers , told to win a consensus , succeeded the vote to present the prom plan to the board of education was nearly unanimous valhalla , too , took stern action in response to events at the combined juniorsenior prom in 2002 , when one young girl was found to be intoxicated before the start of the dance and all the limousines were searched alcohol was found in so many hired cars that more than threequarters of the students were sent home the superintendent , tom kelly , set strict rules for 2003
fertility clinics in the united states have accumulated some 400 , 000 frozen human embryos , about twice the number estimated , since 1986 when the in vitro fertilization procedure began , the first official inventory has found the calculation is likely to influence the debate over human embryonic stem cells , which are derived from surplus embryos the survey , published today , was conducted by the clinics' association , the society for assisted reproductive technology there are two reasons for the large number of stored embryos , experts say because of the expense and inconvenience of extracting an egg for in vitro fertilization , couples prefer to extract a large number of eggs at once so that others will be on hand if the first implantation fails in about 25 percent of cases , surplus embryos remain and are stored in freezers , said dr david hoffman , a past president of the society and a coauthor of the survey , the results of which were reported yesterday in the washington post both the couples and the clinics are reluctant to destroy these frozen embryos , and as a result , according to the clinics that responded to the survey , 396 , 526 embryos have now accumulated in their freezers dr hoffman said that as many as 20 , 000 might be held by clinics that did not respond the survey compared the number of frozen embryos in the united states with those of britain , at 52 , 000 , and australia , with 71 , 000 in britain , where fertility clinics are closely regulated by a government agency , the human fertility and embryology authority , couples may have their surplus embryos preserved for five years , with a single fiveyear extension if they request it the reason for the limit , said ann furedi , a spokeswoman for the authority , was to ensure that children were born into families of reasonably normal childbearing ages despite this limit , the embryo stockpile in britain continues to grow because more people are trying in vitro fertilization , ms furedi said the stockpile in the united states may be growing even faster because there is no limit on storage time for embryos further expansion seems likely given that few to none are being destroyed and more are being created all the time , said a coauthor of the survey , dr gail l zellman of rand , a research group in santa monica , calif couples undergoing infertility treatment donate oocytes and sperm that are mixed to create fertilized eggs , which then develop in the laboratory into preimplantation embryos the parents are asked to choose among several options for any surplus embryos the survey found that 87 percent of the stored embryos were being held for possible future use by parents , 3 percent were earmarked for research and 2 percent for destruction it is unclear how many parents may be designating the embryos for future use simply in preference to the other options , such as research or destruction , rather than because they actually intend to have the embryos implanted what we are seeing is that there is reluctance by parents to do anything other than hold them , dr zellman said if some or many of the surplus embryos are eventually destroyed , ethicists say , there is an ethical cost to be set against the benefit of in vitro fertility treatments about 100 , 000 children have now been born in the united states through these procedures the embryos at issue are at very early stages of development ranging from the zygote , the single cell of the fertilized egg , to the blastocyst , a sphere of cells several days old that has not yet implanted in the womb dr alta charo , an ethicist at the university of wisconsin , said that clinics could favor either the woman s interest or the embryo s interest it is in the woman s interest to create multiple embryos in a single procedure it is in the embryo s interest to retrieve one egg at a time , and to fertilize and implant until a pregnancy results , thus creating no surplus embryos the fertility clinics were at one time accused of being unethical for creating surplus embryos but that argument dropped away because it was n't persuasive to enough people , dr charo said but dr john haas , president of the national catholic bioethics center in boston , said that the excess embryos made in vitro fertilization an inappropriate means of overcoming human infertility and that the vatican pronouncement of 1987 entitled donum vitae had judged in vitro fertilization to be beneath the dignity of the human person dr haas praised a german law that required all embryos created in vitro to be implanted we do n't think any good can ultimately be accomplished at the expense of a human life , he said , referring to that of the surplus embryos human embryonic stem cells , a subject of intense research interest as a possible way of repairing diseased tissues , are derived from the surplus blastocysts generated in fertility clinics some scientists would prefer to generate embryos of known pedigree for research purposes , rather than rely on those of infertile couples but the creation of embryos for research purposes , though allowed in britain , has not been sanctioned in the united states and is vigorously opposed by opponents of abortion
when managers at fidelity investments and the vanguard group fill out their proxies for dell computer s annual meeting later this month , the ballot will no longer be secret dell s meeting on july 18 is likely to be as routine as most shareholder gatherings but it will be one of the first held by a big american company since the rules on proxy disclosures by mutual funds changed last tuesday until then , fund managers did not have to divulge how they voted on proposals put before shareholders but under rules adopted in january by the securities and exchange commission and resisted by the industry fund companies must disclose annually all their proxy votes for the previous 12 months that requirement is just one of the new demands that regulators and legislators have made on fund companies that could prompt them to become more involved in shareholder democracy the weakest link in the corporate governance movement is still the professional money manager , as well as the professional security analyst , said john j mccabe , chief investment strategist at shay assets management in new york the sec is considering making it easier for shareholders to nominate candidates for seats on corporate boards , a move that could increase pressure on fund companies to choose their own candidates or throw their weight behind others a bill introduced in congress by representative richard h baker , republican of louisiana and the chairman of the house financial services subcommittee on capital markets , would tighten the definitions of independent fund directors and require that one of them lead each fund s board critics of mutual funds said they hoped such changes would embolden fund managers to speak out about governance at the companies in which they invest an increase in activism among fund managers , who control about 19 percent of the stock in american companies on behalf of almost 100 million individual investors , would be a significant switch during the tumultuous proxy season this year , while labor unions and some pension fund managers publicly opposed management at several companies , mutual fund companies remained largely silent how companies are managed is not a primary concern of money managers or their clients during bull markets , said mr mccabe , who is a comanager of two stock funds and a past president of the new york society of security analysts the subject comes into vogue only after the booms go bust , he said that presents a challenge to shareholder advocates seeking to rally opposition to management institutional shareholder services , a research company in rockville , md , that advises fund managers on proxy voting , has taken public stands on several contentious issues this year now iss wants shareholders to have more power in nominating corporate directors iss has proposed that an investor who has held a significant stake in a company for at least a year should be allowed to nominate one or more directors the power to place names on the ballot now rests in the hands of a board s nominating committee the size of a qualifying stake should depend on the size of a company , starting as low as 3 percent at the largest corporations , said james e heard , the chief executive of iss until shareholders gain easier access to the corporate ballot , mr heard said , their only real alternative is to take the allornothing approach of voting for the board s nominees or withholding their votes there s nobody else to vote for of more than 600 letters to the sec commenting on shareholder nominations , some are from corporations and trade groups that oppose the idea even the investment company institute , the mutual fund industry association , is against it no large fund company has supported it the managers of pension funds at the aflcio have been outspoken this year about executive pay and other issues at a variety of companies , including tyco international , sprint and the el paso corporation now , they are pressuring mutual fund managers to stand up and be counted , too richard l trumka , the secretarytreasurer of the aflcio , the federation of labor unions , sent a letter last week to executives at the 50 largest fund companies , urging them to reveal how they voted in the proxy season that is now winding down , even though they are not required to do so restoring mutual fund investor confidence is far too vital to our stillfragile capital markets to wait until next year to begin disclosure , said the letter signed by mr trumka many of the votes at annual meetings this year represented key tests of the fund industry s commitment to meaningful governance reform , making them too important to go undisclosed to mutual fund shareholders , mr trumka wrote he added that fund investors are entitled to know whether or not their fund managers are using their share voting power to rein in runaway executive pay , end conflicted auditor relationships and hold corporate boards accountable for poor performance among the votes the aflcio would like to see are those at el paso , where an attempt to unseat the directors went down to the wire the aflcio supported a slate of dissidents who received 475 percent of the votes , but the mutual funds with the biggest stakes in the company did not declare their allegiances how they voted may never be known because the vote occurred a few weeks before the rule change went into effect none of the fund companies responded immediately to mr trumka s request , but matthew p fink , president of the investment company institute , bristled at the suggestion under the new rule , mutual funds will be the only category of investors required to disclose proxy votes to the public , mr fink said fund companies have been leaders in the push for improvements in corporate governance that gained momentum after scandals at enron and worldcom , he said the fund industry has been out there way before enron and worldcom calling for reforms , he said , citing as examples the institute s calls for shareholder votes on stock option plans and the expensing of stock options by public companies recent mandates about the independence of corporate directors have made their boards look more like those of fund companies , he said much of the recent criticism that fund managers have been apathetic is unfounded , mr fink said fund companies have been voting their proxies and using their influence privately , he said we know from our members that they 're quite active in corporate governance , he said , quite often behind the scenes and quite often through their votes but some critics of fund managers say they will believe that when they see it bill patterson , director of investments for the aflcio , said he suspected that fund managers routinely voted in support of company management in what is known among institutional investors as the wall street walk big fund companies like fidelity , he said , do not want to anger companies that are current or prospective clients for some of their services , like employee retirementplan management that potential conflict of interest , mr patterson said , makes the fundindustry establishment the most significant prop to the imperial ceo having fund managers disclose their votes is the only way that the individual investors can know that these conflicts do n't dominate their thinking , he said photos james e heard is the chief executive of institutional shareholder services , which wants shareholders to have more power in nominating company directors \(

amman , jordan , march 23 on another day of protest here and new images of the war next door , jordan s prime minister , ali abu alragheb , urged a renewed effort today at finding a diplomatic solution to the war in iraq we are witnessing extensive use of force and casualties are increasing tremendously every day , mr ragheb told reporters here tonight all efforts should be exerted again to find a solution to the problems and to minimize the damages that have already been big enough this war can be devastating , he added it will be devastating for iraq and for the neighboring countries and might draw in new players to the game , which can be dangerous also mr ragheb s statements echoed a similar plea issued on saturday by another of iraq s neighbors , saudi arabia , which has also offered support to the american military despite strong internal opposition to the war like turkey to the north , the two nations are worried about more intense opposition to a war that has deeply angered many of their people , as well as wreak economic and political havoc as happened in the persian gulf war in 1991 there have been about 60 protests in jordan since the war in iraq began last week and today the police used water cannons and smoke bombs to quell a large demonstration at the campus of the university of jordan here in amman students threw stones at the police and burned a sheet painted like an american flag as well as an effigy of president bush in an apparent indication of just how sensitive the issue of protest and opposition to the war is here , plainclothes police confiscated the videotapes of the protest taken by cbs and reuters television mr ragheb said confiscating the tapes had been a mistake , and they were later returned while jordan maintains largely friendly relations with iraq , its largest trading partner , it has allowed thousands of american special forces soldiers in the desert on its eastern border with iraq , in a role that has grown more contentious in recent days jordan maintains that their role is to operate patriot antimissile batteries and other roles officials here say are purely defensive but iraqi officials have accused united states forces here of moving into the western desert , amid speculation that jordan s role in establishing a front in northern iraq may grow because turkey has refused to host any american soldiers journalists staying near the border have seen military helicopters , american c130 cargo planes and fighter planes in the area tonight , mr ragheb said none of this indicated that united states forces based in jordan were operating in iraq and he strongly denied the allegation i can confirm that no activities took place from jordan into iraq , he said mr ragheb also announced that five iraqi diplomats had been told to leave jordan , though he also denied that this was at the behest of the united states , which has been urging allies to expel iraqi diplomats this is strictly a jordanian and iraqi issue , he said he declined to say specifically why they were expelled two of the iraqi diplomats , he said , were later permitted to stay
john s reed , the interim chairman of the new york stock exchange , yesterday embraced a report from the board s special committee on governance that calls for reducing the number of directors and choosing a majority of them from outside the securities industry the report did not recommend that the exchange split its regulatory operations from its marketplace role , and mr reed , at a news conference , said it would be a mistake to do so while the report did not directly call for dividing the jobs of chairman and chief executive , it did recommend that if they were not separated , a lead director should be appointed by the board to preside over meetings in place of the chairman richard a grasso , who resigned last month because of the furor over the size of his pay package , held both posts what emerged from his first meeting with the full board was a rough sketch of what mr reed intends to accomplish in the next few months he aims to preside over a overhaul of the exchange s governance practices , as outlined in the report , and , for the time being at least , support a view held widely on the board that the exchange continue as a selfregulated organization but , as the report pointed out , the exchange s regulatory future is likely to be decided by the securities and exchange commission , which has been conducting its own examination of the big board s practices a copy of the report obtained by the new york times listed 27 recommendations covering a variety of issues , including compensation and disclosure it is the fruit of many months of sometimes contentious work by the special committee it was presented yesterday to the full board of the exchange by h carl mccall , the former comptroller of new york state , who resigned from the board last week , and leon s panetta , whose term as director expired in june none of the directors on the special committee would discuss the report yesterday while mr reed said yesterday that the proposals were by no means final , if accepted they could serve as a blueprint for the exchange as it struggles to appease its conflicting constituencies federal regulators , the securities industry , its members and the investing public i think if we simply embrace the proposals , we would make substantial progress and basically solve the problem , mr reed said nevertheless , by stating quite definitively his views on regulation , mr reed stands in opposition to the case made by investors , including pension funds and state comptrollers , who have said that as long as the exchange maintains its regulatory function , conflicts of interest will abound in the current situation they are both the judge and a party to each dispute between brokerdealers and investors , said sarah teslik , the executive director of the council of institutional investors , an investor advocacy group as long as they keep their regulatory authority the other measures are just not that important , she said though the suggestions are not binding and they prompted 90 minutes of robust debate at yesterday s meeting , mr reed s favorable comments suggested that directors were close to decisions on the makeup of the board and its future as a selfregulated organization the proposals most likely to be approved are those about the size of the board , which now has 27 members mr reed has said that size is too unwieldy to be effective the report proposes a reduction to 17 directors , which would be a radical reconstitution of the board six of these directors would be representatives of the securities industry three would represent major wall street firms one would represent specialists , which execute the trades in stocks one would represent lessors , who are members that lease out their seats and are not represented on the board now and one would represent floor brokers , the agents for buyers and sellers twelve seats are now allocated to representatives of the securities industry critics have long said that securities firms , which are regulated by the exchange , are too heavily represented under the proposed changes , 10 of the seats would go to representatives of the public three of those 10 would be chief executives of publicly listed companies four would be from the investing public , and three would be public officials , like former elected officials the final seat would go to the chairman of the exchange that means the exchange management would have one seat instead of the current three the report effectively left to the sec the issue of whether the exchange should remain a selfregulated organization it described the topic as a broader policy issue with significant regulatory implications and said that the big board should be involved as the sec considers the issue it added that the exchange could provide greater transparency of its regulatory operation while the sec has been examining the big board s regulatory function , the commission chairman , william h donaldson , has not made up his mind about its future structure , according to an sec spokeswoman mr mccall has supported splitting off the regulatory arm and said so in the resignation letter that he sent to mr reed last week , suggesting that the board identify and evaluate ways to separate the regulatory and marketplace functions of the exchange in an attempt to defuse criticism of the exchange s management of its regulatory responsibilities , the report called for a new board committee for regulation and enforcement the panel would be led by a nonindustry director and the majority of its members would be nonindustry directors as for the nomination of directors , which is now done by a committee of people who are not on the board , the report said that this function should be handled by a revamped governance committee , which would be made up of nonindustry board members the report also set forth a framework for compensating the big board s top officials but did not specify any figures it advocated that the five most highly paid officials disclose their compensation each year all the factors involved in compensation would also be disclosed , according to the report , including methodology , the evaluation process and what benchmarks were used the compensation committee would be made up of independent directors the report also included several proposals to improve disclosure , including one that would make directors publicize any relationships they have with officers of the exchange the report itself is a relatively short one three typed pages put in written form at a fivehour meeting of the committee on monday and formally presented to mr reed by mr mccall and mr panetta at a dinner that evening conspicuously , the report did not advocate that executives of securities firms be excluded from the board , a proposal put forward by henry m paulson jr , the chief executive of goldman sachs the idea was much discussed on the board , but it now appears moot given the report s suggestion that six people from the securities industry hold board seats photo john s reed , the interim chairman of the new york stock exchange , said at a news conference yesterday that he supported the recommendations of a report on the way the big board should govern itself \( photo by tingli wang the new york times \) \( pg c2 \)

he shouted to two members of his team both in their 60 s and professors by profession , to whom the burden of carrying some of the canvas sacks had fallen the money was loaded into the van , and dr erdmann sprinted off , dodging between cars children playing on the sidewalk cheered in arabic , look , more looters !

concord , nc , may 17 the goo goo dolls and gov mike easley played to the crowd gathered today for nascar s annual allstar race at lowe s motor speedway but when the prerace music and politicianinuniform photo opportunity were over , 150 , 000 fans who withstood windy , cool temperatures saw jimmie johnson survive bumpercar racing to take home a record payoff of just over 1 million in the winston kurt busch was second unlike the weekly races in the nascar winston cup series , the winston is a pure money run with no points awarded drivers compete in a set of races with the field whittled to the top 14 drivers who reach the final 20lap sprint for the money that kind of cash provides a certain singular motivation , with drivers taking unusual gambles and cars taking plenty of knocks last year , busch admitted that he deliberately forced robby gordon s car to spin out late in the race to force a yellow flag that slowed the field and gave busch a chance to catch the leaders the strategy failed ryan newman won the race and last year s winner s share of 750 , 000 this year s race was no less contentious tony stewart , the defending winston cup points champion , won the 40lap first leg of the winston , when the field was cut from 24 cars to 20 but stewart never made it to the final his was among eight cars that crashed in the 30lap second leg won by busch none other than jeff gordon , a threetime winner of the winston , put sterling marlin and ward burton into spins in that second section marlin stayed in the race burton did not and later in that leg , newman crashed into the wall after bumping mark martin that sent newman out of the race before the final sprint newman was so miffed , he walked down the track waiting for the drivers to come around so he could approach stewart , who newman thought bumped him stewart was not to blame for that wreck , but he was gone shortly after that anyway in the final laps of the second leg , with the racecars in a pack , stewart hit terry labonte s car , creating a chain reaction that knocked six cars out , including those of labonte , stewart , dale earnhardt jr , martin , dale jarrett and bill elliott elliott broke three bones in his left foot in the crash it s part of being in the winston , stewart said of the pileup that s what makes it exciting for everybody' by the final 20lap sprint , only 12 of the

it all started eight years ago when henry hershkowitz wanted to lure new yorkers to the screening room , his new theater and cafe at 54 varick street at canal street what better companion for his sunday brunch , he decided , than a classic film about his city in which the word breakfast figured prominently \? and so began a theater tradition of showing blake edwards s 1961 film , breakfast at tiffany s , at 1 30 pm sundays in an interview the other day , mr hershkowitz said he briefly tried other classic films like singing in the rain in the same slot , but none sold as well as the story of a carefree glamour girl , played by audrey hepburn , who flits around new york surrounded by adoring men these days , the theater is on its second print of the film , and seats are often filled with holly golightly types sporting white gloves and carrying little blue boxes from tiffany s proposals and bridal showers are common at brunch , and extra showings are added on holidays like mother s day if mr hershkowitz had merely wanted a new yorkcentered film for sunday afternoons , he said he could have chosen from dozens of candidates but breakfast at tiffany s is one of his favorites because it is so romantic evidently , new yorkers agree one guy used to think it was so cool , he 'd bring different dates here to impress them , mr hershkowitz said but we have n't seen him in awhile , so he must have gotten married susan wrubel , a 34yearold film consultant who lives in the flatiron district , stops by the theater every other month to eat brunch and see the film she started seeing the film eight years ago with her mother , a big audrey hepburn fan who remembers what it was like to be a young woman here in the early 60 s ms wrubel also began attended showings with friends on sundays when the hbo hit sex and the city was in reruns for her , the film and the theater are linked in a single city tradition at first , it was my novelty , but now , it s become my good old standby for a sunday afternoon , she said besides , i still love the era and style of the movie it reminds my mom of a happy time in her life , and so it s crystallized for me , too kelly crow photo audrey hepburn with george peppard in breakfast at tiffany s , perhaps the ultimate new york starter film \( paramount pictures \)
urban cowboy , which closed last sunday after 26 previews and 60 performances at the broadhurst theater , garnered some of the worst reviews of the broadway musical season not the disastercult euphoria that greeted dance of the vampires , but something more along the lines of how dare they bring this tripe to new york \? based on the 1980 john travoltadebra winger movie \( and the original esquire article by aaron latham \) , the musical s book , about a hick ranch hand finding love at a singles bar near houston , was by mr latham and phillip oesterman the score consisted of country standards \( some from the film \) , as well as newly commissioned songs in a similar vein the musical was n't my cup of texas tea , but i was fascinated by the anger it aroused and by the dogged determination of its lead producer , chase mishkin , to keep it limping along also by the plight of talented people , like the show s director , lonny price , getting trapped in a failure urban cowboy was n't his first flop at 22 , he starred in merrily we roll along , which ran for 16 performances in 1981 , but is considered one of stephen sondheim s greatest scores so go figure a class act , which mr price directed , cowrote and starred in \( and which ms mishkin coproduced \) , ran only three months on broadway in 2001 , but has had a promising afterlife even urban cowboy may yet turn a profit a road tour has been announced for 2004 on the musical s final weekend , i spoke to mr price , now 44 , at his apartment on the upper west side while letting go of urban cowboy , he was in the midst of directing a revival of athol fugard s 'master harold' and the boys , a play he was in on broadway in 1982 \( the production opens at the royale theater next sunday \) our conversation began when i asked mr price how he got involved in urban cowboy jesse green lonny price chase invited me to see the workshop that phil oesterman directed a year ago february just as a friend i did n't think it was overly successful i did n't quite know what it was going for jesse green for instance \? price there was a chorus who came on and danced and then left they never sang and never spoke the music was n't being used well the songs were mostly decorative , or commenting on the action , not incorporated in terms of storytelling i thought a couple of the leads were perhaps miscast but chase is a believer she falls in love with something and sees possibilities i frankly did n't see many possibilities but she clearly wanted to pursue it anyway green and that was the extent of your involvement until price phil oesterman died last summer , when i returned from doing a class act in japan , there was a message from chase saying phil was dead and she wanted me to direct the show i turned it down but i said chase , here s what i will do i 'll meet with aaron and see if i can help with the script green how did that change your mind \? price i began to think it might be interesting to take on something i'm not in love with it would be like being a mechanic you pick up the hood and say , hmm , well , the gasket needs this the question is , how do you make this car run better \? , not , how do i build my fantasy car \? i did n't have a natural affinity for the material , so none of it was sacrosanct to me green you put in a lot of new songs , and they did work better than the old ones what about improving the plot \? price the plot was a given you had to assume that people were coming to see urban cowboy it was n't my job to say that the story does n't make a good musical green was there a sense of panic about fixing something bad \? price it just felt like we were doing our work every day remember , we were doing this for florida , not 44th street chase had hopes of bringing it in to broadway , but we did n't have a theater booked green ok , so you went to florida , opened at the coconut grove playhouse price yes , and they loved it ! we never had a performance without a standing ovation green what do you think they were responding to \? price they liked people in cowboy hats , watching people twostep they liked that world , they wanted to be in it for two hours green but florida is n't new york you were n't worried about the difference \? price did i expect it to get a good critical response in new york \? no but many shows do n't and do fine thoroughly modern millie got bad reviews but won a tony and ran green is that a bit cynical \? price no realistic is this follies \? no was it intended to be sweeney todd \? no you want me to say it s bad , and i ca n't say that people liked it there s a distinction to be made between what s good and what s successful all the shows i grew up loving pacific overtures , for instance they were not successes they probably would n't even get produced today ! green you 're saying you were n't aiming to make the show good , just successful \? price the show was n't written for me the idea was that it would be mamma mia ! with a cowboy hat it was written for a middleoftheroad , middleclass audience the material could n't be anything else you could n't try to make it caviar it s about poor white trash i do n't mean that in a derogatory way but you 're not trying to make art you 're making an entertainment green so the hostility during previews in new york must have come as quite a shock
from the start , the arraignment yesterday was anything but routine there was a gotti in the courtroom there were wisecracks and there was a delicate matter that a judge would take up only behind closed doors the gotti was peter gotti , who prosecutors say is the acting boss of the gambino crime family mr gotti , his hands cuffed before him , was led into courtroom 17b of federal district court in manhattan with five other men , all of whom were charged in a broad racketeering conspiracy mr gotti was convicted in march in another racketeering case , in brooklyn on monday , federal prosecutors in manhattan filed new charges against him i'm trying to find out what i'm doing here , he said to one person , adding remember the name gotti \? they always invite us to things like this the charges in manhattan include allegations that he participated in a conspiracy to murder salvatore gravano , the mafia turncoat known as sammy the bull , who helped the government convict mr gotti s brother , the deceased gambino leader john j gotti yesterday in court , peter gotti seemed relaxed , cracking more jokes they invited me to the party , he said to someone else i did n't ask to be invited in the hearing , mr gotti and the five other men all entered pleas of not guilty before the judge , richard conway casey but much of the hearing was taken up with another matter that dealt with one defense lawyer s ability to visit her client in jail after officials there contended she was involved , possibly romantically , with another jailed defendant in the case the judge said that at the request of the defense , he would close the courtroom before addressing the lawyer s visitation issue a prosecutor , michael g mcgovern , rose , and objected to closing the proceeding this reporter , speaking on behalf of other members of the news media , also objected the judge refused to reverse his ruling , and the marshals cleared the courtroom afterward , lawyers and prosecutors would not discuss what went on in the sealed proceeding but the visitation issue stems from a broader dispute that has not been a big secret indeed , the new york post , which first reported on the matter , declared in a recent frontpage headline la cozy nostra public court records offer more details on july 24 , the united states attorney s office wrote to judge casey to advise him of a possible conflict of interest by the lawyer , jean marie graziano prosecutors said staff members in the jail , the metropolitan correctional center , accused ms graziano , a lawyer representing the defendant edward garafola , of acting in an unprofessional manner with another defendant , frank fappiano ms graziano was seen holding hands and interacting intimately with mr fappiano during a legal visit , prosecutors wrote prosecutors said evidence confirmed that ms graziano had a personal , apparently romantic , relationship with mr fappiano her conduct was seen as unbecoming of an attorney and disruptive to the orderly running of the jail , the prosecutors said , and her visiting privileges were temporarily suspended prosecutors noted that ms graziano had admitted to having a personal relationship with mr fappiano and his family , but denied disrupting the orderly running of the jail or acting unprofessionally the government raised a question of a a potential conflict of interest ms graziano s loyalties , for example , may not lie undividedly with her client , prosecutors wrote there has been at least one closed hearing on the matter previously , records show after yesterday s hearing was reopened to the public , mr garafola told the judge that he would waive his right to conflictfree representation it was clear after the hearing that ms graziano will remain as one of his lawyers , suggesting that she will also be able to visit him in jail ms graziano would not discuss the matter with reporters after the hearing michael rosen , her cocounsel for mr garafola , who had asked to close the hearing yesterday , said after court i made a decision as a lawyer that this should not be in the public domain the court agreed it s under seal mr rosen added , to be perfectly blunt , it s none of your business
has the nation s television audience burned out on serious news \? american soldiers are dying in iraq almost daily , questions are continuing to swirl around the bush administration s case for the march invasion and united states marines are poised off the coast of liberia at home , decisions by the supreme court prompted national debates on affirmative action and gay rights , a basketball star stands accused of sexual assault and the california governorship suddenly hangs in the balance and yet , television news viewers are tuning out the total evening news audience on the broadcast networks has been lower this summer than it was during the summer of 2001 , when the pressing stories of the day were shark attacks and chandra a levy cbs evening news has been particularly hard hit in late june , cbs , which is owned by viacom inc , had one of its leastwatched weeks for its nightly news report in at least a decade , and perhaps in its history , according to nielsen media research the audience of abc , which is owned by the walt disney company , is down nearly 600 , 000 from last year among the broadcasters , only nbc , which is a unit of the general electric company , has bucked the tuneout trend this summer the collective cable news audience , meanwhile , is slightly smaller so far this summer than it was this time last year , despite gains for the fox news channel , which is owned by the news corporation people have been through two years of very heavyduty , stressful news , from sept 11 through the war with iraq , said jim murphy , executive producer of the cbs evening news with dan rather i think there s probably just a little bit of a breaktaking going on across the spectrum steve sternberg , senior vice president for audience research at magna global usa in new york , an advertising buying agency , takes a similar view considering how much news there was with the iraq war , he said , people are probably just taking a breath and saying , 'ok , that s enough news for a while' summer tv viewing , of course , is always lighter than other times of year , as people find other things to do and , because tv audience analysis remains an inexact science , with no hard data on what motivates people in their tvwatching decisions , no one can say for certain why news ratings are lower this summer than in recent years but the overall diminished state of the television news ratings has come as a surprise to some executives and advertising executives especially since it comes after impressive audience figures , at least for cable news , during the main military action in iraq back in the spring according to nielsen media research , about 241 million people watched the three evening newscasts each night , on average , in june and july , compared with 252 million during the twomonth period last year and 243 million during june and july 2001 as for cable , cnn s daily audience during june and july was , on average , 413 , 000 people , down from 502 , 000 last summer , according to nielsen media research , and much smaller than its audience of 25 million during the thick of the war the daily average audience for msnbc , which is owned by the microsoft corporation and ge , fell from 254 , 000 last summer to 197 , 000 this one which is down from 13 million during the war and while the average daily audience at fox news grew to 753 , 000 , compared with 612 , 000 during last summer s twomonth period , the audience was nowhere the average of 32 million people who watched fox news each evening during the thick of the iraq fighting some news executives said that many viewers may see this summer as nothing more than the end of the big iraq story that they so eagerly watched in the spring others said this summer s more seriousseeming news events were , in fact , less compelling than those of last summer the disappearance of 14yearold elizabeth smart from her utah home the abduction and killing of 5yearold samantha runnion in california the rescue of nine miners from a pennsylvania coal shaft the fatal shooting of two people at the los angeles international airport and the killing of the gunman by an el al security guard among the top news stories this summer , none of these have the broad appeal and emotional tug that a samantha runnion , elizabeth smart , the miner rescue or the airport shootings had at that time , said jack wakshlag , head of research for the turner broadcasting system , which manages cnn for their parent company , aol time warner inc cnn s highestrated day during june and july last year , for example , was july 27 , when an average audience of about 1 million people tuned in to learn about the rescue of the coal miners , according to mr wakshlag s nielsen media research data this summer , cnn s mostwatched day during the comparable twomonth period was july 22 , when an average audience of about 650 , 000 tuned in for news about the united states military s killing of uday and qusay hussein mr wakshlag said the audience for the miners was probably higher because the nation had been following their plight over the course of several days the successful attack on the hussein brothers , obviously was not a largescale , unfolding , dramatic event , he said it was pretty much straightforward coverage of the fact that they were caught , which is by and large something you learn quickly and you do n't have to stay and watch a whole bunch of stuff all day and get glued to the set though he took heart that cnn s ratings were up from the summer of 2001 , mr wakshlag acknowledged , i'm not sure that national import and national interest always correspond there are two anomalies in the ratings that dispel the theory that perhaps the american public is turning a blind eye to the world the audience increases for nbc nightly news and the fox news channel , the respective leaders of their fields according to andrew tyndall , publisher of the tyndall report , which is a newsletter that tracks the network evening newscasts , nbc has given the heaviest coverage of iraq of the three newscasts in recent weeks fox news channel has not exactly shied away from iraq , either executives at fox news channel and nbc said they concluded that it was better to devote more time where more context can be given to iraq news rather than less if boiled down to mere headlines , they said , that news can seem relentlessly negative and may turn off viewers other networks have come on the air every day and they give you a countdown or countup of the bad things that have happened whether it s military deaths or civilian deaths , said bill shine , the executive producer of fox news channel that is important , and it s news america should know but , there is some progress going on in that country cnn and msnbc dispute that fox news is devoting more time to iraq than they are and competitors of nbc news denied they were being overly negative , saying that if nbc news is covering iraq any more than they are , it is only by a marginal degree i think that reality can get to viewers at times , said mr murphy at cbs but i do n't think our coverage is negative or relentlessly negative we tell people what we have some days it s negative , some days it s not it remains unclear whether the big celebritydriven news narratives of the moment the kobe bryant sexualassault case and arnold schwarzenegger s announced gubernatorial run in california will change the current ratings equation on cable news , fox news channel , cnn and msnbc saw spikes in their average daily audiences on wednesday the day mr bryant had his first court appearance and mr schwarzenegger announced his candidacy but the gains were not huge reliable data on the evening newscasts for last wednesday were unavailable either way , mr murphy said , he did not expect the ratings funk to continue for very long people come to watch the news when they need the news , he said , adding , and they will need it again photos despite a number of serious news events playing out this summer like the war in iraq , above , and the civil war in liberia television news programs have been

los angeles if kevin garnett has not seriously thought about packing his bags and leaving the minnesota timberwolves , he should start thinking about it garnett will not be a free agent until after next season , but if i were in his shoes , i would walk when the time comes west during the allstar game weekend in february , kobe bryant told garnett that he should think about joining the lakers bryant said garnett laughed off the suggestion after a long summer , he 'll have another season in minnesota , where he can do some serious california dreamin' in the aftermath of a demoralizing seriesending loss to the lakers on thursday night , garnett plopped down on a folding chair for a final postgame news conference asked for his immediate thoughts of being bounced again from the playoffs , garnett reacted with the frustration of a great player whose talent was not enough to pull his team to victory the timberwolves have never advanced past the first round of the playoffs this year they finally earned the homecourt advantage , but they also had to face the lakers we did some good things and we got under their skin , but in the end they took it to another level , he said minnesota has tried to take it to another level for seven years in a row garnett may be beginning to realize that the timberwolves cannot reach another level asked if minnesota could take the next step , garnett said i think it s a team of uncertainty we got eight free agents i do n't think kevin mchale knows who s going to be where and what right now it s a team of uncertainty the nba would like to have garnett in minnesota i would like to see him in los angeles for two reasons first , i hate to see talent wasted , and second , i'm tired of former players the michael jordancharles barkley era castigating young players for not knowing how to win , or caring whether they do i would like to see garnett , who will turn 27 later this month , team with bryant , 24 , and extend the lakers' dynasty moving to southern california has worked for a succession of stars wilt chamberlain came here in 1968 after a fabulous career in philadelphia kareem abduljabbar came here in 1975 after winning a championship in milwaukee kobe bryant arrived via a trade with charlotte in 1996 shaquille o'neal arrived as a free agent seven days later phil jackson arrived as head coach in 1999 each player was rewarded with a championship chamberlain won a ring in 1972 abduljabbar won five shaq , kobe and jackson have won three straight there are all sorts of snags that could prevent garnett from wearing purple and gold salary cap restrictions and chemistry considerations , to name two can garnett , shaq and kobe coexist \? a lot better than you would think my model is the lakers team of magic johnson , jabbar and james worthy or the celtics team of larry bird , mchale and robert parish and garnett and bryant are good friends garnett went to the nba straight out of high school in 1995 bryant also went straight from high school to the nba , in 1996 after thursday s loss , a somber garnett said free agency was the last thing on his mind the questions you 're asking are about the summer and i did n't really anticipate answering summer questions today , he said so i have no answers for you garnett knows this much minnesota has been bounced out of the playoffs seven consecutive seasons and the lakers are going for their fourth consecutive championship this is not a team of uncertainty garnett skirted the contract issue but he made it crystal clear that he knew where the lakers' bread was buttered in order for them to go far they got to continue to defer to shaq and just feed off of him , garnett said when he made the statements publicly about getting the ball , they started to let the offense flow through shaq before it was sort of flowing through he and kobe after he made those comments , the offense started going through shaq and his team fed off that garnett smiled after shaq made those comments , everything went through the monster , and it was over , he said garnett s season is over , too the lakers have an even steeper mountain to climb , beginning monday , when they face san antonio in game 1 of the western conference semifinals i see los angeles winning , even though the spurs swept the season series , 40 none of the games were close shaq s in shape now , jackson said thursday night the first two games we played against san antonio he did n't play and the next two games that we played he was there , but i did n't think he was in the kind of condition he needed to be bryant does n't think the san antonio series will be steeper than any of the lakers' previous playoff challenges they 're going to be confident because they beat us , and we 're going to adjust , he said as for garnett , i would offer the same advice i had for shaq in 1996 when he had to choose between los angeles and orlando go west , my brother , go west photo kevin garnett , who was hit in the face thursday , will watch the rest of the playoffs minnesota was eliminated \( getty images \)
kent , england seen from the lofty perspective of its two instigators , the louisiana purchase was a matter either of nation building \( thomas jefferson s view \) or of molding destiny \( napoleon bonaparte s version \) the sheer scale of the enterprise more than doubling the size of the united states and paying for much of napoleon s effort to conquer europe makes either viewpoint almost irresistible but each misses what is most remarkable about the transaction the speed with which it was accomplished and the ease with which the huge territory became american with this week s bicentennial of the treaty s signing in paris , it is useful to see it through the eyes of the actual negotiators to them it was a real estate deal vast in extent , but fundamentally a commercial matter of fixing the price of a property exactly half the credit for the businesslike approach of the two sides should go to the compelling attractions of a french society hostess named ad la de de flahaut her role began in 1785 when the new york diplomat and businessman gouverneur morris went to france to negotiate tobacco deals for an \( unrelated \) associate , robert morris flahaut , whose pet name was ad le , took morris as her lover , a pleasure he shared with the bishop of autun , otherwise known as charlesmaurice de talleyrandp rigord paris gossip speculated salaciously on the curious coincidence of talleyrand s having a clubfoot while morris stumped around on a wooden leg but none of the three cared my friend s countenance , morris wrote of ad le , glows with satisfaction in looking at talleyrand and myself as we sit together agreeing in sentiment supporting the opinions of each other a decade later the jacobin terror forced talleyrand to flee france , and as a refugee in the united states he naturally sought out gouverneur morris , who found him employment with robert morris s real estate company in the years since independence , a frenzy of land speculation had overtaken the young republic governments , state and federal , sold huge swaths of territory to finance their operations breathtaking deals were struck in the infamous yazoo land fraud , 40 million acres were sold by a bribed georgia legislature to a consortium that included a united states supreme court justice , several members of congress and the governor of the tennessee territory speculators like robert morris \( who , naturally , also had a stake in the yazoo deal \) could buy and sell millions of acres a year talleyrand , dispatched to maine by robert morris to spy out new lands for purchase , surveyed the grandeur of the landscape with thoughts that were unmistakably those of a speculator there were forests as old as the world itself , he wrote , large natural meadows , strange and delicate flowers in the face of these immense solitudes we gave vent to our imagination our minds built cities , villages and hamlets when fortune carried him back to france and elevated him to the post of foreign secretary under napoleon , this commercial experience became sharply relevant by 1803 napoleon wanted to raise money for war with britain , and jefferson was prepared to pay for control of france s territory around the mouth of the mississippi in order to guarantee free use of the river the american minister in paris , robert livingston , had already approached the french about such a limited purchase \( livingston , who owned some 130 , 000 acres in upstate new york , was himself very familiar with the american real estate market \) but a critical shift occurred on april 11 , 1803 , when he went to meet talleyrand in his offices in the rue du bac writing james madison that evening , livingston reported that talleyrand had suddenly asked whether we wished to have the whole of louisiana surprised and playing for time , livingston at first denied any interest , but talleyrand persisted , what would you give for the whole \? livingston came back with an opening bid of about 375 million , which talleyrand dismissed as too low but both men knew the game being played talleyrand told livingston to consider the proposition and return with a better price , and as the maneuvering continued over the days ahead , livingston recorded talleyrand s promise to give me a certificate that i was the most importunate negotiator he had yet met with with the participation of james monroe , who arrived in paris the next day as the american envoy extraordinary , and the french treasury minister , fran ois barb marbois , agreement was reached just 18 days later for the sale of france s possessions in north america some 565 million acres for about 15 million , or less than 3 cents an acre in fact , without their knowledge of the booming land market , the american negotiators would have found it hard to accept the french price it exceeded congress s appropriation by 13 million but monroe and livingston were aware that federal land was selling for 2 an acre although no one knew the exact size of louisiana i can give you no guidance , but you have made an excellent deal for yourselves , talleyrand said airily both men could work out that not only would american strategic interests be served by the purchase , there would easily be profit to cover what was paid on april 30 , the treaty terms were formally accepted by both sides looking at the louisiana purchase as a property transaction rather than a work of diplomacy helps to explain another anomaly many americans feared the new land would make the nation too big to govern and , given the prevailing view that government was authority exercised from above over an unruly populace , they had good reason for their fears but louisiana was to witness the development of a new kind of society under spain and france , the province had been a nearfeudal domain , ruled by appointees from europe , with the land sold only to those approved by the governor in the united states , however , land could be owned by whoever could afford it since 1785 , all federal land west of the appalachians had , at jefferson s urging , been measured out in onemilesquare sections for sale as real estate , and this grid of squares now extended into the louisiana purchase for the first time in history , land , the primary source of wealth production , could be owned by anyone speculators , settlers , even squatters power , said john adams , with icecold accuracy , always follows property in the old world property was distributed in a hierarchical manner with the powerful few owning most but as america spread westward , more than one billion acres of public land , including most of the louisiana purchase , would pass into private hands power still followed property , but now it was spread democratically , and the nation it created possessed innate stability , because each propertyowning citizen had a vested interest in a lawabiding society ad la de de flahaut s contribution to history might be worth only a footnote , but it s worth acknowledging , as a reminder of the real value of the louisiana purchase drawing \( nancy stahl \)
washington it was just a few lines of dense legalese in a 3 , 000pageplus spending bill , but the provision was a turning point in a bitter struggle between two of the most powerful business lobbies in the capital real estate and banking the relevant words in section 646 of the treasury portion of the spending bill said none of the funds made available in this act may be used to finalize , implement , administer or enforce \( 1 \) the proposed rule relating to the determination that real estate brokerage is an activity that is financial in nature it meant this banks cannot get into the realestate brokerage business in allowing that 11thhour addon to a 397 billion spending bill , republican congressional leaders handed the nation s real estate brokers an important symbolic victory if perhaps a temporary one in their concerted push to keep banks at bay the story of how this extraneous bit of policy wound up in a longoverdue appropriations measure is a classic example of how washington works and how wellconnected players can have their problems addressed even when the most logical legislative route is cut off the maneuver was the latest episode in a twoyear feud that has made rivals out of bankers and brokers who often work together to close property deals it has also frayed relationships on capitol hill and forced lawmakers to choose between dependable deeppocketed political allies i'm very glad it is over , said representative anne m northup , republican of kentucky , who engineered the provision and earned the deep enmity of the banking industry in the process they are very angry angry in part because real estate sales generated 54 billion in commissions last year , according to an estimate by steve murray , an editor of real trends , an industry newsletter in littleton , colo a move into the real estate brokerage business also would be an efficient way for banks to increase their mortgage lending , as several joint ventures between banks and brokerages have demonstrated because so much is at stake and despite ms northup s exclamation this battle is almost certainly not over , according to many involved under the spending bill , the treasury department and the federal reserve are prohibited through sept 30 from moving ahead with a new regulation that would enable nationally chartered banks to offer real estate sales services the banking lobby says it still intends to seek that power in the future and will fight a pending measure that would permanently bar national banks from the real estate business we feel pretty good about our chances , said edward l yingling , the chief lobbyist for the american bankers association the battle between banks and brokers dates back to the adoption of major changes in financial services law in 1999 at the time , congress freed banks to engage in new kinds of services like selling insurance and financial securities and opened the door to further expansion into areas judged by treasury and the fed to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity seizing the moment , the nation s bankers in mid2000 petitioned under the new law to make the leap into real estate later that year , the clinton administration proposed a rule to allow it the national association of realtors , sensing a major competitive threat , quickly fought back it marshaled hundreds of thousands of its 800 , 000 members across the country to register their objections and reached out to allies on capitol hill this issue is all about who is going to control the real estate transaction , said stephen cook , a spokesman for the association , explaining why thwarting the banks quickly became the no 1 legislative priority of the realtors the brokers argue that the change could lead to a nationwide consolidation in the industry , one that could ultimately cut competition , hurt service and drive up fees to consumers the bankers say that large realty companies are already deep into mortgage financing and that banks need to be able to compete nationwide when half of the states already allow statechartered banks to sell property a measure barring the banks was introduced and attracted significant support , but it stalled in the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over banking those panels traditionally have strong political ties to the industry phil gramm , then chairman of the senate banking committee and an author of the measure that cleared the way for such expansions , was dead set against the restriction , one banking lobbyist said but there was still the appropriations committee , where ms northup served on the subcommittee that allocates money for the treasury department the holder of a bachelor s degree in economics , she was not happy about the bankers' push for new real estate business at the time the financial services overhaul was passed in 1999 , she said , no one was talking about such a big change but as one of the few incumbent house members in a highly competitive district , she was not eager to alienate a dependable ally and potential source of campaign financing when you win every election with 50 percent of the vote , you are not dying to pick a fight with anybody , she said
three small figurines carved of ivory from mammoth tusks have been found in a cave in southwestern germany , providing stronger evidence that human ancestors were already adept at figurative art more than 30 , 000 years ago , an archaeologist is reporting today one of the pieces is the oldest known representation of a bird , which resembles a cormorant or a duck the others appear to be the head of a horse and a figure halfman , halfanimal none is longer than an inch the discoverer , dr nicholas j conard , an archaeologist at the university of t bingen in germany , said the sculptures belong to one of the oldest traditions of figurative art known worldwide , and that they point to the region of the upper danube river as an important center of cultural innovation during the late stone age , also known as the upper paleolithic the discovery , described in today s issue of the journal nature , was made at hohle fels cave , in the swabian mountains southwest of ulm in the report , dr conard said the find complements the collection of more than 20 similar ivory figurines over recent years , all found at swabian sites precise dates for the objects are unknown , he said , but an analysis of related deposits indicates that the artists lived from 30 , 000 to 33 , 000 years ago it was a time when painting on cave walls had also begun to flourish colorful drawings discovered at the grotte chauvet in france have been dated to 32 , 400 years ago although no human skeletal remains have been found in the german caves with the figurines , dr conard said they seemed to have been produced by modern humans , not their relatives , the neanderthals , some of whom still lived in europe the evidence , he added , suggests an early migration of modern humans along the danube corridor into the interior of the continent the advance of anatomically modern humans into europe from their home in africa coincided with the extinction of the neanderthals , about 30 , 000 years ago commenting on the figurines from german caves , dr anthony sinclair , an archaeologist at the university of liverpool in england , said , without question , they are the oldest body of figurative art in the world in a companion journal article , dr sinclair said the figurines appeared to be personal possessions , not 'art' as we know it today they may be material expressions of the shared personal qualities of humans and animals , he said , their surfaces appear to be polished from constant handling some other experts have suggested that they were related to practices of shamanism in any case , dr sinclair wrote , the figurines show that the first modern humans in europe , instead of gradually evolving their artistic skills , as had been thought , were in fact astonishingly precocious artists map of germany highlighting hohle fels cave the prehistoric figurines were found in the hohle fels cave
los angeles , aug 18 at the bigair circus that was this summer s x games , it was spectacularly and painfully clear that the world s top actionsports athletes lack the basic human fear of being far above the earth with no means of support an ecstatic throng of nearly 109 , 000 broke the previous multiday attendance record for the staples center , 100 , 000 , set during the 2000 democratic national convention they and fans at other sites were rewarded with a series of astounding firsts during the motox freestyle competition on saturday at the los angeles coliseum , 19yearold travis pastrana pulled a barrel roll 360degree backflip across town at the staples center , on the biggest skateboard halfpipe in competition history , the 35yearold legend tony hawk won after claiming his first 900degree spin during a vertical skateboard competition on sunday , the daring bicycle motocrosser jamie bestwick earned gold with a spectacular move he called the tailwhip flair and later that evening , an audacious 28yearold motocrosser named brian deegan pulled a jawdropping mulisha twist backflip and barrel roll to win the big air competition in 2003 , the evolution of the x games into a serious , mainstream event continued not only did the event draw hordes of tattooed teens and twentysomethings , but many in the crowd were parents , drawn to the event by young children whose airborne heroes are the new school s traditionalists outside the staples center , two mothers , carrie onorato and michele escutia , towed a crew of five skateboarders through the heat the children , ages 7 to 11 , held bags full of free posters , dvd s and sports drinks , and said they idolized ryan nyquist and hawk the mothers said they were surprised at how familyfriendly the event was , and were overwhelmed at the graciousness of the athletes , who they said were everywhere signing autographs we are big tony hawk fans at my house , said onorato , whose 7yearold son , augie , plasters the walls with posters of hawk in fact , i probably see more of tony hawk than my husband inside the center , a group of teenage skateboarders , inline skaters and bmxers stood alongside the 100foot long halfpipe , screaming for autographs as though the skaters on the ramp were rock 'n' roll stars bouncing balls are not very cool , 17yearold louie verdieu said i much prefer watching tony hawk to football or baseball mainstream people have got to start accepting these sports next to verdieu , 17yearold curtis kwast , a surfer , skater , bmxer and snowboarder , was beside himself at seeing hawk , who , after winning saturday s event , said he was retiring from x games competition tony s a role model , kwast said he s the history of skateboarding fifty years from now , people will look back at the 900 and say , 'i remember when he invented that trick on sunday night , as practice for the motox big air competition began , the attention of the soldout staples center quickly shifted from the vert ramp to a series of metal ramps that led to an imposing , 20foottall dirt berm the spectacle took place in front of a crowd that cheered wildly but also seemed sobered by the consequences of this , the x games' most dangerous event i want to try motocross , 12yearold john stafford said , but after some of the things i 've seen , it s like , whoa this morning i watched carey hart fall he ran into the barricades and was just out at the start of the big air event , 5 of 13 top riders were out because of injuries among them was mike metzger , who sustained a concussion before the games , and pastrana , who injured his knee winning the previous night s event when the competition began , mike jones fell from the sky , landing on his head after apparently attempting a corkscrewing roll maneuver he was hauled off in a wheelchair later , beau bamberg pulled a harrowing backflip and a maneuver called the sterilizer , in which the rider lands a jump atop his handlebars after crashing hard , he went into convulsions on the track and emt s did not attempt to move him for five minutes despite the wrecks , the successful jumps were undeniably spectacular , none more so than a wild , corkscrewing backflip put forth by deegan that even eclipsed an astonishing , nohanded backflip performed by the runnerup , nate adams afterward , an elated deegan said the roll it just came to me last week i was doing big back flips and combos last week , but i was just saying , 'that s not going to win , to deegan , the wild , dangerous heights his sport is reaching is simple evolution i do n't think it s ever going to stop , he said i mean , look at mike jones he s 36 and went for something i do n't even know what and landed on his head i 've got many years of landing on my head left sporting a mouthful of broken teeth and a wide scar across his cheek , the bronze medalist , cowboy kenny bartram , was sobered at the event s toll , despite pulling a pair of unbelievable backflips himself it s gotten to the point where guys say , 'i do n't care if i die , i want to win' i'm not ready to die yet , so i took the bronze , he said photo the big air event at the x games , demonstrated by nate adams , is as dangerous as it is breathtaking \( photo by bakke shazamm espn \)
morningside heights by cheryl mendelson 326 pp new york random house 2495 when the characters in cheryl mendelson s first novel are looking for entertainment , they often pick up the works of great 19thcentury authors like thackeray and george eliot in providing the members of her modernday cast with such reading matter , mendelson is , at one level , simply underlining their literary tastes but at another , she is paying homage to her predecessors thackeray , eliot and jane austen \( invoked after two of mendelson s characters see a film adaptation of sense and sensibility \) are , above all , social novelists who place their protagonists in carefully modeled worlds that mendelson intends morningside heights to be such a book is clear even from its title , which asks us to see the lives the novel depicts as representing a broader context a socially mixed manhattan neighborhood at the end of the 20th century with her motley cast , mendelson paints an accurate , often comical portrait of the upper west side the dramatis personae include mr morales , a building superintendent , better educated and more intelligent than his employers on the coop board guessed elderly mary o 'reilly , retrieving her mail , in an elegant 60 sstyle suit incongruously paired with worn athletic shoes father merriweather , a nebbishy episcopal priest who was once a lawyer and the tall , gaunt , intimidating smithsmythes , who signed brazen petitions , wrote public letters that were signed by nobel prize winners and held secret meetings with fugitives , the proceedings of which were reported verbatim the next day in the world s various timeses the central characters are charles and anne braithwaite he a solidly secondrank baritone at the met , who had accepted that he would never rise further she once regarded as a promising pianist , now the fulltime mother of three children who attended private schools and got carefully chosen outside lessons and classes in typical manhattan fashion , the whole braithwaite brood is crammed into a twobedroom apartment charles and anne claim to have a strong marriage , but it is the sort of relationship in which a wife knows her husband had an inner account book , where he kept a record of her moral flaws , and in which a husband can think the following of his wife how hard anne worked , how much she gave up and did without , never suspecting , it seemed to him , that her petty domestic sacrifices had no tendency at all to produce cash or put food on the table as though she thought that moral payment were coin of the realm so she suffered her little deprivations thereby , in her own mind , she earned the right to spread her table with lobster , caviar and rare apples grown only in a small civil warera orchard somewhere south of pittsburgh , and to spend thousands of dollars on tiny old violins for ellen and stuart for all her orderly practicality , there were ways in which anne s mind was really deranged it s no surprise , then , that the braithwaites ignore their conjugal difficulties and throw themselves into worrying about the marital prospects of their two best friends , morris malcolm , an irascible biologist engaged in genetic research , and merrit roth , a beautiful cultural critic , who \( ironically \) writes on the history of women s roles and the family anne feels genuine sorrow on merrit s account , for in her mind the joys of husbands , pregnancies and children were life s best when merrit has n't found these by the age of 38 , anne concludes that merrit s life is an emergency obviously , merrit and morris will eventually end up together less clear is why all these cultured intellectuals are so preoccupied with marriage and babies charles and anne seem to agonize over morris and merrit as a kind of pastime , but the behavior of the singles themselves is puzzling in the midst of huge , potentially careerbreaking shenanigans in his former lab , morris proposes marriage to a brandnew girlfriend , for whom his feelings are at best lukewarm merrit s research gathers dust on her desk while she frets over comments her gynecologist made about infertility and fends off a volley of proposals from a young professor when mendelson s characters are n't pondering marriage , their thoughts turn immediately to its bedfellow , the great new york topic real estate this straitness of focus troubles me , particularly because the novel s peripheries are rich with more interesting material subthemes and subplots abound what , for example , it means to be a secondrate musician , and to be married to one , having given up one s own art to look after his children what damage is inflicted by the backbiting and competition in morris s world of scientific research the changes gentrification wreaks on a neighborhood and the emotional consequences of the death of lizzie miller , the old lady in apartment 9d , which also triggers a chain of events that culminate in a courtroom drama none of these stories are fully realized because , as if it were a narrow cousin of persuasion , the book s chief aim is to see everyone fitted neatly into the social order the sometimes muddled writing in morningside heights is surprising , given the clean prose of mendelson s first book , home comforts , a hefty volume of nonfiction that provides perhaps the only context in which entertaining and treatise on domestic economy can correctly be used in the same sentence one might overlook the galumphing description of morningside heights at the start of chapter 1 , but once the story begins to roll , you begrudge the detour in chapter 2 for more neighborhood lore and do there need to be three scenes of merrit uncovering deep truths about herself with her analyst \? most of the lackluster writing is garden variety , composed of scenes and sentences a more experienced author would simply have excised \( the kind of interest that sustained marriage was bestowed on its object , not created by it is one of many examples \) i suspect that with experience mendelson may also regret her decision to tie a neat bow at the end of each plot line , especially given her stated intention to write two more volumes about these characters yet if home comforts is the true index of mendelson s capabilities as a writer , the forthcoming installments of the morningside heights trilogy might be worth looking forward to after all , now that the marriage plot has been exhausted , she may feel free to bring other , more engaging matters to the fore
like many people touched by 9 11 , i'm still mourning the loss of a dear friend who worked on the 106th floor of one of the twin towers last year , to honor my friend s memory and those of the thousands of others who died , i created a sculpture titled tumbling woman , a bronze statue of a naked woman in perpetual free fall if it sounds familiar , that s probably because you remember the fuss it caused about a week after it was installed at rockefeller center , the sculpture was removed too soon to be seen is what i was told as the piece was being draped with a cloth and taken away perhaps as you can imagine , the experience led me to think about what constitutes an appropriate expression for tragedy as an artist and an american , one question still preoccupies me if we cannot face what happened , how can we move past it \? at any moment the decision will be made as to who will design the memorial at the world trade center site based on what i have seen , none of the proposals will reflect the tragedy of that day or inspire us to confront it they do not speak of the cruelty and the horror , of the vulnerability and desperation , of the valor and sacrifice above all , they fail to capture the destruction and injustice in fact , these sanitized designs could be memorials to anything almost anywhere maybe the finalists who designed the proposals were overwhelmed by the success of the vietnam memorial , or maybe their modernist sensibilities could not tolerate the messiness of what happened that day maybe it was because the bodies of most of the victims vanished in the destruction that might help explain why each design puts too much emphasis on the towers themselves by trying to honor the buildings' footprints , and by placing the intimate and sacred memorial spaces underground , covered with a false sense of tranquillity , they are regrettably doing what the attack did to the people inside making them disappear not only is the coffin being put in the ground , the tombstone is being buried along with it we need to learn how to tell the story of 9 11 after all , a memorial should be more than a marker at a grave site it should be a narrative imagine if the gettysburg battlefield were a sound and light show , or if the alamo were a park with reflecting ponds instead of the remains of the old structure narratives help keep the meaning and significance of great historical events vital they inspire us in their retelling they reinforce our resolve ground zero is big enough to contain several memorials reconstruct the twisted and charred steel facade of one world trade , return the battered bronze globe that now sits in battery park to the center of the plaza where it once stood , and keep the slurry wall exposed we need to allow space for monuments that capture the drama , images that haunt us and objects that carry the scars of their survival in other words , we need to memorialize what really happened on sept 11 part of the outcry i heard against my sculpture last year was that it was art , and art belongs in museums , not public spaces but what , then , is the purpose of art \? art has always served to bring form to what is experienced but cannot be seen it recreates things that have happened and moves them forward into a new light it brings order to chaos and clarity to confusion let us hope that the memorial will seek to include true artistic expression in its final configuration in the end , i'm not sure we are ready to finalize the design of the memorial perhaps not enough time has passed to absorb the tragedy and come to terms with our loss in a few brutal seconds , the collapsing towers robbed us of family members , friends and fellow citizens we ca n't allow a memorial to do the same
delmar , ny some 1 , 500 american investigators are scouring the iraqi countryside for evidence of weapons of mass destruction that has so far eluded them known as the iraq survey group and operating under the supervision of a former united nations weapons inspector , david kay , they are searching mostly for documents that will help them assemble a clear , if somewhat circumstantial , case that iraq had or intended to have programs to produce prohibited weapons it is a daunting task and according to many iraqi scientists and officials i have spoken to , it is not being done very well a logical starting place for such a mission is in the jadariya district of downtown baghdad , adjacent to the campus of baghdad university the complex that housed the iraqi national monitoring directorate the directorate was the government agency responsible for coordinating all aspects of the united nations inspection teams' missions it was also supposed to monitor iraq s industrial infrastructure and ensure compliance with the security council resolutions regarding disarmament , verification and exportimport controls as such , the directorate was the repository for every iraqi government record relating to its weapons programs , as well as to the activities at dozens of industrial sites in iraq that were dualuse used to manufacture permitted items but capable of being modified to manufacture proscribed material for 12 years the iraqis collected and collated this data if we inspectors had a question about a contract signed between country a and iraqi factory b , the directorate could produce it at short notice the 12 , 500 page full , final and complete declaration provided by iraq to the united nations in the fall of 2002 was compiled using this archive and the directorate s holdings went well beyond paperwork every interview conducted by the united nations inspectors with iraqi scientists throughout the 1990 s was videotaped and available for review of course , all this material was put together by officials and scientists who were obedient , either out of loyalty or fear , to the former regime , and it was done in a way intended to prove that iraq was complying with the united nations resolutions \( something that has not been proved false in the five months since the americanled invasion \) still , even if one was to discount the entire archive as simply a collection of iraqi falsifications , it would still be a sound foundation on which the iraq survey group could have started investigations after all , some of my most fruitful efforts as a united nations inspector were initiated using false claims by the iraqi government as the starting point and it seems that after the coalition troops moved into baghdad , the records were all there for the taking according to several senior directorate officials i have spoken to since the war one a brigadier general who had been a highranking administrator at the complex the entire archive had been consolidated into metal containers before the war and stored at the directorate s jadariyah headquarters for protection yet these eyewitnesses have provided me with a troubling tale on april 8 , they say , the buildings were occupied by soldiers from the army s third infantry division for two weeks , the iraqi scientists and administrators showed up for work but , according to several i have spoken to , no one from the coalition interviewed them or tried to take control of the archive rather , these staff members have told me , after occupying the facility for two weeks , the american soldiers simply withdrew soon after , looters entered the facility and ransacked it overnight , every computer was stolen , disks and video records were destroyed , and the carefully organized documents were ripped from their binders and either burned or scattered about according to the former brigadier general , who went back to the building after the mob had gone , some iraqi scientists did their best to recover and reconstitute what they could , but for the vast majority of the archive the damage was irreversible obviously , i am relying on the word of former directorate officials , but these are people i knew well in my days as an inspector , and none would seem to have anything to gain by lying today in any case , the looting of the building , if not the previous presence of american troops , has been well documented by western news reports why was this allowed to happen \? i am as puzzled as the iraqis given the high priority the bush administration placed on discovering evidence of weapons of mass destruction , it seems only logical that seizing the directorate archive would have been a top priority for the coalition forces at least as important as the iraqi oil ministry or the national museum and it seems highly unlikely that coalition leaders did n't know what the archive contained i was one of many international inspectors who led investigations of the facility and the data we produced was used by the american government as part of its case that saddam hussein was hiding prohibited programs today , with the tremendous controversy over the administration s prewar assertions , it is impossible to overstate the importance of the archive that produced iraq s 12 , 500 pages of claims none of which have yet been shown to be false that comprise the most detailed record of iraq s weapons programs next month the iraq survey group will give a formal briefing to american and british officials on the status of its investigations president bush has already hinted that the group will make a case that it has found evidence of prohibited weapons programs and of efforts to hide them from international inspectors such a case may have merit , but without being able to compare and contrast it to the iraqi version of events , i'm not sure how convincing it will be to the american public , or to the rest of the world
tulia , tex the first time i ever saw a smile flicker across the face of freddie brookins sr was on monday mr brookins is a compact , athleticlooking man in his late 40 s he could serve as a model for that mythic american figure , the tough , softspoken , nononsense father who puts in decades of hard work to build a reasonably secure and comfortable life for his family mr brookins is a beef processor four years ago his son , freddie jr , a young man with no history of trouble with the law , was arrested in the nownotorious tulia drug sweep after taking out a home equity loan to get his son released on bail , mr brookins asked freddie jr if he had , in fact , sold drugs to an undercover agent named tom coleman , as the authorities were alleging freddie jr said no which created a situation tremendously long prison sentences were already being handed down , and everybody understood that there was more of a chance that the people of tulia would begin to fly than that a jury would acquit any of the blacks caught in the sweep but prosecutors were willing to accept a guilty plea from freddie jr in exchange for a fiveyear sentence when i met mr brookins last summer , freddie jr was already in prison doing 20 years mr brookins told me he could n't bear to advise his son to take a plea to something he had n't done so the young man went to trial in the spring of 2000 and was convicted , as he knew he would be i got a chance to talk to mr brookins on monday afternoon , soon after freddie jr and 11 other tulia defendants were released on a special personal recognizance bond the tulia drug cases have completely fallen apart and all convictions are likely to be overturned i spotted mr brookins taking a quiet moment alone outside a building where a welcome home celebration for the newly released defendants was being held how you doing \? i asked that s when i saw the smile spread across his face he took my hand in both of his and gave it a great squeeze he s finally home , he said his voice was a little husky from cigarette smoke , and still as quiet as ever it s a great day a great day i asked if he was bitter about the authorities , or the system , or tom coleman , the chronic liar who set the tulia madness in motion that s a hard question , said mr brookins in a way i'm bitter and in a way i feel sorry for them also released on monday was joe moore , a kindly , overweight 60yearold pig farmer who ca n't read or write too good and is in such poor health he can barely walk without assistance he was smiling , too well , i had kind of a hard time for a while there in prison , he said , because i have sugar diabetes and i was n't getting my medication there for a while i began to lose some of my sight but then i got my medication , so i'm all right now except for the fact that he is destitute i lost all my hogs because of this trouble , he said i lost everything , really there seemed to be a special measure of cruelty in the treatment of mr moore he was sentenced to 90 years in prison as an alleged drug kingpin , and at one point was assigned to a maximum security unit populated by hardcore predators even the inmates were astonished they said to me , 'what are you doing here \? you do n't need to be in here , old man' rather than abusing mr moore , the inmates looked out for him they were very protective , he said there were smiles and hugs everywhere on monday as defendants were reunited with their children , their parents , other relatives and close friends but if you paid close attention it was easy to see signs of discomfiture , wariness , anger and even rage behind many of the smiles the events over the past four years were not just bizarre , they were profoundly destructive some of the defendants seemed bewildered , not fully understanding all that had happened to them , or what might be in store none of those i spoke to had solid plans for the future and no one had any money to speak of their liberty had been taken away from them capriciously and , in their view , almost as capriciously returned so monday was a good day but given everything that had happened , no one was placing heavy bets on tuesday

dr schechter asked parents can inspire philanthropy in their children through their own example of good works , he said showing them very graphically whom and how they are helping is also effective debbie shulansky gershman of west hartford , whose twin daughters , carolyn and sara , had separate fundraising parties for connecticut children s medical center on their seventh birthdays , took her twins on a tour of the hospital she also began talking to them about their parties a year before , stressing how fortunate they were there were a lot of things that made it concrete for them , ms gershman said mrs parry struck a deal with her daughter olivia , when olivia wanted to have a massively , huge birthday party with 40 children at the weston middle school pool traditionally , the parrys favored small birthday parties mrs parry agreed to the pool party on the condition that instead of gifts , guests would be asked for contributions to the international relief agency americares meanwhile , olivia would still receive gifts from her family at first , i did n't agree , said olivia , now 13 watching a news story about children in kosovo helped change her mind they had raggedy clothes and looked hungry in some cases it is an unforgettable image of a child or adult in distress that spurs a child s compassion because children lack adult defense mechanisms of denial and rationalization , some ca n't let go of a haunting image , said dr dan kindlon , a child psychologist and author of too much of a good thing raising children of character in an indulgent age it s a much more immediate thing for them a television news clip of a family , their home destroyed by fire , compelled zoe allison , now 11 , of west hartford to celebrate turning 10 with a party for the american red cross sometimes children s reasons are more personal after his grandmother died of cancer , jake medina , 9 , of avon bypassed the toys at his most recent birthday party and asked his friends to donate money to the american cancer society so it would n't happen to other people , said jake , recalling his grandmother s suffering since age 5 , philip brauer , now 8 , of greenwich has had birthday parties to benefit save the children , an international aid organization , partly because there s no toy shortage in the brauer home , but mostly to teach compassion , said his mother , mary brauer but mrs brauer wondered how much philip understood she got her answer last spring when he looked at a magazine with pictures of starving children upset by the photos and questioning why the children could n't get food , philip said , this is what i'm doing on my birthday i'm helping these children it s one of those moments , i 'll never forget , mrs brauer said this year right after the war in iraq began , zoe , the parrys' middle daughter , asked her mother if she should celebrate her 10th birthday with a party to help iraqi children the party raised 570 for americares i felt really good , said zoe , who received praise from her school , other parents and americares officials it was better than getting more toys photos top , from left sitting at table , eliza allison and lily gradante standing , from left , natalie cooke , zoe allison , diana cooke , maia gradante , lily hannigan and olivia jones middle photo , philip brauer at his eighth birthday party that s one of his invitations to the right of him at left , zoe parry with decorations and , from left , her sisters , olivia and eleanor zoe s invitation is above \( photo by george ruhe for the new york times \) \( photo by judith pszenica for the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) the parry girls , left , looking at pictures of zoe s birthday party , including the one above of zoe the family s parties have helped charities , including americares \( photo by judith pszenica \) philip brauer , 8 , left , at his birthay party , and , above , at his home in greenwich his parties have benefited save the children since he was 5 years old \( photo by judith pszenica for the new york times \) \( pg 4 \)
norman , okla , oct 7 they appear together on a technicolor mural in the kerrmcgee stadium club and leap lifelike from portraits hung reverently in the legends' lobby of the 21 coaches who have led oklahoma on the football field , three of them comprise the sooners' holy trinity the first , bud wilkinson , led oklahoma to three national championships and a record , which still stands , of 47 consecutive victories from 1953 to 1957 he has a practice field named after him the second , barry switzer , captured three national titles and posted an 837 winning percentage over a 16year tenure that ended in 1988 his name is on the stateoftheart strength and sports medicine center the third will be on the sideline of the cotton bowl in dallas on saturday , when the topranked sooners \( 50 \) hope to continue their domination of their red river rival , no 11 texas , and take an emphatic step toward a national title in five seasons , coach bob stoops has already earned a national championship , compiled a 489 record and earned the devotion of a footballcrazy state at 43 , stoops has a ways to go before being memorialized in bricks and mortar instead , the university of oklahoma has paid its respects by making him among the highestpaid college coaches in the nation if not the highest paid with an annual compensation package worth 22 million squarejawed and trim , stoops has acted every bit the wall street titan one who prefers coaching shorts and a polo shirt in the days leading up to the game with a formidable 41 longhorn team you want confidence \? he insisted that this year s sooners were better than the 2000 team that capped a 130 national title season by defeating favored florida state in the orange bowl you want combativeness \? stoops chided the local news media here for not trumpeting the heisman trophy campaign of his quarterback , jason white all white , a senior , has done is overcome knee injuries that ended his seasons the two previous years to complete 67 percent of his passes , including for 16 touchdowns you 'd think they would have an idea , stoops said this week , gazing defiantly at the reporters he was taking on but some are slow to learn you want conviction \? i refuse to undersell my football team , he said to that end , alumni and boosters anted up 80 million for improvements to the sooners' football facilities joe castiglione , the university s athletic director , two years ago negotiated stoops s compensation package , which was approved by oklahoma s board of regents castiglione conceded that college coaching salaries had escalated in erratic fashion but he said stoops s hefty contract makes sense financially because of the way his athletic budget is structured , and in a more grandiose way , because of the iconic status of oklahoma football coaches the oklahoma athletic department has to generate every dollar it spends , castiglione said we are compensating an individual that leads an important program in our university , one that is important to the people of oklahoma though stoops s base salary of 200 , 000 is paid by state funds , the 2 million balance is raised from outside endorsements and private donations oklahoma s football program generates 70 percent or 336 million of the university s 48 million athletic budget it accounts for 30 percent or 144 million of its expenses , according to castiglione last year , the athletic department donated 250 , 000 generated from merchandise sales to the university s libraries stoops gave an additional 50 , 000 after switzer , the sooners went through three head coaches , none of whom was able to unite the university s powerful constituencies , or win often enough for the people of the state when castiglione hired stoops from steve spurrier s staff at florida in 1998 , he was given a twoprong mandate restore credibility and integrity to the program dozens of meetandgreets with boosters throughout the state helped , as did a 75 record and a bowl appearance in stoops s first season , in 1999 but what really inspired the sooner faithful was word emanating from the team about the family tone stoops had set , as well as his insistence that the state needed to raise its expectations along with spurrier s wideopen passing offense , stoops brought his belief that life is more important than football stoops holds dinners for his staff members and their families every other week and schedules the first meeting of the day for 8 45 am , so his coaches can spend time with their children after his first season , stoops reminded fans that oklahoma football is not about above 500 seasons and trips to the independence bowl he told them it was about national championships , and the next year the sooners went out and won one stoops s steely standards and velvet touch have also helped raise oklahoma s graduation rate to 65 percent , a record for the program on the sidelines , he talks to you like he is still playing the game , said running back kejuan jones off the field , he treats you like a real person , like you 're his brother , and he wants you to accomplish everything you can just as he refuses to undersell his players , stoops is not ready to be deified beyond a few twodimensional paintings by the oklahoma faithful he is neither intimidated by his lofty position in the state nor impressed by his own salary you have to live your life appropriately and set a good example in all things , he said it s that simple photo in five seasons at oklahoma , coach bob stoops has won a national title and has a 489 record enough success to enable him to make one of the highest coaching salaries in the country \( photo by associated press \)
sandwich , england down here , not far from the white cliffs of dover , the names that have won the british open at royal st george s jump out of the sandhills of history harry vardon twice , walter hagen twice , bobby locke and , more recently , bill rogers , sandy lyle and greg norman but do n't forget james bond the spy , 007 , did not win the british open , but on the pages of ian fleming s goldfinger , he survived a classic golf match with auric goldfinger and his caddie , odd job , on a course that fleming , a royal st george s member , disguised as royal st mark s in the movie , starring sean connery , the match was filmed at stoke poges , a bland parkland course near london , instead of here at royal st george s , where the 132nd british open begins today on land formed by what is known locally as the great storm of 1287 everything in england is old , the tourists like to say , especially the land that links the farmland to the sea hence the terms linksland and golf links when that storm left huge chunks of silt in sandwich harbor , sandbars developed that created the rolling sandhills that more than seven centuries later perch above golf s bumpiest fairways here on the kent coast in what is known as the garden of england near the channel tunnel in the unusual heat that has baked the moonscape fairways this week , the vagaries of those bounces could determine the winner of the claret jug on sunday they 're the most severe fairways we 're going to play as far as the bounces go , tiger woods said not too often do you hit the ball down the middle and you end up in the bunker or the rough because of the bounce you 're going to hit shots that just end up in some weird places the harder the ball lands , the crazier the bounce a factor that could work against woods and golf s other heavy hitters although straight drives do n't always stay in the fairway , the last time the british open was played at royal st george s , in 1993 , the winner was greg norman , considered by many the longest , straightest driver in golf history his 64 in the final round edged nick faldo by two strokes the 48yearold norman is now more of a conglomerate than a touring pro his business is course design , apparel and wine he has teed off only twice in a pga tour event this year , withdrawing after a 78 in the players championship and finishing tied for 65th in the byron nelson championship but as the most recent winner of a british open at royal st george s , norman might have a more valid view than most of how the course plays it s a quirky golf course , norman said there are so many different nuances about how you can approach the game around here you can play it aggressive if you want , or play it as conservative as you like because of the sandhills that provide a natural grandstand for spectators , many shots are blind , or partly blind some shots are semiblind , norman said some shots you have to trust the distance how far you want to hit it through the air , but then you have to calculate a 60yard run and hopefully that run is going to be straight some of the greens are low , some are high royal st george s is not much different than it was in 1894 , when james h taylor won the first british open played outside scotland , or in 1911 , when vardon won the fifth of his record six british opens , or in 1949 , when the irish pro harry bradshaw hit his ball out of a broken beer bottle after shooting a 68 in the first round , bradshaw was among the leaders in the second round when he found his ball in the rough to the right of the fifth fairway and inside a discarded bottle rather than risk a penalty stroke under what was then an ambiguously worded unplayableball rule , bradshaw chose to swing with his sand iron he smashed the broken bottle but moved the ball only about 30 yards his doublebogey 6 there haunted his bid for the claret jug i had been playing with great calm and was really in a perfect relaxed state of mind the kind of feeling you get all too rarely , bradshaw said later , referring to his demeanor before the shot from the bottle it took me about five or six holes to recover bradshaw would finish 72 holes in a tie with locke , a south african who won the 36hole playoff by 12 strokes with all drinks now poured into plastic cups at the concession stands , none of the golfers at this british open should find their golf ball in a broken bottle but with royal st george s bumpy fairways flipping the ball sideways , the sometimes kneehigh rough will be enough of a problem not that all that rough kept 007 from winning
it sounds like a debtor s dream the lender pays interest to the borrower , and the borrower reports a profit stmicroelectronics , a european semiconductor maker , raised 12 billion last week by selling a new convertible bond with an interest rate that was half a percentage point below zero for every dollar a buyer invested , the company promised to pay back 95 cents in 10 years that makes sense to the financial engineers who design convertibles the idea is that a buyer of a convertible bond is buying three things first is the bond , with whatever the normal interest rate on that company s bond would be second is a 10year call option to buy the underlying stock and third is a put on the bond , giving the buyer the right to sell the bond back early to the company , an escape mechanism if the stock falls far enough to make the conversion feature seem hopelessly out of the money investors who bought the bonds were persuaded that the options were worth more than the interest that would normally be paid if the bond lacked such options a result was the negative interest rate whether the investment is a good one remains to be seen , of course the exercise price for the conversion is 3343 , a 55 percent premium to where the share price stood when the deal was sold and 62 percent above yesterday s close of 2061 a bond buyer would seem to be showing hope for a big gain in the stock , while demanding protection from the possibility of a substantial price decline that may not be as contradictory as it seems , because stmicro is a typical technology stock it went to the moon in 2000 , peaking at 7388 , and fell to 11 last fall optimists have reason to be wary but the important point may be that the embedded call option has similarities to the typical employee stock option the option lasts 10 years , although the buyer can cancel it by redeeming the bond after 3 , 5 or 7 years the option cannot be separated from the bond and sold separately similarly , employees cannot sell their options , and can cancel them early by quitting none of that prevented the market from valuing the option the arithmetic indicates that the option was valued at 10 percent of the price of the bond stmicro s fellow technology companies might want to ponder that fact for in the current debate about whether to force companies to treat stock options as an expense , they have argued that such options cannot be valued as the securities industry association put it , existing valuation models do not provide reliable estimates for options of one or more years in duration the association complained that the valuation depended on estimates of future volatility , and said such estimates were often wrong true enough but that did not stop stmicro from accepting a market price for a very similar option embedded in its bond nor does uncertainty about valuation keep it , or any other member of the securities industry association , from issuing millions of options to officers and employees had stmicro reported the value of those options as an expense last year , its reported profits would have fallen 47 percent the company said the only official who could discuss such issues was on vacation and unreachable issuing this bond will raise reported profits a bit the company will report interest income , not expense there is a pattern here because accounting rules let companies ignore the value of options , the companies can obscure the cost of compensating employees and even claim a profit from borrowing money that such accounting is legal does not stop it from being absurd graph tracks weekly closes of stmicroelectronics since 1999
washington , april 18 the united states believes that at least seven senior iraqi officials are now in syria , including a figure who is no 8 on the american wanted list , defense officials said today the most senior iraqi identified in american intelligence reports as being in syria is kamal mustapha abdullah altikriti , secretary of the republican guard and special republican guard , the officials said in recent days , the state department has relayed to syria the names of iraqi officials believed to be there , with a request that they be expelled , administration officials said today it was not clear whether mr tikriti was on that list a state department official said tonight he had not heard mr tikriti was in syria the american military has also stepped up its search efforts in parts of northwestern iraq near the syrian border where some senior iraqi officials are now suspected to be hiding for more than a week , administration officials including defense secretary donald h rumsfeld have said that they believed some iraqi officials or their families escaped to syria and perhaps beyond in their public statements , the officials have not been more specific about who they believed to be in syria but in a television interview broadcast on thursday night , secretary of state colin l powell said the united states had provided syria with some information concerning specific named individuals that we would hope they will look into the only other iraqis that administration officials said they believed were in syria and cited by name were farouk hijazi , iraq s ambassador to tunisia and a former senior intelligence operative , and possibly president saddam hussein s first wife , sajida khairallah telfah the concerns about the flight of iraqi officials have aggravated an already difficult relationship between the united states and syria bush administration officials have long expressed concern that syria is developing chemical weapons and about its support for organizations the united states considers terrorist , including hezbollah and the palestinian groups hamas and islamic jihad mr powell has said he plans to travel to syria later this spring to discuss all those issues with its leader , president bashar alassad the defense officials who identified mr tikriti as the highestranking iraqi believed to be in syria spoke on condition of anonymity and would not describe the basis for the intelligence reports they said he was among seven or eight iraqis on the american list who are believed to be in syria united states forces in iraq have detained several highranking iraqi officials in recent days , and other iraqis have surrendered to american troops but none have been ranked as high as mr tikriti on the american list the syrian government has repeatedly denied having granted refuge to any iraqi officials , and said it had closed its border to iraqis american officials say those border posts have indeed been closed in recent days , a step they have characterized as positive , but they say it is possible that iraqi leaders may be finding other routes into syria of iraq s six neighbors the others are turkey , iran , kuwait , saudi arabia and jordan syria had by far the closest economic and political ties with the baghdad government , and it is regarded by intelligence officials as being the most likely escape route for fleeing iraqi officials american forces in iraq have now begun the process of sorting through iraqi prisoners of war to determine who should remain in custody in the last two weeks , coalition forces have released 887 iraqis detained during the war who have since been determined to be noncombatants , the pentagon said today our intention is not to hold prisoners indefinitely and to get these people processed as soon as possible , said cmdr chris isleib , a pentagon spokesman but nearly 7 , 000 iraqi prisoners are still being held at camps in the southern city of umm qasr , where the united states is constructing what it has named its theater internment facility an unknown number of additional prisoners are still at temporary holding units elsewhere or are with the military units who captured them , the officials said under the geneva convention , prisoners of war can be held until the end of hostilities , a condition the united states is not likely to declare for weeks or even months but noncombatants who did not engage in hostile acts during the war and were not part of a military force are to be released as soon as their status is determined among the prisoners held at umm qasr are a number of highranking iraqi officers , according to defense officials they are being interrogated as part of the broader american effort to seek out other iraqi officials who have evaded capture and to obtain information about iraq s suspected caches of illegal weapons in other military developments today , the pentagon said it had recovered and identified the remains of an air force pilot missing since his f15e fighter jet went down in iraq on april 7 the pilot was identified as capt eric b das , 30 , of amarillo , tex , and his status was changed from missing to killed in action the search for the plane s weapons officer , who has not been publicly identified , is continuing the confirmation of captain das s death brings to 128 the number of american military personnel killed in the war two americans are still listed as missing the second f15 crew member and army sgt edward j anguiano , 24 , of brownsville , tex , missing since his convoy was ambushed on march 23 in iraq no americans are listed as prisoners of war from the current conflict
the line to get into entertainment weekly s annual it party last month was long , and getting longer countless stylish hipsters were massed around the door to the roxy , stretching down 18th street , around the corner and up 10th avenue when jeff marx arrived , however , he headed straight for the entrance and the publicist who was guarding it despite his large posse and his nonchalant air , he appeared to be an unlikely candidate for vip access for one thing , he was dressed in schlumpy clothes and for another , most of the members of his posse were puppets they were n't just any puppets , of course they were the stars of avenue q , the musical that mr marx and robert lopez created , wrote and scored , and they were being honored that night as some of the 100 most creative people in entertainment so after a bit of a fuss , the doorman unclipped the velvet rope , and mr marx and his entourage strolled onto the red carpet , where the paparazzi awaited the show , which is both a spoof of and a homage to sesame street , had an acclaimed run at the vineyard theater last spring that made its puppets into celebrities , of a sort at the party , having earned the right to mingle with guests like bruce willis and snoop dogg , the puppets hammed it up for their adoring public the legless look is very in , the female lead , kate monster played by stephanie d'abruzzo joked to a cnn camera no legs no cellulite meanwhile , rod , the closeted gay puppet played by john tartaglia , started petting the fuzzy boom mike , calling it cousin larry over the course of the night , the avenue q posse proved to be as popular as and often cleverer than the award winners who were actual carbonbased life forms on thursday the puppets will be making another very public debut , as they open at the golden theater on broadway there , larger audiences will have the opportunity to revel in meanspirited songs like everyone s a little bit racist and schadenfreude \( the world needs people like you and me who 've been knocked around by fate cause when people see us , they do n't want to be us , and that makes them feel great \) and offcolor characters \( kate monster has nipples , an onstage orgasm and a buxom rival named lucy t slut \) indeed , much of the fun of the show lies in the chance to see the familiar world of children s wonder dragged into a cursefilled world of genx angst , unemployment and promiscuous , drunken sex the musical makes no effort to hide its debt to sesame street the opening number starts with the line the sun is shining , it s a lovely day deliberately close to the television show s famous sunny day , sweeping the clouds away after the main characters , kate monster and princeton , have a euphoric , boozefueled encounter , the silhouette of a male face on a video monitor mouths the word come while a female counterpart adds mitment , offering a grownup adaptation of the old children s phonics lesson cookie monster s legacy is suggested by the presence of trekkie monster , who is addicted to internet porn instead of sweets bert and ernie are echoed by two male puppet roommates , one of whom is in love with the other as rick lyon , the show s puppet designer , explains on his web site , lyonpuppetscom , the question behind avenue q is what if a cozy , familiar kids' television show had to grow up \? not just the characters , but the subject matter , the songs , the attitude it s one long , backhanded compliment extremely backhanded , you might say , which is interesting given that mr marx is a former intern for the series and that , in 1999 , he was fired mr lyon also worked on the show , as a puppeteer until he , too , was asked not to return just last season the other three puppeteers ms d'abruzzo , mr tartaglia and jennifer barnhart worked there as well , albeit without incident few television producers would tolerate this kind of satire , especially from disgruntled former employees and in the past , sesame workshop \( the group that controls sesame street \) and the jim henson company , which created the show s stars , the muppets , have been extremely protective of their brands in 1982 , henson sued five residents of bath , me , who had named their pig contest the miss piggy pageant last year , sesame obtained a ceaseanddesist order against ernest bertram , an eightminute independent film that jokingly presumed a sexual relationship between ernie and bert sesame executives said they even contemplated bringing suit when bert s image appeared , unexpectedly , on posters at a 2001 proalqaeda rally in bangladesh about avenue q , however , sesame workshop has almost nothing to say they 're not our characters , said ellen lewis , a spokeswoman it s not like they took cookie and big bird and put them into adult situations they are different puppets as for the bodies that inhabit them , she said , they happen to be our puppeteers , then hurried off the phone

pittsburgh , jan 4 peter laviolette declared earlier in the day that the coming homeandhome series against the pittsburgh penguins was no less than the most important in his two seasons as the islanders' coach laviolette wants his team to keep charging the islanders overcame a lethargic start to send the game into overtime tonight , but they lost to the penguins , 32 the loss ended the islanders' seasonbest fivegame winning streak and came against an opponent they could have tied in the eastern conference with a victory instead , pittsburgh is 2 points ahead of the islanders \( 171651 \) to battle back and get a point is important , laviolette said it s not satisfying , but it s important that now makes the second game of the series , to be played tuesday at nassau coliseum , as big as a game in early january can get the islanders have only joined the jumble of teams that are in playoff contention hopefully , on tuesday we can take 2 points and give them none , michael peca , the islanders' captain , said martin straka scored the gamewinning goal on a twoonone rush 42 seconds into overtime penguins defenseman marc bergevin tapped the puck up the ice to michal rozsival , who quickly formed a rush with straka islanders defenseman kenny jonsson took on rozsival , and rozsival slid the puck to straka garth snow , who had replaced chris osgood in goal after the first period , got in front of straka s shot , but the puck squirted past him and dribbled over the goal line kenny played it perfectly the way he was supposed to , snow said osgood , who was 712 since nov 30 , left after giving up 2 goals on 10 shots laviolette said he wanted to go with a different look against the penguins \( 171535 \) , who won for the fifth time in seven games snow played for the first time since dec 14 , when the islanders lost at tampa bay he stopped 15 of 16 shots but said with a smile , it felt like i had n't played in a month it was hard to tell at first that this game was important for the islanders they were listless in the first period , and the penguins cruised to a 20 lead on goals by mario lemieux and michael sivek the islanders rallied in the next period after they killed their only penalty of the game stretching their current penaltykilling streak to 25 and began to push the puck into the pittsburgh zone mark parrish scored a powerplay goal at 15 34 , and the islanders tied the score 3 24 later peca carried the puck toward pittsburgh goalie johan hedberg and flicked it at the last moment to arron asham , who scored his sixth goal at 18 58 we thought there was no way we were n't going to win the hockey game , peca said but the islanders had only eight shots in the third period it s a bit of a consolation prize to get 1 point , parrish said , but we slipped another 1 in back of them
after more than a year of pretrial maneuvering , an effort by two of the world s largest phone equipment companies , motorola and nokia , to paint themselves as victims of a huge fraud by a secretive turkish family is scheduled to go to trial tomorrow in a federal court in new york the two phone giants are trying to recover as much as possible of the 28 billion they lent telsim , a turkish cellular startup controlled by the uzan family , to buy equipment and enter the fastgrowing turkish market the battle is being waged on multiple fronts , including courts in britain and turkey , and in washington , where motorola has sought the support of the bush administration on thursday , operating under a british court order , motorola seized one of the uzans' private jets when it landed in germany meanwhile , motorola and several of its top executives are facing a growing number of shareholder lawsuits complaining that the company inflated its stock price in 2000 and 2001 by announcing the sale of more than 15 billion in equipment to telsim without disclosing that it had provided even more than that in loans to finance the sales motorola says the suits are without merit the uzans , who were not available for interviews and whose representatives declined to speak on the record , have argued in interviews and in court that the entire conflict reflects their suppliers' unwillingness to face up to the losses stemming from the global crash in the telecommunications markets , recession in turkey and a large devaluation of the turkish lira they say the main issue is whether telsim s problems were beyond their control and that the terms of the agreements call for arbitration of such issues in switzerland but the uzans are being sued in new york under state fraud laws and the federal racketeering law originally designed to attack organized crime if motorola and nokia win , they will ask that the damages be tripled , as the racketeering law allows the problem , they say , is not one of contract interpretation but of deliberate deception , manipulation of the turkish courts and financial skulduggery although american courts tend to support arbitration clauses strongly in business contracts , federal district judge jed s rakoff in manhattan has ruled that telsim s contracts do not apply because the suits are against the people who control telsim and not the company itself judge rakoff also ruled that the contract allowed the suppliers to go to court rather than arbitration the trial is expected to end quickly and decisively in the companies' favor last may , when judge rakoff froze the uzans' new york assets , including eight apartments , he said that every preliminary indication pointed to repeated acts of fraud and chicanery adding up to a rather massive swindle since then , the uzans have defied additional orders by judge rakoff they have obtained a turkish court ruling ordering that the new york suit be halted none of the defendants or their lawyers plan to attend the trial judge rakoff last fall imposed contempt fines starting at 100 million a month and doubling each month , but that ruling was stayed on appeal the family has similarly ignored orders entered by a british court , leading to 15month jail terms being imposed on kemal uzan , the family patriarch , and murat hakan uzan and cem cengiz uzan , his two sons the court imposed a fourmonth sentence on aysegul akay , their sister but there has been no move to extradite any of the family from turkey motorola , based in schaumburg , ill , argues that it is owed more than 2 billion by telsim , while nokia , based in finland , is seeking 700 million both have written off the entire value of the loans they are confronting one of the world s wealthiest families , according to forbes , which estimated the uzans' net worth last year at 13 billion the uzans' farflung business empire comprises well over 100 companies , including the construction company that kemal uzan started in the 1950 s , power and communications businesses , banks and media properties back when the turkish government awarded telsim a license to compete with turkcell , the country s first provider of digital cellular service , motorola saw a golden opportunity motorola , which had previously sold small amounts of analog cellular equipment to telsim , signed a supply agreement early in 1998 and also provided 200 million to help telsim acquire its licenses telsim had 400 , 000 out of about 12 million cellular subscribers in turkey when we made the first loan , said scott wyman , a spokesman for motorola by late 2000 , it had 48 million out of about 144 million and with 65 million people in turkey , there was plenty of room for more penetration obviously , we were right about the opportunity but the growth was not producing profits indeed , it was creating demands for more equipment , and frequent amendments to the supply agreement raised the total that telsim had been loaned to 19 billion , not counting interest payments
three years ago , tracy mcgrady , at age 21 , from a workingclass , singlemother family , who had graduated from high school but did not go beyond , signed a contract that would secure him a thick bundle of cash 928 million , to be exact over the next seven years he had been a pro since 1997 , the ninth overall pick in the nba draft he had gone directly from high school in north carolina to the toronto raptors at 6 feet 8 inches , slender and with arms that could pluck goods off the top shelf , he had been a good player , but not a great one , though knowledgeable observers generally believed that the potential for stardom was there he had a drowsy look about him , with heavylidded eyes and a casual speaking manner , that may have given the impression of laziness his nickname was big sleep , after all , for his ability to fall asleep anytime , anywhere , as friends say and there was also a suspicion among some , contradicted by others , that he did not always play hard or work hard to develop his skills but the orlando magic decided that , when mcgrady became a free agent in 2000 , he was a risk well worth taking in our business , said john gabriel , the general manager of the magic , who scouted and signed mcgrady , we live our lives on potential that s the history of our league now , with so many younger guys coming in , gabriel said you look for athletic ability which tracy has an abundance of and the ability to play multipositions , which he can do even toronto was n't sure who he was but when i talked to people like butch carter , who coached him there , we got very good reports back but none of us guessed that he would turn into tmac mcgrady has indeed materialized into one of the best players in the league he was named last year to the allnba first team \( along with tim duncan , shaquille o'neal , jason kidd and kobe bryant \) , and appears certain to receive that honor again he was recently named to the united states olympic team , and , of even greater significance for his employers , has led his team into the playoffs this year he has been instrumental in leading the eighthseeded magic to the seventh game of their firstround series against topseeded detroit orlando lost game 6 to the pistons friday night , 10388 , despite mcgrady s 37 points , 11 rebounds and 5 assists in playing all but 25 seconds of the game only twice in the 19year history of the current playoff system in the nba has an eighthseeded team toppled a topseeded team in a series and in mcgrady s two previous years with orlando , the magic reached the playoffs , only to lose in the first round mcgrady has achieved his current stature with two elements his performance with the basketball and his assuming a true leadership that befits a superstar he has averaged 268 , 256 and , this season , a leagueleading 321 points a game in his three years with orlando , up from about 11 points a game in his three years with toronto , when he was primarily a role player besides his scoring , mcgrady has drawn raves for his overall usefulness , adding significant rebounds , assists and an assiduous defense to his game but of primary importance has been his increasing sense of leadership i do n't think it s quite his nature to be outspoken , said doc rivers , the orlando coach , but tracy has understood that as the star of the team he had to be more vocal as a leader and he has one example mcgrady scored 43 points in game 1 against detroit , and 46 in game 2 but orlando lost the second game when the team as a whole scored just 77 points after that second game i got an email from a fan saying that if mcgrady scored so many of his team s points , he must be a ball hog , said ken hornack , a sportswriter with the daytona beach \( fla \) news journal i replied that mcgrady was n't hogging the ball nobody else wanted to take a shot before game 3 , rivers recalled , mcgrady went to each player on the team and said do n't worry about me getting my shots you just play your game , be aggressive orlando won the next two games , to go up by 31 in the series he was n't scoring in astronomical figures , and he did not have to meanwhile , in game 3 , during a timeout , mcgrady gave advice to the rookie forward drew gooden you 're making the game too hard mcgrady told him drew is a talented player , but inexperienced , mcgrady recalled he s in such a rush , so fidgety to do things i said 'get the ball , take your time , look around at the defense , and then make a quick move take your shot , not the shot the defense wants you to take' pat garrity , an outsideshooting specialist , said when tracy thinks i 've passed up a shot after i 've taken another shot and missed , he s said 'keep shooting the ball ! keep shooting the ball ! ' he was giving me confidence that even if i miss , i 'll make the next one , or the one after that s the confidence he has in himself , one of the many reasons he s become such a great player when mcgrady was signed by the magic , he was intent , he said , on proving myself
there was a long period from the mid50 s to the late 60 s when i played every single day , man , said the drummer paul motian over tea a few weeks ago at a cafe not far from his central park west apartment three months at the half note , nine weeks at the vanguard two weeks at birdland , back down to the vanguard every day ! mr motian who , after working with thelonious monk , coleman hawkins and others , spent five years with the pianist bill evans s famous early60 s trio is a 72yearold bandleader now and , by his own admission , tired but his small compact frame , shaved head and sunglasses make him seem a lot younger so does his attitude , more or less with mr motian \( he pronounces it mohshun \) you get the expected gripes of an elder in jazz who s still cutting all his deals himself he feels he does n't attract the volume of work that would require him to trust a manager and you also get the code of beatnik cool , not manqu , but the real thing he does n't care about rehearsing or recording a second take he hates european festival gigs because he does n't like playing to more people than can fit in the village vanguard he quit bill evans s band in 1964 after making the great album sunday at the village vanguard to play with paul bley , because he thought evans s music was getting too commercial \( to me , bill was stuck , he said with a shrug \) he thinks musicians should play however they want to play this is why so many young players have been drawn to him over the years mr motian is involved with a pile of bands he leads one \( the electric bebop band \) , in a curiously nondictatorial way he s an equal member of two more \( the joe lovanobill frisellpaul motian trio and tethered moon \) and he s an ideal sideman for all kinds of others , from obscure to topoftheclass in a recent session , he recorded with the stillunderground young saxophonist bill mchenry just two weeks ago , he made an album with the major figures hank jones and mr lovano at the village vanguard this week , as part of the jvc jazz festival , he will perform with five different bands , from tuesday through saturday , with a sixth show , not part of jvc , added on sunday the most exemplary of these groups , demonstrating mr motian s favorite repertory and an original group sound , is his electric bebop band \( the band will play at the vanguard on friday evening \) the idea for its sound started by chance at a rehearsal 12 years ago , when the guitarists kurt rosenwinkel and mike stern both happened to be playing at mr motian s apartment but the thought to do something different with the old bebopera repertory tunes by bud powell , charlie parker and monk had come to him earlier i was thinking of trying to destroy bebop , he said in an offhandedly perverse way , stifling a laugh i thought it might be fun , because there were none of the original players around anymore to really do it justice so i wanted to get players who ca n't play but it did n't work out that way he ended up with mr rosenwinkel and brad shepik , a couple of technically fluent products of jazzguitar pedagogy and musicians who had studied bebop lines up , down and sideways soon , when the saxophonist chris potter came along to replace joshua redman , the two overlapped for a few days and mr motian liked the sound voila a bebop ensemble with two tenor saxophones , two electric guitars and electric bass and mr motian on drums , keeping his light , efficacious swing , changing the phrasing of the beat in every measure tony malaby , one of the tenor saxophonists in the current lineup of electric bebop \( along with chris cheek \) , bought mr motian s albums as a teenager in arizona since i started playing jazz , i 've been visualizing how to play with paul motian , he said and now that i'm doing it , i see that there s so many layers in there that i can play from his playing is wideopen , and deep , but at the same time it s very dancey it s swinging , it s grooving , but he s always an improviser and it s always relaxed over time , as some of the better musicians to emerge in the last decade of jazz have passed through the band \( the saxophonists mr potter , mr malaby and mr redman and mr cheek , the guitarists mr rosenwinkel and ben monder and steve cardenas \) , the group has sounded central to what jazz is becoming , where it s moving it still draws sustenance from the music that turned mr motian on in the first place but it s music with an enveloping sound , and an odd kind of density it has a defining structure , but allows plenty of improvisation , individually or collectively while he was still a member of bill evans s group , mr motian said , he , evans , and the bassist scott lafaro decided that they wanted to make a music that would n't have a date on it that in the year 2000 people could listen to this music that was being made in 1959 , and it might still sound fresh not that such a thing had n't ever been done before they were just trying to find their own way in to the rhythmic and structural originality that louis armstrong , monk and others had found before them , but find it on their own terms they did , and mr motian has followed that strategy ever since photo paul motian , the venerable jazz drummer , in the lobby of his apartment building he performs six nights this week at the village

tonight at avery fisher hall the national chorale is opening its season with carl orff s carmina burana nothing special about that the national chorale and several other local amateur choruses , not to speak of hundreds or thousands more around the country and world , sing carmina burana most every year o fortuna , as the opening chorus would have it good luck for orff and his heirs except that fortuna does n't refer to good fortune , but to fickle fate and orff s fate has been far more fickle than the seeming success of carmina burana might suggest it s easy to see why this score is so popular a bawdy , romantic evocation of medieval lives and loves , it rewards lusty singing , it pleases audiences and it has cachet as a certified 20thcentury choral masterpiece but cachet in only some quarters orff \( 18951982 \) is not a wellrespected composer connoisseurs think he is derivative of stravinsky in his bawdy \( russian \) medieval phase , especially with les noces , in which stravinsky depicts a traditional russian peasant wedding worse yet for orff s reputation , most people who think about such things assume he was a nazi before carmina burana got so popular in modernday new york , it was vastly popular in late1930 s germany nazi propagandists trumpeted it as a celebration of german folk vitality and hence of the aryan spirit but i come to praise caesar , not to bury him i love orff s music , which ranges far beyond the catchy choruses of carmina burana and modern scholarship has shed new light on orff s politics , which were far more complex than simple stigmatization would have us believe carmina burana was first staged in frankfurt in 1937 , and was violently attacked by the nazi party newspaper , der v lkische beobachter , as degenerate music akin to negro jazz \( which some upperlevel nazis enjoyed avidly in private \) this disapproval did not constitute an outright ban , however , and several notable conductors , among them karl b hm and herbert von karajan , championed the score nazi opinion was hardly unanimous in cultural matters the traditional nationalist conservatism of alfred rosenberg , reflected in the initial carmina burana review , gave way to the more modern trendiness of joseph goebbels the nazis needed composers they could crow about after so many of germany s good ones , jewish and nonjewish , fled the country eventually orff s score began receiving good reviews from the german press , and by 1939 it had attained a popularity equal to the status it now enjoys worldwide orff was not a nazi , although he collaborated with party members and even , egregiously , consented to write new incidental music to a midsummer night s dream after the beloved score by mendelssohn , a jew , was deemed tainted after the war he clearly exaggerated his antinazi activities to american interrogators but politically he seems more guilty of careerism than racial fanaticism \( michael kater , the author and scholar , documented that orff was oneeighth jewish \) the american musicologist kim kowalke has shown that a decade before carmina burana orff used the same vigorous , supposedly aryan musical idiom in settings of leftwing political poems by bertolt brecht and others after the success of carmina burana orff turned out catulli carmina \( 1943 \) and trionfo di afrodite \( 1953 \) , forming a trilogy first performed at the salzburg festival in 1953 neither successor lived up to the popularity of carmina burana , however , and neither is often heard outside of orffcentral , which was the salzburg festival but in recent decades has been his native munich lamentably , more interesting orff compositions are less known , and taken together they suggest a powerful and individual sensibility that easily transcends charges of undue indebtedness to stravinsky there are versions of monteverdi operas and ballets from the 1920 s , and the ravishing school work , composed with gunild keetman , an unapologetic nazi this music is so charming and pedagogically sound that it is still used worldwide today , limited only by the expense of the required instruments , largely xylophones and percussion years ago angel records released a now outofprint album called music for children , consisting of selected school work songs in english it was so lovely that i gave it to all my friends for christmas but orff s heart was on the stage his catalog contains all manner of stage works , oddly none designated as operas some are ambitious and strange , like de temporum fine comoedia , which had its premiere at salzburg in 1973 some are quirkily bavarian , and others are still popular in german opera houses , like der mond \( 1939 \) and die kluge \( 1943 \) orff s libretto for die kluge , composed as things were starting to go seriously wrong for hitler , includes the following lines , sung by clever vagabonds and cited here in william mann s translation fides is struck dead justitia lives in great penury pietas lies on straw humilitas cries blue murder superbia is the winning candidate patientia has lost the battle veritas has flown up to heaven honor and virtue have crossed the sea purity goes abegging tyrannis wields its scepter far and wide invidia has broken loose caritas is naked and bare virtue s been driven out of the country dishonor and wickedness have stayed behind one wonders what the firstnight audience in frankfurt back in 1943 thought of all that for me orff s greatest works are the three settings he made of greek tragedies for chanting opera singers and huge , percussiondominated orchestras antigonae \( 1949 \) and oedipus der tyrann \( 1959 \) were sung in h lderlin s german translations of sophocles prometheus \( 1966 \) was in the ancient greek of aeschylus these were honorable attempts to evoke the actual performance of greek tragedy , which we know to have been sung the tragedies gain awesome power when done this way the cosmic , measured outpourings of the orchestra and the stately chanting of the singers , rising to impassioned cries , are constantly gripping you can hear all this for yourself either in ferenc fricsay s febrile , intense live recording of antigonae from the 1949 salzburg premiere , the microphone placement oddly favoring the singers , or from the orffsupervised studio recording of the same work under ferdinand leitner , which is more balanced when i directed the lincoln center festival , i found a fellow orff enthusiast in kurt masur in the 1990 s the festival was locked into an arrangement with the new york philharmonic mr masur and i wanted to do antigonae , but the strange instrumentation proved intractable most of the philharmonic would have had to be paid for doing nothing antigonae is scored for six pianos and four more played by two people each , 16 mallet instruments , six flutes , six oboes , six trumpets , nine double basses and all manner of exotic percussion , including six large javanese gongs so enjoy yourselves guiltfree , you singers and audience members at tonight s carmina burana at lincoln center it is perfectly legitimate to like this music but if you do like it , you might want to venture further into orff s world the rewards there are great photo carl orff is much more than a single composition \( photo by columbia records \)
you can argue that this has been a good season for broadway musicals after all , five original shows have opened , more than in any other autumn in recent memory , and two of them , avenue q and wicked , appear to be hits the former is expected to recoup its 35 million cost by the onset of the summer , its producers say the latter has been raking in more than 1 million a week lately even though it s an oftrepeated truism that revivals dominate broadway , it is n't currently true of the 22 musicals open now , 16 are original productions there is something misleading about this spin , however , because you ca n't actually argue that this has been a good season for broadway music the three other new shows taboo , the boy from oz and never gonna dance all feature scores written long ago who are the tonynominated composers going to be \? boy george , peter allen and jerome kern \? this is the continuation of a trend in repackaging old tunes for the theater that has been mounting for a couple of decades and includes shows like the already revived ai n't misbehavin' \( featuring the music of fats waller \) , sophisticated ladies \( duke ellington \) , the who s tommy , smoky joe s cafe \( lieber and stoller \) and the current broadway residents mamma mia ! \( abba \) and movin' out \( billy joel \) some of these are worthy shows , but such compendiums and jukebox musicals are beginning to shove aside the book musical with an original score , historically the broadway stock in trade musicals based on the songs of elvis presley and john lennon are expected in seasons shortly to come , and of the 11 currently running musical nonrevivals that have opened on broadway since the fall of 2000 , just 6 have original scores of those thoroughly modern millie is only partly original jeanine tesori s handful of songs are melded with those from the 1967 film on which the show was based the score of the producers , written by mel brooks , consists of serviceable novelty numbers written in generic style and is hardly the selling point of the show marc shaiman s score for hairspray borrows an idiom from the early 1960 s , when the show is set mark holliman s score for urinetown is part homage , part sendup , of kurt weill and stephen schwartz s score for wicked is , well , undistinguished , with a few tuneful songs embedded in anthemic wallpaper that leaves avenue q , with the jaunty and irreverent music by robert lopez and jeff marx , as the only recently opened new musical on broadway with a score that might be described as original and contemporary at the same time there is no shortage of talent the musical theater workshops sponsored by ascap and bmi are thriving the graduate program in music theater writing at the tisch school of the arts at new york university is cranking out graduates and the list of young composers already working in the theater is long and impressive michael john lachiusa , andrew lippa , ricky ian gordon , robert reale , zena goldrich , adam guettel , jason robert brown , david yazbek , polly pen , robert lindsay nassif , tim acito and laurence o'keefe these men and women are working in a dazzling array of styles the lush , cerebral nearopera of mr lachiusa s first lady suite the american folksiness of mr guettel s floyd collins the candyflavored pop of mr acito s zanna , do n't ! the adult balladeering of mr brown s last five years the lavishly comic sendup of traditional show music of mr o'keefe s bat boy the shrewd amalgam of rock 'n' roll and show tunes of the full monty , mr yazbek s first broadway score the alluringly astringent phrasemaking of ms pen s most recent work , embarrassments , the intelligently told story of henry james s failed foray into playwriting , now at the wilma theater in philadelphia some of these writers have been on broadway none are there now why not \? as always with the theater , part of the story is economics with the cost of mounting a musical on broadway often topping 10 million , it s a huge risk to try to sell a new composer , or even a new score by an old hand \( it s significant that avenue q was relatively cheap \) new shows by stephen sondheim \( bounce \) and john kander and fred ebb \( the visit \) have gone unseen in new york apparently they only want to revive us , said mr ebb , the lyricist of shows that include cabaret and chicago but i do n't want to be revived i want to be presented it s enough to make you scratch your head and ask whither broadway music \? a moving target you could spell whither either way , said jack viertel , the artistic director of the encores ! series of musicals in concert at city center there s a real reluctance on the part of producers to take on new composers because to some degree no one is sure what a broadway show is supposed to sound like anymore is it supposed to sound like michael john lachiusa \? or alan menken \? if the broadway sound were the pop music of the day , which it used to be , it would sound like hiphop , but i do n't think anyone feels there s much of a broadway audience for that at the moment
nasa managers grew so complacent about safety that at times inspectors were prevented from performing spot checks , an independent investigator said yesterday brig gen duane deal of the air force , a member of the independent board investigating the shuttle columbia disaster , told the associated press that the program that oversees shuttle inspections within the national aeronautics and space administration would take a pretty big hit in the final report by the board , which is due at the end of august general deal , who has conducted 72 private interviews with nasa workers as part of the investigation , called the inspection program poor , and said that inspectors were prevented from making spot checks and in one case had to buy their own magnifier when the procurement process dragged on for months he said said the decline in inspections over time suggested that some nasa managers were perhaps out of touch with the realities of manned spaceflight and its high level of risk attempts to reach general deal yesterday through the board were not successful but in public briefings , he and other members of the board have spoken extensively about the decline in inspections and the need for nasa to go back to thinking of the shuttle as an experimental vehicle , not an operational craft adm harold w gehman jr , the board s chairman , said at a briefing last week that nasa should not have the expecation that when the thing lands , that you can turn it around and get it back into the air again quickly in a briefing on may 28 , general deal said that the interviews were showing widespread dissatisfaction with the quality assurance programs at nasa we 've interviewed many , many people , from line technicians all the way up through management , and none of them out there agree that we 're at the 100 percent point , he said it s time for a relook during that briefing , general deal said that the number of mandatory inspection points on the shuttle had dropped to around 8 , 500 from more than 40 , 000 he said the board interviewers had encouraged nasa safety workers to talk about general issues as well as specific ones along with the questions about whether they have the budget and the people to do the job well , he said , we ask what i commonly call the 'king for a day' or 'queen for a day' question 'if you were in charge of all of nasa , what s been gnawing at you \? what would you change if we gave you the right budget \?

washington , feb 18 it began as a modest idea a series of small seminars by democratic party lawyers for elected officials , political consultants and congressional aides on the intricacies of the new mccainfeingold campaign finance law party officials reserved a dining room at the democratic club on capitol hill and sent out invitations across washington by the end of last week , that lowkey undertaking had drawn more than 400 people over the course of a month , a turnout that has astonished its organizers the crowd came first for a threehour introductory course on a statute that is upending the fundraising culture of washington , and many have returned for specialized weekly threehour classes at what has become known , none too fondly , as mccainfeingold school we sometimes leave our audiences in a state of complete shock at what they hear , said robert f bauer , a lawyer for the democrats' house and senate campaign committees a sort of slackjawed amazement at how far this thing reached is not uncommon at the seminars , mr bauer said nor are a lot of very anxious questions benjamin l ginsberg , a republican party lawyer who has conducted seminars for the other side of the aisle , said lawmakers were startled to hear that oncestandard practices like acting as host at a fundraiser for a homestate governor might now be illegal there s an initial stage where the reaction is , 'this ca n't be true , ' mr ginsberg said and then there s the actual anger stage the chief provision of mccainfeingold was a ban on the national parties' raising of soft money , the large , littleregulated contributions that were supposed to encourage general partybuilding activities but as a practical matter had become the chief method of raising millions from the wealthy during the campaign season most of the party lawyers and fundraising officials now explaining the new law were never fans of it to begin with adjusting to the measure s detailed workings , however , has proved bewildering and anxietyproducing even among those who supported it as members of congress begin refilling their coffers for 2004 , the law s full effect is just beginning to sink in the law , being challenged as unconstitutional by dozens of groups spanning the political spectrum , has already had sobering financial consequences for the democrats , who , it is becoming clear , have been put at a decided fundraising disadvantage by a measure that many of them championed with federal candidates and national party committees now barred from raising soft money , they have been forced to finance their activities from the contributions of hardmoney donors , who are limited to 2 , 000 per candidate in any one election softmoney contributions were previously the main source of financing for the national democratic party , which roughly kept pace with the republicans in collecting them by contrast , republicans last year raised nearly twice as much hard money as the democrats , evidence of a much broader base of contributors that democrats believe has put the republicans in a dominant fundraising position as the 2004 presidential and congressional races approach while campaign experts had predicted that the republicans would have an advantage , the gap has been even wider than expected the new chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee , representative robert t matsui of california , who voted for mccainfeingold , says he has been surprised by its fine print i did n't realize what all was in it , mr matsui said we have cautioned members 'you have to really understand this law and if you have any ambiguity , err on the side of caution' one of the legislation s authors , senator john mccain , republican of arizona , dismisses the newly voiced concerns as overblown , maintaining that the main sources of criticism are lawyers and lawmakers who opposed the bill he disputes the suggestion that lawyers and members of congress are now discovering fine print they were not aware of when the measure was enacted last year those who support the law generally speaking are n't complaining , mr mccain said those that opposed it are complaining and these same people are trying to find ways around the law they are having difficulty doing so , so they complain even more yet the law does impose a vast array of unfamiliar and in some cases still evolving restrictions on both parties for example , members of congress have been informed that while they can attend annual state party dinners back home , they cannot permit their names to appear on the invitation as members of the host committee , since most state parties are permitted to raise money in excess of the 2 , 000 hardmoney limit embodied in the federal law and , while the lawmakers are allowed at least to show up , socialize and speak at those state party dinners , the law may be less forgiving when it comes to their attendance at breadandbutter fundraisers held by candidates running for state and local office some party lawyers have concluded that a member of congress can attend and even speak at a fundraising dinner for a local politician , but others argue that the question is open to interpretation involving everything from what the candidate says to the maximum level of contributions at the dinner
baghdad , iraq , may 18 maj gen hameed othman , a man who loves poetry and landscape painting , ran the national police force in iraq from 1997 to 2001 he is the kind of highranking baath party stalwart whose views are creating anxiety for the united states and its allies he holds no current office , but since he once commanded the 80 , 000member national police force , he is a man of influence with a certain following after 35 years of police work he speaks in respectful tones about president saddam hussein , and he refuses to say whether he would arrest him or salute him if he ran into the toppled leader on the street of the mass graves being unearthed around the country , he says they are the inevitable result of the purification campaign mounted by the iraqi military to put down a rebellion against the legitimate authority in the country if a person raises arms against the government , what i am supposed to do salute him or meet him with the same force of arms \? he said he chuckles dismissively at the notion that a slaughter of innocents seeking to overthrow tyranny took place in iraq in 1991 reports that mr hussein s secret police killed hundreds of thousands of iraqis in secret executions over decades is all talk to general othman still , he explained , if a command came from the regime to fulfill a certain order , then no one can say no , adding , the nature of police work is that you execute orders , but the leadership is responsible for decisions a morning in the general s parlor shows that despite the american and british forces' quick victory over mr hussein s armed forces , the mind of the ruling baath party is still alive in the general s view , the united states and its allies have destroyed iraq s institutions , wrecked law and order and stood by while iraq s heritage was looted from the national museum this is the worst case of destruction in iraq since the time of the mongols , he said everything has been destroyed and iraqis , including myself , feel that coalition forces bear the responsibility for it these views epitomize one side of the psychological battle over blame that is under way in iraq today , and explain why the new american civil administrator in iraq , l paul bremer iii , moved swiftly in his first week here to ban up to 30 , 000 former baath party officials from public office in the postwar period as american and british leaders race to restore security , electricity , water and wages , they find themselves countering a groundswell of frustration and resentment whether it is the beginning of a backlash against president bush s liberation of iraq is too early to tell and too difficult to measure , most experts agree but as summer temperatures soar , a kind of simmering anger is palpable on the streets of the capital some iraqis , especially those previously associated with the baath party , are shifting as much responsibility as they can to the bush administration and its allies today in baghdad , as one group of demonstrators was pulling down the statue of ahmad hassan albakr , the baath party leader who preceded mr hussein as president , another group confronted them shouting that they were wasting their time when workers had no wages and homes had no electricity there is a threat of the baath party trying to come back , said a senior western official administering reconstruction efforts here that is part of the reason , the official said , for a tough policy and for making the road as difficult as possible for a comeback the official added , without specifying , that other measures would be taken to block a baath resurgence if the ban from office proves insufficient american officials say there is no evidence yet that the baath party is trying to reorganize itself , but as a conversation with general othman and some of his former baath colleagues shows , the party s philosophy , its instinct for selfpreservation , and its hostility to foreign intervention exist in the voices of its members , who represent a huge and potentially influential network in postwar iraq the arab socialist baath party has long experience in working underground and in secret , the official said , offering this as an explanation for some of the things he does not know or ca n't tell about whether the baath might be trying to come back some baathists , including general othman , are already speaking the language of democracy , perhaps because they see the ballot box as a means back to power what seems to unite them is their unwillingness to criticize mr hussein , who like osama bin laden is rapidly becoming a legend for the stealth and evasion he has apparently used in eluding capture saddam hussein is part of this country s long history and it is not easy to wipe him out of the iraqi memory , especially as the news is spreading that he is still traveling around iraq , the general said , declining to pass judgment on iraq s sacking of kuwait in 1990 and 1991 prof miklif h m aldulaimi , vice president of baghdad university , was among the baathist administrators whom student and faculty groups that called elections this weekend want to eject from the university the previous regime had both positive and negative aspects and we have now accepted the new situation in the country , he said in a recent interview there are rights for citizens he added that he believed that some of the negative aspects of mr hussein s rule were exaggerated but then he none too subtlely turned the logic of liberation against the americans and british one of these rights is salaries and this is the second month that the staff has not been paid , he continued every day we hear about democracy , but we hear nothing about bread both general othman and professor dulaimi also had what they said was sincere and truthful advice for the americans work with the previous government in order to facilitate the transition , professor dulaimi said , adding that his advice was pure and came from an academic with no ulterior motive i say that not out of a desire to remain seated in this chair , but in order to save what can be saved , he said what also seems to unite the baathists , even highranking ones , is their desire to portray their membership as incidental , or mandatory because of the field they were in you cannot enter the police academy without being nominated by the baath party , general othman said the whole work force in iraq is arranged by the baath professor dulaimi asserted that during his tenure at the university , he could not remember an instance when a professor was removed for political reasons when he was reminded that prof hilal albayyati , director of the national computer center , was arrested , tortured and imprisoned without trial in 2000 on unsupported charges that he was a spy for the united states and israel , professor dulaimi admitted that he had failed to mention the case asked why , he responded , i swear to god i do n't know crossing his legs , he returned to the tone of a soothing friend , giving reassurance that whatever bad happened was in the past i am not defending the baath , he said , i am defending the sector i was in the field of higher education general othman said he was defending police work , which remains constant in its service of the people , he said , no matter who is in power photos maj gen hammeed othman , who ran iraq s national police force for four years , still speaks respectfully of president saddam hussein \( tyler hicks the new york times \) demonstrators toppled a statue of ahmad hassan albakr , the baath leader who preceded saddam hussein as president , in baghdad yesterday \( ruth fremson the new york times \)
for birdwatchers in new york city , winter is a slow time sure , if you 're willing to endure the cold , you can see tufted titmice and blackcapped chickadees clinging to bare branches in the parks or a few ducks bobbing along the shoreline but what about those dark , dreary days when the birds themselves go into hiding \? mark dion , an artist and avid birder , has found a way to beat the winter doldrums he birdwatches at the metropolitan museum of art he got the idea a few years ago when he went to central park to do a little coldweather birding , got caught in the rain and ended up taking shelter in the museum as he walked soaking wet through the galleries , he paused to look at goya s don manuel osorio manrique de zuniga and noticed a blackandwhite bird in the foreground his birding instincts kicked in , and he identified it as a magpie , a species of european crow since then , he has encountered many avian species at the met mute swans floating through panels of tiffany glass , vultures skulking on egyptian urns and raptors in renaissance paintings mr dion was particularly delighted by these sightings because he frequently uses bird themes in his own artwork for example , since 1993 he s created several sculptural works in a series called library for the birds in these installations , the branches of real trees , brought indoors , are festooned with books that birds would find useful if they could read these include field guides , histories of hunting , and biographies of naturalists like john james audubon and rachel carson for one such piece , he persuaded the museum of contemporary art of antwerp to let 18 of his putative readers \( live african finches \) fly free around the gallery i like to sensitize people to the ornithological , mr dion explained recently , we asked mr dion if we might accompany him on one of his indoor birdwatching trips , and he was happy to oblige on the day we met , it was drizzling an icy rain the three of us wore hiking boots and hooded barn jackets , the pockets of which were stuffed with pads , pencils and various bird guides our binoculars were slung around our necks as we clomped into the museum s highceilinged , marble lobby , mr dion set the parameters for our expedition find as many bird species as possible time limit four hours the met has more than two million artworks in its collections and miles and miles of public corridors even if you 're just planning to look at art like a normal person , it s hard to know where to begin mr dion suggested we start with the american wing we should be able to recognize more birds there , since it s our native habitat , he reasoned on the way there we started our search , eyes darting over rare and ancient objects , from a massive byzantine sarcophagus to a set of tiny gold coins minted in the fourth century ad passing through the dimly lighted medieval galleries , we sighted our first pair of wings , taking flight on a 15thcentury wool tapestry a closer look revealed they did n't belong to a bird but a winged angel , hovering protectively over a scene of the annunciation tricky a gold eagle despite this false start , we soon made our first avian identification taking a right at a baroque choir screen , we found ourselves entering the skylit , airy garden court of the american wing , with its glass wall overlooking central park as if in an aviary , we saw a largerthanlife gold eagle , flying with wings outstretched , its giant beak agape a little id card stated that the eagle was carved from white pine by william rush for a church in philadelphia in 1809 we agreed that the eagle belonged to the subfamily buteoninae , but could n't decide whether it was supposed to be a golden eagle \( aquila chrysaetos \) or a bald eagle \( haliaeetus leucocephalus \) clearly , identifying species was going to be a challenge in an environment where the linnean system took a back seat to artistic whims delving farther into the galleries , we were inundated by images of our national bird there was an inlaid bald eagle on the face of a pendulum clock manufactured when jefferson was president , a wooden bald eagle in a picture frame surrounding a painting of george washington , and a castiron bald eagle on top of a federalperiod stove as we began poring over american decorative art , mr dion exhibited an uncanny ability to find birds he discovered a wild turkey appliqu d on a folkart coverlet dated 1850 , a european stork on a fin de si cle umbrella stand , a great blue heron carved into a chippendale highboy , and a baltimore oriole embroidered on the back of a colonial easy chair he also located numerous birds of unspecified species geese , swans , owls and ducks in glass , wood , pottery and textiles when we moved on to twodimensional works , we found a painting entitled hummingbird and passionflowers at the back of a period room labeled renaissance revival parlor mr dion immediately recognized it as a piece by martin johnson heade , who , like himself , was an amateur naturalist heade spent years in south and central america , and he was practically obsessed with hummingbirds , mr dion said
new delhi , feb 12 nearly two years ago , tehelka , which means sensation in hindi , caused one nine months after its founding , the news web site burst forth with videotape showing politicians , bureaucrats , military officers and middlemen seeking and taking bribes from arms dealers the dealers were in fact undercover tehelka journalists , pretending to peddle thermal imaging binoculars the furor after four and a half hours of the tapes were televised was immediate the coalition government briefly seemed to totter and the defense minister , george fernandes , whose party leader was shown accepting funds , resigned now , far from their bringing the government down , the journalists say the government is bringing them down none of the officials pictured on the tapes have been prosecuted but tehelka s main investor spent two and a half months in jail , and has watched his business shrink to almost nothing one of the web site s journalists , kumar badal , was granted bail last month , by supreme court order , after six months in jail the government s central bureau of investigation accused him of hiring poachers to kill leopards so that it could be recorded on film a charge he and tehelka s editors deny there are defamation cases pending against the editors and reporters , income tax investigations , official secrets act cases , and more their offices have been searched , their accountants kept busy one editor , aniruddha bahal , sold a novel , bunker 13 , to farrar , straus giroux and the british publishing house faber faber , and was promptly accused by a government lawyer of receiving illegal gains as a result , tehelkacom , which at its peak employed 125 people , is now down to 3 it no longer has a salaried journalist unable to pay office rent , it has moved to a tworoom space , and its web site articles , once sprightly , are now mostly stale tehelka s founder , tarun tejpal , said he had been unable to get a rupee of new investment he and the other editors have gone into debt he said they spent a third of their time dealing with the endless legal fallout , a third of their time fighting what they call a propaganda war and a third hunting for money last month , tehelka found a champion in the writer and nobel laureate v s naipaul , who has sat on the web site s board since its founding he held his first news conference in 40 years of visiting india to express his concern at the government s handling of the case he also met with the deputy prime minister , l k advani , who is also home minister , to press tehelka s case this thing that has happened to tehelka has been profoundly disappointing to me , he said it comes from another era it serves no purpose it seems to me it will profoundly damage the country neither mr advani nor the home secretary s office responded to a request for comment mr tejpal speculates that part of the government s reaction may stem from coalition politics mr fernandes is back as defense minister , and his samata party is a small but essential coalition member the targets of the videotaped sting , such as jaya jaitley , the former leader of the samata party , who was shown accepting funds on tape , have seized on the journalists' tactics among other things , they procured prostitutes for army officers as part of their sham but mr tejpal said the scrutiny of their methods was unparalleled and unwarranted no story in the history of world journalism has been through this , mr tejpal said

bridgeport , conn , jan 24 icy road conditions and the failure of a milelong string of highway lights were crucial factors in a chainreaction crash last week on interstate 95 in fairfield , conn , that killed four yale students , federal and state investigators said today at a news conference here , david s rayburn , the lead investigator for the national transportation safety board , said a preliminary inquiry suggested that the lighting failure and slick roadway were a deadly combination on a curved portion of highway where numerous fatal accidents have occurred in recent years it was very dark and it was difficult to see , mr rayburn said it was difficult to see the weather conditions he said initial toxicology results indicated that none of the four drivers in the crash were impaired by alcohol or drugs none of the vehicles had been traveling at excessive speed , he said mr rayburn said at least some of the lights had been knocked out by a construction mishap on a nearby bridge about three hours before the accident ordered to stop work because of the bad weather , a construction crew accidentally knocked over a light pole while trying to stow an excavator the fatal crash occurred shortly after 5 am on jan 17 it began when a truck driver traveling north lost control of his tractortrailer , which jackknifed , crashing over the median and into the southbound lanes , where it was hit by another tractortrailer and a dodge avenger a portion of the trailer remained jutting into the left northbound lane ten minutes later , with the highway lights out and snow falling , a chevy tahoe sport utility vehicle carrying nine yale students back to new haven from a fraternity outing in manhattan slammed into the steel flatbed trailer the accident happened near exit 24 , in an area where a taller concrete median is being installed but officials said even the new median probably could not have prevented the truck from crashing over the barrier mr rayburn said that investigators had interviewed armando salgado , 33 , the truck driver who first lost control , for three hours mr salgado , who was driving a rig for arrow trucking of tulsa , okla , reported that he skidded on black ice while traveling about 50 miles per hour the second tractor trailer in the accident had been traveling at 59 mph , mr rayburn said and data from the chevy tahoe s airbag system indicated it also had not traveled excessively fast the factual evaluation indicates that the tahoe was not grossly exceeding the speed limit , mr rayburn said the posted limit in the area was 45 mph because of the nearby construction there have been a lot of rumors that the students were flying at grossly excessive speeds , mr rayburn said , dismissing them the excessive damage to the vehicle was the result of the vehicle striking a steel structure with its softer components but the suv was overcrowded it was designed to carry five passengers , mr rayburn said , but nine were crammed in it remains unclear , however , whether the crowding aggravated the injuries most of the students were asleep at the time of the crash , mr rayburn said the driver of the suv , sean r fenton , 20 , and his frontseat passenger , both of whom died , had been wearing their seat belts , mr rayburn said , as had the two truck drivers mr rayburn said the log from mr salgado s truck showed that he got seven hours of sleep not long before the accident mr salgado s company , arrow trucking , had a good safety record , 036 accidents per million miles , mr rayburn said a rate of up to 15 accidents per million miles is considered satisfactory , he said the state police and the safety board , which sent a team of nine field investigators to connecticut , said that it would take three to four months before the inquiry was completed officials said the malfunctioning lights may have been a factor in another accident about an hour before the fatal crash state police noted in a report filed just after that accident that the lights were out , but it was unclear whether the state department of transportation took immediate note of the problem construction crews restored the lights later that morning sgt paul vance , a spokesman for the state police , said troopers routinely notify the transportation department about such problems but mr rayburn said the protocol for addressing light failures was unclear robert b adelman , a lawyer hired by mr fenton s family , said the initial investigation showed mr fenton had done no wrong he was the designated driver he was not drinking , mr adelman said the lights were out on the trailer the lights were out on the road
oxford , england tonight is halloween , all hallows' eve , a time of ghosts and spirits walking by night which leads me naturally to think about literary realism , and about politics how can you write in a truthful and realistic way about something that does n't exist \? i do n't take much notice of critics , except when they praise me extravagantly but one of the remarks they sometimes make about my work does coincide with a mild puzzlement i feel about it myself in common with some other writers whose work is read by children , i am chided for writing fantasy , because fantasy is a lesser form than realism , and everyone knows that there are no such things as elves or hobbits or , for that matter , ghosts and disembodied spirits , so nothing interesting or truthful can be said about them my usual response to that is to deny that i'm writing fantasy at all , and to maintain that all my work is stark realism but that implicitly accepts the basic stance of the critic that fantasy is a lesser kind of thing , and that realism is the highest form of literary art and there may be something in that for example , take ghost stories i do n't believe in ghosts and disembodied spirits i used to believe in them , and i can remember how thrilling it was , when i was a child , to read ghost stories with the thought , this could be true , this could really happen but that was a long time ago i do n't enjoy ghost stories in quite the same way these days the trouble is that such tales have to convince you on the supernatural level as well as on the mundane part of your mind has to believe that there could be a disembodied spirit full of malice haunting this old house , there could be a nameless evil presence lurking in the crypt and there just could n't disbelief , at that point , is just too heavy to suspend the ghost stories i still enjoy , like the turn of the screw by henry james , work because of their ambiguity we 're never really sure whether the evil presences are being imagined by the protagonist , so we can read the story as if it s a tale of psychological disturbance , and it makes enough sense that way i do believe , however , in disturbing places there are houses that feel as if they 're haunted three years ago i slept \( or tried to \) in a hotel room in glasgow that was one of the most creepy places i 've ever been in but i am also persuaded by an explanation that has nothing to do with ghosts certain subliminal sounds or visual stimuli the hum of an airconditioner , the flicker of a fluorescent light can resonate at the exact frequency that causes hallucinatory images to appear in the brain , or that induces feelings of panic or unease replace the neon tube , tighten the screws on the housing , and the haunting ceases as if by exorcism so there ai n't no ghosts the trouble is the trouble is that for a writer of fiction \( well , for me , anyway \) expunging the uncanny is n't always a good thing the rational , daylight , functional , getaboutanddothings part of my mind welcomes the broom of reason as it sweeps away the cobwebs of spookery but i do n't write with that part of my mind , and the part that does the writing does n't like the place cleaned up and freshly painted and brightly lit my daylight mind , the conscious and responsible me , might want to write stories about people who seem entirely real in situations that seem utterly plausible i might want to explore family relationships or moral dilemmas or social problems or political questions that are entirely free of the fantastic , the ghostly , the uncanny as a matter of fact , i do want to books like that are the sort i like to read things like that are the things i think important so i want to write stories about subjects like that that is to say , my will wants to but my imagination does n't when i try , it s like trying to light a fire with damp wood nothing catches making the will do the work of the imagination is a wearisome and melancholy task , and it would drive you mad with despair in no time if you let it and there s no need to , after all when there is dry tinder nearby , and when the spark of your imagination leaps toward it like a lover , you can have a fine blaze roaring in a moment , if a blaze is what you want so i came to the conclusion some time ago that imagination and reason were two powers that did n't always agree , and that the one who had sovereignty was the imagination there s nothing democratic about what goes on in this business everything about the act of writing fiction is an exercise of absolute and despotic power there s no point in deploring this , or wishing it were all nicer and kinder , or gentle and caring and inclusive it s a tyranny , and that s that however , none of this is to say that we have to abandon every other faculty just because we 've ceded dominance to one in fact , we must n't if we do n't bring everything we have to the task of writing a story , there s a psychological cost we feel that it s a fundamentally trivial and worthless occupation , and we despise ourselves for wasting our efforts on something so contemptible
most new yorkers , including most transit workers , were relieved on dec 16 at word that a tentative agreement had been reached between the metropolitan transportation authority and local 100 of the transport workers union none of us , whether we work on the buses and subways or simply ride them , were eager for the hardships that a strike would cause for many transit workers , however , the relief at not being on strike turned to anger on learning the terms of the agreement furthermore , the new era of cooperation between the mta and the union touted by the local 100 president , roger toussaint , and the authority s chairman , peter s kalikow is seen as a dangerous fantasy as a result , the contract is facing considerable opposition , with many officers and members urging fellow transit workers to reject the proposal and send the union s negotiating team back to the bargaining table while those of us who oppose the agreement recognize that there are important gains in it like prescription drug coverage for retirees who have not reached the age threshold for medicare and improvements in the use of sick time we are convinced that we are being asked to give up too much in return we are , for example , being asked to give up our protection against layoffs how could we even consider this when the mta has , in the past , threatened to eliminate positions for cleaners , mechanics and security personnel \? preserving these union jobs is essential for our members , who depend on them to feed and house their families but it is also important for new york to ensure that decent jobs with union wages and benefits remain available in our communities we are being asked to accept the merger of the city s two public bus systems with major concessions from one system and no details on how the two will be put together we are not opposed to more efficient bus service but unresolved work rules and practices are decided unilaterally by management given the authority s recent record of cutting bus service and its demand to end the protection against layoffs , we are concerned about the mta s plans we are being asked to accept a wage freeze in the first year of the contract instead of a raise , we are offered a onetime payment of 1 , 000 , in recognition of substantial past productivity of the work force but does n't that productivity deserve to be rewarded by a real raise \? as for the new era of cooperation between the union and the authority , is the mta cooperating when it refuses to open its books to show how a surplus in the fall of 2002 turned into a projected deficit \? is it cooperating when it insists on eliminating our protection against layoffs \? is it cooperating when it refuses to take seriously the union s proposals for preserving the 150 subway and bus fare \? the mta needs to be more willing to cooperate on these issues before we can consider accepting this contract experience has taught many of us that when union leaders start thinking that their job is to cooperate with management , the union and its members suffer the members of local 100 voted in a new set of officers in 2000 largely because they were tired of leaders who demonstrated their willingness to bow to the mta , the mayor and the governor by giving away the hardwon benefits and rights of transit workers they will elect new officers again , if necessary as the city s budget is cut and programs are slashed , working people throughout new york will learn that they have to struggle to hold onto what they 've got an important step will be for transit workers to refuse to surrender the protections and benefits we have earned i urge my union brothers and sisters to reject the proposed agreement and send their officers back to the bargaining table as a necessary step in our continuing struggle for a just contract
when the fourth book in the wildly popular harry potter series went on sale three years ago , children , parents and bookstore clerks contrived homemade robes , glasses and wizard hats to dress for the occasion this time , merchandisers are leaving nothing to the imagination when the next installment , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , goes on sale midnight friday , fans can buy officially licensed paraphernalia like a harry potter robe with builtin fiber optic lights , \( 5599 \) , a batterypowered magic wand with flashing lights and sound effects \( 1299 \) and foreheadscar makeup \( 749 \) j k rowling , the author of the series , has often said she wanted to protect her stories from becoming encrusted with marketing pitches and merchandising plugs , but she may have finally lost the battle her fifth novel is the first to arrive since warner brothers began making harry potter movies and selling the licensing rights out of deference to ms rowling , the licensing agreements try to block toy or candy companies from tying their products directly to the books but retailers are capitalizing on the anticipation of the new novel to push everything from harry potter video games to bubble bath officially under wraps until the day of release , the new book is setting off an unprecedented marketing melee walmart and toys r us will stack copies of the book alongside piles of dvd s , legos , action figures , candy and stuffed toys bookstores large and small are defending their turf with elaborate spectacles , including a miniature golf course , a human chess game , a functioning railroad train and carnivorous plants , owls , rats and lizards other publishers are hoping to ride harry potter s coattails , with one even pushing a marxist critique of the marketing of harry potter scholastic , which publishes the harry potter books in the united states , says it expects early sales of the new book to double the recordbreaking sales of the last one , even though it is nearly 900 pages long and has a 2999 cover price judy corman , a company spokeswoman , said it planned two initial printings totaling 85 million hardcover copies of order of the phoenix , compared with an initial printing of 38 million for the previous volume , harry potter and the goblet of fire \( there are 115 million hardcover copies of goblet of fire in print , at about 760 pages with a 2595 cover price \) the movies now account for much of the growth in the already extraordinary popularity of the books barbara marcus , president of children s books at scholastic , said that more than half of the 80 million harry potter books in print in the united states were sold in the last three years , when film versions of the first two books were released the biggest jump , she said , came with the release of the first film , harry potter and the sorcerer s stone in our world , not everyone is a reader first , she said there are people who go to movies and then realize there is a book although ms rowling knowingly sold the film and merchandising rights to warner brothers , a unit of aol time warner , she has often worried aloud that movies and merchandising might overshadow or cheapen her stories i would do anything to prevent harry from turning up in fastfood boxes everywhere , she said in an interview three years ago i would do my utmost that would be my worst nightmare \( he is not in fastfood boxes yet , but he is in cocacola ads \) even some young fans now roll their eyes at the flood of harry potter products , from lunch boxes to souvenir stones none of the kids are crazy about it , said emma bradford , 9 , of brattleboro , vt some people say how stupid it is that they are coming out with harry potter toothbrushes and things like that i think they should just stop with the books and movies , otherwise it just goes sort of overboard into a more disney thing diane nelson , the senior vice president of warner brothers in charge of marketing for harry potter , said the studio would deliberately lay low during the book s publication primarily out of respect for jo rowling s wishes to keep the movies and the books separate so that the books can be appreciated for their own integrity for example , the toy makers mattel , hasbro and lego encourage stores to promote their products along with dvd s of the harry potter films by including coupons for the toys or by displaying them together , but agreements with warner brothers preclude any coupons or toy promotions tied directly to the books still , that does not stop retailers from doing anything they can to sell harry potter knickknacks and candy along with each book discounters , toy stores and retailers that do not specialize in books now account for the majority of sales of many blockbusters like harry potter chains like walmart , as well as the major bookstore chains and online stores , all plan to sell the new book at discounts of as much as 40 percent off the cover price nearly the same as the wholesale cost in part because they hope to sell shoppers other goods and almost all will be displaying the new books surrounded by potter paraphernalia
after once owning shares in 18 companies , james keener , a 43yearold veterinarian from geneseo , ill , sold the last two of those holdings a few weeks ago these days , his money is in mutual funds dr keener used to watch the nightly business report on public television and do his own stock research now he watches the local news and leaves the details to his financial planner i think it s pretty darn hard for the little person , he said if enron crashes and a lot of people in wall street did n't see that coming , how is an individual investor supposed to know \? compared with the body blows that individual investors like dr keener have absorbed over the last three years , the 14 billion that 10 wall street firms agreed to pay this week for their role in the stock market bubble may be a slap on the wrist some financial experts say that the 7 trillion in stock market losses since the broad averages peaked in march 2000 have long since taught investors not to rely on the judgment of wall street analysts others say that hope s inclination to spring eternal means that for each newly cautious dr keener , there is an investor ready as ever to jump at the hint of a big market score either way , experts doubt that some of the new practices mandated by the wall street settlement like the requirement that brokerage firms make independent stock research available to customers will matter much to small investors i'm not sure , after all the dirty laundry was hung out , how much retail investors are looking at investment bank research anymore , said kei kianpoor , the chief executive of investarscom , an independent research firm that tracks analysts' stock picks burton g malkiel , the princeton economist whose widely read book , a random walk down wall street , argues that individual investors cannot expect to beat the market , said that he hoped the settlement would nurse a healthy distrust of most research by the time an individual investor gets information , whether it s tainted or not , it s already in the market price , he said there is some evidence that investors have a newfound interest in independent thinking about stocks for example , subscriptions to the research services of value line , well regarded by financial planners for its independent analysis , are up , even from the marketpeak days of early 2000 a charles schwab survey of active stockholders , to be released later this spring , found that 78 percent valued research from independent firms over analysis by wall street firms with financial ties to the companies they are rating yet it is harder to gauge how much interest investors have in following any of this advice it s still true that most individual investors do n't rely heavily on analysts , said jay r ritter , a professor at the university of florida who specializes in behavioral finance the most common is from friends , acquaintances and word of mouth some experts said that there is no evidence investors' behavior has been changed by the exposure of corporate and wall street wrongdoing americans have remarkably poor longterm memories , said lawrence e mitchell , a george washington university law professor whose books include one on corporate scandals i believe when the economy comes back and the market starts to rise again , as it inevitably will , people will jump right back in will they be more careful investors \? i kind of doubt it careful investing takes work a continuing study by the yale school of management that tracks investor confidence in stocks suggests a blithe spirit prevails , despite market losses more than 90 percent of those surveyed said that they believed that the market would rise in the next year , a level of support that has hardly changed in two years harold evensky , a financial planner in coral gables , fla , said he was surprised that none of his clients had called to discuss the wall street settlement , but he guessed that for many investors , it merely reinforced the downturn s harsh lessons investors have learned that it s not so easy , he said that there probably are no gurus that investing does indeed involve risk mr evensky said that while some people had abandoned the stock market , more seemed chastened but still eager to get back in these individual investors readily acknowledged their part in pumping up the market what he described as an aggressive na vet after all , he said , the market s boom and bust were fueled on investors who were willing to disconnect from what common sense told them was reality terrance odean , an assistant professor of finance at the university of california at berkeley , recalled that four years ago , when investors were riding high , his criticisms of executive compensation failed to resonate among business school students now sentiment has changed , he said , expressing his conviction that investors who have ridden the market down will not want to repeat the experience i 'll be surprised if we get another spate of the intensive speculation that we got in the late 1990 s in the near future , mr odean said you need more new investors to come of age , because there were a lot of people who really got their fingers burned it s going to be some years before you 'll have some significant fraction of investors who have never experienced a bear market dr keener , the illinois veterinarian , said he had become a more cautious investor and believed that other people had , too then again , he conceded , investors probably could help inflate another bubble under the right circumstances i hope they wait until another five years , he said , explaining that he would like the chance to ride the runup the way he had with an internet stock or two in the late 1990 s and then i 'll retire photo james keener , a veterinarian , once researched his investments but now leaves the details to a financial planner because it s pretty darn hard for the little person \( todd mizener for the new york times \)

at the end maybe of the central park jogger case , the clash between the police and prosecutors boils down to a single question who started the attack \? did a lone predator , matias reyes , strike the victim , drag her from a road in the park and then rape her entirely by himself , or did a gang of teenagers actually begin an assault that mr reyes brutally finished \? that question may never be answered to universal satisfaction , given the fiercely contrary positions of the police and prosecutors by now , many people who are worn out or bewildered by the dispute are taking shelter in the allpurpose conversationending declaration that no one will ever know what really happened maybe that is true , but a littlenoted documentary record does exist of the very first moments of the attack the impressions captured in soft grassy ground cover , just off the spot on the road where the jogger was first knocked down from the road , she was dragged across that ground cover into the seclusion afforded by the spindly trees of early spring about nine hours after the attack , as part of a meticulously documented effort , a crime scene detective measured and photographed those drag marks his work showed a skinny trail , 40 feet long and about 16 to 18 inches wide \( that is slightly wider than a single page of this newspaper , which is just over 13 inches \) at a trial in 1990 , the detective , robert honeyman , was asked if there were any disturbances outside the drag marks yes , the detective said , indicating an area to the right that was caused by us walking back and forth down the path of drag marks , someone or several someones pulled the 105pound jogger the narrow trail in the grass marks a moment in the crime , and in the view of prosecutors , stands for a moment of truth but to a special police panel that reexamined the case , the trail reveals nothing particularly important the trail can be seen as the spine of an angry debate between the police and prosecutors over what actually happened on the evening of april 19 , 1989 , and the fundamentally different ways they have tried to answer questions about the case beyond the matter of whether one attacker or many were involved at the beginning of the assault , the police and the prosecutors do not agree that anything useful can be learned by comparing the statements of the suspects with physical details of the crime to prosecutors , the path appears to be more consistent with a single attacker dragging an inert form than with a group , nancy ryan , the chief of trials in the manhattan district attorney s office , wrote in a court filing in that analysis , then , the physical evidence conforms with mr reyes s account that he was the lone attacker the police panel has another theory entirely in a version described last week , at least five teenage boys began a frenzied attack on the road and then dragged the jogger into the woods , where mr reyes either joined or followed them the panel argues that nothing in mr reyes s account can be corroborated , and that since he is the author of many monstrous crimes , he should not be believed the narrow dragging path is not dealt with in any fashion in the police report , which offers no explanation of how a group of five or more unregimented teenagers could have hauled the victim from the road into the woods without leaving more of a trail the ground cover was pliant enough that night to show not only drag marks from the victim s body , but also footprints from detectives we focused on that at one point , and then we did n't follow it up , said michael f armstrong , a private lawyer and a former prosecutor , who served on the panel at the request of police commissioner raymond w kelly if it s wide enough for one person to drag a body , and the others followed behind , so what \? we did n't bother to address it , because it did n't seem to be a major point ye gods , we 're not sherlock holmes if the other people pranced along beside , or followed in the path , you would n't have any drag marks mr armstrong added , to say that it was only one person , i just do n't see it after the prosecutors said in december that the slender path was significant , the original crime scene detective was interviewed for the police inquiry according to mr armstrong , the detective said he had seen other signs of disturbance on the ground , including evidence of several different types of footwear suggesting that there was evidence of many people moving along that ground these marks , however , were not documented in the detective s crime scene report , and were not mentioned during the portions of his 1990 trial testimony that deal directly with disturbed ground a detailed review of the final reports shows that the police and prosecutors disagree on nearly every aspect of the case the credibility of mr reyes s account , the plausibility of the original confessions , the sequence of events and the meaning of laboratory tests conducted this year the disputes border on metaphysical each side puts different weight on issues of time and space , on the importance of knowing when and where the attack took place

everything changed for the mets when they traded for mike piazza during the 1998 season piazza almost singlehandedly transformed the mets from a backwater franchise into a contender the mets made the playoffs in 1999 and the world series the next year but the mets missed the playoffs the past two years and fired their manager , bobby valentine now , with a new manager , art howe , and several new players , the mets expect to return to the postseason when they signed piazza to a sevenyear contract after the 1998 season , the mets set a time frame to win a championship in the prime of his career but time is running out we 've only been to the world series one time with him , fred wilpon , the mets' owner , said last week we need to be there more that s the goal wilpon has stressed a family atmosphere since he bought out nelson doubleday to become the principal owner last august and his son , jeff , assumed greater responsibility as the mets' chief operating officer but wilpon is also a driven competitor , and his decision to fire valentine after last season proved that his patience was finite howe has the security of a fouryear contract but a team owner who is more involved than ever general manager steve phillips built two playoff teams around piazza and has surrounded him with established veterans at most positions but the outfield has questions , half the lineup hinges on players rebounding from their worst seasons and the pitching rotation had two openings entering the final week of spring training perhaps most glaring , piazza s batting average has dropped the past two years , dipping below 300 for the first time last year he turns 35 in september , past the age at which most catchers look to ease the burden on their bodies but phillips still believes in piazza i have no thought or expectation that he wo n't get back to the numbers that he s produced in the past , phillips said none of those other catchers are mike piazza comparing him to what happens to other catchers just is n't apples to apples during spring training , howe put off any thought of a position switch for piazza but regardless of where he plays , piazza can carry a team for only so long he has three years left on his contract , and piazza views this season as a turning point for the mets the team has six primary players whose contracts will expire after the season , including roberto alomar , jeromy burnitz , pedro astacio and armando benitez there s obviously a lot of guys who could change and we could be very different , piazza said as proof of their intent to win now , the mets' offseason centered on adding more veterans like pitchers tom glavine and mike stanton phillips preaches the correlation between experience and winning the mets took what they believe are minor gambles they let the free agent third baseman edgardo alfonzo leave without making him an offer and funneled that money to the ofteninjured left fielder cliff floyd unable to sign another third baseman , they handed the position to the rookie ty wigginton they extended their budget to add glavine to an aging rotation it s not just mike and the years he s caught , starter al leiter said look at the age of all the guys on the team it s not any type of secret this team is built to win now we 're absolutely built to go to a world series we have guys that have done it the mets entered camp with the thirdoldest 40man roster in the major leagues , behind the cardinals and the yankees the average age of 28675 did not factor in graeme lloyd \( 35 \) and jay bell \( 37 \) , who made the opening day roster , or tony clark \( 30 \) , who should join the team within a week of the eight position players , only wigginton \( 25 \) , roger cede o \( 28 \) and floyd \( 30 \) are younger than 33 in the projected rotation are glavine \( 37 \) , al leiter \( 37 \) , steve trachsel \( 32 \) , david cone \( 40 \) and the injured astacio \( 33 \) leiter understands that age increases risk , but he also realizes youth can be fragile i had my first shoulder operation when i was a 23yearold , he said my second one , i was almost 25 i see a lot of young kids around here rehabbing their shoulders and elbows i also know that my last seven years have been absolutely the best of my career leiter s point is clear veterans have learned how to succeed and stay in shape and wilpon believes most of the mets' core players should have three to four more prime years but the fact is we blended that with young players and will continue to blend because our system is starting to produce , he said i think it s obvious our system was dormant for too long wigginton , a product of that system , will start at third base with bell as a safety net prospects like shortstop jos reyes and pitcher aaron heilman are expected to contribute at some point this season glavine , who was courted by wilpon during the offseason , needs 58 victories to reach 300 wilpon vowed that he would provide glavine with a competitive team for the length of the threeyear , 35 million contract he signed in december i'm not going to play forever , and i'm certainly on the back end of my career , so the opportunities for me are going to get fewer no matter what , glavine said that s just a reality for me that my chances are going to start diminishing , but i do n't think you look at it in terms of , 'oh , geez , i only have four more chances , ' because who knows another new york team was built around a franchise player for 15 seasons , the knicks tried to surround patrick ewing with a cast that could win a championship , but they never won a title when ewing finally left , the knicks crumbled piazza views his situation as different from ewing s i'm proud of the position i 've had in this organization , but i do n't look at it that way , piazza said baseball is a team sport , an extendedteam sport that was pretty obvious when we went to the world series there s not one player that s going to shape the destiny of an organization but piazza , who is as skilled at deflecting attention as he is at swatting a baseball , has changed the course of the mets franchise the pressure to win with him has increased every year since his arrival five years ago photos catcher mike piazza still wields a big bat , although his average dipped below 300 for the first time last season newcomers to the mets include tom glavine , above , who will anchor the pitching rotation left fielder cliff floyd , below left and reliever mike stanton \( photographs by gary i rothstein for the new york times \)
the union representing new york city principals said yesterday that it had reached a tentative deal with mayor michael r bloomberg on a contract that would provide raises of 8 to 11 percent over 27 months , with none of the changes mr bloomberg had sought to get more experienced principals into troubled schools under the agreement , the city s 1 , 200 principals would make 100 , 244 to 125 , 283 a year , up from 92 , 681 to 115 , 831 the 2 , 730 assistant principals would make 79 , 357 to 107 , 436 a year , up from 73 , 370 to 97 , 322 because the principals' last contract expired in april 2001 , the new one would be retroactive and would expire on june 30 city officials stressed that the new contract would be shortlived and that they would keep pressing for changes in work rules in the next round of negotiations the officials said they decided to settle now because the new school year is approaching , and schools chancellor joel i klein is determined to lure talented new principals into the system to stanch a shortage and the increased salaries could boost that recruitment drive union leaders , meanwhile , boasted about not having to make a single concession i'm happy to say that in spite of all the rhetoric and demands that have been on the table for a long time , there have been no givebacks whatsoever , said jill levy , president of the union , the council of supervisors and administrators though city hall would not officially confirm the tentative agreement , mr bloomberg stressed in a news conference that future contracts with the principals' union and others would provide raises only in exchange for productivity gains we have not walked away and are not walking away from the fact that we can only give raises going forward based on productivity , mr bloomberg said those cannot be retroactive , like this contract is ms levy had originally asked for a 10 percent raise over 30 months the 8 percent raise that most of her members got 4 percent retroactive to april 2001 and 4 percent retroactive to 2002 matches the city pattern for civilian employees while most of the union s members would get an 8 percent raise , assistant principals with three or more years on the job would get up to 11 percent , to ensure that their salaries are higher than those of senior teachers in their schools until now , many assistant principals have earned less than those teachers , and the disparity was a main sticking point in the contract talks earlier in the negotiating process , mr bloomberg and mr klein wanted to award up to 75 , 000 in bonus pay to experienced principals who agreed to work in lowperforming schools but the union insisted that the bonus pay be counted toward principals' pensions when they retired , and mr bloomberg balked several education officials said that the city s budget situation was so bad that mr bloomberg had decided he could not afford the bonus program , anyway just last week , the bloomberg administration hinted that it would instead seek the power unilaterally to transfer principals and assistant principals from one school to another but ms levy went to the press to complain about the proposal , and city hall backed off experienced administrators typically avoid working in lowperforming schools because of poor working conditions and unrelenting pressure to improve test scores some education experts said that by dropping both of his plans for getting veteran principals into the worst schools , mr bloomberg was sacrificing a crucial reform but city officials pointed out that the new contract will expire soon and said they would continue to pursue such changes in the next round of negotiations mr bloomberg used the same rationale when he settled a contract with the city s teachers' union last spring he raised their salaries by 16 to 22 percent , which helped the city end its teacher shortage , without demanding concessions to work rules
albany , march 11 assembly speaker sheldon silver continued today to try to goad mayor michael r bloomberg into a fight for more state aid for his financially struggling city in particular , he urged the mayor to push his fellow republican , gov george e pataki , for help in reinstating a tax on commuters but mr silver , a democrat from lower manhattan , is not advocating the same type of commuter tax that mr bloomberg has proposed , an elaborate plan that would transform the city s income tax system nor does mr silver have a realistic ability to singlehandedly help mr bloomberg win approval for any kind of commuter tax both mr pataki and the majority leader of the state senate , joseph l bruno , a republican , are opposed to reinstating the old commuter tax , which mr silver helped repeal in 1999 the mayor s tax would be up to six times as high as the old commuter tax , which mr silver now supports all of which seems to leave mr silver in his current role as fire thrower an isolated political force who is increasingly trying to drive a wedge between the republican executives here and in new york city by contending that mr pataki is the one who can and should solve mr bloomberg s problems it is the same argument mr silver has been making on a national scale he has argued that president bush and the republican leaders in congress have left mr pataki in the lurch in dealing with the worst state budget crisis since the great depression , in part because the governor has been too reluctant to shout for help from the white house similarly , mr silver said , mr bloomberg has been too timid in asking for albany s aid the mayor is being led down a path to slaughter by his republican colleagues , the governor and the republican senate majority leader , mr silver said he said mr bloomberg should fight for more education aid and try to block other parts of mr pataki s budget proposal that fall short of the city s needs i think it is up to the mayor to get out on a soapbox and make this happen , he added the mayor has a bully pulpit it is time for him to point fingers at people who are n't going to go along with him on this the mayor , who has refused to personalize politics , has resisted being provoked into battle in several showdowns , including his fight for control of the schools and his efforts to thwart a threatened strike by transit workers , he has adopted a cool leadership style , believing , aides have said , that it does the city no good to injure relationships or isolate others even today , as he led a coalition of new york s counties in lobbying albany to create a cap on escalating medicaid costs , mr bloomberg talked of the leaders in the capitol collectively , rather than shifting pressure solely on mr pataki the mayor s style might not make for great political theater , said edward skyler , his press secretary but it seems to always get the job done , such as its leading to today s resolution of the strike on broadway as for mr silver s statements , john mcardle , who is mr bruno s chief spokesman , said a history lesson was in order , lest city and state taxpayers forget it was mr silver who secured the repeal of the commuter tax , stopping 400 million to 500 million a year in reliable cash from streaming into the city s treasury let the record show that the speaker is the one who led the charge to repeal the commuter tax in the assembly on behalf of his new york city democrat colleagues , ostensibly to influence a state senate election in rockland county , mr mcardle said compare that with what he is saying now , he said , and it might seem a bit ironic to hear the speaker now criticizing the mayor for something that he was largely responsible for lisa dewald stoll , the governor s chief spokeswoman , said it was time for leadership , not politics it is unfortunate that the speaker prefers fingerpointing and political blame games to actually working productively to help the state overcome this unprecedented fiscal crisis , she said mr silver s admonitions come as pressure is mounting both in the city and the state to deal with enormous budget gaps on april 15 , mr bloomberg will present his plan to close a 34 billion deficit but serious negotiations on a plan for the fiscal year that begins on july 1 will be hard to achieve if the city does not know what aid it can expect from the state estimates of how the state budget would hurt the city have varied from not at all , according to mr pataki , to costs ranging from 200 million to more than 2 billion none consider revenue from a commuter tax mr silver said the commuter tax would not unduly burden suburbanites at this time , despite other tax increases they face in the past , he has been consistently optimistic about tax revenues , yet more accurate than the governor and mr bruno , who have a track record of underestimating by a wider margin the money coming into the state
in the spring of 2001 , the little league of the three villages considered buying a 50 , 000 batting cage for its players but was uncertain about the league s future at ward melville high school in setauket , where since 1978 it has leased 11 acres of ball field free michael hartnagel , president of the little league , went to john w sonedecker , then the superintendent of the three village school district , of which ward melville high school is a part he said , 'you will be there as long into the future as you can see , mr hartnagel recalled with that assurance , mr hartnagel said , the little league raised the money and installed the batting cage , which contained three pitching machines but last september , a little more than a year later , mr hartnagel said , he received a letter from the school district saying its fiveyear lease would not be renewed when it expired in 2005 when he and other little league board members met with school officials to discuss the issue , mr hartnagel said , they were told that the district had decided to cancel the lease one week later , at a school board meeting that included a resolution to terminate the lease effective june 30 , 2003 , mr hartnagel said he pleaded for a onemonth extension so all the july games could be played as scheduled the board agreed , but on aug 1 the little league officially became homeless the school board voted to cancel the lease because the district needed the ball fields , said mitchell h pally , the board s vice president there is a clause in the lease that says if enrollment increases and we need the field , we can take it back , he said we could n't wait until 2005 because we have 600 more kids at the high school than we did four years ago that s why we just expanded our building to add 16 classrooms mr pally said the school district wanted to reconfigure the 11acre little league fields to make them available for high school students the high school baseball team , mr pally explained , needs to play on fields with 90foot base paths , but the regulation little league fields have only 60 feet between bases those fields do n't do us any good , he said mr pally added that the batting cage and many of the other improvements the little league made were donated to the school district and may not be removed by the league philip j rizzuto , a lawyer who lives in east setauket and has a 6yearold son in the little league , said that despite any enrollment change , the number of teams at the high school had not changed it was only looking at the clause as an excuse to break the lease , he said on behalf of the little league , mr rizzuto filed suit against the school district , and on july 31 , justice edward d burke of state supreme court in riverhead signed a temporary restraining order that prevents the district from breaking the lease mr rizzuto said no hearing date had yet been set just as the little league said the termination of its lease caught it by surprise , the school board said it was blindsided by the lawsuit i was dumbfounded , said william f connors jr , the school board president they filed it without even speaking to us if they had said , 'let s try to work something out , ' we would have tried to make an accommodation there was none of that this was out of the blue we would like to work with them if possible , we 'd consider other locations within the district we would even consider a lease arrangement donald f webster , the district s executive director for health , physical education , recreation and athletics , said the little league fields were needed not only because of an increasing high school population but because more girls were participating in athletics we had 30 girls for girls' track two years ago now we have 70 on the team , he said and this is indicative of the growth of our programs mr webster said that the high school would have 10 teams this fall for soccer , field hockey and football but only five fields to play on and one is the game field , which he said he did not want to practice on every day that s one of the reasons we want to move to that property , he said , referring to the little league fields otherwise , we would have to transport our kids to our elementary schools , our junior highs or stony brook university to use their fields mr webster said one of the high school fields was in such bad shape from overuse that it was decided not to use it last year as a result , he said the district rented a field at stony brook university for 1 , 500 for the season it then paid to bus the teams to the field because our kids could n't play on our own fields as a result of the lease arrangement with the little league joseph m cumella , vice president of the little league and a coach of three of its teams , dismissed the school s explanations the real issue here is that the school district s budget does not include a single budgetary item for the work they plan to do to the fields , he said over the last 25 years we built what is probably the best little league facility in suffolk county through corporate donations , parent sweat equity and volunteers , we cleared the land and spent at least 1 million over the 25 years we put in every blade of grass , every fence post and every base at no cost to the taxpayers whatsoever the school district , seeing what we built , has stopped using their fields and wants to use ours mr connors said that the league had done an excellent job in preparing and maintaining its fields , but that it always knew the district had the right to reclaim them if they were needed they put all of that money into it knowing full well that this situation could occur , he said mr hartnagel said the little league , which consists of about 800 boys and girls on 50 teams , uses its fields from midapril until the end of august during the week , the fields are used after 6 pm and on weekends from 9 am until 6 pm there are three fields with 60foot base paths and one with 90foot base paths that mr hartnagel said the junior varsity team sometimes used under the new arrangement , mr hartnagel said , the district has told the little league that it will still be allowed use of the district s fields but will have to get a permit just like other organizations and will now be required to pay a fee for the use they do n't want us to have exclusive use of the fields that we built , maintained and improved , he said but mr connors insisted we now need the space for our own district s activities and sports , and having the little league there is preventing us from using it photos the little league of the three villages has used fields at ward melville high school since 1978 but was told its lease was being canceled joseph m cumella , vice president of the little league , said the league s fields were improved over the years at no cost to taxpayers \( photographs by maxine hicks for the new york times \)
a federal appeals court is set to hear arguments today about whether a monument engraved with the ten commandments may remain in the rotunda of the alabama supreme court a decision issued by the same federal court on friday may contain clues about how the court will rule in the alabama case the arguments , before the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit , will take place in montgomery , ala , just blocks from the state judicial building , where , in august 2001 , chief justice roy s moore of the alabama supreme court unveiled a 5 , 280pound granite monument setting out the ten commandments in the king james version on friday , another threejudge panel of the federal court , including one of the judges deciding the monument case , upheld use of a stylized picture of the commandments on a georgia court s official seal the two cases are part of a trend , said douglas laycock , a law professor at the university of texas who is an expert in the law of religious liberty there has been a lot of ten commandments litigation over the years , and in an escalating pace recently , he said for the most part the government has been losing these cases friday s decision was an exception and an error , said robert l tsai , a law professor at the university of oregon who represents the plaintiffs this is the first federal appellate decision to uphold governmental display or usage of the ten commandments since 1980 , he said that was when the united states supreme court struck down a kentucky law requiring the posting of the commandments in public school classrooms for 130 years , the official seal of the superior court in richmond county , ga , used to authenticate legal documents , has depicted a sword and two tablets bearing the first 10 roman numerals all concerned agreed that the tablets represent the commandments , but the parties differed about whether the depiction indicated a government endorsement of religion the original purpose of the seal is , the trial judge found , lost in the mists of history the judge , dudley h bowen jr , of augusta , ga , said the tablets were among other things a secular symbol for the rule of law and might have aided illiterate people in recognizing the legal validity of documents displaying the seal the appeals court said that justification was plausible it added that the seal did not give the appearance that the government was endorsing religion that holding would at first appear helpful to chief justice moore but the court s reasoning mostly hurts his case , experts said the court noted that the seal was used in the very narrow context of authenticating legal documents , albeit some 24 , 000 a year the commandments were not , the court said , displayed in the superior court s courtroom or anywhere else in the courthouse the presence of the sword on the seal helped , too , the court held , increasing the probability that observers would associate the seal with secular law in addition , the seal is relatively small finally , the court noted that the text of the commandments did not appear on the seal none of those things are true of the alabama supreme court monument , professor laycock said friday s decision was defensible , he said , but it should be of no help to chief justice moore to uphold that , he said , referring to the monument , the court would have to say that we agree with the argument that the ten commandments are sufficiently secular that you can put them anywhere except public school , which is unlikely but possible in the eleventh circuit it s impossible in the supreme court if they uphold it , they will be reversed herbert w titus , chief justice moore s lawyer , did not return a call seeking comment in his brief to the eleventh circuit , the judge defended the monument as a constitutionally permissible acknowledgment of god as the source of the moral foundation of law the chief justice has noted that depictions of the ten commandments or blank tablets evoking them can be found in many government buildings , including that of the united states supreme court j l edmondson , the 11th circuit s chief judge , concurred in the result in friday s decision , but he did not join in its reasoning , saying little more than that he was uncomfortable with the characterization and the manner of application of some of the precedents discussed he is also on the threejudge panel that will hear arguments today and is the only judge involved in both cases certainly he had our case in mind in issuing his limited concurrence , said danielle lipow of the southern poverty law center , which represents one of the plaintiffs in the alabama case
more than a million schoolchildren play chess in the united states , yet beatriz marinello says they have been largely ignored by the game s official sanctioning body she intends to change that ms marinello is the new president of the united states chess federation , and she is planning new scholastic chess initiatives aimed at supporting existing programs as well as introducing the game to children who have had little exposure to it , particularly girls and those in lowincome areas the federation has neglected them , said ms marinello , an international chess master and the first woman to hold the federation s presidency there are so many kids playing , but we lose most by the time they 're 11 , she said we need to provide more opportunities for them to take part in the game chess teaches pattern recognition , systematic thinking and flexibility in adapting to changing situations scholastic chess gives us the chance to introduce the game into the culture in a massive way already , 60 percent of the federation s members are 14 or younger , and an even greater majority have not yet graduated from high school historically , the federation s scholastic members who cannot vote before age 16 were represented by a vocal group of adults who , until recently , had relatively little political power within the organization , ms marinello said but in the last three years , as younger members became a majority in the organization , the influence of scholastic chess advocates grew so much that they were able to elect ms marinello to the federation s board , from which she was appointed president a native of santiago , chile , ms marinello , 39 , started playing chess at 13 and three years later became a chilean national women s champion since moving to this country in 1990 , she has participated in four united states women s championships , and she was a playercaptain in the 1994 chess olympiad in moscow she said that her dedication to scholastic chess comes from both her love of the game and the fact that her parents actively discouraged her from playing because she was female i succeeded in spite of them , she said now i have a mission ms marinello said that her first move as president of the federation would be to invest 200 , 000 in new computer technology , giving the federation online ability to reach out to both young chess players and children who have had no contact with the game she estimated that of the more than a million children playing chess in the united states , only 50 , 000 have any connection with the federation using the internet and her academic expertise , she said she would help develop scholastic chess programs , particularly in lowincome areas she said that most children who play chess in the united states are male , white , affluent and participants in private or schoolsponsored chess clubs , but that fewer youths near or below the poverty line are exposed to the game to bridge the gap , she said that she was writing curriculums , creating program models and soliciting funds to set up chess programs in school districts that have none her most recent project is chess for our children , a privately financed initiative that will bring professional chess instruction to 7 , 000 lowincome students in dade county , fla , this year ms marinello , who is moving to miami from manhattan , said she would like to see the program integrated into the district s regular school curriculum , expand into public and private schools throughout florida and eventually become a national program another objective , she said , will be to strengthen afterschool chess programs by providing them with professional and organizational support from the federation in the hope that they , too , will eventually be integrated into their school districts' academic curriculums ms marinello has considerable experience in this area , having brought chess into the classrooms of a number of new york area schools , including the dalton school , where she was one of the chess coaches from 1990 to 1992 public schools 9 and 6 in manhattan , where she was the main classroom chess instructor for kindergarten through fifth grade from 1993 to 1996 the horace mann school in the bronx , where she led students to second place in the national elementary chess championships earlier this year and the chappaqua , ny , elementary schools , where she taught chess to elementary students as an academic subject the federation s vice president , tim hanke , said that ms marinello s plans to promote scholastic chess would not only benefit schoolchildren but would enliven the game if you go to an average adult tournament , you 'd be lucky to see 50 people there , said mr hanke , who manages the federation s finances but some of the biggest scholastic national events have between 2 , 000 and 3 , 000 people playing clearly , dramatic changes are needed , and beatriz is the one to make them photo beatriz marinello , president

orange , conn , may 5 four police officers , including the assistant police chief , have resigned in recent days from this town s police force because of possible sexual misconduct while on duty , the town s first selectman said today mitchell goldblatt , the first selectman , added that two more officers might resign as a result of an internal police investigation that began about a month ago based on information provided by one of the six officers while mr goldblatt would not discuss details of what the officers did because the inquiry is continuing , he said their behavior involved violations of the police force s code of conduct , departmental rules and was behavior unbecoming an officer at this point , he said , we have no evidence of criminal activity that might warrant involving other law enforcement agencies rather , he described an environment where officers seemed to look away as other officers pursued sexual liaisons with various women while on duty the four officers were all veterans of the force they were identified by mr goldblatt as robert f kenny , jr the assistant chief , who joined in 1986 john regan , on the force since 1992 and andrew d'agostino , who joined in 1984 the fourth man , andrew gambardella , a parttime officer who is not included in the official police headcount , started in 1991 none of the officers could be reached late last night for comment the fulltime officers will retain their pensions , but will lose the lifetime health benefits they would have enjoyed had they served until retirement , mr goldblatt said orange is a town of 13 , 500 people with 40 uniformed officers for a small community that prides itself on community policing , this is a real blow , said mr goldblatt it s a real letdown , and it s ruined the reputation of a very fine police department

fort lauderdale , fla in the early 60 s , i washed out of minorleague baseball and took up writing by the late 60 s , i had gained 50 pounds , so i went on an obsessive diet and lost it all friends asked if i had an incurable disease finally , in the 70 s i found a dirty iron gym filled with raucous bodybuilders and began to lift weights to regain some muscle tone the guys in the gym grunted , sweated , cursed and shouted at one another i loved the camaraderie of the place it reminded me of a baseball clubhouse i also loved the physical exercise of lifting heavy weights , the feeling of strength it gave me , the sense of control over my body , which was quickly becoming more muscular arnold schwarzenegger smiled down on us all there were posters of him on every wall in the gym in his tiny trunks , flexing his huge biceps , his oiled hair flat to his head , his gaptoothed grin reminding us all that we would never be like him the man was our hero the babe ruth of bodybuilding i knew about him before he became arnold schwarzenegger , when he was billed in the back of cheap muscle magazines as arnold strong but none of us ever really knew him until he starred in the documentary pumping iron arnold schwarzenegger dominated pumping iron with his easy , slightly disturbing charm and his indomitable will i had been a lot like him in some ways gregarious , egocentric and not like him in others there is a point in the movie when he grins into the camera and explains to his audience just how far he 'd go to defeat his main competition , the hulking , manchild lou ferrigno , in the upcoming mr olympia contest he says , if necessary , he 'd spend the night before the contest with his rival and mess up his mind he 'd give lou ferrigno a night he 'd never forget what did mr schwarzenegger mean \? how far would he go \? was there nothing he would n't do to win a bodybuilding contest \? pumping iron affected a lot of the young guys in our gym they emulated mr schwarzenegger s persona in the movie i remember gary , a handsome , muscular kid , who was training for the mr connecticut contest his main competition was claude , who had some of lou ferrigno s childlike simplicity gary began to mess with claude s mind while they trained together every morning he came to the gym and told claude he was hung over from drinking all night when they weighed themselves to see if they were losing fat as the contest approached , gary would tell claude he knew he must have gained weight because he 'd pigged out the night before on pizza and ice cream then he 'd step on the scale and his weight would be down three pounds poor claude was completely confused he was struggling so with his diet , limiting himself to cans of tuna and glasses of water , and here was gary , eating , drinking and dropping weight of course , gary was lying he was n't out drinking all night , nor was he pigging out he was eating tuna , too days before the contest claude cracked he pigged out on pizza and ice cream and lost the fine edge of muscular definition he had starved to get gary became mr connecticut i finally met arnold schwarzenegger at a miss olympia contest he was hosting in new york in the mid80 s before the contest , he held a seminar on bodybuilding in an auditorium with his buddy franco columbo , who had managed to win a mr olympia title despite being less than five and half feet tall if mr schwarzenegger was polished , charming and ruthless , his partner was the opposite simple , charming , sweet mr columbo was the straight man and there was always something a little bit cruel in the jokes his partner played on him throughout their routine , as if even tiny franco columbo was a threat during the seminar , mr columbo , dressed in slacks and a dress shirt , sat hunched over on a bench and performed bentover , rearshoulder exercises with dumbbells , while mr schwarzenegger provided commentary this is how you develop the delts , he said in his thickly accented english then he frowned , a mock frown but you ca n't see them he pulled big scissors from his back pocket and , while mr columbo continued to perform his exercises , leaned down and cut huge holes in the back of his friend s shirt the audience roared with laughter after the demonstration , mr schwarzenegger answered questions from the audience i was 44 , and about to enter my first bodybuilding contest mr connecticut , over40 i had reached a sticking point in my training and wanted to get bigger biceps i had asked a lot of knowledgable bodybuilders how to gain bicep size and they had all told me the same thing as i got older i had to do fewer sets six to nine sets of 10 repetitions each and get more rest but who were they \? they were n't arnold schwarzenegger , my hero i raised my hand and asked him how , at 44 , i could get bigger biceps he told me i needed to perform 36 sets of 15 reps each for my biceps every other day i was stunned but i'm 44 , i said i do n't take steroids i thought the man on the stage waved the back of his hand at me it does n't matter , he said do what i told you 36 sets , 15 reps i went home and took mr schwarzenegger s advice it took me hours to perform that many sets for just one muscle even worse , after a month , my biceps had shrunk from overwork my guess now is that mr schwarzenegger had intentionally misled me he was famous for telling tall tales to other bodybuilders about his training routine i imagine it was his way of maintaining his advantage over them in pumping iron he delighted in telling a story about how he had misdirected a young bodybuilder who had asked him for help with his posing routine the secret to posing , he told him , was to come on stage and scream as loud as he could to impress the judges when the young bodybuilder followed this advice he was laughed off the stage now mr schwarzenegger will be giving advice to his fellow californians
creating an independently financed magazine is always a perilous activity , but the endeavor takes on more foolhardy dimensions when the publication is aimed at music fans it all has the makings of a torch song that comes to tears in the end music magazines are a bet on an industry that has been slumping for three years , is in danger of losing custody of its product through the internet , and is already covered by a clutter of publications but next week , alan light and john rollins , two longtime members of the music magazine business , will take their chances with tracks , a publication aimed at grownup consumers of popular music with a relatively small initial investment of 5 million and a promised circulation to advertisers of just 100 , 000 , mr light and mr rollins are out to prove that music does not begin and end with beyonc and downloading the first issue features durable , adultfriendly performers like sting , ryan adams and robert plant in a pure music format , one that avoids the broader pop culture sensibilities of more established magazines like rolling stone , owned by wenner media , and vibe , owned by vibe spin ventures tracks pays little heed to ofthemoment bands like the rapture and killing joke that are a staple of spin and it has none of the cheeky attitude of blender , a more recent arrival from dennis publishing usa , or the teenage sensibility mtv s recently christened magazine mr light , the editor in chief , and mr rollins , the chief executive and publisher , say tracks will cover music built to last which happens to be the magazine s tag line the two , along with their chief operating officer , dana sacher , were part of creating vibe , an urban music magazine that was greeted with tremendous skepticism and now has a circulation exceeding 800 , 000 and carries more than 1 , 000 advertising pages a year mr light and mr rollins also count spin and rolling stone on their r sum s it reminds me of when we were first making vibe , mr light said there is a huge pool of music listeners who are not being served , and this feels like a similar vacuum mr light said virtually all the current music publications are youthoriented , without much of interest to someone over 30 who purchases boxed sets by artists like bob dylan and samples the work of newer artists like norah jones who play music that is anything but trendy tracks will come out twice in the first half of 2004 and three times in the second half older consumers generally do not excite advertisers , and tracks' first issue has little in the way of ads from companies that are not record labels but older consumers , whether out of technological impairment or a habit of collecting , still actually buy music so as the music industry has watched sales drop 30 percent over the last few years , these listeners and readers have a special , and growing , power in the music industry five years ago , people under 30 bought 504 percent of the music sold , according to the recording industry of america last year , those over 30 bought 56 percent of the music sold the adult sector of the business is largely download and cd burnerproof , said david weyner , general manager of arista associated labels , an arista records division focused on adult listeners i think that there is a place for a magazine that picks its targets and is able to reach a sophisticated adult audience perhaps , but of the more than 700 magazines that will start life this year , less than 4 of 10 will make it through their first year , according to statistics gathered by samir husni , a professor of journalism at the university of mississippi who tracks new magazines and fewer than one in 10 survive over the long haul reed phillips , a managing partner of desilva phillips , a media banking firm , has lived through such heartbreak the two independent magazines he founded , fathers and washington weekly , are no longer published many of the independents raise enough money so that if every single thing goes right , then they have just enough , he said but everything does n't usually go right and it is tough to survive a couple of false moves he pointed out that book magazine , a very well thoughtof independent effort , which attracted financing from barnes noble , recently shut down after running out of money other independents , like dads and oxford american , have also faded away jonathan simpsonbint , president of future network usa , a brisbane , califbased publisher of enthusiast and hobby magazines like macaddict and pc gamer , said he was impressed by the pedigree of the people involved but doubts that adult consumers are obsessive enough about music to buy a magazine about the artists they have often grown up with my experience has been that the people who like to listen to bonnie raitt and phil collins do not have music as a primary interest , he said i like to drive a nice car , but that does not mean that i buy car magazines
eight men sat back to back at two adjoining booths on the 7 30 am ferry to bridgeport on march 7 , keeping to themselves , speaking quietly in deep voices , like guests at a funeral these solidlooking men , with thick , calloused hands and heavy clothing made for outdoor work , plainly were not part of the usual crowd of commuters and casino daytrippers they were lobstermen , and they were on their way to another scientific dissection of an event that has threatened their livelihoods a stillmysterious long island sound lobster dieoff that began in 1999 most of the guys have n't checked their gear for months there s nothing to check , said george dahl , chairman of the new york lobster conservation management team and vice president of the long island sound lobstermen s association john davi , 39 , a lobsterman from port jefferson , ny , said that between late september and the end of last year he lost money every time he took out his boat , at a cost of about 600 a day for bait , fuel and labor things were good five years ago , he said we lost a lot of lobsters so mr dahl and his colleagues had plenty of time to go to bridgeport for the third annual lobster health symposium , sponsored by the sea grant projects of new york and connecticut , to hear the scientists report on their latest attempts to find out why the sound s lobsters have been dying long island sound lobster landings , reported at 104 million pounds in 1998 by the new york department of environmental conservation and the connecticut department of environmental protection , dropped to 36 million pounds in 2000 after a slight decline in 2001 , last year s harvest plunged again , to an estimated 25 million pounds until september of last year , we were having a fair year , said john german , 55 , president of the long island lobstermen s association then in septemberoctober , there was a major dieoff this year , i 'd predict a couple of hundred thousands pounds , if that the lowest ever lobstermen are closemouthed about their income , which makes it hard to get accurate estimates of their financial losses but in 2002 , there were 414 licensed lobstermen in connecticut , down from 538 in 1998 in new york , there were 600 in 2001 , the last year for which complete figures are available for the lobstermen , there is little love lost between them and the scientists there are a lot of bean counters here , but the fishermen are suffering , said nick crismali , 52 , of guilford , president of the connecticut lobstermen s association i'm just interested in knowing where your program is going now that the fishermen are disappearing carl lobue of the new york dec responded , we recognize that if it was n't for fishermen , we would n't be in this room but neither mr lobue nor the four scientists who presented their findings on environmental stressors , physiological responses to stress , parasites and pesticides could predict when the situation would improve , and none had an explanation for the disaster that could satisfy the lobstermen alistair dove , a senior research associate at the cornell college of veterinary medicine who runs a shellfish pathology lab at stony brook university , identified a fatal disease called calcinosis in 20 lobsters analyzed between august and october of last year calcinosis , in which stony deposits form in the lobster s gills , causing respiratory failure , is caused by excess calcium this is the first time this disease has shown up in long island sound lobsters dr dove also hypothesized that warm water temperatures during the summers of 2001 and 2002 stressed the lobsters' immune systems so that they were vulnerable to infection further , the warm water created favorable conditions for paramoebas and parasites the most hotly debated topic pertaining to the dieoff is whether pesticides sprayed against west nile virusbearing mosquitoes in 1999 were washed into the sound a few days after hurricane floyd swept through the region , killing the lobsters jack mattice , 61 , director of the new york sea grant program in riverhead , doubted the pesticides were to blame the lobsters started dying before the first pesticides were sprayed in 1999 , mr mattice said the night before the conference in bridgeport , fishermen learned that a lawsuit filed on their behalf against the pesticide manufacturer cheminova was granted class certification status the suit charges cheminova with causing economic harm to the lobstermen after its pesticide fyfanon , a malathion product , was sprayed in nassau and suffolk counties in 1999 cheminova s attorney , christopher kelly , did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment class certification is one step on a long road , said gladstone jones , a new orleans environmental lawyer who is representing the lobstermen on both sides of the sound he predicted that the case would go before a jury in federal court in islip , ny this fall , at which time 300 to 500 lobstermen will be named as plaintiffs photo nick crismali of guilford , president of the connecticut lobstermen s association , asking a question during the symposium \( thomas mcdonald for the new

hartford , dec 13 the leader of the connecticut democratic party called on gov john g rowland on saturday to step aside while federal investigators continue looking into allegations that repairs were done on his private cottage at a discount in return for promises of state work stopping short of calling for governor rowland , a republican , to resign , the leader , george c jepsen , said , at a bare minimum , step aside for as long as it takes for these investigations to be completed mr jepsen was joined at a news conference here by five democratic lawmakers , all of whom said they were ready to begin impeachment proceedings should the governor refuse to step aside i personally would like to see him resign today , said state senator edith g prague , a democrat from columbia no sitting governor in connecticut has ever been impeached , and while five have resigned , none have been forced out as a result of scandal at a separate news conference at the state capitol afterward , dean pagani , the governor s chief of staff , said , the governor has no intention of resigning while not answering specific questions about work done on the cottage , mr pagani said governor rowland worked with his lawyers for the past two weeks to prepare the documents that were released on friday he is certain that there has been no wrongdoing on his part , mr pagani said there is no cloud hanging over governor rowland mr pagani said the governor would continue to do his job as he always had governor rowland , however , canceled a longplanned trip to florida on monday so that he could remain in hartford , an obvious signal that he realized the coming week would be critical to determining his future he was supposed to participate in an education forum held by the national governors' association in florida the dueling news conferences on saturday caused a swirl of activity in the usually quiet marble hallways of the state capitol they came a day after governor rowland admitted that he had made false and misleading statements about work done on his private cottage on bantam lake he had earlier said he had paid for all the work himself , but on friday acknowledged that some of it was done free of charge or given to him as a gift friday s statement , in both the details it laid out and its timing , came as a surprise to many in the capital , where a day later they were still struggling to deal with it particularly striking was the response of lt gov m jodi rell , a republican who would replace the governor should he step aside or be forced out of office i feel sick at heart i'm disappointed and i'm angry , she said on friday there s an investigation going on , and we need to complete that investigation and move forward mr pagani said that governor rowland spoke with ms rell on friday night and that she expressed her complete confidence in the governor on saturday night , she released a statement , distributed by an aide to the governor , saying i support the governor and i urge the residents of connecticut to do the same in a reflection of the delicate moment in which connecticut lawmakers find themselves , mr jepsen was not joined publicly by the top democratic leaders of the house or the senate instead , those lawmakers decided to stick to statements released on friday night legislative aides said there were several reasons that the democratic leadership , including the speaker of the house , moira k lyons the house majority leader , james a amann and the senate president pro tempore , kevin b sullivan , decided to hold off on calling for the governor to step aside they are waiting to see how republican lawmakers will react for now , the republicans are holding firm in their support of the governor the senate republican leader , louis c deluca , said , from my perspective , there s an investigation going on and i think we should wait for the results of the investigation even though things do n't look good , there does n't seem to be anything criminal here democrats are also looking for a way to give the governor a dignified way to step aside , their aides said the fear is that if they act too quickly in calling for his resignation , they will look shrill and partisan the next seven days will be critical an aide to one of the democratic leaders said , on the condition of anonymity at an appropriate moment , democratic lawmakers may approach governor rowland privately to talk about what comes next , the aide said but aides to several democratic lawmakers said that only if republicans joined them would they have a chance of persuading the governor to step aside or resign democratic lawmakers are also concerned that the governor will weather the latest crisis as he has done in the past if that is the case , they will have to work with him closely for the next three years with a republican in the governor s office and democrats controlling the legislature , a spirit of bipartisan compromise is necessary to get anything done photo george c jepsen , the connecticut democratic party chairman , spoke yesterday in hartford behind him were two democratic state representatives , peter a tercyak , center , and christopher g donovan \( photo by douglas healey for the new york times \) \( pg 56 \)

austin , tex there is a good deal of criticism these days leveled at the bush administration for being surprised by a number of events not just the sept 11 attacks , but also the escape and regrouping of the al qaeda and taliban leadership after the afghanistan war , french intransigence at the united nations in the build up to the iraq war , turkey s refusal of timely cooperation before that invasion , the coordinated murder and sabotage campaign led by baath party remnants in iraq , and the widespread mood of iraqi impatience with the american presence there so the question is was the administration blindsided because of poor work by the intelligence services , or was the problem poor coordination by the national security council , which is supposed to integrate the various intelligence , diplomatic and defense agencies \? actually , the answer is that none of these events was really a surprise everything that appeared to catch the white house off guard had been anticipated in various reports , some by the national security council itself the problem was n't foresight but forethought the bush administration , like the clinton white house before it , has yet to come up with an effective process to marshal judgment on the events it does foresee this is not really the fault of the national security council rather , it is a matter of the historic changes around the world and of the habits of organizing ourselves we inherited from the cold war for nearly 50 years , american decisionmakers could rely on forms of strategic planning a method that begins with choosing a desired result and then plotting the decisions that will have to be made to reach that goal strategic planning worked well in the twopower world because we were able to extrapolate from a relatively stable and familiar security environment , relying on more or less agreedupon intelligence estimates governments sought the likeliest linear future , and planned accordingly unfortunately , in an increasingly decentralized world , in which previously insignificant actors and factors can play a decisive role , strategic planning can leave decisionmakers flatfooted in its unidimensional reliance on a single future , strategic planning hardens the official future agencies internalize , and thus prepares them poorly for appreciating rapid changes in circumstance and for making agile adaptations for example , using strategic thinking it might have been estimated last year that saddam hussein could not have produced nuclear weapons in the less than seven years since his rudimentary programs were halted in 1995 in the new world , however , no one could make such a judgment with confidence not because we do n't know how long it takes to develop nuclear processing plants or how much fissile material is required , but because we could n't know whether iraq might have bought a nuclear device on the clandestine market and become a nuclear power in an afternoon this is why strategic planning was largely abandoned by the clinton administration , in which i served but no new way of thinking has replaced it it is an open secret that the national security council s strategic planning directorate is really devoted to communications tasks , and that the state department s policy planning staff is actually a speechwriting office in this new era of uncertainty , not only must we must accept that simple forecasting is not going to be very useful to us , we must sharpen our skills of forethought one way will be to augment traditional strategic planning with scenario planning , a strategy that has long been a staple at the largest multinational corporations scenario planning involves the creation of alternative narratives about the future based on different decisions by many players as each scenario progresses as opposed to the classic strategic method of applying the past to the future coming up with a single , likeliest story about how things will turn out scenario planning is about applying the future to the present , creating a learning framework for decisions the idea is not so much to predict the future as to consider the forces that will push the future along different paths , in order to help leaders recognize new possibilities , assess new threats and make decisions that reach much further into the future scenario planning can also exploit the changes under way in intelligence collection especially the greater emphasis on human sources unlike strategic planning , which tends to rely on quantitative and technical information like population figures and productivity reports , scenario planning tends to use more qualitative and dynamic data it depends in large part on studying economic , political and social trends scenario planning at royal dutch shell , where i am a senior adviser , helped the corporation become one of the most profitable oil conglomerates in the early 1970 s , its scenario planners worked on hypothetical futures involving an oil boycott against the west when political events finally brought about the arab oil crisis , the company not only was n't taken by surprise , it was in a position to capitalize in the 1990 s shell analysts were scenarioplanning a potential backlash against global companies , long before the antiglobalization movement took off thus , while most companies reacted to the new movement with corporate disdain , shell was courting nongovernmental groups and decentralizing its global operations so that decisions in foreign divisions could be made by people living in and sensitive to the countries affected getting the government to emphasize scenario planning will not be easy to be successful , the approach depends on wellorganized dialogue between decision makers at many levels , which would be culture shock for the rigidly hierarchical executive branch \( indeed , despite the efforts of advocates like joseph nye , dean of harvard s kennedy school of government , to get washington interested in scenario planning , only one country , singapore , has made extensive use of the practice \) our various national security agencies may not be competitive businesses , but they often behave toward each other as if they were intelligence is often stovepiped when analysts refuse to share information and sources with interagency rivals working on the same problems and mutually distrustful cultures abound also , scenario planning requires a political culture that is tolerant of uncertainty contingencies of uncertain probability tend to be of little interest to politicians , who are confident they know the future similarly , competing scenarios are anathema to bureaucrats whose careers are threatened by answering questions like , what would it take for this estimate to be dramatically wrong \? which translates to , what arguments can you give me that undermine your own recommendations \? to change this culture , we need an interagency working group that can organize scenario planning for a new era it should be headed by the senior director for strategic planning at the national security council , and should include the director of policy planning at the state department , the chairman of the national intelligence council , the politicalmilitary director for the joint chiefs of staff , the assistant secretary of defense for strategic and threat reduction , and a senior representative of the treasury secretary this body would be charged with coordinating the work and circulating the results of scenario planning by a team made up of veteran government analysts and , perhaps , experienced people from the private sector the bush administration came to office promising to bring the best practices of the business world to bear on government in many areas it has scenario planning at the national security council should be added to the list
having recently moved to new jersey , i went with my australian passport to the trenton division of motor vehicles to acquire a local license i discovered that nowadays , in the aftermath of the 9 11 terror attacks , new jersey will take no risks with its foreigners , submitting all alike to a bruising sequence of background checks and examinations beforehand , i had surveyed the new jersey driver manual \( 2001 edition \) this compact booklet is a mustread for anyone newly arrived in new jersey , a diverting , often thrilling snapshot of life in the garden state the prose style of the manual careers wildly from the quotidian to the sensational your grip on the steering wheel is important , it announces , almost before listing off the motor vehicle divisions nearest my home no foreign arriviste can be left in doubt new jersey sets a standard for the world in observing the preferred 915 hand position on the steering wheel in the next section on common causes of driver distraction , i was amazed to discover that new jersey residents can perform , at high speed , activities i can barely manage in my own living room searching for burning cigarettes , reading newspapers , shaving , applying makeup , watching children and pets , operating a fax machine now here was a bracing prospect a new life opened before me , in which i would touch up my lipstick and read the newspaper while a handsome young executive in the next car gestured inattentively to a chocolate labrador on his back seat what was life really like in new jersey \? as i skimmed each trim section of the manual , i sensed a dark , complex , grainy existence the book spoke of fines for each time ice flies from the vehicle and causes death it alluded grimly to the fate of drivers who abandon their vehicles on or along limited access highways for four hours or more without permission i wondered where could you get to from a limitedaccess highway in less than four hours it had taken me twoandahalf hours just to get from my parking space into the home depot on us 1 amazed , i read that if you are a driver convicted of prostitution where a motor vehicle was used you will receive a sixmonth suspension of driver privileges \( and a threemovie deal with a payperview adult network , i seemed to hear in voiceover \) but in the face even of such lurid disclosures , the manual maintained its whitmanesque effervescence here was a text in which wretched fatigue could be slaked by chewing gum or singing along with the radio and where underage drunks could find absolution and redemption by attending an intoxicated driver resource center \( called bars in australia \) the book reached a crescendo of feeling and suggestion as it turned to the topic of drunken driving among adults the pleasures and disappointments of intoxication were before me vividly , rendered in the manual s frisky , evocative style when you are giving a party or having friends over , be a good host , it implored serve nutritious foods or snacks along with the drinks do n't insist that your guests drink alcoholic beverages or push refills these were surely timely interventions , rescuing the citizens of new jersey from a fate far worse than an intoxicated driver resource center one imagined a pre2001 edition cocktail party with aggressive hosts forcing pint glasses of whiskey into the hands of the unsuspecting guests who had n't yet read the new jersey driver manual worse , one imagined a paucity of unnutritious snacks dotted about the room white cheddar puffs and pizzaflavored bagel chips acquiring a permit to become a part of all this was clearly going to be an arduous task the practices and habits of the state s drivers seemed so foreign to me and there i had it i was a stranger in this strange land the sort of hooligan with whom neither the state nor the federal government was going to take any chances new jersey had positioned itself as a key player in america s homeland security , and the dmv was its final frontier keeping sars breathing , anthraxtoting learner drivers off america s highways no afghani armsdealer would be passing the new jersey written exam any time soon when i arrived at the trenton dmv , i was told to join line 16 for foreign nationals seeking permits i stood behind 30 or so arabic men , none of whom looked as if they really cared what hydroplaning was contempt for the manual s snappy autoterminology is of course a red rag to the dmv s bull as it turned out , these foreigners were not individual applicants , but applicant units four or five highprofile baathparty loyalists trying to distract the dmv hierarchy while the aspiring driver sneaked over to counter 3 for a vision test it was apparent , in fact , that line 16 was a satellite facility for the immigration and naturalization service itself we were flanked there by heavily armed security officers ready to open fire the moment it looked as though a saudi militant had refused to join the voluntary organdonor program as the middle eastern man in front of me stepped up to the counter , the line 16 screening process became fully transparent the woman behind the desk took one look and instructed him curtly to join line 4 , which was more or less the same as sending him to a place called guant namo bay the difference was that people could be held in line 4 for a lot longer , and there was a sign on the wall saying no food or drink when it came my turn , i pressed a stack of id into the counter 16woman s paws she flicked through them the passport , the j1 visa forms , the work permit , the iap66 there s a problem , she said all this stuff says harvard on it i need something to show you 're from new jersey so do i , lady ! i wanted to scream was it the fact that i really did want a driver s license that had thrown the perfectly calibrated system into disarray \? she told me to leave the premises immediately and to come back with proper certification of my status choking back a flood of recrimination and rage , i returned to the carpark but as the new jersey driver manual told me , these were just the circumstances in which drivers need to be most careful distracted and angry , i could easily pick up a 4point fine for improperly passing a frozendessert truck on route 1 drawing \( tom bloom \)

now that macy s has assured everyone this thanksgiving that santa claus is a straight guy with no eye for samesex marriage , it may be time to face another issue squarely how come he and mrs claus are childless \? are they simply unable to have kids \? or was theirs a conscious decision not to add to global overpopulation \? maybe they figured having those elves around was enough then again , is it socially responsible of them not to expand the future work force \? inevitably , it increases the fiscal pressures on social security and other programs that most of us will depend on once we ourselves start looking a bit like the clauses serious questions , all but they are less immediate than a concern raised by a california company that does background checks on thousands of people applying for jobs this company , preemploycom , wanted to get the lowdown on the santas who put the ho in holiday at shopping malls across the country a year ago , it examined about 1 , 000 santas at malls , and discovered that 70 had criminal records that s 7 percent , for those of you who have lost the pocket calculators that you got last christmas we 're talking about nastiness like indecent exposure , assault , soliciting prostitution and contributing to the delinquency of a minor santa , we hardly knew ye ! as a followup this year , preemploy contacted 44 malls none in new york , thank goodness to see if any of them have learned something , said jennifer haynes , a company spokeswoman apparently , many have n't nearly half could not be bothered to look into the backgrounds of the new batch of saint nicks how worried should we be \? i do n't think 7 percent is necessarily a high rate , ms haynes said in a phone interview but it is high when you 're talking about someone who s as involved with children as a santa has even one of these santas done something terrible while bouncing little johnny or janie on his knee \? we do n't know , ms haynes said but , she added ominously , we do n't ever want to find out , either forget about samesex marriage this was the most anxietyinducing thought since arlo guthrie sang the pause of mr claus , a late60 s number with lyrics like santa claus has a red suit he s a communist in short order , other holidayrelated worries crept in this is the season when you can really get hurt all too many people drink themselves silly , and then think they can drive poorly tended christmas trees dry out and catch fire hanukkah candles are put too close to the curtains , with disastrous results children running around the house knock over hot food , and scald themselves in a study a few years ago , the burn center at new yorkpresbyterian hospital concluded that hanukkah , while joyous , had hidden hazards we 'd see two to three times as many children being burned around that time , dr roger yurt , the center s director , said the other day then there is the sheer psychic terror commonly known as holiday shopping what to buy \? how much to spend \? will we get to the toy store before it runs out of hot items like hokey pokey elmo and mighty beanz \? the ordeal officially begins today , black friday , when retailers hope the red ink turns to black not to be subversive , given how shopping has been equated with patriotism since sept 11 , but there are other ways to go for some people , today is buy nothing day , an idea cooked up a while ago by someone , somewhere , as a counterpoint to the raw commercialism of the season we just do n't have to rush to the mall that day , said surya das , a wellknown buddhist lama born jeffrey miller in brooklyn and reared on long island it s ok to buy nothing on one day , he said , and think about what people might really want and need surya das commissioned a poll on holiday buying patterns of 1 , 013 adults interviewed , 33 percent said that at least one present received last december ended up in the trash onethird also had a gift still sitting in the closet , never used we 've all been there surya das suggested some alternatives to runaway shopping frankly , most did not seem quite right for this laidforward nonbuddhist one idea stood out , though thank someone who you would n't usually think of thanking , he said he specifically mentioned newspaper writers as perhaps worthy of such grace honest , he did fat chance newspaper writers \? most people would rather cozy up to a santa who just got out of the state pen

we never heed the warnings when the power failed last thursday afternoon i was reading a report commissioned by the council on foreign relations that found that even now two years after the tragic events of sept 11 , 2001 the united states remains dangerously unprepared to cope with another catastrophic terrorist attack the blackout that interrupted my reading showed once again how suddenly we can be thrown out of our daily routine and into a widespread emergency i walked down the 10 flights from my office in the times building and out to times square , where the bewildered , disoriented throngs , frightened by thoughts of terror , were trying to get their bearings in an environment that had been transformed in an instant it seemed that almost everyone had a cellphone and none of them were working that freaked out a lot of people cellphones have emerged as the lifelines of the 21st century , the quintessential emergency gadget it s the one device that s supposed to work when everything else is falling apart there were already reports circulating \( true , as it turned out \) that the blackout extended all the way into canada and as far west as ohio a woman asked a reporter if he thought the entire nation was under attack the reporter said no , he thought it was just a blackout , like the ones in 1965 and 1977 but bigger , maybe the night would bring a reacquaintance with deep silence and flickering shadows and the comfort of listening to baseball on a batteryoperated radio but there was also the disturbing sense \( nurtured in the long , dark , humid hours of the night \) that much of our trust is misplaced , that in instance after instance the people in charge of crucial aspects of our society are incompetent or irresponsible , or both , and that american lives are far more at risk than they should be because of that last week s enormous , cascading blackout should never have occurred we knew the electrical grid was in sorry shape and the experiences of 1965 and 1977 were still in our collective memory the experts told us again and again to expect a breakdown two years ago an official with the north american electric reliability council said , the question is not whether , but when the next major failure of the grid will occur we ignored the warnings , which is what we always do with warnings , and we paid a terrible price now we 're left wondering what might happen if terrorists linked their madness to our electric power vulnerabilities the report i was reading when the power failed was issued less than two months ago and was titled , emergency responders drastically underfunded , dangerously unprepared the report acknowledged that some progress against terrorism has been made through the department of homeland security and other federal , state and local institutions but it said , the united states has not reached a sufficient national level of emergency preparedness and remains dangerously unprepared to handle a catastrophic attack on american soil , particularly one involving chemical , biological , radiological , or nuclear agents , or coordinated highimpact conventional means the task force that conducted the study was headed by former senator warren rudman , a republican , who , with former senator gary hart , a democrat , wrote two previous important studies that spotlighted the woeful state of our defenses against largescale terror attacks their first study was issued before the sept 11 catastrophe it predicted a deadly attack , saying , americans will likely die on american soil , possibly in large numbers their second study was issued last year and it accused the white house and congress of failing to take the extensive and costly steps necessary to defend against another catastrophic attack , which they said was almost certain to occur now we have yet another warning if an attack were to occur , the report said , the socalled first responders police and fire departments , emergency medical personnel , public works and emergency management officials are not ready to respond effectively and one of the reasons is that we wo n't spend the money or invest the effort necessary to adequately train and equip them after the next attack we 'll have another study to assess what went wrong and we wo n't pay attention to that study either
when the police responded to an alarm at a jewelry store in harlem on saturday night , they found 16yearold farj zaibak bound hand and foot with tape and 150 , 000 worth of jewelry missing , police officials said yesterday but soon , farj , the nephew of the three brothers who own the shop , jou jou jewelry , at 157 east 116th street , was under arrest , and the police were calling the robbery an inside job farj was not securely tied up when he was found , the police said and although he told investigators that the robbers had left in a mercedesbenz , when the manhattan north street crime unit stopped a pontiac with four people inside , they found the jewelry , a gun and a security videotape from the shop farj first claimed that he did not recognize the robbers , then , the police said , he confessed to having taken part in the robbery but when his parents and older brother went to see him at central booking , he told them that he had woken up in the shop , bound , and remembered nothing of the robbery , they said yesterday at the family s home jou jou is farj s nickname , and the shop , which sells jewelry , gold teeth and cellular phones , typically stays open until 7 30 or 8 pm on saturdays , the family said according to farj s relatives , two of his uncles , joey and raymond louz , had driven him to the gravesend section of brooklyn on saturday after work , dropping him near his girlfriend s home farj was to see his girlfriend and then join his family members , who also live in gravesend , for a dinner to celebrate the jewish holiday of sukkot but farj s girlfriend called the family about 9 30 to say that he had never showed up , said jack zaibak , farj s brother the girlfriend said that she had been talking with farj on his cellphone when the call was cut off , and that was the last she had heard at the jail , farj told his family that he remembered nothing between the cellphone call and his awakening at the shop they must have put a gun to his head , mr zaibak said he does n't know anything at all he does n't remember the family speculated that farj may have been tricked into confessing , saying the police told him that his uncles blamed him for the robbery the police responded to the alarm about 10 pm , a department spokesman said despite the fact that farj gave them incorrect information about the car , the spokesman said , the suspects were captured quickly when the pontiac was pulled over a few blocks from the crime scene the spokesman said he did not know why the street crime unit had pulled the car over one suspect , aaij saadia , 20 , who lives on ocean parkway , is known to the zaibaks , who said he would have known that farj had access to the shop the others jawara quintyne , 24 , fanny arias , 19 , and guillermo ferrer , 22 all live in east new york , according to addresses given by the police mr ferrer was released from state prison last month , where he had been serving time for attempted robbery and criminal possession of a weapon a woman who answered the door at mr saadia s address said , was it such a big robbery \? and then added , i do n't think i want to do a report , and shut the door when farj was brought to the pontiac for what is called a show up identification , as opposed to a lineup , he said that he knew none of the suspects , the police said at this , the officers grew suspicious and took him to the 25th precinct station house for further questioning there , they said , he confessed to having been an accomplice the five were held on charges of robbery , criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of stolen property , a police spokesman said the zaibaks said the store had been open for about three years and was owned by farj s mother s three brothers , joey , raymond and simon louz they said farj often ran the store by himself on weekends and during the summer farj , whose father , david zaibak , manages a linen shop on rockaway avenue , is the second of seven brothers and attends the torah academy of brooklyn , a private school
rahway , nj , oct 31 a commuter train bound for manhattan derailed friday morning , disrupting travel for thousands of passengers on 24 new jersey transit and amtrak trains on the northeast corridor line , officials said it was the third derailment since midjuly of a commuter train headed to new york city from new jersey none of the 700 passengers were hurt in the derailment , which occurred when the four front wheels on the lead car of a 10car new jersey transit train left the tracks about threequarters of a mile south of the station here the train , the 6 30 am from trenton , was switching from one track to another at low speed about 7 15 am as it approached the station , said dan stessel , an amtrak spokesman all of the cars remained upright , and the passengers were transferred to other trains to complete their trips amtrak and new jersey transit set up a joint committee to investigate the derailment in late afternoon , mr stessel said investigators were focusing on problems with the tracks , the switching equipment at the juncture , and nearby track signals all are owned and maintained by amtrak mr stessel said the investigators had tentatively ruled out defects on the train as a cause a spokeswoman for new jersey transit , penny bassett hackett , said its officials had questioned the train s five crew members and were satisfied that human error had not been a factor a new jersey transit conductor s mistake contributed to the first of the recent derailments , on july 14 the agency has said the conductor failed to detect an overheated wheel assembly during an emergency stop on a morning trentontomanhattan train the wheel eventually flew off the train in secaucus two of the train s 12 cars derailed , and 13 passengers were injured the conductor , who was initially suspended , returned to work after retraining the other derailment occurred on oct 9 as a new jersey transit train from dover was entering pennsylvania station in manhattan with about 300 passengers mr stessel said that derailment happened after amtrakowned rails loosened from their wooden ties
humanism has been on the wane as an intellectual and political force in america for many years , as more people question whether reason and science are adequate portals into the mystery of life but humanists alarmed by the rise of religion in american politics and culture have at least been able to turn to certain liberal domains for comfort and confirmation one has been unitarian universalism , a liberal religious movement that pitches a large enough theological tent to include atheism , religious humanism , liberal christianity , nonchristian theism and much else which may be why the rev william g sinkford , president of the unitarian universalist association , sparked such a reaction this spring when he posed a challenge to its members mr sinkford , who was elected in june 2001 , has been urging the nation s 225 , 000 unitarian universalists to reclaim a vocabulary of reverence he has called the effort a main goal of his presidency of the noncreedal association in recent sermons , talks and articles , mr sinkford said he was struck by the fact that the association s purposes and principles , or mission statement , contain not one piece of traditional religious language , not one word the statement has inclusive generalizations about human dignity , justice and the interdependent web of all existence , but omits mention of god it serves well as a broad ethic , he said , but does not do much to capture our individual searches for truth and meaning explicit religious language would better acquaint people with life s religious depths and ground them in their personal faith , mr sinkford said in a recent interview it would also help liberals wrest religious language back from the religious right , he said in the interview , mr sinkford , a 56yearold onetime businessman and former cardcarrying atheist who turned to ministry 10 years ago , said he was not formally proposing to change the principles , which are bylaws of the association and require a fiveyear process to be altered nor is he saying that any new language , wherever invoked , must mention god , so long as it allows us to capture the possibility of reverence , to name the holy , to talk about human agency in theological terms but it is clear that he is comfortable with that word after his son recovered from a coma in 1997 , mr sinkford began to develop a prayer life centered on thankfulness and gratefulness to god mr sinkford describes his own faith with a reference to the merger , in 1961 , of unitarianism , a liberal offshoot of puritan calvinism that gradually shed its christian identity , and universalism , a small denomination that preached a theology of grace the unitarian side tells us that there is only one god , he said , one spirit of life , one power of love the universalist side tells us that god is a loving god , condemning none of us , valuing the spark of divinity that is in every human being officials of the association say mr sinkford s initiative has generated more email , letters and telephone calls than any other issue in its history a big statement for a contentious group that has had some huge blowups over race , war and gender issues it s tender territory , noted mr sinkford , who said he was talking with hundreds of individuals or groups on the topic but it s a conversation i think we need to have he called it part of the process of unitarian universalism s growing up into a more confident maturity rhoda miller of concord , mass , a member of the unitarian universalist church there who calls herself a rational atheist , said mr sinkford s plea makes me feel that atheists are less welcome in unitarian universalism the rev kendyl gibbons , minister of the first unitarian society of minneapolis and a leader of a national unitarian universalist humanist group , said that some humanists certainly feel threatened by the initiative but she said she did not see the association slipping away from humanists i do n't think sinkford s use of theological language means he s unwilling to be disciplined by reason , she said one former president of the association , william f schulz , executive director of amnesty international usa , said he viewed himself as a religious humanist but supported efforts to use a wide lexicon of religious language i 've long been critical of the position of some humanists that would sanctify secular language and lock us into a calcified rationalism , he said mr sinkford s first sermon on the topic , in texas in january , set off a firestorm of protest from humanists , who flooded a humanist chat room with cries of creeping credalism and warned of a mass exodus from the association that was partly a reaction to a newspaper article that erroneously said mr sinkford had called for including the word god in the principles in an open letter responding to that outcry , mr sinkford said he would not twist anyone s arm to speak of god after that , he said in the interview , people notched down their anxiety mr sinkford said the flexible language of the mission statement dated from efforts in 1961 to find wording acceptable to unitarians and the more traditional universalists , and he noted that the culture had changed since then i think we are seeing a historical cycle , he said i sense a gradual shift in unitarian universalism , away from the unitarian pole of doubt and toward its pole of faith mr sinkford was asked what he thought of the coincidence that his initiative came amid the 200th anniversary of the birth of ralph waldo emerson , who is often linked to unitarian skepticism i'm delighted by that convergence , he said emerson was deeply spiritual , of course , and he wanted people to think for themselves about these matters i see this as the next stage in the conversation he initiated
america will not be able to claim victory in iraq until it secures saddam hussein s missing troves of unconventional weapons , the ingredients for making them and the network of scientists able to produce them this is a longterm challenge but over the next days and weeks , american commanders face an urgent task to make sure that none of this deadly arsenal leaks out to terrorist groups or neighboring states like syria or iran this will not be easy components of every kind of unconventional weapon iraq may have can be smuggled out in compact forms amid throngs of refugees crossing the thousands of miles of borders germ agents and seed stocks can be freezedried , sealed and carried in a shirt pocket nerve gases can be converted into talclike powders washington thought it knew where less than a third of this material was when the war began some of baghdad s biological and chemical agents are in mobile weapons labs the size of rental trucks more complete information has been assembled about the identity of iraq s leading weapons scientists , though not about midlevel engineers , technicians and security officials some experts believe that to avoid detection , iraq may have retained only seed stocks , growth media and the technical knowhow to be able to start up production again quickly these basic ingredients are likely to be hidden at locations known only to a very select group of leading scientists and top regime loyalists this means that the main tools for tracking down iraq s hidden weapons caches must include offers of financial bounties to ordinary iraqis and a pragmatic openness to plea bargaining with detained iraqi security officials and scientists these include leaders of such notorious formations as the special republican guard and the special security organization some of the sadistic members of the iraqi baath leadership may have to be offered a measure of leniency despite years of inspections , the current state of iraq s weapons programs can only be guessed at most estimates start from what iraq was known to have before the 1991 persian gulf war on this basis , iraq is assumed to have substantial quantities of highly lethal biological agents , like anthrax and botulinum toxin , and huge stocks of chemical weapons , notably vx nerve gas and mustard gas most experts believe baghdad s nuclear weapons programs have been fully eliminated it will be necessary to find new civilian work for iraqi weapons scientists who might otherwise be tempted to sell their skills to the highest bidders , including terrorist groups the united states should help set up science centers like those that now provide employment to some former soviet weapons scientists , and the european union and japan should contribute some of the funding continued international inspections and monitoring will be needed for years despite the bush administration s irritation with united nations inspectors , they constitute a cadre of technical experts with important knowledge that should be put to use as soon as possible president bush has declared that keeping unconventional weapons out of the hands of international terrorists is one of his administration s highest goals that objective must guide american actions in iraq now and for many years to come
not since the ascendancy of tyrone power and gregory peck has hollywood been as mesmerized by a pair of bushy male eyebrows as it is by the ebony foliage adorning the forehead of the 26yearold irish actor colin farrell projecting a brooding , blocky machismo that suggests a junior russell crowe , mr farrell is being widely trumpeted as hollywood s next big thing in leading men and like increasing numbers of hollywood stars of both sexes , he is an import mr farrell has appeared in several american films , including tigerland , hart s war and minority report but the first picture he has had to carry largely on his own burly shoulders is the new spy thriller the recruit although aided by al pacino , who once again plays a cackling , craggyfaced mentor with distinctly satanic leanings , mr farrell is given considerably more screen time than his 62yearold costar he also appears opposite ben affleck as the villainous bullseye in the new comicbook thriller daredevil and stars in joel schumacher s forthcoming drama phone booth and if all goes according to plan , next year he will have his gladiator moment as alexander the great in a biopic to be directed by oliver stone for all its market testing , hollywood is n't always on the money when it comes to discovering and grooming future superstars neither matthew mcconaughey nor julia ormond , both of whom were heavily hyped as the next big thing , went on to challenge the boxoffice supremacy of tom cruise or julia roberts mr farrell s progress toward the crown will depend a lot upon his choice of roles in the recruit he plays james clayton , a brilliant , aggressive young computer whiz recruited into the cia by its ace talent scout , walter burke \( mr pacino \) , a cynical , baggyeyed 25year veteran of the agency who looks as if he has n't slept in a decade the young actor s unselfconscious mixture of earnestness and bravado should appeal to both sexes while young male audiences can relate to mr farrell as an amiably rowdy drinking buddy , women can swoon over those eyebrows and his buffed \( and hairless \) torso but for all his glamour and obvious comfort before the camera , mr farrell lacks the intensity of mr crowe none of his performances has begun to convey the sense of an actor turning himself inside out to become someone else he seems content for now to play an archetypal guy s guy who suggests a screen version of that television iconofthemoment , joe millionaire the connections between mr farrell and evan marriott , the roughhewn 28yearold faux prince charming of that fox reality series , go beyond looks and attitude both embody a traditional model of rugged manhood in which intelligence and sensitivity matter less than animal magnetism and a cowboy s swaggering physical ease what s eeriest about the connection between mr farrell s character in the recruit and evan marriott in joe millionaire is that both are rewarded for being worldclass liars the motto drummed into james clayton s head holds that nothing is as it seems mr marriott s assignment is to fool 20 women competing for his favor into thinking he s a wealthy international jet setter when in fact he s a construction worker earning 19 , 000 a year both the recruit and joe millionaire seem a direct reflection of an age of governmental doublespeak in a fearful climate where words and actions often do n't go together no sooner have james and his fellow cia recruit layla \( bridget moynahan \) finished making love than they are secretly hacking into each other s computers hollywood has always treated spies \( at least those on our side \) kindly but has it ever portrayed flagrant mendacity with such drooling adoration \? what s also out of sync , of course , is mr farrell s irish nationality like increasing numbers of male hollywood stars , the actor , with his assumed midatlantic accent , is an import , a faux american if you will others who have taken on american roles with macho images include mr crowe , mel gibson , hugh jackman and guy pearce , all from australia these imports are a breed apart from most of the homegrown stars being groomed as future harrison fords and clint eastwoods mr cruise , hollywood s ultimate yuppie , may be 40 , but he still exudes the geewhiz eagerness of an ambitious college kid leonardo dicaprio , at 28 , is far more at home playing a teenage runaway in catch me if you can than he is as a cocky 19thcentury street fighter in gangs of new york tobey maguire , 27 , and jake gyllenhaal , 22 , both project a dreamy , wideeyed boyishness that s closer in spirit to puberty than to young manhood will smith , 34 , who struggled to project the substance of muhammad ali in michael mann s commercially disappointing biopic , is locked into his image as an eternal teenage prankster , while ben affleck , 31 , and matt damon , 32 , project variations of the same peter pan quality that glints off mr cruise why is it so difficult for young american actors to project a traditional male authority \? does it reflect a lack of professional training \? or has half a century of institutionalized teenage rebellion and the coddling of youth softened and infantilized the american man \? in importing its allamerican heroes , hollywood is sending a message is it a distress signal \?

florence , italy five centuries after michelangelo s david was unveiled in florence s piazza della signoria , there is another contretemps about how to save this icon of youthful beauty from the ravages of time should the marble colossus be restored to its original perfection or simply cleaned of grime \? or should it learn to live with the inevitable streaks and blotches of venerable old age \? in the cradle of the renaissance , whether a major artwork should be cleaned , restored or left untouched is invariably the stuff of intense debate thus , when florence s art establishment decided last year that david needed attention , it acted cautiously it promised only a gentle cleaning of the 14foothigh statue , which has stood inside the galleria dell'accademia since 1873 almost inevitably , a heated battle has ensued agnese parronchi , the experienced restorer first hired to clean the statue , resigned in april , charging that the officially approved method was too harsh and could cause damage now a petition signed by 39 international scholars has proposed suspending any action pending review by an independent commission of experts that said , antonio paolucci , the superintendent of florentine art who has the last word on such matters , stated recently that the cleaning of david would finally begin in september , with a new restorer already named to replace ms parronchi on the other hand , 15 months ago , mr paolucci canceled plans to restore leonardo s adoration of the magi in face of international protests and he is known to dislike scandal for the moment , with david , mr paolucci is playing down the dispute between the wet method proposed by the accademia s director , franca falletti , and the dry method favored by ms parronchi both are gentle methods , both are very light , he explained we do n't have a very serious problem of conservation there are little problems of superficial cleaning nothing dramatic but there is no shortage of passion in the arguments brandished by ms parronchi and ms falletti and their respective supporters , arguments in which science and experience have been marshaled for partisan purposes when ms parronchi was named last september , she seemed perfect for the job , having won acclaim for her cleaning of michelangelo s tombs of the medicis in the medici chapel behind the basilica of san lorenzo and of his two reliefs , madonna of the stairs and battle of the centaurs , in the casa buonarroti in florence once installed at the accademia , working from a mobile ladder in full view of visitors , she spent three months making 360 digital graphics of david her conclusion the statue should be cleaned using a minimally invasive dry method involving soft brushes , cotton swabs , an eraser and a chamois cloth because 'david' stood outside for so long , its pores are open and a lot of dust accumulated , ms parronchi said but this can be easily removed the issue is not one of recovering the sculpture s original look because there is not one millimeter of its original surface left here she was backed by james h beck , a columbia university art historian and president of artwatch international , who has now organized the petition urging mr paolucci to halt the cleaning there was no reason to clean 'david , ' said mr beck , who has frequently campaigned against what he considers unnecessary restorations but if it had to be done , it should be done in the gentlest possible way agnese s approach was merely heavyduty dusting in contrast , ms falletti s case for wet cleaning is based on a report prepared by a committee of scientists from the opificio delle pietre dure , a government artrestoration department after months of testing , they concluded that the greatest threat to david was posed by a light sprinkling of gypsum , a calcium sulphate that responds to humidity they proposed removing this by applying wet poultices using distilled water , which , they said , would also draw the dust out of pores agnese parronchi s method does n't reduce the amount of gypsum , said mauro matteini , who headed the team of scientists it may work aesthetically , but it does n't remove the gypsum also , even if it is gentle , her brushing is a mechanical process why use a mechanical method when you can use a poultice \? ms falletti was even more forthright agnese parronchi s method and material are absolutely unacceptable to us , she said with some irritation the issue is removing the dust , not brushing it round and by definition , you have to brush hard this entire fuss is because an art historian , jim beck , has stirred up other art historians but none of them has ever done a restoration yet such was ms parronchi s opposition to the wet method that she was willing to walk away from what could well have been the most prestigious project of her career the problem with the poultices is that they create a uniform look , she said , noting that the marble has natural colors and veins the issue is not wet or dry , but uniform or not uniform my approach respected all the subtleties in the marble
the intricate web of treaties and international agreements to limit the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons is under siege , influential arms control experts say , and may be unable to deter hostile states or terrorists from acquiring the most lethal weapons we are facing a daunting array of new threats , some of which our existing treaties and agreements probably ca n't solve , said michael l moodie , president of the chemical and biological arms control institute , a nonpartisan research center that sponsored a conference in washington last month complaints about the three socalled pillars of nonproliferation the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty , the 1997 chemical weapons convention and the 1972 biological weapons convention are not new but the cascade of challenges has vastly increased concern experts who attended the meeting in washington and one in monterey , calif , last month warned of the growing sophistication of terrorist groups like al qaeda and their persistent efforts to acquire nuclear , chemical and biological weapons for what bruce hoffman , the head of the washington office of the rand corporation , called mass casualty or megaterrorism w seth carus , deputy director of the center for counterproliferation research at the pentagon s national defense university , warned that terrorists cannot be deterred by existing treaties or emerging tools of equal concern is the weakening of the arms control treaties themselves for the first time , a member of the nuclear treaty group , north korea , has withdrawn from the accord , openly renouncing its pledge not to develop nuclear weapons india , pakistan and israel , none of which signed the treaty , have also suffered few consequences as a result of their decision to acquire nuclear weapons that could encourage other nations to pursue atomic bombs , experts said the bush administration s policies have also come under attack critics like joseph cirincione , senior associate at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington , argued that the administration was undermining nonproliferation norms and alliances by its policies its determination to develop an antiballistic missile shield and a new class of nuclear weapons its abandonment of an international , sixyear effort to strengthen the bioweapons treaty and its attack on iraq as part of its doctrine of preventive war administration officials adamantly dispute such claims , arguing that the terrorist attacks of 9 11 and the anthrax letters that followed underline the limitations of current agreements and the need to propose creative supplements and alternatives don a mahley , the state department s special negotiator for chemical and biological arms control , called other nations' unwillingness to take action against treaty violators like iraq the greatest threat to the arms control regime and the rule of law we need an international community that wo n't play pontius pilate whenever there are obstacles to taking action , he said at the washington meeting others say developments in technology biotechnology , in particular threaten to render current treaties unenforceable advances in technology are moving too fast for international treaties , or even domestic legislation , to catch up , said jean p du preez , a former south african diplomat who directs a nonproliferation program at the center for nonproliferation studies at the monterey institute , which sponsored the california meeting last month and the germ weapons treaty has no enforcement mechanism at all could thousands of new , small , mobile germ production facilities throughout the world ever be monitored to ensure that terrorists do n't use them \? and if nations do not need to stockpile vast quantities of microorganisms and chemicals for weapons , relying instead on fast new production techniques , could treaties stop them \? probably not , many experts agreed , including some of the staunchest defenders of the current arms control system indeed , many criticized loopholes in the treaties , noting that iran and north korea used the antinuclear treaty which was supposed to deter states from acquiring nuclear weapons to secure that very atomic technology and expertise analysts say arms control is also being undermined by secondary proliferation , the sale or trading of goods and expertise by states like pakistan to wouldbe possessors of unconventional arms while washington suspects nearly a dozen countries of violating the treaties banning chemical and biological weapons , officials concede that they usually lack smoking gun evidence of such cheating still , most experts agree that the existing arms control regime , for all its faults , is vital to stop the most dangerous states and groups from getting the most dangerous weapons but there is less agreement on how to respond to the new challenges ashton b carter , a former assistant secretary of defense under president clinton who is now codirector of the harvardstanford preventive defense project , argues for a major renovation of arms control arrangements our entire tool box of counterproliferation measures needs overhaul , he said
when you live in a small neighborhood say , on a cul de sac tucked between rutgers lane and harvard circle in montgomery township just south of the princeton airport you learn about community values most of all you learn that it really does take a village to accomplish something in this case , to destroy the notion that you can do your own thing without worrying if the neighbors will think you 're a jerkandahalf for doing it this is not a rumination on bravely standing up for one s beliefs , though that s important , too no , this is about something more fundamental to life in the suburbs , namely , the politics of being the only one on the block with a snowblower i have been extremely cheap for most of my adult life , and in the past i never would have considered shelling out six big ones for a soupedup shovel for one thing , i know from hard experience that once you start lavishing gifts on yourself , you lose all leverage to complain about your spouse s overspending that s a comfort i ca n't live without on the other hand , i'm as lazy as i am cheap and after the season s first storm , in december , i realized i 'd rather get flattened by the no14 bus to piscataway than lift so much as a forkful of snow ever again i have never been flattened by the no14 bus , but i ca n't believe it would be any worse on the lower back than three hours of shoveling wet snow from here to there i 've heard that eskimos have 250 words for snow i have only one it is a compound word that this newspaper will not print and so i took splurged and when the president s day blizzard came , it presented a sumptuous opportunity to crank up my spanking new , twostage gaspowered , candyapplered cream puff and take her out for a maiden blow along my eight feet of driveway at full throttle , the cream puff makes a conspicuous noise , something akin to the daytona speedway on race day it certainly got everyone s attention soon , questions i had n't previously considered came hard and fast do i offer my services to others \? if so , to whom \? the nextdoor neighbor is a cinch , especially when he outnumbers you in dinner invites 40 to 1 but what about the guy two doors down \? and how do you weigh distance against need \? what about the corporate transfer and his pregnant wife hacking haplessly at a 6foot wall of snow down yonder end of block \? why should i have to come to some other guy s wife s aid \? i 've never even met him let him get his own cream puff let her get a new husband are they even married \? can i raise my kids in a neighborhood where unmarried couples cohabit \? why not \? it s none of my business the clattering ruckus of my machine drew a mix of reactions from the neighbors , from studied indifference to unseemly glances at my whirring augers the block president finally forced the issue hey that s a cream puff , that thing ! he said yep there ought to be a community snowblower there ought to be a law how much that thing cost \? can you show me how to use it \? he asked teach a man to fish , eh \? huh \? no , i do n't want to fish i want you to teach me how to use the snowblower how 'bout it , guy \? how about i teach you how to get to home depot and fill out a credit application \? i am nobody s fool and i welcome confrontation to defend my rights but i have embarrassed my wife many times with such behavior , and i have tried hard to improve and so , after i had finished clearing the block president s driveway , i moved on to his sidewalk , carved out a broad space around his mailbox , tightened the blower s traction cable , gassed her up , and rolled her over to the more deserving folks all around the block they had n't asked for help and probably did n't want any , but now i was boxed in , forced to foist myself on them to save face the corporate transfer and his pregnant wife , however , were giddy as they watched from their kitchen window , hoisting hot cocoas in thanks for having been placed in such a wonderful community with such nice people the whole block took less than four hours i lost a fingertip to frostbite , but my neighbors do n't think i'm a jerk a sap , a mark , a fool , a noise polluter and an overeager helper , yes but technically , not a jerk at least not for this photo drawing \( tom bloom \)
dear diary despite all the complaints about the seemingly unending rain in june , there actually were a few enjoyable side effects across the street from my house , there was a gush of the most beautiful burgundy roses anyone would ever want to see at least 150 farther up the block were the most exquisitesmelling , stunninglooking bright pink peonies i have seen but my favorite find from the deluge came after another rainfilled sunday directly under the awning in front of my building on the sidewalk was a perfectly shaped yellow snail , very much alive and trying , i assumed , to find some dry land i picked it up , took it to my backyard , put it among some nottoowet leaves and hoped for the best when i checked on the snail the next day , it seemed to have happily wandered off a smile crossed my face as i thought that maybe we city folks are not so far removed from nature after all if it takes a deluge for us to see it , so be it carol marsh dear diary i traveled to sun valley , idaho , on the fourth of july weekend , arriving at hailey sun valley airport aboard a puddle jumper from salt lake city as i entered the tiny airport , i saw several dozen people carrying red , white and blue balloons and placards announcing , welcome home , nick while waiting at the car rental counter , i heard shouts of there he is ! and turned to see a crew cut , 20something young man stride into the airport , a duffel bag slung over his shoulder he was immediately swarmed by friends and family , hugging and handshaking and backslapping him in welcome at the same time , a beefy man with bagpipes bearing the nypd logo began playing the marines' hymn , followed by america later , in the parking lot , i overheard the bagpiper , now alone and his new york accent unmistakable , say into a cellphone you would n't believe what i just did i got off the plane and some people asked me whether i 'd play to welcome this marine who was coming home from iraq , so i did it was the perfect start to a lovely weekend leslie r caldwell dear diary on our recent trip to italy , my husband , a friend of ours and i went to lunch at a ristorante down one of those narrow sleeves \( alleys \) that connect the neighborhoods of venice the proprietor encouraged us to sit outside i was wary because of the very narrow walkway right next to the tables , but he convinced me that there would be few passersby at that time of day we had just been given our menus and were talking with the very urbane proprietor , who spoke perfect english , when a group of street vendors carrying huge duffel bags rushed past us and hid in doorways nearby in the areas of venice most frequented by tourists , it is common to see street vendors selling knockoff designer handbags on blankets the scurrying fugitive vendors rushed up and down the alley several times , playing runandhide with the carabinieri who were evidently on one of their cleanup campaigns as we discussed the situation , the proprietor , obviously unhappy that our serenity was being disrupted , blurted out , what we need in venice is mayor giuliani susan bramucci dear diary at the theater recently , the two mid60ish men were having a lively discussion about computers one seemed much more knowledgeable and was instructing the other the lights dimmed , the conversation stopped , and we saw the notebooks of leonardo da vinci about 85 minutes later , the actors took their bows , and the two men took up their conversation without seeming to miss a beat the play had just interrupted them alison goodwin schiff dear diary it was a hot , oppressively humid night , and i thought it would be fun to take my sons , ages 6 and 8 , out for japanese food after their annual checkups as soon as we were seated at the upper west side restaurant , i could tell this was a misguided adventure in parenting the tables were shoehorned together , the airconditioning was n't working , my younger son quickly managed to spill his pineapple juice all over himself and the table , my older one launched all of our chopsticks onto the floor and the staff , wilted from the heat , was nowhere to be found i was thinking of giving up and heading home when my older son pointed to a table nearby and said , look , i think it s the guy from the box of harry potter tapes , which we 'd listened to nonstop the past year indeed , the man bore a striking resemblance to the actor jim dale , who recorded the books on tape and whose photo appears on the packages go ask him if i'm right , my son whispered figuring that the evening was already in a downward spiral , i decided to risk embarrassing myself and went over i asked if the man was indeed the guy from the box of harry potter tapes it was and mr dale graciously said in his mesmerizing voice , let me come meet your boys he left his party and introduced himself to my sons , questioning them about their favorite potter characters and adventures , and explaining his inspiration for the 130plus voices he does on the recording of the new order of the phoenix book \( harry s voice is quite simply a young jim dale \) he returned to his table our tempura still had n't arrived we were still chopstickless the table was still sticky with pineapple juice sweat beaded on everyone s upper lips but none of us minded a bit anymore janet siroto dear diary my husband and i were delighted to see nine recently at the eugene o'neill theater our seats were in the mezzanine , mine on the aisle two women arrived and sat in the seats just behind us alas , the aisle seat on their row had a steep step down to reach the floor the small woman in that seat , whose feet could not touch ground , fidgeted to get comfortable but finally asked if she could place her legs on my armrest to be more comfortable i will always remember antonio banderas and the women of nine and their superb performances as well as the black patent chanel pumps that shared the armrest with me , or dominated it during most of the show jennifer dorn dear diary one recent sunday afternoon , i was walking down broadway and saw a young boy heading in my direction on a bicycle he had a helmet on , and his bike had training wheels as i got closer , i could tell that he was chanting something in a singsong voice , and i figured it was some sort of children s song or something he had picked up from tv finally i got close enough to hear the chant it went like this ladies and gentlemen , this is 96th street transfers available for the 1 and 9 trains shira abilevitz drawings \( drawings by

karbala , iraq , april 22 with pilgrims clogging every road , a police car led a convoy of four or five sport utility vehicles toward a mosque here the convoy was carrying the brother of muhammad bakr alhakim , who leads one of the main exiled opposition parties trying to consolidate its power in iraq a crowd of several thousand pressed around the entrance to a small hotel nearby , where the convoy s occupants had disappeared the crowd chanted , yes , yes , islam , and our blood and soul , we sacrifice for you hakim they were not the only partisans of a particular religious figure expressing such views here today while fervent crowds continued to build for a festival mourning the death of the shiite martyr hussein , who was killed here nearly 1 , 400 years ago , clergy were engaged in a more modern passion play that is defining political divisions among the religious groups competing for leadership of iraq s shiite majority the shiites , who account for at least 60 percent of iraq s population of about 25 million , will play a major , if not dominant role in any democratic system here sunni muslims make up about 37 percent of the population , and christians and others make up the remaining 3 percent the united states hopes to win the shiites' support and block iranian influence but the common thread linking the religious groups here was strong opposition to american influence in iraqi affairs , now that saddam hussein is no longer in power anyone supported by the united states is cursed by us , said sheik kadhem alebadi alnasseri , 30 , a follower of moqtadah alsadr , the son of the late shiite leader muhammad alsadr , who is quickly becoming the most visible power among the shiites in iraq many look toward shiite iran as a friendly power we want an islamic state here similar to the iranian model , said omran kadhem , a doctoral student and public affairs officer at karbala university we tried liberalism , communism and secularism , but none of them worked , so why not try an islamic state \? the brilliant bluetiled gates to hussein s mosque were plastered with posters of rival imams , some now in iran , appealing to the public for support banners and announcements from the dawa party , an iranianbased shiite opposition group , were also scattered throughout the town at karbala s seminary , imams huddled to discuss religious edicts , or fatwas , and offered veiled or outright criticism of their rivals , depending on where they stood in stillshifting alliances of shiite politics byzantine as that world may seem , it is critically important to the united states as it moves into the nationbuilding phase of its iraq program , having pledged to create a stable democracy in place of mr hussein s dictatorship it is not yet clear how responsive the shiite community will be to the religious hierarchy that controls its mosques and provides many of its social services mr sadr s organization has rushed to fill the void left by the collapse of mr hussein s baath party government , setting up administrative offices in major shiite centers around the country , fielding militias to keep the peace and even doling out funds to pay some civil servants' salaries but no one knows whether that effort will translate into popular political support meanwhile , mr sadr s rivals for that support are growing the political maneuvering here is being carried out against the backdrop of an emotional shiite revival , with shiites from across the country performing longbanned rituals of selfflagellation crosscurrents of melodic chanting , hundreds of voices strong , echoed across the center of the city throughout the day as groups of men beat themselves with increasing abandon to the rhythm of the chants their fervor spread like waves into the crowds , the mass thumping of chests quickening pulses and reaching to the blackclad women on balconies lining the streets , who beat their chests as well by nightfall , the mood on the streets had grown electric at about 9 pm , the convoy arrived carrying abdul aziz alhakim , whose brother , muhammad bakr alhakim , leads the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq , a group that is based in tehran but several imams here have already made it clear that neither mr hakim nor his brother would be welcome by everyone he is acting as if he is the most important leader in the iraqi religious opposition , mr nasseri the follower of moqtadah alsadr said of muhammad bakr alhakim he dismissed mr hakim as a politician rather than a religious leader all those who claim to be opposition figures were traitors who left iraq and left us suffering here , he said yet , in a twist that characterizes the complexity of shiite politics , mr nasseri said that mr sadr , who does not have the authority to issue fatwas , had allied himself with an exiled imam in iran , kadhem al haeri that alliance was forged to deflect criticism by iraq s senior cleric , ayatollah ali alsestani mr sestani , who was freed by the american invasion from years of house arrest under mr hussein , has taught that the role of shiite clerics is to offer spiritual guidance without getting involved in the administration of the shiite community the young mr sadr s father , muhammad alsadr , had preached the opposite , advocating religious activism and urging clerics to intervene in their communities he was assassinated in 1999 , presumably on mr hussein s orders since the collapse of mr hussein s government , the young mr sadr has taken up his father s principles , installing clerics in administrative roles across the country and sending them money to get things done his followers openly call for an islamic state along the lines of iran , where shiite clergy would rule our ambition is to establish an islamic state where islamic theory is completely applied , said mr nasseri after all , the shiites are the majority in iraq and if we want to apply the democracy that the west is propagating for iraq , then the government should be elected by the majority , and the majority are shiite but mr sadr has come under criticism from mr sestani s followers because he is not a senior cleric , and many people are disturbed by his growing power earlier this month , mr sestani issued a fatwa advising the clergy against involvement in administrative and executive affairs , and explicitly stating that only fatwas from living clergy should be obeyed a blatant swipe at the many edicts mr sadr has issued based on his father s authority countering mr sestani s criticism , mr nasseri said mr sadr was now backed by fatwas from mr haeri in iran though mr haeri was born in karbala , his ties to mr sadr suggest growing iranian influence in the shiite community here sadr believes in the rule of the religious clergy , which means they should intervene in all aspects of society , whether it be the military or the economy , like ayatollah khomeini did in iran , said mr nasseri i want a shiite cleric to rule iraq , whether it be iraqi or iranian i would rather have someone like mr khomeini rule iraq rather than any secular iraqi photos shiite muslim pilgrims in karbala , iraq , pounded themselves with whips and

fatima \( daughter \) ali hussein \( son \) zaynab \( daughter \) umm kulthum \( daughter \) hasan \( son \) successor to muhammad after the death of muhammad in 632 , there was a divison among

what would you call an election in which voters are presented with only one slate of candidates and informed that votes against that slate will not matter \? how about shareholder democracy \? consider , for a moment , the verizon annual meeting that will be held on april 23 shareholders will be asked to vote for directors chosen by the board s nominating committee , which wants all the incumbents to be reelected there is a place on the proxy card for shareholders to withhold their votes from any director they choose , but that decision will have no effect on the election with no other candidates , the directors will be reelected if they receive even one shareholder vote that process , it should be noted , is common in corporate america i mention verizon because shareholders will also get to vote on a shareholder resolution calling for a change in the system the proposal , by richard a dee , a 72yearold investor who has been offering shareholder resolutions for almost a quartercentury , would require the board to nominate twice as many candidates as there are seats , thus giving voters a choice as it is now , he complained , directors answer only to fellow directors verizon does not like the idea nothing in law requires , the board states in the proxy , that an election provide a choice of candidates , or that shareholders have a 'right' to nominate candidates if there were competing candidates , verizon added , it would be difficult to predict which individuals would be elected some companies allow writein votes for directors , but none allow opposition candidates to be added to the ballot anyone wanting to run against the incumbents must finance his own proxies , with expensive shareholder mailings campaigns to withhold votes from directors cannot oust the directors , although in some cases they have embarrassed companies into changing policies but directors can and sometimes do ignore such protests with impunity verizon and other companies contend that requiring twice as many candidates as seats would be disruptive , and cause some good directors not to run but that argument does not apply to another proposal , to allow candidates to run on the company s ballot if they are nominated by owners of at least 3 percent of the shares this is an attempt to break up the system of coronation and make it a system , when shareholders want it , of a real election and a real choice , said michael zucker , the director for corporate affairs at the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , which tried to get the idea on six corporate proxies this year , including citigroup s the companies resisted allowing shareholders to vote on the proposal , and the staff of the securities and exchange commission concluded that a 1976 sec rule barred such votes it appears that this proposal , the sec explained , would establish a procedure that may result in contested elections of directors the union has appealed that decision to the members of the commission , giving william h donaldson , the new sec chairman , and his colleagues an opportunity to indicate that the term shareholder democracy is not an oxymoron paul s atkins , a commissioner , was careful in a speech last week to say that he was not commenting on the case before the commission but he added should n't shareholders have more say than simply whether they should buy , hold or sell their stock \? just as with socialism , the danger is that if a large number of dispersed people supposedly own something , then in reality no one owns it and oversees it photo paul s atkins
after the first round , jim boeheim surveyed the 32 teams remaining in the ncaa tournament and proclaimed his syracuse team good enough to win the championship true to his glassishalfempty nature , however , he bemoaned the fact that there were too many goodenough teams still alive five days ago , lute olson of arizona and kelvin sampson of oklahoma opined that being an excellent basketball team is not necessarily enough to win a title you also have to be lucky , they said all three coaches were right texas , syracuse , kansas and marquette have played superb basketball over four tournament games to earn their way to the final four but good fortune also blessed them along the way , especially the longhorns and the orangemen , who , on paper at least , had a softer road because of upsets in their regions and who had a decided homecourt advantage sampson was not seeing red about playing syracuse in albany , nor was michigan state coach tom izzo about facing texas in san antonio , but both coaches saw plenty of orange syracuse fans made the twohour drive to albany , turning pepsi arena into a carrier dome annex the cavernous alamodome , 80 short miles from the texas campus in austin , glowed like a hearth as all but a sliver of the crowd favored the burnt orange of the longhorns boeheim correctly pointed out that over his 22 years in the tournament , his teams have traveled to similarly inhospitable sites , but he also acknowledged that this was among the most favorable brackets one of his syracuse teams has had to navigate manhattan was pesky but overmatched sixthseeded oklahoma state had struggled at the end of the regular season and no 10 auburn may have been spent after an overtime victory over no 7 st joseph s and an upset of no 2 wake forest moreover , the topseeded sooners were banged up a groin injury hobbled hollis price and a broken wrist slowed ebi ere as every coach knows , those are the breaks of the game no apologies necessary , especially after the thirdseeded orangemen s 23 zone made an experienced oklahoma team look like a junior high school team the longhorns are the only topseeded team to make the final four , but in three of the four games , texas faced teams seeded lower than had been projected , culminating with no 7 michigan state in the south final texas also benefited from perhaps the unluckiest bounce of the tournament when , with 351 seconds left in the regional semifinal against connecticut , a layup attempt by the huskies' marcus white became wedged between the rim and the backboard instead of uconn tying the score at 7878 , texas got the ball , because the possession arrow was in its favor those are the breaks as well secondseeded kansas and thirdseeded marquette could not have been built more perfectly to make their own good fortune the jayhawks' kirk hinrich and nick collison took turns saving each other in the west , which was hands down the toughest and most exciting region in the tournament in the regional semifinals against duke , hinrich was 1 of 9 from the field for 2 points , while collison produced a careerhigh 33 points , 19 rebounds and 3 blocked shots in the final against topseeded arizona , hinrich scored 28 points , 18 of them on 3pointers , while collison shot 2 of 7 and scored 8 points both players are seniors who are in their second straight final four does that remind you of anyone , say last year s champion , maryland , with juan dixon and lonny baxter \? then there are the golden eagles of marquette , a team that survived the most harrowing path to new orleans they beat holy cross by 4 points , 7268 , shot 6 for 6 in overtime to get past missouri , 10192 , then needed brandin knight to miss a gametying 3pointer to outlast pittsburgh , 7774 what would have happened if kentucky s keith bogans had not sprained his ankle and instead was at full strength in the midwest final \? lucky \? yes how about this for good , if not great marquette s dwyane wade had 29 points , 11 rebounds and 11 assists against the wildcats in the tournament , he is averaging 226 points , 68 rebounds and 63 assists so what happens four days from now in new orleans , when syracuse meets texas and kansas faces marquette \? careful readers will note that none of my projected final four teams made it to the big easy they were good teams kentucky and oklahoma lost in regional finals , duke and connecticut in the semifinals but in the parlance of coaches with far more experience and knowledge of college basketball , those teams , alas , were unlucky still , we will try again let s look at the great players capable of carrying their teams carmelo anthony of syracuse versus the national player of the year , t j ford of texas hinrich and collison of kansas versus wade of marquette next , let s gauge their age and final four experience anthony , a freshman ford , a sophomore and wade , a junior , have never been this far hinrich and collison lost in the national semifinals as juniors last year finally , let s look at the men sitting at the end of the bench boeheim , who is 3621 in ncaa tournaments , has won the most tournament games without winning a championship kansas' roy williams is third boeheim is making his third final four appearance , williams his fourth rick barnes of texas and tom crean of marquette are reaching the championship round for the first time syracuse meets kansas in the final , and let s see who gets lucky photo jim boeheim and syracuse enjoyed a softened schedule in the east regional \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
los angeles , july 1 california began its new fiscal year today living on borrowed time and borrowed money as state officials remained locked in a seemingly unending dispute over how to resolve a record 38 billion deficit for the 17th time in the past 25 years , california s legislature failed to pass a budget by the constitutional deadline of june 30 lawmakers and statewide elected officials will receive no paychecks until a budget is signed into law , and some payments for community colleges , local street repairs and the university systems will be delayed the state will continue to operate as long as it can on a dwindling balance of 5 billion from the june sale of revenue anticipation notes , a pool that will run dry sometime in august , budget officials said california s problem remained the most intractable in the nation as other states staggered across their budget deadlines with stopgap solutions , shortterm spending plans and continued debate over the most contentious budget items legislatures in new hampshire and oregon passed shortterm budgets , while the governors of massachusetts and north carolina signed lastminute budgets on monday , the last day of the fiscal year gov john g rowland of connecticut signed an executive order on monday to keep the state government operating for a week even though the final details of several state budgets have yet to be completed , it is clear that spending at the state level will fall in absolute terms for the first time in 20 years , according to the national association of state budget officers that is a very , very unusual occurrence and it shows that the fiscal crisis is much worse than we anticipated , said scott pattison , executive director of the group mr pattison noted that in 2000 , the states had a cumulative 488 billion in reserves or rainy day funds at the end of june , all but about 6 billion of that had been spent , a level well below what is considered an acceptable fiscal cushion to address these problems , governors in 29 states are seeking to raise revenues , although most have shied away from broadbased taxes on income and sales because of their political unpopularity new york , bucking the trend , raised both income and sales taxes to help close an 115 billion deficit the state also relied on a variety of onetime revenues and borrowed 42 billion against expected payments from the nationwide settlement with tobacco companies the fiscal year that just ended brought deep spending cuts in 28 states , in many cases with additional reductions imposed in the middle of the year that pattern is likely to be repeated in the next year unless the economy improves , according to ray scheppach , executive director of the national governors association in the last two years , you saw midyear cutting of 12 billion to 14 billion , mr scheppach said i would expect another 5 billion to 10 billion this year even if the economy rebounds , he added , the rapid rise in medicaid costs now roughly 8 percent a year would swallow virtually all the new revenue education will be competing with health care in the shark pen , he said the long run does n't look pretty budget woes have been exacerbated by disputes over the taxesversusspending conflict that has stalled solutions , most notably in california , where republicans are refusing to consider any plan that includes new taxes as a result , states are raising money in inventive ways fees will rise on studded tires in alaska , mobilehome inspections in florida , traffic fines in iowa , birth certificates in new york and filing lawsuits in vermont , according to the governors association illinois is increasing taxes on admission to riverboat casinos , utah is raising fees on hazardous waste storage and virginia has imposed new fees for serving subpoenas smokers will pay higher taxes in a dozen states , and drinkers will pay more for liquor in a halfdozen fuel taxes will rise in alaska and michigan still , no state governments shut down at the stroke of midnight today gov kenny guinn of nevada went to court at 12 01 am today to sue the state assembly for failing to pass a budget by the monday deadline the legislature in that historically taxaverse state is divided over how to finance public education for the next two years the governor asked the state supreme court to circumvent the legislature and raise as much as 165 billion to finance the state s fastgrowing school districts lawmakers in new jersey reached a tentative agreement late monday to raise 600 million to 700 million in new or increased taxes to balance the state s 24 billion budget the agreement includes a steep rise in cigarette taxes , new hotel taxes and an increase in fees on real estate transactions the budget slashes propertytax rebates to homeowners and reduces aid to colleges and universities , arts groups and state operations in massachusetts , gov mitt romney signed a 22 billion budget and then vetoed 201 million in spending items approved by the legislature the budget tries to address a 3 billion deficit , imposing deep cuts on colleges and universities , education and local governments the final plan includes about 500 million in new fees but no acrosstheboard tax increases in oregon , where revenues have dropped sharply in recent years , resulting in substantial program cuts , state officials approved a continuing budget resolution on monday that allowed the government to operate as legislators worked on a biennial budget for 2003 through 2005 legislators are considering a variety of options for restoring money to programs , including enacting a state sales tax for the first time the pennsylvania legislature , which passed a budget in record time in march , has still not completed work on a proposal by gov ed rendell to raise the state s income tax by 22 billion to pay for education and property tax relief so while the state has an overall spending plan in place , none of the bills required to finance state operations have been enacted , said the governor s press secretary , kate philips new hampshire adopted a continuing resolution on monday , allowing the state to keep operating for three months as lawmakers and the governor wrangle over the state s proposed 88 billion twoyear budget the state , which has been somewhat insulated from the recent economic recession because it does not rely on taxes from income , sales or capital gains , is in a dispute over how to treat onetime revenues gov craig benson vetoed the budget over its treatment of the disposition of income from the federal government and savings from selfinsuring state workers california , with an estimated 38 billion twoyear budget deficit , remains the nation s fiscal basket case gov gray davis announced today that he was extending a statewide hiring freeze and eliminating as many as 20 , 000 vacant state positions for an immediate savings of 250 million , which would pay about one day s operating expenses he pleaded with lawmakers to put aside their partisan differences and pass a budget by the end of the week last year , the budget impasse was not resolved until the end of august and the stakes were considerably lower then i urge both parties to redouble their efforts to find common ground , mr davis said as he signed the order to cut jobs that is what people elected us to do

boston , april 25 the archdiocese of boston today announced its first fundraising campaign under bishop richard g lennon , seeking to raise 9 million in a diocese where donations have plummeted and budgets have been slashed since the sexual abuse scandal exploded here 15 months ago this year s target is well below last year s projected goal of 174 million the diocese collected 86 million through the campaign last year and 162 million in 2001 the appeal provides operating money for programs including schools , innercity parishes and spiritual formation classes damien j devasto , director of the appeal , said the sexual abuse scandal and the sluggish economy were the main reasons for lowering the goal the archdiocese also did not want to detract donors from its capital campaign , a twoyear , 300 million fundraising drive begun in 2001 that is projected to fall nearly 100 million short it s been a painful year , a challenging year , mr devasto said the fundraising drive announced today comes with a new name the annual catholic appeal formerly called the cardinal s appeal , the name was changed in response to anger with the way cardinal bernard f law handled the sexual abuse scandal cardinal law resigned in december and bishop lennon assumed the post in an interim role the diocese is in a difficult financial position as a result of its decrease in donations , its budget for the next fiscal year must be trimmed by 4 million the archdiocese plans to close a number of schools , to leave some administrative positions vacant and to pare down programs bishop lennon said today that none of the money collected through the annual appeal , the capital campaign or church offerings would be used to settle continuing litigation in the sexual abuse cases officials assured church members of this in a pamphlet describing details about the campaign it says the archdiocese will use a combination of insurance money and the liquidation of assets to settle the suits it has already begun to look into the possible sale of property bishop lennon said today that the archdiocese wanted to settle all lawsuits there are active conversations going on at this time regarding coverage by insurance companies , he said but jeffrey newman , a lawyer for plaintiffs in the abuse suits , said he was surprised by bishop lennon s comments settlement talks have not been productive , mr newman said , and he has advised his clients to prepare for litigation the two sides are in a 90day litigation moratorium , during which they are to focus on settlement the period ends on may 20 the archdiocese has not placed any settlement proposals on the table , mr newman said , and there has been little communication between the sides
it is time for washington , including democrats , to start reconsidering economic policy once again just when economists began telling us the clouds were lifting , the june unemployment rate jumped to a nineyear high of 64 percent despite a modestly rising gross domestic product , some 236 , 000 jobs have been lost in 2003 and 26 million since early 2001 furthermore , we too often forget that if jobs are not created and wages do not start rising robustly , what little recovery there has been will peter out many people criticized president bush s growth policies mostly tax cuts on income and dividends weighted toward the welloff for providing too little bang for a buck s worth of stimulus this seems ever truer but democrats have not done much better their rallying cry has generally been to favor tax reduction , just not as much there are better alternatives one is to concentrate government stimulus in areas that produce a high number of wellpaying jobs these include capital spending and many federal and state programs , from education and health care to transportation infrastructure by contrast , consumer spending in general is less likely to create as many good jobs thus , stimulating consumption through individual tax cuts is not the best tonic for these times before we consider this further , we should clear away some misconceptions many argue that times are not bad , or the turn is just around the corner but the economy has been losing jobs for a longer period than in any other recession since world war ii and the 64 percent rate understates the severity of the problem because many more people have dropped out of the labor force a historically more accurate estimate is 7 to 75 percent moreover , the average number of weeks the unemployed cannot find a job is higher than at any time since 1983 , in the aftermath of the worst postwar recession and few economists believe that the economy will grow fast enough to add jobs in the next two years finally , the unemployment rate does not merely mean that two or three million more americans are suffering without jobs it is an indicator of weakness throughout the labor market there are fewer promotions or raises , there are fewer benefits , and there is rising insecurity jared bernstein of the economic policy institute points out that average weekly earnings are growing slowly again , if at all in the first quarter , they were down after inflation in the second quarter , they were certainly weak again the president seems determined to stick to his poorly designed programs , but one would think this would be an opportunity for potential democratic challengers to come up with fresh ideas so far , there is silence james medoff , a harvard university economist , has explored the jobcreating benefits of different categories of spending his main research , sponsored by the center for national policy , and based on the commerce department s inputoutput analysis , was done in the early 1990 s but he has completed a partial updating and says the conclusions still apply today mr medoff created a measure that included the number of jobs produced by a dollar of spending and the level of pay and benefits those jobs provided combining the two resulted in a labor market score he then examined how highly capital investment , consumption and various government spending programs scored that is , added good jobs to the economy private investment in durable goods did especially well , mr medoff found , creating a reasonable number of jobs on average but ones that pay especially well thus , more capital investment is an excellent way to create good jobs but the nation s spending on education programs did even better it created many more jobs per dollar spent , and they paid fairly well , if not as well as jobs derived from capital spending government health care spending also produced many wellpaying jobs other government spending programs conducive to good job growth were for highways , water and air facilities , and police and firefighters military spending also added good jobs , but not at an equivalent rate the weakest jobcreating spending on average was consumption itself , which is exactly what is driving the economy today tax cuts of both democrats and republicans are intended to stimulate just that but such spending may well not create an adequate number of jobs , partly because so much leaks to imports mr medoff updated the study to find out what the quality of jobs has been in the current administration he finds that the score , combining number of jobs with quality , has declined almost as rapidly in this administration as it did in the first bush administration on average , over the course of the clinton administration , the score rose the lack of job creation for so long has been a mystery to many , it suggests business is simply more productive but most models link rising productivity to growing capital investment , and capital investment has been sinking for three years more likely , business is cutting back on labor aggressively to maintain profit margins rising measures of productivity are truly meaningful when both efficiency and the number of jobs are growing simultaneously a sensible new economic program , therefore , would reject individual tax cuts and emphasize government spending that creates jobs this could include adequate transfer of money to the states as much as 100 billion it could also include seriously financing the president s new education bill , which has been neglected a drug prescription plan for medicare that is more generous than what congress is considering new ideas about providing health insurance to those who have none and innovative investment in transportation infrastructure capital spending is usually harder to stimulate directly , although generous new depreciation allowances have already been created given the disturbing state of the economy , a jobs program is what the nation now needs it might even be just what the electorate wants to hear chart the shrinking paycheck weekly earnings fell in the first quarter of this year , a sign of weakness in the job sector graph tracks the annual rate

jerusalem , oct 3 the israeli military has filed manslaughter charges against an army officer in the killing of four palestinians , including three children , at an outdoor food market last year , the army said friday the indictment says the four were killed when the officer , identified only as a lieutenant , ordered the firing of tank shells and machine guns to enforce a curfew palestinians and human rights groups have accused israeli troops of unprovoked shootings of civilians during the past three years of fighting , but say such cases are seldom investigated b'tselem , an israeli human rights group , said this case was the ninth time in the past three years that the military had indicted troops on charges of illegally using deadly force the cases are at various stages in israel s military courts , and none have been resolved , the group said in the latest indictment , the israeli officer is accused of ordering tank crews to fire shells and machine guns to drive palestinians off the street during a curfew on june 21 , 2002 , in jenin , in the northern west bank the shooting killed a 6yearold girl , sojud shohaneh , along with two boys , brothers ages 13 and 5 , and a 53yearold man five palestinians were hurt , three of them children the trial has not yet begun for the officer , who is also charged with causing grievous bodily harm sojud s father , ahmad turki shohaneh , told b'tselem that he had taken his children to the market near the center of jenin to buy food around midday because they believed that the israeli military curfew had been lifted after three days , and shops were beginning to open but while shopping , he heard intense bursts of gunfire people began to run in all directions , and i immediately went to my car and put my children , who were next to the car , inside , mr shohaneh said as he was driving away , he heard his children screaming , and saw that his son nail was wounded i did not stop , and continued driving to get out of gunfire range , mr shohaneh said when i left the market , i stopped to see how nail was i picked sojud up to move her away from nail when i lifted her , i was shocked to see her lifeless body in a rare admission , the israeli military issued a statement hours after the shooting that said an initial inquiry indicates the force erred in its action at the time , israeli troops had just reentered palestinian cities throughout the west bank in response to a series of suicide bombings israeli forces usually announce the imposition and the lifting of curfews over loudspeakers , but palestinian residents say they do not always hear them and take to the streets when they see other palestinians heading out of their homes the israeli forces remain on the outskirts of the west bank cities today , and make almost daily sweeps to arrest palestinians suspected of involvement in violence

london , oct 31 across europe and the middle east , young militant muslim men are answering a call issued by osama bin laden and other extremists , and leaving home to join the fight against the americanled occupation in iraq , according to senior counterterrorism officials based in six countries the intelligence officials say that since late summer they have detected a growing stream of itinerant muslim militants headed for iraq they estimate that hundreds of young men from an array of countries have now arrived in iraq by crossing the syrian or iranian borders but the officials say this influx is not necessarily evidence of coordination by al qaeda or other terrorist groups , since it remains unclear if the men are under the control of any one leader or what , if any , role they have had in the kind of deadly attacks that shook baghdad on monday a european intelligence official called the foreign recruits foot soldiers with limited or no training a senior british official , who was in iraq in september , said most of the foreign men captured there were from the middle east syria , lebanon and yemen or north africa he described them as young , angry men motivated by the antibritish , antiamerican rhetoric that fills their ears every day signs of a movement to iraq have also been detected in europe jeanlouis brugui re , france s top investigative judge on terrorism , said dozens of poor and middleclass muslim men had left france for iraq since the summer he said some of them appeared to have been inspired by exhortations of qaeda leaders , even if they were not trained by al qaeda mr brugui re , who earlier this year opened an investigation of young men leaving france to fight on the side of muslims in chechnya , said the traffic to iraq was now a similar problem he called the changing pattern a new threat the rising agitation in parts of the muslim world over the americanled occupation in iraq was clear at friday prayers at al nur mosque in a workingclass section of berlin dr izzeldin hamad , the director of the saudifinanced mosque , said political discussion was banned there but outside , a 21yearold man who identified himself as akmed said that while saddam hussein was unpopular , now there are people who are angry about the american occupation he and others said that inside the mosque , collections usually requested for muslims in palestine and chechnya were now being offered for iraq as well an initial hint that iraq would become a magnet for foreign recruits came just before the war began in march , with the arrest in syria of four algerian men , who had been living in hamburg and attending a mosque frequented by three of the sept 11 hijackers the authorities believed that the men intended to fight in iraq one of them , abderazak mahdjoub , whom german investigators have linked to a spanishbased terror network , is under investigation for alleged involvement in a planned terror strike on a tourist location on the costa del bravo in spain syria deported the men to germany , but none of the four men is in custody , since there is no german law against going to iraq a senior german intelligence official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the authorities had detected other cases of immigrants in germany trying to go to iraq we know that in germany there are people in the militant muslim scene who are willing to go other places to participate in jihad , including iraq , the official said there are scattered reports from other places , including saudi arabia , where a senior saudi official said two saudi militants , believed to have ties to al qaeda , were missing from the kingdom and believed by the authorities to have gone to iraq intelligence officials , who base their assessment of the traffic into iraq on surveillance of mosques and islamic centers and on interrogations of terrorist suspects captured inside iraq , say they have found no connections between the recruits nobody is organizing this move from europe to iraq , a senior european counterterrorism official said at least it is difficult to analyze and know who is organizing this this may be just the beginning of a new phenomenon united states troops patrolling the long iraqsyria border have said they have not detained any foreign recruits entering iraq , but officials investigating attacks on allied targets say they have little question that militant muslims are being drawn to the country it s pretty clear their number is increasing , a senior american official said the number of attacks is also increasing in the last week , the average number of attacks against allied or international relief targets exceeded two dozen a day , from 12 attacks daily in july this week s attacks produced some evidence of the role of foreigners in iraq one wouldbe suicide bomber who was shot and wounded by iraqi policemen was later identified as a man of yemeni descent who was holding a syrian passport in addition , monday s multiple , coordinated suicide bombings were a sign to some investigators that foreign terrorists may have added a level of sophistication to the attacks
tokyo , aug 1 michio shimazawa is a fan s fan , a rabid follower of the pittsburgh steelers if only the national football league could clone him a university professor in his 50 s , shimazawa has followed the steelers since their heyday in the 1970 s he can reel off names like terry bradshaw , rocky bleier and jack lambert without skipping a beat he has never seen a game in person , yet his enthusiasm for american football remains undiminished i like the variety , the passing , the blocking , the running , said shimazawa , who checks two japaneselanguage web sites for steelers fans daily and once visited three rivers stadium in the offseason the steelers do n't have a lot of money to buy the best players , but they have good teamwork fans of american football like shimazawa are the exception in japan , where baseball , soccer and sumo wrestling dominate the sports landscape the nfl has tried for years to develop a network of fans , players and teams in japan , the country with the world s secondlargest gross national product , but progress has been slow and uneven still , the nfl will continue its attempt to win over the japanese on saturday , when the tampa bay buccaneers , the defending super bowl champions , play the jets at the tokyo dome in the league s preseason opener \( the game will start at 5 am eastern time \) the game , called the american bowl , first came to japan in 1989 , when the economy was booming and a visit by foreign teams was considered exotic several super bowl champions and marquee players like joe montana and emmitt smith helped draw huge crowds and ignite talk that a pro league would someday start in japan by the mid1990 s , though , recession and familiarity had taken some of the shine off the game attendance slipped and ticket prices remained high meanwhile , fans were drawn to an emerging soccer league and became interested in following bigname japanese baseball players in the united states the nfl no longer comes to japan every year the league continues to promote football through licensing agreements and television contracts , and with grassroots activities like teaching flag football several japanese players have joined nfl europe teams but any chance of developing a pro league , as the nfl has in europe , remains remote because the number of fans , however loyal , is still small you need three resources to build a league fans , broadcasters and sponsors , but none are in enough supply right now , said munehiko harada , a professor at osaka university of health and sports sciences a professional league is not realistic now despite its limited support , football has deep roots in japan the game arrived in 1934 when paul rusch , an american teaching here , helped form several teams the sport grew after world war ii , thanks partly to the presence of the united states military today , 224 colleges field teams , with more than 9 , 000 players fewer than half as many high schools have teams , though compared with baseball and soccer , two of the most popular team sports , football requires large amounts of equipment and money , not to mention big fields , which are in short supply in japan s densely populated cities japanese athletes also tend to play one sport yearround , so it is harder to recruit players in the 1970 s , japan s largest companies formed the xleague , which now includes 71 teams in four tiers , much like in soccer some games are televised , but attendance is sparse and most seats are filled with team members' family and coworkers layoffs and costcutting have made it hard for teams to field squads made up entirely of employees , so some players freelance for rival companies with budgets squeezed , corporations are unlikely to funnel more money into their teams , which have only limited appeal as an advertising vehicle when the fan base is small even the best teams have budgets of about 2 million , hardly enough to pay for the resources and the players needed in a professional league then there is the task of finding fans like shimazawa most japanese view football as a sport for huge men who like to test their machismo by wearing shoulder pads and butting heads one of the challenges we face is overcoming the perception that the sport is violent , said gordon smeaton , vice president of nfl international small guys feel small when they watch the game on television so we 're teaching people that football is not so hard to play to do this , the nfl is weaving its way into school curriculums about 160 , 000 elementary school and junior high school students now play flag football in japan the nfl also helps teams acquire the equipment they need video football games have also sold well in japan the nfl has made headway on college campuses , too ritsumeikan university in kyoto , which won this year s rice bowl to become the nation s top team , has the only sports marketing class in the world devoted entirely to the nfl joe taneda , who has taught the class for three years , said his students wanted to learn how professional leagues really worked in japan , the athletes are professional because they are paid to play , but the teams and leagues are not run well , taneda said he said 500 students signed up for his class this year sports management is still a new field in japan most teams are run by executives more interested in putting their logos on jerseys than in finding good players to wear those jerseys in baseball , only the tokyo yomiuri giants are said to make money minor league systems are thin , and players are treated more like employees than specialists this attitude toward organized sports and player development is perhaps the biggest hurdle if the nfl ever pursues a fullfledged professional league in the meantime , the nfl will have to keep searching for the next generation of diehard fans like shimazawa photos in japan , sports like baseball , sumo wrestling and soccer , right , have captivated fans , leaving little room for football cheerleaders from waseda university in tokyo helped welcome the nfl to their campus in may \( photographs by associated press \) \( pg d1 \) the nfl continued its attempt to win over the japanese when raymond adams and the jets played the buccaneers today at the tokyo dome \( photo by associated press \) \( pg d5 \)
positively fifth street murderers , cheetahs , and binion s world series of poker by james mcmanus illustrated 422 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 26 it s a safe wager that professional poker players are n't very good writers , but it s also better than even money that adept writers are , or could be , cunning poker players , for they come to understand motive and risk and instinctively realize that you ca n't win if you do n't bet james mcmanus bet big and won his positively fifth street , an exhilarating chronicle of the 2000 world series of poker in las vegas , will go on the shelf with the classic that inspired it , the biggest game in town , a alvarez s account of the 1981 event harper s magazine sent mcmanus , a novelist who teaches at the school of the art institute of chicago , to report on the poker tournament he received an advance for expenses but had another idea my ulterior plan was to use the 4 , 000 check , he writes , to try to play my way into the championship , which costs 10 , 000 to enter mcmanus began playing poker when he was 9 and participates in a local game at which 1 , 000 pots are common obviously he loves the game , and he s not alone some 60 million to 80 million americans play why \? poker , like that other great american pastime with a world series , is something you either get or you do n't and poker is a lot like baseball just listen to mcmanus in both contests position , aggression and stealing are critical , but patience is what turns out to be the most necessary virtue baseball and poker players spend most of their time waiting , getting into position and strategizing , but once every nine chances or so they really do have to come through if you do n't see that analogy , mcmanus is capable of raising you , going highbrow , quoting , for example , the scholar john lukacs , who called poker the game closest to the western conception of life where men are considered moral agents , and where at least in the short run the important thing is not what happens but what people think happens betting large amounts of money can induce guilt , of course , and to deal with that issue mcmanus divides his personality into good jim and bad jim in offering up reasons , or at least humorous rationalizations , for his attraction to gambling , bad jim , never immune to digressions , is not above invoking such things as the genius of dostoyevsky , game theory , even evolutionary biology macho oneupmanship strikes many people as trivial and pathetic , and no doubt they 're right , but it s also a fact that without this competitive ardor , humans would be long extinct one reason we 're not is that the sociobiological legacy of our days as huntergatherers causes levels of testosterone , the primary hormone of both male and female desire , to rise by as much as a third when the local team does well he shoots , he scores ! and later that night , so do we but bad jim also has some excuses for gambling that make sense writing poetry , he says , is a habit that s much more expensive the most i have earned for a poem is 100 , and that poem took eight months to write usually i earn much , much less yet i'm treated to no sermons about that risky , acumenproving habit who can fault that logic \? good jim is conscious of , and sensitive to , his large mortgage , how deep he is into his home equity line , his children and his extremely understanding wife a responsible journalist , he tells her when he reveals his plan not only to cover the championship but also to play in it , needed actual table experience to capture the rhythms and texture of the hairraising brand of nolimit texas hold 'em that decides the world championship , right \? krakauer on everest , i mentioned mcphee in alaska you can picture her expression still , good jim never bets the grocery money he pays for his gambling with his winnings and with the money he makes writing essays and book reviews it s a fund to which this publication has occasionally contributed , albeit rather minutely to prepare himself for the competition , mcmanus bones up on the game \( if you 're ever crazy enough to want to play poker with the pros , he tells you which books are essential reading \) and plays tens of thousands of hands against computer programs these poker programs will beat the average player but unlike their brethren , the chess programs , they ca n't compete with the best players that s because , unlike chess , poker involves deception , cheating really despite all their advances , computers still have a hard time distinguishing between erratic play \( stupidly misplaying a hand \) and stealing a huge pot with a spectacular bluff then the two jims are off to las vegas and binion s horseshoe casino benny binion began gambling operations in texas until for complicated reasons he left \( my sheriff got beat in the election is how he summed it up \) in 1946 he piled his family and 2 million in cash into his cadillac and drove to las vegas , where , with the help of meyer lansky , he set up business in 1951 he opened binion s horseshoe never a rat pack hangout , the horseshoe is the bastion of oldtime serious gambling , the last familyowned casino in america and the gem in downtown las vegas s desperate , and probably doomed , attempt to compete with the disneyfied palaces that line the strip to the south benny binion died in 1989 , leaving his children to fight over his casino for a time it was run by ted binion , one of his sons , who , like benny , was known for never backing down from a bet but ted had problems , a fondness for heroin being only one of them a historian of gambling tells mcmanus that ted possessed all of his father benny s bravado and none of his insight and good sense this became apparent in 1998 , when he was murdered in a particularly gruesome fashion by his girlfriend , a former topless dancer , and her other boyfriend , one of ted s ostensible friends

the 65yearold memory of sept 21 , 1938 , remains etched in my mind that afternoon , quite suddenly , a fierce wind began to blow against our house on mackey avenue in port washington it made my father very jumpy we were new to the east , but had n't been warned of anything like this ! although the wind was very frightening , and we were without phones or electricity , nothing really very serious happened to us we were some of the lucky ones but the hurricane of 1938 was a far more dangerous adventure for frank , my late husband we met in high school frank began telling me the story that follows about two weeks after we met , and retold it as often as anyone would listen frank still lived in college point , queens , in 1938 , but his family kept their 43foot alden schooner , the lady jane , off port washington s town dock his dad had gone to work the day of the big wind frank went to school , but came home early , his school closed because of the terrible weather at 3 o'clock , he was not surprised to see his dad , charlie , come home , too dad had a bit of soup , then said , hey , skipper , do you want to take a drive to port washington and see how the lady jane is doing \? immediately his mother and father fell into a shouting match no , you must n't ! his mother cried stay home and look after us ! eventually frank , then 14 , and his dad set out in their quitenew packard the sight of the sound was not reassuring big waves , strong current , many overturned small boats but they pressed forward driving south on college point boulevard toward northern boulevard , the main eastwest thoroughfare in those preparkway days , they came to the tidal inlet at the foot of flushing meadow , below downtown flushing as charlie directed the packard through the low area , he suddenly turned white as a sheet and shouted , skipper , get out of the car now ! as frank opened the door , he looked toward the sound and saw an enormous mass of water , loaded with debris , hurtling toward them he later told me that was the first time he thought he was going to die immediately , he was under water , tumbled about , unsure which way was up and wondering what he would do if he made it to the surface though the water was full of sediment , one direction was faintly lighter , so he swam toward it , short of breath and full of dirty salt water as he neared the surface , he saw one end of a footthick wooden pole , and used the last bit of strength to get one arm around the pole and his head above water with difficulty , he caught his breath , in spite of the sharp wind , and shivered with relief but what could he do \? he was a long , long way from shore but as he peered through the twilight , joy spread through him at the other end of the pole , placed there as if by unseen hands , was his dad he moved toward his father , and his father moved toward him , and soon they were shouting to each other , trying to reason in their dreadful situation the hurricane continued silently they prayed and hoped it was two hours later , they estimated , that the wind and water quieted , and with darkness , they could see lights some distance away from time to time , they lustily bellowed for help , and within another hour , they were hauled up and into a sturdy small boat the police recommended a visit to a hospital , but charlie would have none of it , and the squad car drove them home each took a warm bath , got into pajamas and enjoyed hot coffee and crumb cake at 11 pm , charlie announced that he would be getting an early start next morning and where would you be going \? his wife asked why , to port washington , of course , to see about the boat frank s mother stomped off to bed so charlie borrowed a car and he and frank took off on a wild and wacky ride , skirting beached boats and debris on the road when they arrived at the town dock they were thrilled to see the lady jane , perky as ever , swinging safely on her mooring , surrounded by overturned boats in two more days , they located the packard buried in mud , forever useless they learned that the occupants of other cars caught on that stretch of road had died in that storm surge into flushing meadow and to think how much worse it must have been near the center of the storm , which passed to the east at least 60 miles from where they almost lost their lives !
no one believes andy dunkinson when he tells them how he spends his time on monday and wednesday nights if only more people knew about this , mr dunkinson said , still dripping wet as he stood outside the university of bridgeport s pool recently after playing two hours of his favorite sport underwater hockey i tell people at work and they all think i'm winding them up that s understandable like the 20 other diehards who drive to bridgeport from all over the northeast twice a week to play underwater hockey , metaphorically speaking , mr dunkinson is swimming in the deep end of the american sporting pool although popular particularly in australia , south africa and england \( where the 37yearold mr dunkinson hails from \) , underwater hockey is obscure in the united states the bridgeport club is one of three in the state smaller clubs operate at the university of connecticut and in east lyme , but bridgeport is the only option for anyone to the south including mr dunkinson , who comes from new jersey , and several players who travel from new york nationwide , there are no more than two dozen clubs , according to players , with only one program at the high school level , in cincinnati accessibility is the problem here , said mr dunkinson , who drives almost two hours to connecticut , but is trying to start a club closer to his home at rutgers university it s hard to get pools in the states , but in australia and england , they 're teaching the sport from the time you 're in proper school by all accounts , the game was developed in britain during the 1950 s , but did n't make it to america until the mid1970 s , where it first surfaced in chicago it is played by two teams of six players , each of whom wears a snorkel , mask and fins and plunges underwater in attempts to push a threepound puck across the pool and into an unguarded , ninefootwide goal this is all done by using a shortened stick , about a foot long , resembling half a boomerang it s a lot to get accustomed to , said tom croteau , a stratford resident who found out about the sport through a local newspaper ad five years ago i had never even snorkeled before i played a lot of sports , but this is like running the bases holding your breath according to its more enthusiastic participants , underwater hockey combines everything exciting and challenging about snorkeling , water polo , ice hockey , swimming and even free diving not just a hobby to some of the men who play it , the sport is described in terms one would for a drug phrases like this is an addiction and it s like flying are thrown around the olympicsized pool in bridgeport if it tells you anything , said scott lapham , a 10year veteran of the sport i 've had knee surgery , back surgery , and six months ago , a quad bypass and i'm still here lapham , of milford , was turned onto underwater hockey when his boss recommended he try it instead of snorkeling he is a hefty man and breathes heavily as he exits the pool , but as one longtime player put it , none of that matters water is a great equalizer it brings everyone down to sort of an even ground , said larry panza , a hamden resident who , along with john gailhard , helped start the barnacles out of the ashes of a scuba club in 1979 just look at some of these guys he pointed to the men in the pool , most of them at least middleaged like him , and did not by any means sport anything resembling a runner s build they 're heavy guys , they 're big , said mr panza , at 56 , the selfdescribed oldtimer underwater , they look like walruses , but , man , can they swim looking in the pool , where the players were bobbing in and out of the water for air , mr panza focused on mr dunkinson , who was clearly in control of the action that english guy , andy , he s a big guy , mr panza said but underwater , he s incredible from above the surface , it s hard to tell anyone s skills , however as mr panza put it , it s not much of a spectator sport that is an understatement while the skilled players glide across the bottom of the pool , weaving through opponents and anticipating movements to score goals , all that can be seen from the top is a lot of fin kicking and heads continuously popping up for air therefore , it was debatable what lauren agnelli s verdict would be on the sport ms agnelli , a university of bridgeport graduate student , had just finished using the pool when the underwater hockey players arrived on a recent wednesday it all seems crazy to me , ms agnelli said initially after watching curiously for a few minutes , she decided she had to get in the water herself to really see what was going on i 've never seen anything like it , ms agnelli said after stepping out of the pool and lifting up her mask it s pretty wild down there you have to watch it s very graceful she likely witnessed the one player everyone was quick to tab as the best , the unequivocal leader of the club , jamie saulnier having attended underwater hockey tournaments throughout the country and in quebec , mr saulnier has competed with some of the world s best players he takes the game seriously , too , wearing gloves to protect his hands from the puck , switching between multiple sticks during play , and yelling out orders to his team like i want to see more teamwork no trying to plow through people i want to see more passing the foreigners , they 're actually the better players , said mr saulnier , who has been playing with the club since 1988 our homegrown connecticut players , they do n't get into the stick drills at all while mr saulnier comes to compete and coach , the 52yearold larry carbonelli knows he is never going to play in a championship tournament he comes for the company , uses a stick autographed by several boston bruins , and simply plays to unwind after a long day of work at the grocery store he manages in fact , during the course of a game recently , mr carbonelli mentioned the pizza parlor the players often frequent afterward more than what was going on in the pool they 're all nice guys , mr carbonelli said that s really what keeps me coming photos underwater hockey is not as well known as its onice counterpart but in bridgeport , 20 diehards , equipped with snorkels and footlong sticks , play the sport twice a week at the university of bridgeport pool the game was developed in britain during the 1950 s , but did n't make it to the united states until the mid1970 s \( photographs by suzy allman for the new york times \)
augusta , ga , april 13 a master of comebacks is now a masters champion all halfdozen of mike weir s pga tour victories have occurred after he entered the final round trailing but none of his comebacks compared to his magnificent run down the back nine of augusta national golf club today weir erased a threestroke deficit to catch len mattiace , then won a playoff on the first hole with a bogey to capture his first major championship weir became the first canadian to win a major , and the 67th masters will be remembered for compelling golf , offcourse controversy over the club s allmale membership and the tournament s first playoff since 1990 it will also be remembered for its diminutive and determined champion weir ended the championship run of tiger woods , who tied for 15th after a finalround 75 and failed in his bid to become the first player to win three consecutive masters weir also became the second lefthander to win a major , joining bob charles , who won the 1963 british open weir \( 68 \) and mattiace \( 65 \) both finished at sevenunderpar 281 , two strokes ahead of phil mickelson \( 68 \) , who finished third for the fourth time at augusta but the 5foot9 weir won for the third time this year , earning 108 million , and passed the most significant test of his career he compiled a bogeyfree round until the playoff on one of golf s greatest stages with nine players within five strokes of the thirdround leader , jeff maggert , when the day began , this tournament could have gone many ways but weir prevailed over former majors champions and longer hitters because of his solid putting stroke and even more solid resolve mickelson was widely thought to be the next lefthander to win a major , but weir had different ideas at age 32 , he has taken his place as one of the world s best players he is the tour s leading money winner this year i could n't ask to play much better , said weir , who lives in utah but grew up in ontario it was just a gutwrenching day it has been a hectic week , but i did n't pay much attention to that i was here to play golf , but once i got inside the ropes , i focused on that it ended on the first playoff hole , the par4 , 495yard 10th , when mattiace made a crucial error on his second shot , pulling it well left of the green after weir put his second shot on the green about 50 feet from the pin , mattiace chipped 20 feet past the hole weir left the door open , lagging his long putt for birdie about 8 feet past the hole but mattiace made another blunder , slamming his quick 20foot putt for par across the green , about 15 feet past the hole now mattiace was putting for bogey , and he put that putt about 6 feet past the cup that left weir needing only a twoputt for a green jacket , and after hitting his first putt 2 feet past , weir made the tapin and the masters belonged to him it was the first masters won with a bogey it was immense pressure , weir said of the playoff i saw the difficulty len was in , but i still had to do my job a blistering finalround 65 by mattiace , who played four groups ahead of weir , put the pressure on weir to make the run that lifted him to victory starting the day five strokes off the lead , mattiace snatched the lead with a sensational eagle at the par5 no 15 , reaching the green with a perfect drive and a 5wood , and then sinking a 10foot putt that sent a roar echoing from one side of the course to the other on most days , what mattiace did would have been enough and a few minutes after the tournament ended , mattiace sobbed , finally able to release his emotions now that s it s over , it comes out , he said , wiping away tears with the back of his hand my game showed up today , and i was hitting on all cylinders that s all we want to do , try and put it together i exceeded what i thought i could probably do weir started the day two strokes behind maggert , who suffered through the cruelest round of the tournament , a finalround 75 to finish fifth at fourunder 284 maggert s hopes begin to disintegrate at no 3 his second shot from a fairway bunker ricocheted off the front lip and hit maggert in the chest for a twostroke penalty that led to a triplebogey 7 it was an unfortunate time for an unfortunate break , and it immediately put maggert in catchup mode i was close to the lip , and i caught it thin , maggert said of his adventure in the bunker i did n't want that incident to be the mark of my day maggert was sunk for good at the par3 no 12 when he made an 8 , hitting two balls into the water maggert rallied with three late birdies , but by the time weir reached the 15th tee , it was clearly a twoman race between him and mattiace as weir stepped to the 13th tee , he trailed mattiace by three strokes mattiace had made a 10foot birdie putt at no 16 that moved him to eight under par that seemed to make weir only more determined after hitting his second shot at the par5 no 13 just over the green , he got up and down for birdie , making a 15foot putt to cut mattiace s lead to two strokes that was a huge putt , weir said to make up three strokes if i had missed that putt would have been difficult at the par4 , 465yard no 18 , mattiace made a costly mistake , hitting his drive into the right trees he had to punch out short of the green and could not get up and down to save par , and the bogey cut mattiace s lead to one weir pulled even with a birdie at the par5 , 500yard no 15 after laying up on his second shot , weir hit a splendid wedge shot from 91 yards that stopped 4 feet left of the hole as mattiace was signing his scorecard , weir made the putt to tie the masters then weir made par on the final three holes of regulation , making a 5foot par on no 17 and a 6footer on no 18 , while mattiace waited on the practice green for woods , dreams of winning a ninth major turned nightmarish when he made three bogeys on the front nine and doublebogeyed no 3 his first mistake was mental , when he hit a driver instead of a 3wood at the par4 , 350yard no 3 woods said that he wanted to hit a 2iron , but that his caddie , steve williams , talked him into hitting a driver i just made a mental blunder over there on no 3 , woods said it was a bad decision i wanted to hit iron , but stevie said it would better to get the ball down there and have an easy pitch from down there i went with it , but ultimately it s the player s call , and ultimately i made the wrong decision after no 3 , once could sense the momentum leaving woods woods , who shot a firstround 76 , was not at his best this week , particularly with his putting and his short game , and though his thirdround 66 put him back into contention , he could not sustain that level of play no one s ever done it , so it s been proven it s not easy to do , woods said of his bid to win a third masters in a row it s disappointing we try to put ourselves in position to win , but you 're not going to win every time it was weir who won this time , and after a week that featured drama , controversy and great shotmaking , it was weir who did the celebrating i do n't own a green jacket , weir said i was hoping this would be my first one i'm glad to be wearing it right now , believe me photos mike weir , the second lefthander to win a major , after his masters victory yesterday \( getty images \) len mattiace s second

jerusalem , friday , feb 28 prime minister ariel sharon s new rightwing government won parliamentary approval early today , and he declared that peace negotiations with the palestinians would not resume until the violence stops and the current palestinian leadership is replaced mr sharon s prescription for resolving the conflict was familiar , but he now presides over a government that is considerably more hawkish than his previous one the composition of the new government could complicate international efforts to restart negotiations that collapsed more than two years ago before returning to the diplomatic track there is a need for ending terror and incitement , for reforms within the palestinian authority to be implemented , and for replacing the existing leadership , mr sharon said in remarks on thursday afternoon directed at yasir arafat , the palestinian leader the speech came a day after president bush said that a war to topple president saddam hussein of iraq would make the region more stable and could lay the groundwork for an israelipalestinian peace deal israel would be expected to support the creation of a palestinian state and must stop expanding settlements , mr bush said however , prospects for a swift resumption of the peace talks remain dim mr bush has strongly supported mr sharon during the middle east fighting , and both have made clear they would like to see mr arafat replaced , though mr arafat s position appears solid for now mr sharon s fourparty coalition , which was formally approved in a vote shortly after midnight , holds 68 of the 120 seats in parliament none of the four parties are calling for a resumption of peace talks two farright groups , the national union and the national religious party , reject a palestinian state under any circumstances mr sharon s likud party , the largest single faction , with 40 seats , contains some members who do not want a palestinian state and some like mr sharon who say they would accept a limited state under certain conditions the fourth coalition member , the centerright shinui party , favors resuming peace talks after mr arafat is gone while a large part of his speech was devoted to the conflict , mr sharon said improving israel s slumping economy , now in its third year of recession , was the primary mission of his government palestinians accuse mr sharon of erecting obstacles that have blocked diplomatic proposals by the united states and other wouldbe international mediators in addition , palestinian leaders say the hardliners who will dominate the new israeli government could aggravate tensions by emphasizing military actions and supporting the building of jewish settlements in the west bank and the gaza strip president bush is talking about a palestinian state , and sharon is determined to undermine it , said saeb erekat a cabinet member in the palestinian authority the only thing that is missing from this government is the peace process mr sharon s focus in recent days has been on filling fiercely contested cabinet posts in his new government shortly before the parliamentary session began on thursday , benjamin netanyahu , a former prime minister , reversed an earlier decision and agreed to serve as finance minister after demanding and receiving expanded powers in the latest chapter of a rivalry that dates back years , mr sharon dismissed mr netanyahu as foreign minister on wednesday and offered him the finance ministry job , which mr netanyahu rejected mr netanyahu then reconsidered , and aides for the two men met for hours , holding additional talks on thursday to seal the deal mr netanyahu has been promised broad autonomy over economic decisions , and he will be put in charge of staterun companies , including those that are candidates for privatization he also sought to be named acting prime minister when mr sharon is out of the country , but he was rebuffed , people familiar with the talks said mr sharon filled the foreign ministry post with silvan shalom , the departing finance minister , who has no formal diplomatic experience but is considered a close ally of mr sharon s israeli political analysts said mr sharon would have had difficulty controlling the outspoken mr netanyahu had he remained the foreign minister mr netanyahu calls for ousting mr arafat and dismantling the palestinian authority
columbia s onboard computer hardware and software not the crew were driving when the craft made its fatal reentry last saturday those computer systems , stateoftheart designs when the shuttle program began in the 1970 s , detected a drag under columbia s left wing and ordered flightcontrol jets to compensate by steering the craft to the right their performance will be investigated as part of the inquiry into why columbia was destroyed , nasa officials say the computers act as the electronic brain of the flight control system computer avionics experts say the shuttle program s hardware and software systems , despite their age , have a record of extraordinary reliability the technology , they say , is a triumph of custom machines and programming code that has been designed and endlessly tested to perform flawlessly in the harsh conditions of space travel for this specialized task , they say , mature computers and code are robust and trustworthy instead of an antiquated safety hazard these systems are older , but they are highly reliable , said norman f schneidewind , a computer scientist at the naval postgraduate school , who has worked with nasa the design , testing and work processes are focused on making sure the technology works , all the time in the last year or so , nasa did consider the option of using new avionics computers , according to people close to the space administration finding replacement components for the old machines has been a headache for nasa , and eventually the shuttles may switch but there were other budget priorities for the administration , say these insiders , who add that safety was not the reason new computer systems were being considered besides , there are real risks to moving to newer computer systems , the experts point out the main one is altering the complex interaction between the hardware and software , which can introduce bugs and software bugs can have catastrophic consequences in space in 1996 , for example , the european space agency s ariane 5 rocket , which took 7 billion and 10 years to build , exploded less than a minute into its maiden voyage because of a software bug an investigation found that some new code had been added from the ariane 4 , and it had not been properly tested as for the shuttle s systems , ibm began development work on them in 1972 , nine years before the first spacecraft was launched the company chose the best and most appropriate pieces of technology from its various products and its research laboratories , and came up with a hybrid machine , the ibm ap101 over the years , shuttle scientists have installed improvements to the ap101 , like solidstate electronics for its memory instead of magnetic disks yet the basic design of the five onboard ap101 computers black cubes about 18 inches on a side remains the same the programming language used for these unusual machines is similarly tailored for its task it is called hal s \( highorder assembly language shuttle \) , and was specially developed for spaceflight applications like instantaneous handling of streams of data from shuttle sensors the ap101 computers process data at a tiny fraction of the rate of today s personal computers yet today s computers need a lot of processing firepower because they routinely handle big graphics , as well as audio and video files all of that is important for people playing computer games or downloading music over the internet but not relevant to the shuttle s performance the flightcontrol system on a shuttle craft is designed mainly to process sequence after sequence of numeric data the data come from sensors on the guidance system , accelerometers measuring acceleration and gyros measuring the rotation of the craft the onboard computers , experts say , are designed to process those chunks of numeric data at the rate of perhaps 1 , 000 times a second that data coming out of the gyros and accelerometers is not going to come out faster , said col john keesee , an air force aeronautical engineer and a senior lecturer at the massachusetts institute of technology the guidance functions are not pushing you to faster processors the shuttle s software team is famed in the industry for the flawless quality of its programming code it is one of a handful of projects in the world to receive a level 5 rating from carnegie mellon university s software engineering institute for the reliability of its code and the rigor of its testing processes the guidance system program has more than 400 , 000 lines of code recent versions have had less than one error and none that degraded the performance of the program , let alone raised safety concerns the working environment of the coders who build the shuttle programs is orderly and regimented a world apart from that of young hackers , staying up all night to ship new products every few months they have a system of process improvements , design reviews and testing procedures that almost no one else does , said mr schneidewind , a software engineering expert , of the shuttle coders but at least one expert richard doherty , a consulting engineer who did research for a member of the commission that investigated the challenger explosion questioned whether the computers onboard the columbia had all the information they needed after tiles were damaged on takeoff , mr doherty said , nasa could have sent up a few changes in the software guidance program to adjust for increased drag on the left side of the craft it might have made some difference , mr doherty theorized , but we 'll never know how much
cromwell , conn , july 25 for suzy whaley , as with annika sorenstam earlier this year , things became harder on the second day of a pga tour event after a fiveoverpar 75 on thursday that was better than scores posted by 13 players , whaley posted a 78 today in the second round of the greater hartford open that put her at 13overpar 153 , far above the cutoff number of evenpar 140 but it did not seem to matter to the effervescent whaley , 36 , a teaching professional from nearby farmington a gallery that included her husband , two daughters and parents cheered whaley from her opening shot she reciprocated with a beaming smile and frequent waves to the crowd i wish i could explain to you how it feels to have that many people cheering for you all day long for two days straight , whaley said it s the most wonderful feeling in the world , and it keeps you going whaley s appearance overshadowed the performance of the leader , peter jacobsen , who shot a 67 today that left him at 10underpar 130 he was a stroke ahead of jay haas , who shot a 68 today phil mickelson , who has won the last two tournaments here , barely made the cut at 140 after shooting a 73 three other players mike springer , david dell and james mcclean finished with the same 153 score that whaley did three other players charles meola , gabriel hjertstedt and ryan ouellette finished behind her whaley s performance drew praise from many of the male pros i played nine holes with her on tuesday , and i'm very impressed with her game , said jacobsen , the winner of six pga tournaments in his 27year professional career but i'm more impressed with her attitude and her personality she s a great person , and i love watching her play she is a great representative of golf haas , who has won nine pga tour events since turning pro in 1976 , said , i thought her round yesterday was way better than mine haas shot a sevenunderpar 63 at the tpc at river highlands on thursday in calm weather , while whaley carded a 75 in windy conditions i ca n't say enough about that 75 , he said i think it was terrific whaley became the first woman to qualify for a pga tournament since babe didrikson zaharias in 1945 by beating 89 fellow club professionals in the connecticut section pga last fall none of the 11 previous winners of that event made the cut at the greater hartford open , either sorenstam played in the colonial in fort worth in may after receiving a sponsor s exemption she shot a 145 over the first two rounds , and failed to make the cut for whaley today , three double bogeys , all on par4 holes , were especially painful for the second straight day , she birdied only one hole , the par4 , 434yard no 1 , where she sank a 15foot putt to go nine over par after having started on the back nine that birdie soon became nullified by a bogey at no 2 , where she skulled a sand wedge over the green , then chipped up and made the putt that was ugly , whaley said later but it got worse whaley took her third double bogey at the par4 , 460yard fourth hole , which she had parred on thursday , and her final bogey at the par3 , 223yard fifth hole to go to 13 over , where she finished although she was again outdriven on almost every hole by her playing partners , anthony painter and akio sadakata , whaley , playing on a course that is about 700 yards longer than the ones she plays from the women s tees , parred both of the long par5 holes i played well and hit some good shots , but i focused better yesterday , said whaley , who played briefly on the lpga tour in 1990 and 1993 before becoming a teaching pro but i loved every minute of it photos peter jacobsen , chipping on no 4 , was 10 under par after two rounds and held a onestroke lead \( associated press \) despite missing the cut , suzy whaley said hearing fans cheer was the most wonderful feeling in the world \( reuters \)
washington , april 23 the supreme court appeared poised today to overturn california s holocaust victim insurance relief act , which requires insurance companies doing business in the state to disclose information about every policy that they or their affiliates sold in europe from 1920 through 1945 what we have here is a state trying to establish its own foreign policy , deputy solicitor general edwin s kneedler told the justices , arguing that the troublesome issue of recovering insurance benefits to which holocaust survivors are entitled was exclusively a matter for the national government the justices , who three years ago unanimously overturned a massachusetts law establishing a state boycott of companies doing business in myanmar , the former burma , seemed at times almost impatient with california s defense of its effort to make holocaustera disclosure a condition of a business license this law makes reference to nazicontrolled germany and the holocaust , none of which is california s concern , justice anthony m kennedy told frank kaplan , representing the california insurance commissioner justice stephen g breyer said , the problem is that the constitution seems to give authority to the secretary of state and not to the insurance commissioner of california to address the insurance issue mr kaplan said the law represented the state s effort , on behalf of as many as 20 , 000 holocaust survivors in california , to address the stonewalling that has gone on for years and that continues to this day on the part of insurance companies that have withheld information from family members seeking to collect on policies the california law , enacted in 1999 , was challenged immediately by the american insurance association and by 10 insurance companies , including those with origins or affiliates in germany , switzerland and italy the federal district court in sacramento declared the law unconstitutional in 2000 , and the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , in san francisco , overturned that decision last year the statute authorizes suits against the insurance companies in the california courts only the disclosure provision , not the law s remedial aspects , were before the court today in american insurance association v garamendi , no 02722 in their arguments , both mr kneedler , the deputy solicitor general , and kenneth s geller , representing the insurance companies , emphasized the recent history of executive branch involvement in negotiating solutions to holocaustera claims a group called the international commission on holocaust era insurance claims , set up by a group of european insurance companies and jewish organizations , is processing claims it receives from individuals after checking their names against a database it is compiling under an executive agreement between the united states and germany , all claims against german insurance companies are being submitted to this commission both mr geller and mr kneedler emphasized that the process respected the privacy laws of european countries by disclosing insurance information only when sought by identified holocaust victims and families by contrast , the california law requires disclosure of some 10 million policies issued during the time period , fewer than 1 percent of which were owned by holocaust victims justice ruth bader ginsburg appeared unimpressed with the privacy argument we are dealing with a unique situation here , she said , noting that many of the policyholders were killed to raise the privacy interest with respect to these people is kind of ironic , she said justice ginsburg observed to mr kneedler that california was simply asking questions of companies licensed to do business in california mr kneedler replied , disclosure is a form of regulation and he added that states do n't have the right to regulate through disclosure transactions that occurred outside the state defending the law , mr kaplan invoked the court s recent solicitude for states' rights , noting that congress has long authorized the states to regulate insurance and has said nothing to preempt the california law or others like it congress did n't say stop , he said but the states'rights argument made little headway justice sandra day o'connor observed that insurance companies could lose their california licenses under the law for failing to disclose information that european privacy laws might not even make available what kind of a law is that \? she demanded representative mark foley , republican of florida , said today that he would introduce a bill next week to make clear that states have the authority to require disclosure of holocaustera insurance policies and to permit suits in federal court
when raffaela petrasek was hired as a vice president of the new york city economic development corporation nearly 10 years ago , 42nd street at times square was a seedy , downattheheels place last month , when she left to become the director of nassau county s newly formed economic development corporation , the seediness had largely given way to office towers and new hotels , renovated theaters and glistening new stores and tourist attractions and as the senior real estate negotiator for the city and state , ms petrasek gets a fair share of the credit for the turnaround from her former boss , jonathan fair , an executive vice president of the new york development group last month peter t sylver , nassau s deputy county executive , recruited ms petrasek , a huntington resident , for the county s own fledgling economic development corporation once again her mission will be to spur economic growth by nurturing strategic real estate deals but this time there is a major difference the times square renaissance was built on adding heavily subsidized commercial buildings , but the county s plan hinges on encouraging the construction of 700 units of affordable housing specifically , her job will be to spur economic growth by expanding the stock of affordable housing in nassau county it is an idea , several people involved in planning the strategy said , based on no existing economic development models , certainly none implemented on long island , but one that addresses one of the biggest roadblocks to economic growth mr sylver said the county hoped to recruit and retain businesses and revitalize downtown areas by deploying 7 million in federal housing money to create the 700 units they will be new or renovated , he said , and would be built in commercial and downtown areas , perhaps even in industrial parks the details , mr sylver said , are still being worked out and he could not estimate how many of the units would be owned or with rented , or what sort of buildings would be built or where he did say , however , that about 125 units would be earmarked for lowincome residents and that the buildings would be scattered around the county , which was organized into 35 economic zones for this purpose last year by thomas r suozzi , the county executive mr sylver said the county was looking at a wide range of building types , including condominiums , town houses , standalone singlefamily structures , multiunit rentals and converted apartment houses with a mix of owneroccupied units sold at market rates and subsidized units rented to lowincome tenants the county also plans to seek additional financing for the project from the federal department of housing and urban development hud housing is extremely important to our county , because the median income is so high , mr sylver said a family of four can make 66 , 400 and still be eligible so we 're talking about teachers and postal workers complaints about the high cost of housing on long island abound , and much of the complaining comes from business leaders the long island association , the area s largest business group , and the long island regional planning board , along with many other groups , say that the cost of housing is one of the biggest deterrents to economic growth on the island but complaining about housing prices has not yet translated into widespread support for governmentfinanced housing initiatives lee e koppelman , the executive director of the regional planning board , said that most of the support for affordable housing on long island was limited to housing for older residents and seniors are n't part of the work force , dr koppelman said the theory behind nassau county s strategy is apparently untested mr sylver said that combining affordable housing and economic growth makes sense , even if this is the first time the two have been explicitly linked but he added that how to capitalize on the benefits is still being sorted out by an advisory panel that includes scott rechler , the chairman of reckson associates , the real estate developer in melville frank castagna , who owns the americana shopping plaza in manhasset and jon weinstein , the president of apex plastic industries in hauppauge the county might , for example , encourage employers by offering to defer sales tax for companies that agreed to hire workers from subsidized housing , he said more likely , the law of supply and demand will determine the outcome by adding more housing , prices will drop , according to basic supply and demand theory more workers will be able to live on long island , and that will make the region more appealing to employers mr sylver challenged dr koppelman s position that housing for the elderly failed to expand housing for the work force when retirees leave their houses , working families will be able to buy their homes and move in , mr sylver said plus retirees will be able to stay in the county and not leave irwin kellner , an economics professor at hofstra university and the chairman of the county s council of economic advisers , said that as far as he knew , the strategy of tying economic development to the construction of affordable housing was a nassau county innovation
new brunswick , nj , oct 13 two students at rutgers university were severely beaten with a baseball bat when a brawl erupted early sunday morning outside a former fraternity house in the heart of rutgers s main campus here , the authorities said three members of the university s wrestling team , along with a former member and three other men , including two rutgers students , have been charged in the attack , and three others are being sought , they said the two victims john p morin , 20 , of cliffside park , nj , and robert morgan , also 20 , of pine beach , nj were each struck in the head with a bat and remained in critical condition on monday in the surgical intensive care unit at robert wood johnson university hospital here , said william f lamb , the first assistant prosecutor of middlesex county mr lamb said the brawl erupted just after 3 am on sunday after members of a rutgers fraternity , sigma pi , went to the house and tried to enter a private party members of a student social club called squam were entertaining members of a rutgers sorority , gamma phi beta the sigma pi students were turned away at the door , mr lamb said that was the triggering event , he said because the investigation is continuing , mr lamb would not go into details on the sequence of events after the fraternity members were barred or to say whether any of the seven men arrested so far were among those who were refused admission he also declined to say how many people were involved a university spokeswoman , sandra lanman , said on monday evening that none of those arrested were members of sigma pi the president of rutgers , richard l mccormick , said in a statement that the university deplored the senseless violence outside the squam house and said the university would take all appropriate action against any rutgers students who were involved after issuing the statement , mr mccormick visited with the families of mr morin and mr morgan at the hospital during the day , the university s athletic director , robert e mulcahy iii , suspended the three rutgers wrestlers charged he called the attacks intolerable and said his thoughts and prayers were with the two victims and their families the three wrestlers were identified as christopher gornick , 19 , of oceanport , nj justin smigelsky , 20 , of old bridge , nj and kenneth rodriguez , 23 , of bound brook , nj all were being held on bail of 150 , 000 on charges including conspiracy to riot and hindering the investigation mr rodriguez s twin brother , jonathan , who wrestled for rutgers last year and then dropped out of the university for a semester , was accused of hitting mr morin and mr morgan with the bat , mr lamb said he was charged with two counts of aggravated assault , rioting , conspiracy to riot and possession of a weapon he was held in bail of 350 , 000 , mr lamb said the others , who were arrested on charges including conspiracy to riot , were identified as two rutgers students , roy sous , 19 , and david mallow , 22 , of brick , nj , and a friend of the rodriguez brothers , derek michaelowski , 22 , of bound brook and a student at franklin marshall college in pennsylvania , mr lamb said all three were held in 150 , 000 bail the mood outside the former fraternity house a handsome , threestory brick house on college avenue was tense and somber on monday three glass candleholders were arrayed on top of a dense bloodstain on the sidewalk a handprinted white sign at the top of the main stairway read john and rob our prayers are with you members of squam who left or entered the building declined to discuss the fight or the party preceding it when four young women arrived in midafternoon with a bouquet , members rushed outside the building and ordered members of the news media off the property until 1999 , the squam building was occupied by a fraternity , chi phi the group s national organization revoked its charter that year for a violation of its rules , and rutgers then withdrew its recognition of chi phi , said ms lanman , the university spokeswoman squam s building is now owned by a corporation controlled by former members of chi phi , she said squam is not recognized by the university , although its members are rutgers students , she said the origin of the club s name is unknown , she said matt strampfer , a rutgers senior who lives in a

the director jonathan miller has essentially become persona non grata at the metropolitan opera the trouble started in 1998 , when he publicly challenged some questionable artistic choices cecilia bartoli insisted on for mr miller s production of mozart s nozze di figaro it s all too bad because over the years this feisty british director provided the met with some vividly imaginative productions , none better than his 1997 staging of stravinsky s only fulllength opera , the rake s progress happily , that production returned to the met on monday night , with the surefooted stage director laurie feldman in charge of theatrical matters , and james levine again conducting a score he reveres the rake s progress tells the tale of tom rakewell , a strapping but shiftless young man in rural 18thcentury england , who is engaged to the steadfast and winsome anne trulove but tom is easy prey for the devil , in the person of nick shadow , who arrives with news that tom has inherited a fortune , then leads him to decadent ruination in london with costumes by judy levin and sets by peter davison , this production updates the story with contemporary imagery that fleshes out the characters as well as the subtleties of stravinsky s score anne and her father live in a surrealistically tall country house with a roof of leaves from tall trees growing within the walls anne , sung by dawn upshaw , is prim and proper in her plaid skirt and cardigan but restless tom , sung by paul groves , looks constricted in his vest and narrow tie the london town house that tom purchases has a stark , whitewalled salon with huge windows open upon a commercial street the graveyard where nick shadow calls due his payment , tom s soul , is a creepy place where the only hints of outside life are billboards with remnants of posters with blue sky images on its surface stravinsky s score is an ingenious neoclassical homage to mozart mr levine was determined to cut through the mozartean surface to reveal the fractured meters , the pungent contemporary harmonies , the sparetextured modernisms and the weighty pull that lie within consequently some of his tempos were slower than admirers of this score may be used to there were payoffs , though as sung with heartfelt intensity by ms upshaw and conducted with solemn beauty by mr levine , anne s forlorn no word from tom aria had an overpowering impact nick shadow is one of samuel ramey s signature roles , and he again brought his booming bass voice and eery calm to his charmingly malevolent portrayal the mezzosoprano stephanie blythe s vibrant voice and junoesque physique were perfect for baba the turk , the bearded lady tom marries in a fit of selfdestruction the bassbaritone dean peterson was suitably dignified as anne s father the news was mr groves s tom there are technical glitches in his singing a tendency for sustained notes to waver , some strain in his upper register that he must attend to still , this hearty young tenor threw himself into the role , singing with ardent energy and keen psychological insight , and making every word of the ornately poetic text by w h auden and chester kallman a living presence my guess is that some shaky moments in the playing of the fine met orchestra and in the singing of the chorus , which sounded vocally spent at this late stage of the busy season , would take care of themselves if mr levine would pick up the overall tempos just a notch or two still , he has a powerful vision of this work , and it came through to the cheering audience there are five more performances through may 5 photo samuel ramey , left , and paul groves in the rake s progress \( sara krulwich the new york times \)

after the last boxcar rumbled along the high line in 1980 , imagination began riding the rails battling landowners' opposition , official intransigence and frankly common sense , quixotic new yorkers periodically dreamed of ways to save the high line , an elevated railroad viaduct that threads its way through the far west side of manhattan , from gansevoort to 34th streets that dreaming has now gone global entrants from berlin , vienna and tokyo were among the four winners chosen on friday by an influential jury in a competition that sought ideas for redesigning the high line there were 720 proposals from 38 countries , said robert hammond , director of friends of the high line , which sponsored the competition they ranged from pure whimsy several contemplated turning the high line into a cow pasture and one of the winners imagined it as a 7 , 920footlong swimming pool to visions as starkly provocative as the structure itself , which can be seen as a romantic industrial relic or as a dangerous blight none of the ideas stand a chance of getting built as conceived but the competition marks another step forward in the campaign to reuse the high line what it proves to me is that no matter what the design of the high line ultimately is , something great will occur , said vishaan chakrabarti , director of the manhattan office of the department of city planning , after he and the other jurors finished their daylong review it s obvious from this competition that the conceptual is going to get us to the real , he said mr chakrabarti s presence was significant it reflects a turnaround at city hall from the position of the giuliani administration , which favored demolition of the high line , to the bloomberg administration , which embraces its preservation the swimming pool proposal , by nathalie rinne of vienna , was one of the winners chosen by a jury that included the architects steven holl , marilyn jordan taylor and bernard tschumi and the landscape architects julie bargmann and signe nielsen they also picked black market crawler , a moving structure with shops , galleries , theaters and places for a full range of activities not all of them legal it was submitted by hugo beschoor plug of berlin ernesto mark faunlagui of hoboken won for his proposal to alter the viaduct through incisions and displacement , creating new openings , parapets , walls and skylight wells and matthew greer of new york won for his plan to let the structure continue to evolve naturally into a kind of wild meadow a separate award for public access was won by takuji nakamura of tokyo , who proposed illuminated shafts penetrating the viaduct , with stairs and elevators other entries recreated the high line as a farm , a fluorescent fun house , a logflume ride , a trelliswrapped garden , a roller coaster , a smallscale appalachian trail and the zones of dante s paradise , purgatory and inferno mr greer even proposed to bring back a boxcar photos one proposal would turn the elevated high line railroad line , which snakes through the far west side , into an elongated swimming pool \( nancy siesel the new york times \)
baghdad , iraq , june 19 the united states will focus on emergency repairs rather than on major reconstruction of iraq s crumbling electricity , water and sanitation systems , the top american aid administrator said here today you wo n't see a lot of new buildings , said andrew s natsios , director of the united states agency for international development , in an interview here we are going to take existing infrastructure and repair it mr natsios said that the problems in iraq are more complicated than he had initially expected , but he predicted that the united states would not increase the size of its 24 billion aid package for iraq this year his comments suggested that the bush administration may be at odds with british officials , who are overseeing reconstruction efforts in southern iraq and who favor a more ambitious effort to rebuild a good part of the country s dilapidated power and water systems bechtel group , the american contractor that has a contract to oversee repairs to iraq s infrastructure , is also proposing a more comprehensive and expensive series of water , sewage and electricity projects over the next several years more than two months after the war ended , power outages still occur several times a day and have grown worse in many cities because looters have been tearing down hightension power lines to steal the copper sewage systems are backing up in many neighborhoods , sometimes filling streets with waste , in part because electricity failures prevent the sewage pumps from operating none of the sewagetreatment systems in baghdad or most other cities are functioning , which means that waste water is being dumped directly into the major rivers bechtel executives showed mr natsios a sewage treatment station in baghdad today that had been looted of almost all its equipment , including a large turbine that thieves apparently removed with the help of a large crane mr natsios admitted that he had been taken aback by the scale of the looting he also authorized bechtel to install six new generators at waterpumping stations in the southern city of basra but mr natsios repeatedly emphasized the importance of emergency repairs , while minimizing the need for fundamental reconstruction we do n't need to build new sewage plants , new water treatment plants , he said emergency repairs can probably happen in a couple of months citing international studies , mr natsios also said that child mortality in iraq is higher than in india seventy percent of those deaths , he said , can be traced to infections from bad drinking water but in discussing ways to reduce child mortality , mr natsios emphasized health measures such as immunization and biofortification , or adding vitamins and minerals to products like flour , or administering them to people directly two treatments a year of vitamin a could reduce child mortality by 25 percent , mr natsios said echoing the words of l paul bremer , the civilian administrator here in charge of iraqi reconstruction , mr natsios called for devolution of responsibilities back to local iraqis in their own communities british military officials , overseeing reconstruction efforts in southern iraq , have been arguing that much of this country s infrastructure , especially its power and water systems , were inadequate even before the war and need to be rebuilt rather than repaired all that is happening is local repairs to keep the systems going , said lt col duncan bruce , commander of the duke of wellington regiment , which oversees a large swath of southern iraq what we now need to see are major repairs
brian kenny , a member of the manhassetlakeville fire department since 1960 , said that for years he had told his superiors of his concerns about the declining number of volunteers and the high dropout rate but it was n't until he voiced those concerns in two newspaper advertisements , which ran in july and august , that the department took note a lot of his facts and figures have to be looked at , said brian j morris of manhasset , the chief of the allvolunteer department a committee has been formed to do just that the department s district covers 10 square miles and includes manhasset , lake success , russell gardens , university gardens , north hills and the northern part of new hyde park although mr morris questioned some of the figures , mr kenny said that the numbers came from the department s own records that he obtained under the freedom of information act they show , he said , that 283 volunteers have quit the department in the last 10 years and that 85 percent of those who joined between the ages of 17 to 21 resigned within three years only 12 percent of the department s 242 firefighters work in the district on weekdays , and half of the volunteers live outside the district , he said in addition , more than half of the volunteers are over 45 mr kenny has proposed turning over the fire district to a private company , fire rescue management services , that he would run under his plan , he would lease the most centrally located firehouse in the district , on community drive near northern boulevard in manhasset , and would build two annex firehouses at the east and west ends of the district the central fire station would be staffed by 10 paid firefighters per shift , and the annexes by two firefighters each all the firefighters would work two 12hour shifts a week and would be paid 150 per shift , mr kenny said none would be fulltime , mr kenny said , and his company would not pay for insurance or other benefits in all , mr kenny said , he would need a core staff of 98 firefighters and a budget of 39 million , compared with the current department budget of 43 million , financed by tax revenues most of the budget goes for equipment , maintenance and interest on bonds the department recently received voter approval for a 5 million renovation of its firehouses the department pays no benefits to active volunteers , but they can retire at age 60 and receive a maximum pension of 400 a month volunteer firefighting has a long and cherished history on long island of the 71 fire departments in nassau county , 69 are volunteer , according to john livingston , the county s assistant chief fire marshal garden city and the city of long beach have both paid and volunteer firefighters mr kenny contends that his first response team of two firefighters would be able to arrive at any call within six minutes it currently takes an average of 67 minutes for volunteer firefighters to respond to the firehouse and get the equipment out the door , he said brian p jennings , one of three unpaid commissioners of the department , took issue with some of mr kenny s figures for instance , mr kenny found that 138 of the 242 volunteers are over 45 , but mr jennings said the volunteers were pretty uniformly distributed by age he said the precise figures and other detailed information about the makeup of the department have been requested by the fourmember committee he and the other commissioners established to look into mr kenny s claims to chair the committee , the commissioners chose paul j early , a retired navy admiral who lives in manhasset he wrote a letter to the manhasset press after mr kenny s ads appeared there and in the great neck record in his letter he commended mr kenny for thinking out of the box and suggested an investigation into the issues he raised do n't shoot the messenger , or wait until he runs out of money , admiral early wrote this matter is too important to be ignored , trivialized or swept under the rug in addition to admiral early , 78 , the other committee members are mr morris , the current department chief louis a scida , a former fire chief who lives in north new hyde park and richard e miller of manhasset , a former director of the manhasset park district admiral early said the committee had promised to present its findings and recommendations by christmas we 're exploring all the issues , he said our charge is to look at the department , trends for the future , and to make recommendations regarding its efficiency i'm keeping an open mind i want to be objective we expect to look at the records , and they have given us an opportunity to request expert advice as we need it admiral early said the committee had met twice and that mr morris and mr scida were providing him and mr miller with a good tutorial about the inner workings of the fire department , and they are backing it up with information he added that he did not yet know if the committee would ask to meet with mr kenny mr scida said that after the terrorist attack on sept 11 , 2001 , we saw a tremendous influx of volunteers he said that although the number of new volunteers has dropped slightly this year , the number is still greater than what it was before the attack mr jennings , the fire commissioner , said the department would be receptive to the committee s findings when asked about privatizing the fire department , as mr kenny is proposing , he said , if the committee says we should move in that direction , we will mr scida termed mr kenny s ads selfserving since he was promoting his own company this is a paid advertisement , and i'm not going to sit and debate this paid advertisement , he said but robert s bernstein , the mayor of the village of lake success and the president of the great neck village officials association , said mr kenny had raised some good points i think the concerns he has raised , especially the cost of the fire department , are very legitimate , he said we as elected officials have to be openminded and have an obligation to listen sometimes a small minority of people bring up important points photos the three commissioners of the manhassetlakeville fire

pricewaterhousecoopers , the nation s largest accounting firm , has taken a risky public stance in favor of better , more thorough and more detailed audits in recent advertisements , the firm has promised to take a tougher stance with clients and resign if it cannot resolve concerns about a particular audit it is a gamble strongly favored by those who want accounting firms to be more aggressive with their corporate clients , to weed out fraud before investors suffer catastrophic losses and it distinguishes the firm from its three most important competitors among the largest accounting firms but it is still a gamble pricewaterhousecoopers has begun to outline a yardstick by which its own performance will be judged , and if it falls short , the firm could find itself singled out for special criticism in a profession that came under heavy fire in 2002 the talk is great , and if they walk the talk , it will be a tremendous move that will clearly differentiate them from any of the other big firms , said lynn turner , the former chief accountant for the securities and exchange commission it will be a tremendous gain for investors as well but let s see the walk first the talk has been evident in recent fullpage newspaper advertisements in which pricewaterhousecoopers has stated its willingness to ask the tough questions and tackle the tough issues the firm further pledges , in any case where we cannot resolve concerns about the quality of the information we are receiving or about the integrity of the management teams with whom we are working , we will resign but pricewaterhousecoopers faces a significant challenge from continuing public scrutiny of its past work for instance , it approved financial disclosures at tyco international despite the company s use of aggressive accounting that , even when not erroneous , was undertaken with the purpose and effect of increasing reported results above what they would have been if more conservative accounting were used , according to a report filed by tyco on monday with the sec tyco also said it was reducing previously reported earnings by 382 million the approval of technically permissible but perhaps misleading aggressive accounting shows the difficulty the firm faces in bridging what john j o'connor , a vice chairman at pricewaterhousecoopers , called the expectations gap between what investors want from audits and what auditors do mr o'connor said the firm planned to close that gap we are looking at the type of qualitative reporting that we can do , he said , so that investors would be informed of just how aggressive or conservative the assumptions behind a company s financial disclosures were for now , he said , we are clearly starting with the audit committees and management the firm has also put together ethical guidelines that , while not new , have not been codified before the code of conduct tells employees confronted with difficult judgment calls to consider , among other things , does it feel right \? , how would it look in the newspapers \? and can you sleep at night \? the questions illustrate that many of the decisions auditors are called on to make are not strictly dictated by the rules that s the issue , said charles a bowsher , a former comptroller general of the united states and head of the public oversight board that used to supervise ethics and disciplinary issues for the accounting profession in each case , unfortunately , you 've got to look at the facts i'm a great believer that if you have a client who s pushing the envelope too far too many times and i believe that is how arthur andersen got into trouble then the auditor should resign from the account mr o'connor says that if the firm s accountants ask themselves these questions and are uncomfortable with the answers even if a client s preferred accounting complies with generally accepted principles they should not sign off on the books in recent months the company has resigned from several clients , he added , but he would not identify them auditors do not often resign according to auditortrak , a service of strafford publications , an atlantabased publisher of legal and business information services and accounting industry data , 348 accounting firms resigned from clients in 2002 through monday , with firms indicating in 59 cases that the reasons were concerns about independence or a company s practices or concerns by a company about the auditor s standards the four largest firms resigned from 80 clients , and pricewaterhousecoopers accounted for 13 of those in 2001 , there were 286 resignations , 88 of them by the four largest firms and 22 by pricewaterhousecoopers but the data may understate how often companies and auditors part ways over accounting disputes because it is in neither side s interest to make such disagreements public executives do not want their companies to suffer the increased scrutiny and decline in stock price that would probably follow an auditor s resignation , and accounting firms do not want to attract the attention of lawyers looking for grounds for securities lawsuits if pricewaterhousecoopers does provide audits that give more information to investors , mr turner said , it may actually help shield the firm from such lawsuits the way an accounting firm has to manage its risk if it s going to be successful and none of them have been in the last three or four years is you have to be sure that whoever you have out there on the audit team is identifying the problems , he said finding the problems will be easier the more thorough the audit is , he added the other large accounting firms have responded to general criticism of the accounting profession with marketing campaigns of their own , but none have gone as far as pricewaterhousecoopers and some oppose the firm s proposals , mr turner said will pwc be able to bring the profession along \? he asked the proof is going to be in the pudding

the food and drug administration yesterday approved overthecounter sales of prilosec , the little purple ulcer and heartburn pill that not long ago was the topselling prescription medicine in the world the decision benefits those who pay for the drug health insurers and people with no insurance and could roil the pharmaceutical industry prilosec is expected to sell for less than 1 a pill when it becomes available without a prescription this fall , compared with 4 a pill now but few consumers who have health insurance will see any savings , because many managed care plans will stop paying for the drug altogether , health care executives said we do n't cover overthecounter drugs , said deborah whitehead of tufts health plan , a major insurer in the boston area but older people of limited means who have no health insurance other than medicare , which does not cover prescription drugs , stand to save hundreds of dollars a year patients who take similar drugs , like nexium , prevacid , protonix and aciphex , may soon find that their health insurers have made the medications more expensive or harder to obtain , managed care executives said that would parallel what has happened since claritin , the widely used allergy drug , was switched to overthecounter from prescription sales late last year millions more americans will be affected this time prilosec and similar drugs , known as protonpump inhibitors , had 13 billion in total sales last year , more than any other class of drug and more than twice that of claritin and similar antihistamines , according to ndchealth , a health information company unlike allergy drugs , whose effects vary somewhat , the protonpump inhibitors all have nearly identical effects on patients that may give health plans a freer hand to force patients to use overthecounter prilosec rather than the prescription versions health plans have already been increasing the copayments that members must make to get the prescription ulcer and heartburn pills managed care executives say that overthecounter medicines like pepcid and even tums work just fine for most sufferers among the 62 million americans whose drug benefits are managed by medco health solutions , the average outofpocket cost for prilosec is 2394 for a 30pill bottle , said ann smith , a medco spokeswoman for the other protonpump inhibitors , she said , the average is 2850 overthecounter prilosec is expected to have a retail price of 25 to 30 for a 30pill bottle , and patients will no longer need to spend money and time seeing a physician to get it prilosec is made by astrazeneca , which also manufactures nexium under an agreement with procter gamble , the giant consumer products company , astrazeneca will manufacture the overthecounter version of prilosec and procter gamble will distribute and market it any sweeping changes in the way ulcer and heartburn drugs are paid for could hurt the profits of manufacturers who depend on these highly successful drugs astrazeneca , wyeth , tap pharmaceutical products , eisai and altana prilosec alone has generated nearly 30 billion in sales since its introduction in 1988 last year , more than three billion prescriptions were written for protonpump inhibitors in the united states , according to data provided by ndchealth for the companies , the intentions of managed care executives like alan sokolow , chief medical officer of empire blue cross and blue shield , are frightening dr sokolow said his company might impose a rule requiring any doctor who prescribes one of these drugs to get special permission from the health plan such requirements often result in huge drops in sales even if permission is granted , the copayments for these medicines could be raised above the cost of overthecounter prilosec , dr sokolow said ken ferber , a spokesman for the health insurer wellpoint , said his company might also use a priorauthorization rule and high copayments to drive patients to use overthecounter prilosec richard evans , an analyst with bernstein research , said sales of this entire class of drugs are going to fall all of these companies are going to get hurt especially wyeth and altana , the two companies that make protonix a spokesman for wyeth declined to comment an altana spokesman could not be reached a spokesman for astrazeneca said the company was pleased with the government s decision and was optimistic about sales of both prilosec otc , as the overthecounter version will be called , and nexium procter gamble has been pursuing the idea of selling prilosec over the counter since 1997 it expects the drug to bring in 400 million in sales in the first year the business prospects are more complicated for astrazeneca , based in london the company has heavily promoted nexium , which is still protected by patent , as a substitute for prilosec together , sales of prilosec and nexium totaled more than 66 billion last year but the two drugs are almost identical , and many managed care plans may refuse to pay for nexium when prilosec is cheaper thomas a scully , administrator of the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services , recently admonished doctors for prescribing nexium when prilosec is functionally identical and will soon be much cheaper
approaching the new york city international fringe festival is like getting on line for an exotic but lowbudget allyoucaneat buffet surprises are possible danger lurks who knows what you 'll be sampling \? the fringe , which continues through sunday , is now in its seventh year of sprawling across the extremities of lower manhattan it has had its reputation sprinkled with glitter the last couple of years by the broadway musical urinetown , which was presented in nascent form at the 2000 fringe this year the festival is offering more than 200 different productions in 20 locations to call them all theaters would be to stretch the definition of theater and to judge from the number of invitations , both polite and pleading , that i 've received lately , the commercial aspirations of fringe show producers are accelerated a lot more of the shows have press agents these days and in terms of content , the camp , irreverence and cheerful potty mouth of its glam graduate are reproduced in healthy doses gender bending is rife so is musical satire and deadpan outrageousness just read the menu , er , the program five wicked funny space vixens invade your mind with practical advice on genital maintenance gen titus andronicus returns to rome with a hideous disfiguring disease and he s just nuts about it sexually repressed englishmen shipwrecked on an island with a mad scientist , dinosaurs and a cavegirl in a fur bikini a promiscuous diva , an undersexed straight guy , a lovestarved gay boy and a virgin come together in one explosive night find out what s beneath the covers in this offbeat musical i'm a fringe fan , but none of this is especially encouraging it suggests that the photocopying of originality is irresistible even among those who are generally inclined to disdain it and it made me do a little exploring among the fringe offerings that have been less aggressively promoted or at least less conventionally unconventional i was looking , in other words , for the fringe of the fringe as it happened , my scheduled four days' and 12 shows' worth of fringing was cut short by the power blackout , which caused the cancellation of shows on thursday evening and all day friday but i did get to probably the most anomalous of the festival s presentations discordant duets , a play with an evangelical christian bent about two young couples that begin in the same unholy place and proceed in different directions it s a professional production with a cast of obvious training , directed earnestly by mark todd bruner and written with sincere , or at least fervent , purpose by mr bruner and his wife , michelle it is , however , quite a terrible play for a very simple reason it presumes that life s problems have one unambiguous solution this may be the secret of effective preaching \( though i doubt it \) , and perhaps this kind of storytelling is useful as a recruitment tool for the bornagain crowd but it makes for simpleminded drama , and unless you are already converted or wish to be , you might run out of patience , as i did i left midway through the second act , after a couple of suggestions that offended me , namely that if you are not willing to accept jesus as your savior , you are bound to become a belligerent drunk and that the difference between a christian counselor and a secular therapist is that the former is devoted to keeping families together and the latter is more concerned with making excuses for their coming apart the program claims that discordant duets which can be seen at teatro la tea \( 107 suffolk street , lower east side \) on wednesday night at 9 30 is the only play in the festival that explores christian themes , but that is n't so a much better , much more realistic play is acts of contrition , a drama by timothy nolan that does n't flinch as it addresses the sexual abuse scandal in the roman catholic church to those who object to my favoring the astringent view of the church over the saccharine , please hold the indignant email messages and letters i simply prefer theater that probes the complexities of conflict to theater that pretends they do n't exist in any case mr nolan s play is not only respectful of catholicism and catholics , it is also a distinctly sorrowful work , as opposed to an outraged one its characters include a cardinal \( gene fanning \) and three young priests who are good friends , one of whom , stephen \( shiek mahmudbey \) , is on his way to becoming a bishop the moral issues that arise when stephen is accused of sexual impropriety spray off in myriad directions and though in the end the play feels a little programmatic , covering all the bases from celibacy to homosexuality to the craven hypocrisy of church leaders that have been debated endlessly in the newspapers , mr nolan writes thoughtfully and carefully about the human cost of a problem that is , after all , a function of human frailty and at the center is a vivid performance by mr mahmudbey , who makes stephen s faith profound and his gift for the priesthood as evident as the tragic weakness that makes him unfit for it his confession , which is heard by both his friends \( james m armstrong and mark gorman \) , is as wrenching a scene as i 've seen in quite a while

before he roamed the center fields of coors field and pro player stadium , juan pierre had a smaller field to conquer the distance of the outfield walls did not matter with pierre s game , so he would swing down at the ball on the batting tee and begin racing he never tried to be a home run hitter , james pierre , juan s father , said last night from the pierres' home in alexandria , la even in tball he liked to hit the ball on the ground because he could run he 'd hit the ball on the ground and none of the kids could get it so he 'd round the bases as 26 , pierre is still running for the florida marlins and will unveil that game tonight against the yankees in game 1 of the world series pierre took a cab to yankee stadium at noon yesterday , beating the bus from the team s midtown hotel by 90 minutes there , in the quiet of the empty ballpark , he walked around the outfield a few hours later , pierre carried a bat and glove down the leftfield line and took swings as his teammates played catch the night before , he had appreciated how the yankees rallied to beat the boston red sox not aaron boone s gamewinning homer or the two home runs by jason giambi but the bloop hit to center field by jorge posada that scored two runs and tied the score , 55 , in the eighth inning that s what i always try to preach to the other guys on the team , the lousy hit 'll work , ' pierre said it does n't take a home run all the time they probably thought i was crazy in april but now we got the whole dugout saying it , 'beat them with a lousy knock' that s our coined phrase now it might be weird , but i preach to the guys to go the other way and get hits the marlins have been relatively subdued on the bases this postseason \( 6 stolen bases in 11 games \) after leading the major leagues with 150 steals this season pierre batted 305 and had 65 steals , tops in the majors , and teamed with luis castillo \( 314 batting average , 21 steals \) to form one of the more annoying threats at the top of the order pierre played in all 162 games \( a source of pride \) , collected 204 hits and was the hardest player in baseball to strike out \( once every 213 plate appearances \) pierre , who is listed at 6 feet and 180 pounds , accomplished that mostly by slapping hits through infields he walked only 55 times in 746 plate appearances he knows his role and he just plays his role , james pierre said he honed those skills because he knew what he could do james pierre , who played baseball for grambling state university , named his son after his father s favorite player , juan marichal , and the two older pierres took turns pitching to juan in the backyard the father prided himself on teaching juan the game and to be respectful , but he took little credit for his skills those , james pierre said , his son developed on his own that allowed pierre to bypass an offer to play basketball for iowa state and pursue baseball , first at galveston \( tex \) junior college and then at south alabama the colorado rockies drafted him in the 13th round in 1998 , and after starting his first professional season as a fourth outfielder and occasional ninthplace hitter for shortseason portland , ore , he led the northwest league in hitting \( 352 \) and stolen bases \( 38 \) with the rockies , he often waited for the coaches by the batting cages on springtraining mornings dave collins , colorado s firstbase coach and a former big league outfielder , challenged him to bunt with 02 counts , and pierre kept improving the power , though , never came pierre has 4 home runs in 2 , 077 career atbats , and none at homer friendly coors field he had less than three years of major league experience when the rockies traded him to the marlins last november , dumping mike hampton s salary \( which was quickly moved to the atlanta braves \) for a package that included center fielder preston wilson , who led the national league with 141 runs batted in this season pierre is at peace with the deal , happy that the rockies cleared space for him to establish himself and disappointed only that they gave up on him he led the league with 45 infield hits and 29 bunt hits he hit one home run he never longed for power , modeling himself after tony gwynn and wade boggs , hitters with oppositefield swings , and kenny lofton , a leadoff hitter who uses his speed in all parts of his offense knowing he had no power helped him get to the big leagues , pierre said i had to learn how to bunt and run the bases and play good defense , he said the yankees have been adept at shutting down opponents' key players in the postseason pierre expects the yankees to guard against the bunt as other teams have they 've been doing that for four years , he said i guess they can try all that is left is to convince others that his game works i'm glad we 're having the success we 're having as a team without the home runs , pierre said the way the balls are flying out these days it just shows the general manager and baseball people that this game can still work photo the marlins' juan pierre played all 162 games this season he had 204 hits , batted 305 , scored 100 runs and stole 65 bases he hit just one home run \( photo by gary i rothstein \)
one old , one young one righthander , one lefthander one dominating , one exciting if there were two pitchers who seemed destined to play in the allstar game next week after what they have accomplished this season , they were roger clemens and dontrelle willis one is chasing history with the yankees and the other has begun the long chase with flair for the florida marlins but , as usual , there were some omissions in both leagues even as baseball employed a new selection process in which players chose most of the reserves , it is impossible to include every solid candidate so clemens , who won his 300th game last month and will retire after this season , and willis , whose funky delivery and fearless pitching would have made him mustsee tv , are not allstars to clemens , the slight was nothing to grouse about since he sounded as if he did not want to pitch anyway clemens said the break would allow him to watch two of his sons prepare for the high school football season and would give his 40yearold body a rest clemens grinned when he was asked about missing a chance for a farewell on a national stage i have n't worried about it up until now , clemens said i'm not going to start now my whole career has basically been one commissioner bud selig called the voting extremely well done and deflected criticism of the process by saying the players and the managers are best equipped to pick the reserves while selig said you can always say x and y player should have been selected , he admitted that clemens was a valuable candidate for a game that will decide the homefield advantage in the world series roger clemens is a definite hall of famer , selig said in a telephone interview he s been doing it for his career plus he s doing well this year but i'm not going to secondguess the players or the managers i know what kind of pressure they 're under george steinbrenner , the principal owner of the yankees , was perturbed that clemens was bypassed how can you leave off a guy that has struck out over 4 , 000 men and the number of victories he s won \? steinbrenner said how do you leave him off an allstar team \? the player balloting was close to perfect , with the yankees an exception as a team that hardly voted pat courtney , a spokesman for baseball , said 90 percent of the major league players completed ballots , but he refused to provide a breakdown for how many players from each team voted an associated press survey revealed that more than half the yankees did not fill out ballots i know one thing we had about 20 minutes to do it , manager joe torre said we got it in tampa and we were told it had to be back today we have other things to do during the course of the day , other than fill out an allstar ballot still , by ignoring the ballots the yankees forfeited their right to pick the players for a team that will dictate where they could potentially play game 7 of the world series a person who was involved in the process said the ballots were delivered to teams on june 23 or 24 , were distributed before the games of june 25 and were supposed to be returned the next day but the yankees were remiss i really need to find out what happened there , selig said i'm going to find out while clemens was nonchalant about his omission , david wells was more ornery wells , who with clemens and mike mussina was a strong candidate , wondered how none of the yankee starters were selected and said , i guess they want the national league to win torre , who has managed the allstars five times since 1997 , said he was a little resentful that the new homefield format implies that the previous teams did not try to win since torre has not been bashful about picking his own players for the team , he did not dispute the idea that there could have been some people who were antiyankee in their selections maybe they were sick of me taking all my players all the time , torre said i said that with a giggle , not a sneer there will be one more player from a group of five in each league who will be added to each allstar team through an internet vote that runs until tomorrow orlando cabrera , luis castillo , geoff jenkins , corey patterson \( out for the year with an injured left knee \) and benito santiago are the candidates in the national league giambi , eric byrnes , jason varitek , frank thomas and bengie molina are on the american league list there has been more conversation about the allstar game than ever before , selig said i have n't heard this much talk in a long time
the annualmeeting season is here , and one thing seems certain from a glance at the resolutions shareholders have filed the persistent bear market and recent corporate scandals have taken as great a toll on trust in management as they have on investors' wallets state pension funds , unions and other investors , big and small , are clamoring for their say on executive compensation packages , board elections , even choosing where companies are incorporated they want general electric to trim severance packages , citigroup to eliminate golden parachutes , sprint to stop repricing the stock options granted to management and delta air lines to charge stock options against earnings they want qwest communications to link options to performance , walmart to split the job of chairman and chief executive into two posts and general motors to protect the environment in new york , william c thompson jr , the city comptroller , acting on behalf of the new york city police and fire department pension funds , has submitted resolutions to ge , halliburton and conocophillips asking for a board review of their offshore operations in terms of potential financial and reputational risks arising from conducting business with terroristlinked countries like iran it s going to be a raucous few months companies as disparate as cendant and eastman kodak , exxon mobil and aol time warner , cocacola and bank of america , bristolmyers squibb and sbc communications are going to have to meet with very disgruntled shareholders angry investors have already filed a record number of resolutions for inclusion in the proxy statements sent each year to all investors the deadline for filing proxy resolutions at most companies comes in the fall , months before the annual meeting , and few shareholders recognized in the autumn of 2001 exactly how bad corporate behavior had become enron , scene of the first big scandal , did not begin its spiral into bankruptcy until that november but investors have now had more than a year to stew over their helplessness as news of other accounting and insidertrading scandals has piled up the investor responsibility research center , a nonprofit group in washington that advises institutions on proxy issues , has already counted 893 resolutions this year through friday , compared with 802 for all of 2002 s proxies most are related to corporate governance issues 653 so far , versus 529 in 2002 apparently , shareholders do not believe that the new laws , rules and policies spewing from washington and wall street will safeguard their investments it surprises a lot of our clients , but the sarbanesoxley bill is simply not warding off a record number of shareholder resolutions , said david drake , a managing director of georgeson shareholder communications , a proxy solicitation firm immunity has not been granted to companies whose names have not been linked to corporate evildoing kodak , for one , faces six resolutions , up from two last year and three the year before they touch on stock options , environmental reporting , board elections none of them areas in which the company has been castigated of late ge , whose annual meetings were once seen as virtual loveins , has been bombarded with 25 shareholder proposals , the most in corporate america , questioning everything from compensation plans to nuclear power plant safety investors are seeking a new gold standard for corporate governance , and they are putting a lot of companies onto their postenron punch list , said patrick s mcgurn , senior vice president of institutional shareholder services , which advises institutions on proxy matters shareholders , it seems , have come to recognize the potentially sinister implications of seemingly benign corporate policies years ago , they endorsed the spread of stock options in the belief that options aligned executive interests with their own then they saw executives manipulate earnings reports to pump up their options shareholders enjoyed the tax savings that companies like tyco international and ingersollrand received for incorporating in bermuda until they discovered that it does not allow aggrieved shareholders to sue on their own , shareholder resolutions are unlikely to bring fundamental management change few ever garner a majority vote more important , the vast majority of them are precatory , or nonbinding , so management can ignore them even if they are voted in the new york city pension fund system has actually filed resolutions at several companies , including pacific healthcare , gillette , goodyear and hasbro , to require them to take action on any resolutions that win a majority but that , too , is nonbinding still , the resolutions are not futile exercises they are a highly public way for shareholders to register anger with management and potentially a public relations nightmare last year , we saw recordbreaking votes for resolutions on auditor conflicts , golden parachutes , all sorts of issues that used to attract just modest support , said carol bowie , director for governance research at the investor responsibility research center
the common thread a story of science , politics , ethics , and the human genome by john sulston and georgina ferry illustrated 310 pp washington the joseph henry press 2495 it has been 50 years since james watson and francis crick discovered the double helix , the structure of dna and if all goes well , during this year the sequencing of the human genome the threebillionunit molecular code for constructing a human being will be completed the common thread , by john sulston , the british scientist who directed a portion of the sequencing work , and georgina ferry , a science writer , is both an autobiography of sulston and an account of his pitched battle with his longtime nemesis , craig venter venter was until recently the head of celera genomics , a private american company bent on beating everybody else to the genome sulston regards celera as the microsoft of biology and venter as the molecularbiological equivalent of bill gates this is not meant as a compliment sulston at one point describes venter as the potential destroyer of all that we had worked for so powerful a presence was venter in molecular biology , as well as in sulston s professional life , that venter emerges as the driving force of the narrative sulston started off rather unglamorously as a worm biologist , interested in the lowly nematode caenorhabditis elegans , a tiny creature barely onesixteenth of an inch from tip to tail he did handson worm research , attended worm meetings and published his results in the worm breeders' gazette , an informal newsletter of worm scientists it must be read with attention by people beyond that circle , too last year sulston and two colleagues in worm science received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their work he got drawn into the genome project in 1987 , when after four years of work on c elegans he was invited to a conference in the united states to give a cost estimate of sequencing the entire human genome establishing the order of its molecular components the human genome project , eventually set up by the national institutes of health in bethesda , md , and headed by none other than jim watson himself , officially began in 1990 , with a target completion date of 2005 the work proceeded slowly , however , and by the end of 1994 less than 1 percent of the full genome had been sequenced and placed into public databases , while the scientists involved held a series of planning , strategy , timetable and organizational sessions in 1996 , finally , at one such meeting in bermuda , sulston helped define an etiquette of sharing , an ideal that applied both to the division of sequencing labor among an international consortium of laboratories and to the release of data derived from them sulston s notion was to publish the information immediately and openly as it arrived , with no restrictions imposed upon use open access and early release mean that anyone in the worldwide biological community can use those data and turn them into biological understanding and ultimately into new inventions that can be patented , he says but the sequence itself in its raw form when publicly released becomes unpatentable in 1998 , two years after the bermuda meeting , venter , a scientist formerly with the national institute for neurological disorders and stroke , announced that he had obtained private backing to form a company that would sequence the human genome by 2001 his claim had to be taken seriously because in 1995 one of his earlier enterprises , the institute for genomic research \( tigr \) , had completed the world s first sequencing of a freeliving organism , the diseasecausing bacterium haemophilus influenzae having now staked out the human genome as his own private turf , venter , never a paragon of tact , suggested that the governmentfinanced researchers confine themselves to sequencing the genome of the laboratory mouse it was like asking them to walk into the sea and drown , watson said later venter s goal at celera was to produce a quick and dirty version of the genome in an attempt to locate genes that drug companies and other researchers could use to provide cures for human diseases celera , whose corporate motto was speed matters discovery ca n't wait , planned to patent several hundred genes and license them to commercial outfits for a fee , while publishing the nonpatented sequences on the company s web site as celera issued a series of evermoreastonishing press releases reporting its having reached and passed a succession of important scientific milestones \( one of which was sequencing the fruit fly genome in five months , whereas it had taken sulston s group more than nine years to sequence c elegans \) , sulston saw his dream of an open and unrestricted human genome turn into a nightmare of genomic privatization by a singleminded biocapitalist to sulston , the notion of patenting genes was morally offensive the genome was the common heritage of humankind and not the preserve of any individual , group or corporation also , patenting genes made no conceptual sense , he thought genetic sequences were not venter s or anyone else s invention and should be no more patentable than a rainbow and as a practical matter , tying up various bits of genetic information in endless patent disputes would retard the further progress of science and medicine to sulston and his colleagues in the publicly supported project , this was war
cairo , march 6 with war clouds hovering over iraq , regional economies are driving in two different directions egypt s much needed tourists are staying away in record numbers in turkey , jordan and syria none thriving economically cutrate oil imports and special trade deals with iraq are at risk of evaporating for the producer nations in the persian gulf , by contrast , the same war jitters have helped push oil prices to more than 33 a barrel and could produce at least a temporary windfall the oilhungry countries to iraq s north and west turkey , syria , jordan and egypt should all expect some level of economic pain , said ahmed galal , executive director of the egyptian center for economic studies in cairo the oilrich countries to iraq s south and east stand to be net beneficiaries , at least as long as the threat of war , or an actual conflict , keeps oil prices elevated , he added the poorer countries are already seeking increased assistance to compensate for the costs of war in egypt the government has forecast that even a brief war could lead to 6 billion or more in losses in a country heavily dependent on tourism , visitors are already shying away tourism is a coward , said mamdouh salem , secretary general of the egyptian hotel association it flees whenever something bad happens tourism plunged after the sept 11 attacks but staged a strong comeback last summer this boomandbust cycle has been recurring since the 1991 gulf war , which also scared visitors away for an extended period tourism crashed again after islamic militants massacred 58 foreign tourists in luxor in 1997 commercial shipping through the suez canal , another major source of egyptian revenue , is also expected to decline in addition , about two million egyptians work abroad , mostly in the persian gulf , and a war could reduce that income turkey , meanwhile , has been importing iraqi oil at below market prices outside official united nations channels for several years , with large tanker trucks daily crossing its border with northern iraq but a war in iraq would cost the turkish economy an estimated 25 billion to 30 billion , said david lubin , who follows emerging markets , including turkey , for hsbc bank in london the figure is close to the aid package that the united states offered turkey in exchange for allowing american forces to enter northern iraq from turkey turkey s parliament narrowly rejected the proposal last week , though it may reconsider the economic consequences for turkey are serious , mr lubin said if turkey does n't have an aid package , they could be facing big trouble syria s trade with iraq has flourished since the two countries reduced longstanding tensions two years ago syria is selling consumer products to iraq , which in turn funnels oil to syria at sharply reduced prices neither side acknowledges the oil transfer , which takes place outside the united nations monitoring system for iraqi oil it is believed to reach up to 200 , 000 barrels a day , according to oil industry sources but syria s economy is vulnerable to any disruption in those ties syria , which is on the united states' list of countries that sponsors international terrorism , lacks a wealthy patron that could provide an economic safety net iraq was desperate for lifelines to the world after sanctions were imposed after its 1990 invasion of kuwait and offered sweetheart oil deals to its neighbors but if the united states ousts saddam hussein international sanctions would almost certainly be lifted and a new iraqi government would be free to sell oil openly in the gulf , saudi arabia has indicated it would be willing to use its spare capacity to put additional oil on the world market if needed in a crunch , a move that would boost its revenues also , saudi arabia and kuwait are not expected to face the huge cleanup bills that saddled their economies in the wake of the 1991 conflict as long as oil prices are pushed up , they should n't be harmed at all , mr lubin said but oil price hikes may only be temporary , the analysts said in the 1991 war oil prices that had been below 20 a barrel doubled during the fighting but quickly reverted to previous levels after iraqi troops were driven out of kuwait
a bronx man trapped for two days under an avalanche of newspapers , magazines and books was rescued by firefighters and neighbors yesterday in a small urban drama that recalled the macabre 1947 tale of the collyer brothers the victim , patrice moore , 43 , of 1991 morris avenue , near tremont avenue , was found shortly after 1 pm in a 10by10foot room crammed with paper and other detritus that completely filled it , except for a small corner where he slept , neighbors and city officials said a reclusive man who lived alone and had been saving magazines , newspapers , books , catalogs and junk mail for a decade and had apparently thrown none of it out mr moore was buried standing up under the collapse on saturday , according to neighbors , who heard him moaning and mumbling through the door , which had been blocked by all the paper the landlord broke in with a crowbar and neighbors began digging into the entombing piles of publications , communications and advertisements calls to the city brought the police , three companies of firefighters , health and buildings officials , and officials from the office of emergency management it took more than an hour to extricate mr moore 50 garbage bags of his paper had to be hauled out just to reach him and he was taken to st barnabas hospital with leg injuries , apparently the result of the weight that fell on him and the fluid that accumulated in his legs during his captivity he was reported in stable condition last night , a hospital spokesman said deon baitmon , 35 , a nextdoor neighbor who was one of a few people who knew mr moore had been living in a room filled with paper , said she had tried to persuade him to get rid of some of it , without success i told him , 'you 've got to be able to get in and out , ' she said , but he did n't really want to hear about that while it was hardly comparable , the episode echoed the strange cautionary tale of langley and homer collyer , who lived for years barricaded in a 12room mansion at fifth avenue and 128th street in east harlem with their legendary collection of stuff tons of newspapers , magazines and books 14 grand pianos , chandeliers , mirrors , bottles , rotting groceries and an automobile chassis on march 21 , 1947 , alerted by a mysterious phone call , the police broke in and found the body of homer , who had been blind and bedridden after lengthy searching , they found langley s body under piles of junk he had apparently died of a heart attack weeks earlier after triggering one of many booby traps set for burglars , and homer had died of starvation several days later while people who hoard obsessively are generally regarded as troubled , there is no agreement among experts on the causes of the phenomenon , which dates back thousands of years cases are uncovered from time to time , often after the death of a recluse discloses hidden wealth or troves of possessions behind an otherwise unremarkable facade after getting a glimpse into mr moore s room yesterday , some neighbors recalled that almost every day for the past decade he had received a heavy load of mail newspapers , magazines , books that he ordered with a variety of names and never paid for , and tons of unsolicited advertising and other mail a cursory examination of the stacks turned up numerous copies of sports illustrated , nascar racing publications , vibe , scuba diving , essence , skiing magazines , savoy , sound and vision , fitness magazine and copies of the harvard business review he got everything , said john thomas , a neighbor you name it he got it except playboy bennie jones , 62 , the owner of the threestory brownstone , said i knew he was getting a whole lot of magazines , but i had no idea there were so many inside i ca n't see how he had any space to move in there it s crazy he had the place stacked up with magazines , and they fell on him mr moore , who was unemployed and paid his 250amonth rent from the public assistance money he received , lived the quiet life of a hermit , his neighbors said , rarely going out and never allowing visitors into his windowless room on the parlor floor , halfway down a dark , narrow corridor his room is his private room , ms baitmon said he opened the door to get his mail , which was addressed to people named joe smith , pamela cruise and other fictitious names , but bore his apartment number , 1b occasionally , she said , she heard his radio or his voice , singing or mumbling to himself over the weekend , she heard his voice from time to time , but there were no cries for help , nothing very coherent he was just talking through the door a bit , she said , and noted that she had not been alarmed the discovery of mr moore s plight was almost an accident it happened that he had asked his landlord last week for a small loan , and mr jones went to his door with a couple of dollars yesterday he knocked on mr moore s door there was no answer at first , but then he heard a voice inside it sounded strange it occurred to mr jones that mr moore might need help the door was locked , but mr jones got a crowbar and pried it open stacks of magazines and books had fallen against the door , and he had to get a couple of neighbors to force it open they were astonished by what they found inside the room was stuffed from wall to wall and floor to ceiling with stacks of paper they also heard moaning from a corner , behind the stacks he was trapped in a little corner , said mr thomas we had to take books out just to get to him mr jones called 911 , and by the time the firefighters of engine company 42 arrived , the neighbors had hauled away enough material to create a path and to unpaper mr moore nearly down to his waist another obstacle remained a bookcase , apparently the only piece of furniture in the room , had also fallen , wedging mr moore tightly in an almost upright position the firefighters raised the bookcase , hauled away more loads of paper and eventually freed mr moore , who was carried out on a stretcher he could n't say much , mr thomas recalled he was in pain even as mr moore driven away , the neighbors said , a postman was arriving with another delivery of newspapers , magazines and junk mail for him he never threw anything away , mr thomas said photos stacks of trash bags on morris avenue in the bronx hold the newspapers and magazines that firefighters cleared from a man s room \( photo by shannon stapleton for the new york times \) \( pg b2 \) the piles of books and newspapers that buried a man in his room for two days \( photo by shannon stapleton

albany , oct 22 a member of the state board of regents said at a legislative hearing wednesday that an appeals system should be created to allow students who fail regents exams to graduate from high school if they can show solid performance in their classes and meet other criteria if you do n't graduate , the penalties are too great , the board member , harry phillips 3rd , said in an interview before the hearing i was looking for a way to identify capable kids and to allow them to graduate if they are going to school , and they are trying it seemed like a way to reach out and be caring and not destroy the standards in written testimony submitted to the joint hearing of the assembly and senate education committees , mr phillips also urged the regents to explore other ways for students to show that they are ready to graduate he said he supported alternative schools' approach of using other means to evaluate students , like portfolios of their work i'm a big outcomes guy , and their outcomes are so good , he said mr phillips s decision to air his ideas outside the regents meetings was a sign that dissension among the regents has grown since examinations in math and physics in june aroused a sharp outcry many students and teachers said the tests were badly designed and unfair , a view later supported by a panel of math experts and by the regents themselves the scores for both exams are being adjusted the regents' testing system was defended at the joint hearing by richard p mills , the state education commissioner , saying that the exams have been very helpful to children and that children in new york state are learning more now than a decade ago he received strong backing from joel i klein , the new york city schools chancellor borrowing from winston churchill , mr klein said testing , like democracy , was imperfect , but better than the alternatives we need to be highly demanding , he said whatever the elements of arbitrariness , whatever the imperfections , we are on the right course others disagreed strongly deborah meier , a former school principal in east harlem , said at the hearing that the new york testing system failed to measure most of the qualities that are considered important in an educated person , like the ability to speak effectively , to produce wellreasoned written work , to do independent research and to weigh conflicting evidence what the testing does do , she added , is signal that what does count is none of the above many of the critics said adopting an appeals system like the one mr phillips suggested would not go far enough , but others at the hearing , like james r tallon jr , another board member who testified , thought it could damage the whole regents assessment system by opening a large loophole the question is how to create an appeal system strict enough to keep it from becoming a wideopen barn door , mr tallon said mr phillips , a businessman from westchester county , said that massachusetts had a system that limits appeals to students who miss the state s passing score of 220 by only a few points , but also requires that they have very good attendance records and that their classroom work be statistically comparable to that of students who passed the tests this past academic year was the first in which massachusetts high school students had to pass the tests to graduate , and about 3 , 000 of 60 , 000 did not the state received 2 , 373 appeals and approved 1 , 191 of them the appeals were screened first by a committee and then were ruled on by the state education commissioner heidi perlman , a spokeswoman for the massachusetts department of education , said the state did not view the process as a lessening of its standards it was designed out of an issue of fairness , she said , because we believe there are really students out there who are doing 220level work in the classroom every day and simply ca n't do it on a test they sit down and take a test and freeze photo harry phillips 3rd , right , urged alternatives to passing the exams james r tallon jr , left , said the proposal could be dangerous \( photo by stewart cairns for the new york times \)

a lawyer for michael c skakel , who was convicted last year of killing martha moxley 28 years ago in a gated enclave of greenwich , conn , said yesterday that she would seek a new trial based on allegations by a new witness that two bronx youths had bludgeoned the 15yearold victim to death with a golf club while the conviction of mr skakel , 42 , a nephew of ethel kennedy , appeared to close the books on a murder case whose blend of wealth and celebrity had spawned global news coverage , an appeal is pending , screenplays are in the works and supporters of mr skakel , including his cousin robert f kennedy jr , are still reexamining alternate theories in a largely circumstantial case the latest twist involves mr kennedy , who wrote a 14 , 000word defense of mr skakel published in the atlantic monthly in february , and a new celebrityconnected witness he helped to turn up a cousin of kobe bryant , the los angeles lakers star who faces charges of sexually assaulting a 19yearold woman in colorado in june we will be filing a petition for a new trial in a few weeks which will lay out the information we have developed , mr skakel s lawyer , hope seeley , said in a brief telephone interview , in which she confirmed , but declined to expand on , the substance of an article on the case yesterday in the hartford courant the courant quoted ms seeley as saying that gitano bryant , known as tony , a cousin of kobe bryant and a former privateschool classmate of mr skakel , had told an investigator for the skakel defense team that he and three friends had gone to belle haven , where miss moxley lived , on oct 30 , 1975 , the night of the murder the article said that mr bryant , in a 90minute videotaped interview last month , had said that two of the youths , who had met miss moxley at a street fair and a church dance in the weeks before her death , had picked up golf clubs in mr skakel s yard and had spoken of attacking miss moxley caveman style mr bryant , according to his account , wanted no part of their plans and left the three before 9 pm an hour before the killing to return to new york , where he lived at the time he said he that learned of the murder the next day , and that within days his friends admitted to him their role in the attack the courant did not name the two youths , ages 15 and 17 at the time , who mr bryant said he believed were the killers ms seeley said yesterday that they would be identified in the petition for a new trial mr bryant said the third youth with him that night was geoff byrne , a belle haven resident who was 11 at the time he was said to have died of a drug overdose at age 17 the case that gave rise to decades of mystery dates back to the night of oct 30 , 1975 , when miss moxley was battered to death outside her family s home in belle haven she was found the next day , and the police concluded that a broken golf club found nearby was the weapon despite an intensive investigation , the crime remained unsolved mr skakel , a neighbor who was 15 at the time of the killing , was a suspect , but conclusive proof was lacking then , in 1997 , investigators pounced on a break in a taped conversation with the ghostwriter of an autobiography he hoped to write , mr skakel said he was drunk , high on marijuana and sexually aroused on the night of he murder and had climbed a tree in the moxley yard and masturbated while peeping into miss moxley s room mr skakel was arrested and charged in january 2000 in june 2002 , mr skakel was convicted of the crime and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison there was no direct evidence tying him to the murder , but jurors said they were convinced of his guilt by his own statements placing himself at the scene , and his ready access to the murder weapon they also discounted his alibi , which was that he was watching television with two brothers and a cousin at the time of the killing it was unclear why mr bryant had remained silent for 28 years , and several attempts to reach him yesterday were unsuccessful ms seeley said his reasons would be addressed in her petition for a new trial she said she did not believe he faced any liability for withholding information mr bryant , a former bronx resident who is a businessman in the coconut grove section of miami , acknowledged in his videotaped interview that he had never gone to the authorities , but said he had told his story to a friend , tres mills , in december 2001 at the time , mr mills was writing a screenplay based on the case the courant quoted mr mills as saying that he had urged mr bryant to approach prosecutors to try to clear mr skakel , but was rebuffed mr mills , it said , sent his script incorporating mr bryant s account to mr skakel s former defense lawyer , michael sherman to the prosecutor , jonathan benedict and to dorthy moxley , the victim s mother , but all expressed little interest the paper said that mr mills read mr kennedy s article and told mr kennedy of mr bryant s story , and that mr kennedy passed it on to new lawyers for mr skakel , ms seeley and hubert santos their investigator , vito colucci jr , interviewed mr bryant in florida last month
of all the rabbis in all the yeshivas in all of brooklyn , milton balkany stands apart in certain quarters of the city s orthodox jewish world , he is the man to see if you need access to government , whether to secure grants for your worthy organization or kosher meals for your incarcerated relative rabbi balkany has spent 30 years cultivating the perception that he is more than the principal of a wellrespected girls' school in borough park he is someone with influence presidents have uttered his name senators have thought better of not returning his calls he has enjoyed access to bob , as in dole , and rudy , as in rudy the rabbi from borough park became influential through the same means employed by the oil baron from houston and the entertainment lawyer from la giving politicians bushels of money when you bless politicians in this way , they tend to return your calls and help you with pet projects , allowing you to strut about as someone with pull rabbi balkany moves in very , very important circles because people see him as a leader , said his lawyer , benjamin brafman he added , there are not a great many orthodox men in borough park who can pick up the phone and get just about any united states senator to take the call but the rabbi now has a stutter in his strut he was charged this week with misappropriating federal funds , a problem that a phone call cannot make go away before the new york post prematurely labeled him robbi this week , he was best known for his talent in bundling together large contributions he has ties to the affluent who live alongside the poor in borough park , and is related by marriage to the rubashkin kosher meat dynasty he was also known for spreading the wealth among those he believed to be proisrael , proeducation , probalkany in recent years the rabbi from borough park and his many relatives he has 13 children have contributed substantially to congressional candidates in alabama , arkansas , illinois , missouri , montana , oregon , south carolina , south dakota , texas , utah , wisconsin and virginia oh , and new york rabbi balkany , 57 , may be better known in washington than he is in new york city a frequent visitor to the capitol , he was guest chaplain in the house of representatives in june , around the same time that he and his family contributed 10 , 000 to the reelection campaign of president bush he often spoke of his access during the twohour time slots he bought on the popular talkline with zev brenner radio program these appearances allowed him to discuss current events , drop names and burnish his image as a man of influence he has met with real higherups in the administration , mr brenner said some find the balkany act a little icky the bloomberg administration has kept its distance , perhaps in view of the rabbi s role in some unseemly daycare voucher favoritism during the giuliani years and several public officials declined to share their distaste on the record , in part because of the rabbi s perceived influence others , including his lawyer , admire the man he is a person to go to when you are in trouble , mr brafman said he has had orphans living in his home for extended periods of time , he has raised children abandoned by families , he has raised funds for weddings of young couples a pretty special man in many ways but rabbi balkany s image as a man of influence and trust has been damaged by charges that he misused a 700 , 000 grant from the federal department of housing and urban development the money was earmarked for a building that houses a program for children with learning disabilities , but prosecutors say that much of it was diverted to companies with familial ties to the rabbi , as well as to cover some personal expenses the indictment also contains an ironic note when a hud auditor asked him to open his books last december , the rabbi refused , and threatened to call the department s inspector general and complain mr brafman acknowledged that rabbi balkany has been around the grant process for a long time , and admitted to wishing that the rabbi had a more sophisticated accounting system separate accounts , for example still , he said , the grant money was spent properly , with none of it used to cover the rabbi s personal expenses if there is a violation here of the law , it s in my view not an intentional violation , he said on his counsel s advice , the rabbi is keeping his own counsel but mr brenner said that rabbi balkany tentatively plans to appear on his radio program next week perceptions , after all , must be maintained
in hiring santiago calatrava to design the new transit hub at the world trade center , the port authority of new york and new jersey thought large and in his first public words about the project , mr calatrava made it clear that he , too , would think large on the scale of grand central terminal and pennsylvania station old pennsylvania station those places are gates to the city , he said in an interview on monday , 10 days after signing a contract to design the 2 billion transit center , in partnership with the stv group and dmjm harris new york city has a tradition of great stations there are cities in the world that do n't have that new york has it while short on specifics , mr calatrava described a structure that would have the most universal character of any at the site , something above and beyond a path terminal , though that function will be at its core he envisions a civic gathering place that would be open 24 hours a day , pulsing with life and movement , sending people out into the city , greeting travelers from the airport , discharging commuters to nearby ferries and even sheltering visitors from the rain of all the buildings , this is more devoted to the everyday person , said mr calatrava , 52 , a spanish citizen who lives parttime in manhattan and sometimes walks through grand central just for the pleasure of it he deflected speculation about what the path terminal might look like , an inevitable question since his designs are renowned for sinuous curves , abstract monumentality and sometimes anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms because his buildings also tend to resemble freestanding sculptures , it would be perilous to guess how successfully mr calatrava can cope with constriction this station will be different than anything else i 've done , he said i do n't remember having had to work in such a dense , dense core of a city asked whether his fluid and flowing style might be incongruent with the more crystalline forms of the master plan for the trade center site by studio daniel libeskind , mr calatrava said we will certainly work within the master plan but you see , if you look at the city , it s always done from incongruence particularly new york illustrates that , more than any other city for his part , mr libeskind welcomed mr calatrava i think he will bring in a very good dimension , he said yesterday there is plenty of capacity for expression in this station no matter how the design turns out , the terminal will be the architectural face that the new trade center presents to most new yorkers , since it will be on church street , closer to the spine of broadway and landmarks like the new york stock exchange freedom tower and the memorial , by contrast , will be on the west side of the 16acre site and the office towers planned on church street may be many years distant construction on the terminal could begin late next year or early in 2005 , according to a draft document that is part of the environmental review , at the same spot where the temporary station stands now underground levels would be finished by the end of 2006 , with the main terminal building and pedestrian network completed between 2007 and 2009 the temporary station , designed by robert i davidson of the port authority , is to open next month at the moment , the design team is studying transportation demands that may exist in 25 years to ensure that the terminal is flexible enough , said dominick m servedio , the chairman and chief executive of stv group his firm , mr calatrava and dmjm harris are allied as the downtown design partnership , which has a 192 million contract from the authority the project is being financed by the federal transit administration and from insurance proceeds mr servedio said the downtown design partnership , the port authority and the metropolitan transportation authority had been in a dialogue about the relation of the path terminal to the fulton street transit center , being designed by nicholas grimshaw partners and ove arup partners what is known about the trade center project is that it will include four passenger platforms for 10car trains \( the same length as those that existed before the attack \) , a vast mezzanine , lower and upper concourses and a streetlevel building , presumably under glass , with retail space there will be pedestrian passageways to the 1 and 9 subway station , the world financial center , the fulton street transit center , liberty plaza and other buildings on the trade center site we have a goal to fulfill , mr calatrava said , creating interior spaces of high quality , welcoming people , having them get immediately in touch with the light , giving them from the moment in which they are on the platform the feeling they are in ground zero , they are arriving in the city the sequence of spaces will be one of the most interesting things to explore , he said although the mezzanine is underground , mr calatrava said he hoped a way might be found to bring daylight and views into the space madelyn wils , the chairwoman of community board 1 in lower manhattan , applauded mr calatrava s ambitious vision to a point it s certainly wonderful that he wants to create the best possible indoor space , she said yesterday obviously , we want to be as creative and visionary as possible but we also want street life we do n't want to internalize the civic audience too much we want them to be on the streets , shopping , visiting other parts of the area though none of mr calatrava s other stations are precisely analogous to the path terminal , he said his designs for the lyon airport station and the orient station in lisbon embodied the kind of monumentality that might be appropriate the stadelhofen station in zurich exemplifies integration into an existing context , he said , and the li geguillemins tgv station in li ge , belgium , shows how stations can play a role in economic regeneration the only new york city project that mr calatrava has yet completed is the fivefoot , stainlesssteel new york times capsule , installed outside the american museum of natural history in 2001 and not to be opened until 3000 five years ago , he was part of a team with beyer blinder belle that bid unsuccessfully on a new concourse and ticketing area for pennsylvania station within the landmark general post office on eighth avenue he really is the modern descendant in the great tradition of architectengineers like robert maillart , pier luigi nervi and isambard kingdom brunel , said john belle , when asked yesterday how he had come to choose mr calatrava nervi , who designed the george washington bridge bus station of 1963 for the port authority , is a hero of mr calatrava s so is eero saarinen , whose trans world airlines flight center of 1962 at kennedy airport may be revived as part of a new terminal being planned by jetblue airways and the port authority it puts us in a tradition of the port authority as a client of grand buildings , mr calatrava said photos the port authority s george washington bridge bus station was designed by pier luigi nervi , who is a hero of santiago calatrava s \( photo by don

greenwich village in the early 1960 s and lenny bruce , the shocking social satirist of the day , seemed an ideal couple , both reveling in full countercultural bloom bruce , widely considered the father of comic realism , had been harassed for his ribald act in other cities , yet he felt comfortable enough in his native new york to deliver unfettered his bits about sex , politics and religion \( he called one of his more popular riffs how to relax your colored friends at parties \) but on three occasions in cafe au go go during march 1964 , the authorities thought he went too far with talk about bestiality and body parts he was arrested and , after a sixmonth trial in state supreme court in manhattan , convicted on misdemeanor obscenity charges for word crimes those who knew bruce well say that what happened in the courthouse at 100 centre street in december hastened his demise , death by drug overdose in august 1966 there s no question about it , the case killed him , said martin garbus , a lawyer who represented bruce at trial this was a man who was destroyed by the law he could n't get a job no one would touch him it was a sad , angry time for lenny now , 37 years after his death , some bruce devotees are mobilizing to help accomplish bruce s final , unfinished task appealing the verdict a petition is circulating and a movement is gaining momentum among performance artists and first amendment scholars to ask gov george e pataki to issue the one thing that would clear lenny bruce s name today a posthumous pardon the idea that a comic was sentenced to jail for obscenities used during his standup performance strikes some people as so objectionable that lobbying for a pardon is the least we can do , said margaret cho , a comedian who credits bruce with pioneering a new path for comedy away from the corny oneliners that once dominated the stage labeled a sick comic , he replied i'm not sick the world is sick , and i'm the doctor a spokesman for governor pataki , joe conway , said that if a petition was received in albany , mr pataki would review it at the time of his death , some of bruce s friends mourned him as a suicide victim driven to desperation while trying to appeal the guilty verdict after he was sentenced to four months on rikers island , a jail term he had not yet begun to serve , bruce grew distrustful of the law and lawyers and insisted on representing himself but a good appellate lawyer he was not bruce wanted to build a case based on his free speech rights , showing how the first amendment protected his comedy routines but he goofed on technicalities and missed deadlines and so he died a convicted man the movement to pardon lenny bruce is better late than never , from my point of view , said joan bertin , the executive director of the manhattanbased national coalition against censorship lenny bruce was really ahead of his time , and a very substantial unfairness was done to him for ultimately random reasons , this injustice was never righted the owner of the cafe where bruce was performing in the village , howard solomon , was also convicted of obscenity , but he successfully appealed the verdict in october 1965 since mr solomon was a codefendant of bruce , and was part of the bruce case , when his conviction was overturned many people believed that bruce , too , had been cleared technically , the conviction still stands , bruce s former lawyer , mr garbus , said last week ronald k l collins and david m skover , the authors of the trials of lenny bruce the fall and rise of an american icon \( sourcebooks inc , 2002 \) , made the discovery in the process of their research we are 2 , 000 percent sure of this , said mr collins , a scholar in residence at the first amendment center in arlington , va we were surprised we kept looking for some record but there was n't any people assumed that because the solomon case was reversed , the bruce case was reversed it was not last week , more than a halfdozen calls were made to court officials in manhattan with access to records from the time of the conviction , and none seemed to know about or be able to locate any record of an appeal for lenny bruce in the formal annals of recorded law , lenny bruce remains a criminal in new york state for word crimes , said mr skover , a professor at seattle university law school the reverence shown bruce today by comics who have walked in his footsteps is one indication of his legacy we consider him like a messianic figure he died so we could be free , ms cho said not to be blasphemous , but for me to be able to say that last statement is only because of his contributions not only to comedy , but to free speech in general there were undercover police officers in the village cafe on the nights bruce was accused of being obscene he apparently learned that they took notes and recounted parts of the performance for a grand jury in one of his recorded routines , he said , the cop did the act for the grand jury and it stunk , and i got busted a brooklyn law school professor , william e hellerstein , who , as a young legal aid lawyer , represented mr solomon , called bruce s conviction one of the great disgraces of legal history mr collins and mr skover have scheduled a news conference on tuesday to announce the pardon petition in conjunction with a new york county lawyers association event , the trials of lenny bruce free speech or crude comedy \? mr collins , a copetitioner with mr skover , summed it us this way i think lenny bruce should be pardoned for one simple reason what happened to him in 1964 was contrary to everything the first amendment represents there are a number of technical reasons , too , but that s the simple reason photo lenny bruce , who died in 1966 , was arrested after the police heard his act at a greenwich village club \( associated press \)
as dusk seeped into manhattan on a late december afternoon , terese capucilli maneuvered her unusually voluptuous dancer s body into a chair in a cramped dressing room down the hall from a warren of rehearsal studios near union square gone , at least for now , were the angles honed by more than 25 years of grueling discipline where pelvic bones once protruded , a softly rounded belly pushed against a flowing black shirt this is my biggest role yet , she said , gesturing to her curves i 've been waiting for this role all my life ms capucilli , 46 and nearly eight months pregnant , was speaking of becoming a mother \( she is married to bill randolph , an actor \) but in the close quarters she shares with christine dakin , 53 , as coartistic director of the martha graham dance company , she did not miss the coincidence of her role in giving new life to the company as well nearly three years after financial difficulties and litigation sidelined it , the ensemble reemerges on tuesday , when 24 company members and 4 students will resurrect 17 of graham s ballets from the allwoman chronicle and heretic , created in the 1920 s and 30 s , to phaedra , graham s 1962 exercise in lust and lies , and the ubiquitous appalachian spring in a twoweek run at the joyce theater when you hope for something for so long , you do n't quite believe it s true right away , ms capucilli said so it did n't quite hit home until halfway through this rehearsal period when we realized , 'well , yes , we are really here , and yes , we are preparing the dancers for the stage and it s actually happening' on aug 23 , a federal district court judge ruled in favor of the martha graham center of contemporary dance , the company s parent organization , in the lawsuit brought against it by ronald protas , martha graham s sole heir , who sought to prevent the company from performing her dances but even before then , ms capucilli and ms dakin had been working in overdrive to get the ensemble quite literally back on its feet financial troubles and the battle between mr protas and representatives of the graham center had forced the center to suspend operations in may 2000 , though its school opened in temporary quarters in january 2001 in the years following , ms dakin and ms capucilli , having worked together as associate artistic directors of the martha graham dance company since 1997 and lead dancers since the late 1970 s , sought to sustain a group of artists whose futures were riddled with uncertainty we have 10 dancers who were with us for quite some time before the suspension , ms capucilli said many of those dancers were just hitting their peak , just getting into martha s roles and starting to get into the principal roles , and the dances were torn from under their feet it was our goal during that time to keep the dancers together as much as we could , teaching repertory at the school and keeping them aware of what was happening marvin preston , the center s executive director , doled out regular updates on the legal wrangling as the dancers many of whom taught at the school , took gigs with other companies or pursued their own projects in the interim struggled to keep spirits high last may 9 , the company or what was left of it , filled out by student dancers performed formally for the first time since may 2000 in a benefit at city center it was our cry in the wilderness , said ms dakin , a birdlike woman seemingly molded in the image of graham our cry that said that people have to be aware that we have to stay alive and then , nothing until august , when judge miriam goldman cedarbaum ruled that the martha graham center owned the copyrights to 45 of the ballets created by graham , mr protas owned one , and 10 were in the public domain the case is under appeal everything accelerated quite quickly after we found out the judge s decision , ms capucilli said between august and january is a very short time to prepare for a season when you 're starting from stop , although a lot of plans we had already put together , just in case repertory had to be chosen , dancers selected then there was your production team , your development team , your publicist , rehearsal schedules and studio space , she said everything , everything needed to be completely focused we had the theater but we had nothing else not yet on salary , the dancers as graham dancers are wont to do rolled up the rugs in their living rooms and began practicing repertory in anticipation of the roles they would receive beginning oct 14 , the company moved into studios at 890 broadway , at 19th street , where the dancers rehearsed five , sometimes six , days a week from noon until 6 30 pm it was terrifying as to how much could actually be achieved in such a short period of time , ms dakin said we could never have done 17 ballets without our incredible new talent , and if the dancers that formed the core were n't the mature and courageous dancers that they are there was not the time to spoonfeed them
it has taken more than a decade , but the united states postal service and the general post office in new york city are finally about to part company in fact , seemingly overnight , most of the building is already empty that is because the president is coming to town the late senator daniel patrick moynihan worked for years to transform the grand old building at eighth avenue and 33rd street into a train station , but even after securing federal , state and city cooperation , no one could pin down the postal service on an exit date , said kevin sheekey , mr moynihan s former chief of staff then the republican national committee chose new york city for its national convention mr sheekey , who went on to work for mayor michael r bloomberg and now coordinates convention preparations for city hall , saw a dual opportunity in the post office building use it as a media center for the 15 , 000 journalists who will cover the convention , and use the convention as a wedge to get the post office out it was my last conversation with senator moynihan , mr sheekey said he knew it would be the beachhead to get the post office out and the station built in his words , 'we 'd no longer have to enter the city like rats we can enter like kings' \( senator moynihan , who was a democrat , did not think much of pennsylvania station \) and so after the post office leaves , the news media will move in and sometime after the convention ends , in early september 2004 and once the empire state development corporation actually owns the building , construction on the train station is expected to begin , a state official said negotiations between the state and the postal service are continuing on dec 16 , representatives from the news media will be given their first tour of what will be transformed next august into a mammoth multimedia city ultimately it will be a complex with a talk show row , internet alley , network studio sets , phone lines , cables , satellite communications and a bridge across eighth avenue , linking the building with madison square garden \( the bridge will cost about 1 million and will stand for just three months \) it is a switch for a building , renamed in 1982 after postmaster general james a farley , that has never once shut its doors since it opened in 1914 , a postal official said it is the only retail postal operation in new york that is open 24 hours a day , seven days a week , the place lastminute tax filers can always count on to get their papers in the place where 71 years ago postal workers started operation santa by raising money to provide gifts for children who sent their requests to the north pole the building , which stretches across two city blocks , with a grand sweep of granite stairs rising to a corinthian colonnade , will forever be linked to postal lore because of the engraving that runs above its 280foot frieze neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds the quotation , inspired by herodotus , was selected by the building s architect , william mitchell kendall , and over time became the postal service s unofficial motto with such close ties to the building , some postal employees become a touch defensive , insisting that they are not really leaving , just scaling back they will , for example , maintain some mail services there , like the retail windows , which will remain open around the clock , a postal official said at the moment , carriers continue to pick up mail there as well nevertheless , most of the 156 million square feet once occupied by the post office will be vacated much of the work , like the sorting of mail , has already been parceled out to other postal centers , said anthony musso , a spokesman for the postal service i have 31 years in the postal service , born and raised in new york , started my career at kennedy airport , and to me , this was always the post office , mr musso said as he walked around the ornate lobby on eighth avenue i never thought of headquarters in washington when the building opened on labor day , 1914 , it was hailed for its architectural splendor , its unparalleled work space and the mahogany offices afforded to the postmaster and his staff its walls are of handsome botticino marble , decorated with ornamental ironwork , read an article that appeared on sept 6 , 1914 , in the new york times the building was a marvel at the time besides its huge size \( even before an addition was built in 1935 \) , it was linked to a system of pneumatic tubes that blasted mail beneath new york city s streets the tubes , with enough pressure to send a container carrying up to 700 letters nearly 30 miles an hour , ran in a loop around much of manhattan , with an extension into brooklyn but as manual work gave way to mechanized work , and then to automation , the need for such a huge space in the middle of manhattan faded so , apparently , did the state of the building the front is gleaming today , with 70 retail windows running its length , restored works progress administrationera murals , shiny brass tables and fabulous coats of arms on the ceiling
san juan , pr , april 11 it cost him more than 1 , 000 , but no price could keep nestor rullan and his wife , milagros , from seeing major league baseball come to puerto rico so rullan had an associate go to the box office on the first day tickets went on sale and bought seats to each of the 22 games the montreal expos would play here this season it s worth it because we like baseball and the mets , said milagros , who lived with her husband in new york for five years they joined thousands of other puerto ricans tonight in welcoming big league baseball back to the island , although the game ended up short of a sellout seeking attendance and revenue , major league baseball , which owns and operates the expos , has shifted a portion of the team s schedule from montreal to hiram bithorn stadium , named after the first puerto rican to play in the major leagues this was opening night in san juan , although it was not the first major league game played here the texas rangers and the toronto blue jays opened the 2001 season in this stadium if i was a kid , i 'd ask my dad to buy tickets to go see the big leagues , said mets second baseman roberto alomar , whose family comes from salinas on the other side of the island like many , he viewed the expos' games as a trial run for a future franchise in puerto rico we might have only this one opportunity this is it it s up to puerto ricans to support it alomar went into the game needing one run to surpass roberto clemente for the most runs scored by a puerto rican in the major leagues , and he received one of the loudest ovations before the game in a miserable game for the mets , in which they were pounded , 100 , he also received huge cheers after making a diving stop on a ground ball others who were singled out for cheers before the game included mets shortstop rey sanchez and the expos' javier vazquez , jose vidro and wil cordero , who are all native puerto ricans alomar s mother , maria velasquez de alomar , was at the game her son called it a dream come true answering most questions in spanish in a news conference , alomar was asked what cap he would like to wear when he entered the hall of fame if i could , i 'd wear one of puerto rico because that s the one i wear in my heart , he said rullan , a 71yearold construction engineer from san juan , paid 75 each for two box seats down the firstbase line tonight tickets ranged from 10 to 85 and said the tickets were too expensive for most puerto ricans he hoped that would not dissuade fans from selling out the stadium , which holds over 19 , 000 , and would help puerto rico get their own team one day i 'd like to have a team here , rullan said there s enough fans here and there s a lot of puerto rican stars playing baseball hector sanjenis , 33 , brought his sons , alejandro , 9 , and emilio , 5 , and was awaiting his wife as they watched the mets take batting practice they paid 45 for each of their seats and hoped to watch juan gonzalez and the texas rangers in june sanjenis , the vice president of a little league in nearby guaynabo , called the expos' games an incredible opportunity i 've been to the us to see games , but the stadiums are so big you ca n't see anything , said sanjenis , a sales manager for an office supplies company he said he once paid a scalper 200 for a seat at yankee stadium , and he sounded as if the ticket prices here were a bargain we need to show the major leagues that puerto ricans love baseball , sanjenis said people do n't respond to the professional league here because many players from the us do n't play mets outfielder jeromy burnitz gave an incredulous look when someone asked if this appeared to be a good hitter s park it s 313 and turf , burnitz said , referring to the 313foot distance down the rightfield line and the artificial surface the leftfield wall is 315 feet away and the gaps are 365 feet in left and 360 in right , short of the 370380 average for major league parks still , none of those friendly dimensions helped the mets tonight as they scratched out only two hits the mets played in miami on thursday night and did not arrive at their hotel in the san juan neighborhood of isla verde until after 3 30 am , leaving players with little time to see the area before today s game reliever david weathers noticed a difference waking up and seeing the caribbean sea i feel like i'm on vacation , weathers said al leiter and burnitz had played in arecibo to the west , and burnitz lived a block from the team s hotel outside of police escorts from the airport and to the ballpark , he did not see this as much different from another road trip one player told kevin hallinan , baseball s chief of security , that it was reassuring to see him at the airport this morning hallinan s crew is guiding an armada of security forces that include officers from the fbi the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms the police from the cities of san juan and carolina the state police from puerto rico local fire departments and a national guard unit they have been stationed at the stadium around the clock since wednesday sharpshooters were stationed in the bullpens

kandahar , afghanistan nearly three months after president hamid karzai replaced one of the more powerful and colorful warlords in this important southern province , local and foreign officials are warning that the new governor will fail unless he receives more resources and support from the central government and international donors the appointment of the new governor , yusuf pashtun , a collegeeducated , englishspeaking former city planning and housing minister in the central government , was greeted by american diplomats and others as a sign that mr karzai was finally reckoning with warlords who run their provinces like fiefdoms and pay only lip service to the capital the problems here are arguably the most acute of those in any afghan region much of kandahar and the three surrounding provinces are in thrall to an insurgency , thought to be the work of the taliban almost no development aid is reaching the province s rural areas , fueling widespread discontent with the government and creating fertile ground for the rebels with only a scattering of trained policemen in the whole region , and most of the force unpaid for 18 months , the governor has almost no means with which to turn things around they send him no support and what will he do \? said talatbek masadykov , chief of the united nations mission in kandahar he s an educated , professional guy but they have to support him , with resources , militarily and by organizing police training compounding the governor s difficulties , the 40yearold turbines at the main dam above kandahar have broken down and are considered beyond repair the whole region was without electricity for two months until american assistance rushed in temporary generators then , just weeks into mr pashtun s tenure , 41 taliban prisoners , arrested over months of operations , tunneled their way out of kandahar s main prison , with the evident connivance of the prison authorities kabul must pay attention to the region , said ahmed wali karzai , the president s brother and his representative in the south the central government is trying to do everything countrywide my point is make priorities the security problem is here americanled coalition forces are still fighting suspected pockets of the taliban and al qaeda in the mountainous border regions of the country and also carry out occasional vehicle checks in the city of kandahar members of the afghan militias that are known as mujahedeen fight alongside them but there are virtually no police officers patrolling the roads , or keeping the peace in the districts and villages in a recent interview , governor pashtun noted that the existing police officers were so poorly trained that they do not even know how to wear a uniform kandahar s deputy police chief , gen muhammad salim , confirmed that these officers had received only a food allowance , but no salary , for 18 months residents of kandahar complain that the police rob or take bribes to make a living prison guards are believed to have taken bribes to allow the taliban prisoners to dig a tunnel from their cell under the foundations 30 yards to the outer wall they dumped the earth in a side room over a period of several weeks , officials at the prison said united nations officials say the taliban are handing out large sums of money , paying recruits 200 for each operation more if they kill a foreigner and 17 for every day spent on operations in afghanistan , far more than the police are paid aware that the united states is already training local police forces in iraq , mr pashtun said , the americans are learning from their experience in afghanistan and are applying the lessons in iraq mr pashtun has already brought a new businesslike tone to the governor s office government officials , armed with rolls of planning papers and documents , shuttle in and out of his office for rapid meetings gone are the turbaned elders and strongmen who used to fill the rooms and courtyards , waiting for handouts from the previous governor , gul agha shirzai his pockets were deep , one local official said of the previous governor the former governor reaped millions of dollars from customs duties at the nearby border with pakistan , but mr pashtun is sending the customs duties to kabul , united nations officials say that move should improve relations with the central government , but it will upset tribal leaders used to handouts for their communities , and it leaves mr pashtun dependent on the notoriously slow and indifferent kabul authorities for budget and reconstruction aid agencies complain that they cannot drive on even the main highways between the provincial capitals for fear of attacks by gunmen , since aid workers and government officials have been the targets of the suspected taliban guerrillas the voluntary association for the rehabilitation of afghanistan , an afghan agricultural aid agency , stopped working in helmand province , west of kandahar , after two of its staff members were shot and killed in september in the other provinces the association s workers , all afghans , travel by public transport , without any documents to connect them with their work , said najmuddin mojadedi , the group s director since last year , the number of foreign aid agencies operating in kandahar is down to only 6 or 7 from 24 that operated here last year , and none of them work in the neediest , most remote areas mr pashtun reckons he has six months to turn things around or the situation will deteriorate beyond control at the moment there is a vicious circle , no security and so no development , he said the taliban want that to create more discontent i have to break this vicious circle , bring more security and make a bigger ground for development he wants major assistance to train and equip and pay a police force of 2 , 000 officers within six months to provide enough security for afghan aid agencies to reach remote districts in the region the international aid agencies would wait longer , he said funds have been promised by the united states , and there are plans for a police training center in kandahar but , mr pashtun said , so far i am talking philosophy it needs more action photo members of a southern afghan militia that opposed the taliban have been fighting a growing insurgency in the region around kandahar \( photo by associated

in black and white the life of sammy davis , jr by wil haygood illustrated 516 pp new york alfred a knopf 2695 gonna do great things the life of sammy davis , jr by gary fishgall illustrated 430 pp new york a lisa drew book scribner 26 is it possible for an entertainer who achieved the pinnacles of success wealth , fame , power , a critical and collegial regard verging on awe , at least during the long climb to the top to be remembered primarily as a cultural martyr \? in the case of sammy davis jr , a qualified yes seems reasonable unlike frank sinatra , whose music will ultimately obliterate the man s boorish qualities , davis has virtually disappeared from the cultural landscape while his immense , longlived celebrity clouds the minds of those who endured it to many of us born in the 1940 s and 1950 s , he has become a joke a bejeweled , nehru jacketwearing , womenandstimulantspursuing , fauxhipster caricature who cackled at racially stupid jokes that were designed to show how progressively goodnatured the tellers and their victimbuddy were yet davis had once been renowned as a performer of spectacular gifts who could do everything sadly , everything usually proves to be the most evanescent of talents his early appearances were virtuoso displays of dancing , singing and mimicry that defied indifference he would stop at nothing until he brought the entire audience into his fold there were n't many holdouts in the 1950 s , beyond the kind of bigots who barraged eddie cantor with hate mail because he had mopped davis s brow after presenting him on the colgate comedy hour in 1952 sammy was the dazzling kid \( actually 26 years old \) in a troupe called the will mastin trio featuring sammy davis jr the unbilled partner was sammy davis sr , his father mastin , 72 when he made his national debut , was said to be an uncle , though he was unrelated it was a strange , unforgettable act the two older men , natty and understated , offered precision softshoe with some winging and spins thrown in , before stepping back to give the spotlight to the prodigal manboy whose energy and autonomy made you wonder why the others were there at all davis had performed with them since the age of 4 he never attended school , never knew any other life , never bonded with his mother , who had once appeared in a mastin revue now he was carrying his mentors yet when he died in 1990 , the man who had been so generous , so profligate with his talent was largely derided or ignored where had he gone wrong \? two biographies one florid and contemptuous , the other dry and admiring agree on most of the bad turns while inadvertently making the case that davis cackled for our sins , breaking down more racial conventions than many of the more dignified black luminaries of the era the cost was a legacy in shreds , and the posthumous mockery of writers like wil haygood , whose in black and white is a singularly nasty piece of work jack benny once got a big laugh on radio when he asked bing crosby , who had complained that a country club did n't admit actors , how would you like to be an actor and a jew \? davis got many laughs by describing himself as an actor who was a jew and a negro and oneeyed he might have added two more equally damning handicaps an exploited childhood and a brief interlude with richard nixon the stolen childhood evidently contributed to his unslakable thirst for love and its material proofs the nixon hug unleashed another kind of bigotry a feeling of betrayal on the part of blacks to whom he had long been suspect as a performer for infiltrating white citadels \( from the friars to the bedroom \) , and of rash superiority on the part of white liberals of course , race was always the decisive factor other impediments were second bananas , good for a nightclub joke davis s besetting sin was not extravagance , philandering , imbibing or reckless optimism concerning a president it was trying to live life as though color did not matter he was a na f savant in gonna do great things , gary fishgall notes that the relatively few africanamericans who had become national celebrities at the mid20th century spoke carefully and acted with rectitude , as if they were walking on eggshells , while davis went about his business as if he did n't care about breaking eggs or setting a good example for anyone that was his choice that last sentence is a good example of writing on eggshells , but the point is an interesting one davis is not remembered for being outspoken in the 50 s about race or anything else like louis armstrong , davis was later scorned as an uncle tom , though both men had overturned many color bars one has to conclude that they were assailed not for what they did or did not say , but for who they were , for images that did not comport with changing attitudes in america s ceaseless struggle to be cool this was a constant problem for davis , whose entire show business orientation flirted with traditions that had grown pass and were now considered offensive having spent his childhood on the road and in the backwaters of the negro theatrical circuit , he loved oldtime comedians like pigmeat markham , whose career he recharged , and tim moore , whose indelible characterization of the kingfish was endlessly imitated bad enough that davis s film career disappeared with the waning of the movie musical , but when tapdancing fell afoul of cultural arbiters who recoiled at the memory of all those leapingandmugging teams on ed sullivan , davis had to rethink his greatest gift a dance tradition to which he had added his own spontaneous panache , blending the hatandcane elegance of john bubbles with the jazzy virtuosity of baby laurence

last week was not kind to president bush on his asia trip , japan and china showed little enthusiasm for his economic advice a survey by the pollster john zogby put his job performance rating below 50 percent he threatened to veto his own spending bill on iraq after the republicancontrolled senate voted to make part of the reconstruction package a loan rather than a grant and , while the rate of economic growth continues to increase , the index of leading indicators declined for the first time in six months , reducing the likelihood of significant job growth before the november 2004 election as the election approaches , mr bush will face enormous pressure to alter his policies particularly to retreat from his tax cuts , scale back our commitments in iraq and make foreignpolicy concessions to our allies but changing directions out of political expediency would be a grave mistake and if he needs a model , there is none more apt than the man to whom he is often likened ronald reagan early in his first term , mr reagan faced very similar pressures his economic program was not yet producing the promised results , and his foreign policy in that case , his confrontational approach to the soviet union was criticized by the democrats and the press and opposed by most europeans and their governments almost immediately after the enactment of his economic and tax program in july 1981 , mr reagan was confronted by one of the sharpest recessions since the great depression unemployment reached 84 percent by february 1982 , and well over 10 million people were out of work the nightly news showed unemployment lines and abandoned factories the budget director , david stockman , forecast deficits as far as the eye could see , and others in the white house leaked stories alleging mr reagan s economic ignorance in february 1982 , with public support slipping , mr reagan wrote in his diary i'm convinced of the need to address the people on our budget and the economy the press has done a job on us and the polls show its effect the people are confused about our economic program they 've been told it has failed and it s just started with a midterm election less than a year away , republicans in congress were restive the prevailing economic theory of the time was that deficits would cause high interest rates , prolonging the recession howard baker , the republican leader in the senate , called mr reagan s tax policies a riverboat gamble after meeting with republican congressional leaders on feb 23 , mr reagan wrote in his diary , they are really antsy about the deficit and seem determined that we must retreat on our program taxes and defense spending and he faced a senior staff that did not support him now my team is pushing for a tax increase to help hold down the deficits , he recorded i'm being stubborn i think our tax cuts will produce more revenue by stimulating the economy i intend to wait and see some results eventually , of course , he saw them he shrugged off advice to change his economic and foreign policies by the end of his second term , reaganomics had created 18 million jobs and the soviet union was on its way to collapse in retrospect , ronald reagan s stand on principle seems an easy choice , since he was reelected in 1984 in a landslide but in the dark days of 1982 it took unusual toughmindedness and while it is true that he was reelected in part because americans had begun to see the success of his economic policies , there is also no question that voters liked his attachment to principle in hard times it was as rare then as it is now to find a politician who actually believed in something in many ways , president bush is in better shape than ronald reagan was while his popularity has sagged , it is still much higher than the 35 percent approval rate mr reagan had in january 1983 today s republicans , if not the democrats or the press , understand that deficits are not necessarily harmful , and that tax cuts stimulate the economy his staff is cohesive and behind him , certainly in public and likely also in private and while mr bush has plenty of domestic and foreign critics of the iraq campaign , unlike ronald reagan , he is not being accused of risking world war iii nonetheless , the pressures on a president to change course are extraordinary when times are tough , they come from all sides his friends , his staff , his party and of course the news media but if the reagan example is n't enough to convince mr bush to remain unwavering , he should also think about another of his predecessors , president george h w bush commentators repeatedly note that mr bush wants to avoid the fate of his father but they tend to see the elder mr bush s failure as an inability to persuade the american people that he understood the country s economic plight this , however , misreads history george h w bush was turned out of office because he violated the one memorable campaign pledge he had made to his party and the american people no new taxes and thus became , in republican eyes , the antithesis of ronald reagan if george w bush is a traditional politician , he will bend to the harsh political winds if he is truly like mr reagan , he 'll continue to do what his own instincts have so far been telling him stay the course
bethesda , md , sept 24 a food and drug administration panel today recommended approval of a new alzheimer s treatment , which , if formally accepted , would be the first drug available for patients with more severe forms of the disease the drug , memantine , which would be sold under the brand name namenda , has been sold in germany since 1980 and was approved by the european union for moderate to severe alzheimer s in 2002 many desperate americans have been importing memantine by mail and ordering it over the internet the fda generally follows the recommendations of its advisers , and an executive for the drug s maker , forest laboratories , based in new york , said the company expected an agency decision in october none of the four drugs already on the market are approved for treatment of alzheimer s in its more severe forms all work by stimulating acetylcholine levels in the brain namenda blocks glutamate , a brain messenger chemical thought to damage or destroy nerve cells in two trials in the united states and in a latvian study , patients taking namenda declined slightly less than those taking a placebo the drug was given by itself in one study , and in combination with aricept , known generically as donepezil , in another patients getting the combination declined less than those who received aricept alone some patients even had shortterm improvements , but russell katz , director of the agency s division of neuropharmacologic drugs , warned that the result should not be taken as proof that the drug prevents alzheimer s progression lawrence olanoff , executive vice president of forest research institute , said that if the agency approved the drug , the company expected to have it on drugstore shelves early next year he said he could not comment on namenda s cost the advisory committee voted unanimously in favor of approval but said it was concerned about animal data suggesting that the drug itself might damage nerve cells and they noted that the therapy s effects were fairly minimal
washington , march 17 after months of debating questions about the future of iraq , many washingtonians are now absorbed with questions about their own future what day will a war start , and how late will i be stuck at work \? when will it be politically safe for the democrats to criticize the president \? how long until anyone in town pays attention to anything besides the war \? will terrorists strike nearby \? while opponents of a war took to the streets here and around the world , much of official washington concentrated less on morality than on logistics some parents canceled spring break vacations officials of the white house and the defense department met with capitol hill staff members to plan classified briefings for congressional leaders during a war lobbyists scaled back their work for clients not in the business of building weapons or rebuilding countries the threat of terrorism in response to a war has inspired morbid humor and dutiful drills at a weekend dinner party in georgetown , the hostess wrote each guest s name on a gas mask and used it as a place card at the state department cafeteria last thursday , visitors were frightened when an alarm sounded and a voice ordered everyone to remain inside to avoid poison gas headed toward the building , but employees explained that it was a drill at the capitol , people recalled the hijacked plane that did not hit them and the anthrax spores that did people are not paranoid but they understand this is , if not a battle zone , a dangerous place to work , said senator richard g lugar , republican of indiana and the chairman of the foreign relations committee there could be problems terrorists are out there the public s anxiety was heightened this afternoon after a man drove a tractor into a shallow pond near the washington monument as emergency vehicles rushed to surround the tractor and helicopters circled overhead , the police closed nearby streets , paralyzing rushhour traffic the man s motives were unclear , but the authorities said they were taking precautions in case there were explosives in the tractor , which was emblazoned with signs supporting military veterans with war in iraq seemingly a foregone conclusion , politicians stopped arguing for those of us who have believed that unilateral use of force is not in the national interest , it s of course a sobering moment , said representative robert menendez of new jersey , chairman of the house democratic caucus however , once the president deploys those forces , we will lock arms in support of the men and women of the armed forces and the mission they 've been called on to perform by the commander in chief others , though , were in no mood to unite we feel we have to protest more than ever , said medea benjamin , speaking by cellphone from a different kind of cell after she and several dozen other women were arrested today after crossing a police line at the capitol we have a sense of desperation , a sense of despair frank luntz , a republican pollster who has been conducting focus groups in washington , said he had discerned growing anger about a war supporters of the war are regretful opponents of the war are downright angry , mr luntz said this is different from previous military confrontations , because for the first time we are afraid that we may be hit ourselves washingtonians neither planning nor covering a war are wondering how they can get the attention of politicians and the news media when officials from around the country gathered this afternoon at the national press club for a news conference devoted to making housing and community development a national priority , the audience seemed to consist mainly , if not entirely , of their own aides and colleagues after several officials , including mayor thomas m menino of boston , spoke about the urgent priority of housing , the floor was opened to questions , but there were none , and the news conference ended we recognize that at this particular time , domestic issues are drowned out , said the organizer of the news conference , saul ramirez , the executive director of the national association of housing and redevelopment officials jack valenti , the president of the motion picture association of america , had advice for his fellow lobbyists you can call a press conference , but nobody s going to be listening mr valenti , who worked in the white house during the vietnam war , said that even hollywood would have a hard time competing i'm going to be presenting at the academy awards show on sunday , but i have a feeling that people will be surfing to all those channels carrying pictures of the war if hollywood cannot compete , washington authors who are not writing on war have little hope of getting attention christopher buckley , who learned that lesson after publishing a novel on the same day in 1991 that mr bush s father started the ground war against iraq , said he was bracing for another round of nonpublicity for washington schlepped here , a guidebook being published this week at this point , i may vote democratic in 2004 , mr buckley said this time it may be a double whammy on the one hand , it might be a good time to be publishing a guidebook to washington , dc , since people may decide not to visit paris and come here instead on the other hand , a lot of people might avoid our nation s capital altogether , given the chance of its becoming radioactive or chemically toxic photos a man who drove a tractor into a pond near the washington monument yesterday drew a heavy

washington president bush spends hours each day of his texas vacation with his trusty chain saw , happily cutting up the cedar trees that he is determined to clear one of these decades from his 1 , 600acre ranch clearly , putting in time with the saw is recreation for mr bush , a sweatthroughthetshirt kind of guy activity that clears his head and helps him relax because when it came to clearing the north lawn of the white house last week of a big linden tree felled by hurricane isabel , mr bush left the chainsawing to the national park service and stayed on higher ground at camp david the linden , it turned out , was the main casualty visited upon the white house by the storm , which like all acts of nature was democratic in its force washingtonians spent the weekend clearing downed trees and branches , and so too did the staff of the white house , which at the end of the day is still a home i thought we were lucky we only lost one tree , said dale haney , the white house horticulturist , who stepped over the branches in his own suburban virginia yard to reach the north lawn by 6 30 am friday , when he surveyed the damage that had worried him all night what mr haney saw relieved him , but the scene was still surprising the normally pristine north lawn was strewn with the huge branches of the centuryold linden tree , which had split in half the tree stood not far from the large circular fountain off pennsylvania avenue mr haney , who has been tending the 18 1 2 acres of white house grounds for three decades , said the linden had been supported by cables , and was properly trimmed and healthy but the wind nonetheless brought it down the first time , as far as he knew , that a hurricane had toppled a white house tree to mr haney s further relief , the linden was not one of the 48 trees planted by presidents on the white house grounds , like the two andrew jackson southern magnolias on the west side of the south portico or the four saucer magnolias planted by john f kennedy in the rose garden \( the current bushes have planted a cutleaf maple on the south lawn \) the white house began preparing for the storm at midweek , when workers took down flags and awnings and cleared drains , like everyone else in town by wednesday afternoon , the president and mrs bush were on marine one to camp david for the weekend a day earlier than planned , to beat the storm , while two of the planes that serve as air force one , a 747 and a 757 , were flown to robins air force base in georgia for safekeeping by thursday , with the white house rapidly emptying , maintenance workers moved in for lastminute hurricane preparations the whole staff was in , so it did n't take long , mr haney said plumbers , electricians , everybody pitched in pots of petunias and coleus from the white house s five patios were taken in , as were the potted myrtle trees large hanging baskets of begonias were nestled into flower beds , and outdoor furniture was stashed in the west garden room at the end of the rose garden colonnade at camp david , mr bush held a news conference on thursday morning with king abdullah of jordan again , a day earlier than planned i know this was supposed to take place at a different time , the president told reporters , but we wanted to get this over with so that you did n't have to float down the hill , if you know what i mean hurricane isabel also allowed mr bush a natural cutoff to all the unpleasant questions about the middle east and iraq all right , get going before it starts raining , the president told reporters , ending the news conference after 16 minutes at the white house on thursday evening , with the chief occupants slumbering at camp david , the hurricane watch was left to the usual security people as well as two park service employees who spent the night on cots in a maintenance shed in a far corner of the south lawn , nervously checking every crash and bump in the dark the pair armed themselves with chain saws the white house has two and remained alert for branches and trees falling on the drives near the white house they were in and out all night long , mr haney said i do n't know know if they got much sleep by friday morning at camp david , king abdullah and his wife , queen rania , were preparing to return to jordan , but there was no news from the white house on how the president had whiled away the stormy night in the catoctin mountains with the king a few trees did fall at camp david , said a white house spokeswoman , claire buchan , but none of them posed any danger to the president back in washington , where the storm left millions in the city and surrounding states without power \( the lights stayed on at the white house , to no one s surprise \) vice president dick cheney spent part of his morning surveying the downed branches on the grounds of the naval observatory , where he lives or , at least , a man who looked remarkably like mr cheney , with a black labrador retriever and what appeared to be grandchildren in tow , could be seen walking near the observatory s outer fence if you happened to be cruising down massachusetts avenue around 11 am no word on whether the vice president took up a chain saw photo after hurricane isabel the task of clearing the white house lawn was handled by national park service workers like ron edmonds only one tree , a

kaktovik , alaska you 've heard about the atkins diet , the south beach diet , the dean ornish diet , the zone well , based on my research here in the arctic , let me present to you the one approach that is guaranteed to help you lose 10 pounds a week or your money back ! note to apply for a refund , you must send a notarized receipt showing that you purchased this day s newspaper in kaktovik , as well as before and after swimsuit photos of yourself , suitable for publication i'm talking about the eskimo diet , the traditional one even the portliest new yorkers will slim rapidly if they eat nothing but whale blubber , caribou meat and anything else that they personally harpoon or hunt down i had this brainstorm for a new best seller to cash in on the diet craze the day the inupiat eskimos here in kaktovik brought in their first whale of the season each year they have the right to harpoon three whales for their own subsistence diet , and the town was giddy with celebration the school closed , the shops closed , and even the us post office took a break so the whole population of 270 could assemble on the beach under a gently falling snow to hug and cheer as the victorious whalers brought in the supply of winter meat and blubber \( for an audio slide show of the event , see nytimescom kristof \) the elders spoke the inupiat language , while the kids were more hip one girl stared at the 43footlong bowhead whale and shouted , hey , man , that s heavy ! two bulldozers hauled the whale onto the beach \( after breaking the twoinchthick rope , twice \) children danced on top of the whale , and then the adults began carving it up , with one man dispatched to shoot his rifle periodically to ward off the polar bears that were circling the beach hungrily the first muktuk , or bits of skin and blubber , were rushed into a pot , then passed around to all it s good with ketchup or a1 steak sauce , one man explained , offering those condiments as well the local people had handfuls of the muktuk i tried it and found it pretty awful that s a major reason the eskimo diet will trim those waistlines that scene unfolded because , for all its save the whales piety in international forums , the united states has strongly and quite properly backed the right of american indians and eskimos to kill whales the way they traditionally have natives in places like kaktovik depend on the whale meat , and harpooning whales is an essential part of their culture it s true that the us government lists the bowhead whale as endangered , but the population appears to have recovered to a still modest 10 , 000 the tiny numbers taken by the natives keep their way of life intact without threatening the species still , i ca n't help detecting a whiff of american hypocrisy here if we insist on the right of native americans to kill whales listed as endangered , then how can we so vociferously oppose the hunting of much more populous species of whales by norwegians , icelanders and japanese , who also have whale hunting as part of their traditional cultures \? some whale species , like the blue , are truly endangered and should never be hunted but there are hundreds of thousands of minke whales , perhaps as many as a million , and they do n't seem in any jeopardy so the ban on hunting minke whales can no longer be easily justified on the basis of saving the species it is now possible both to save the whales and to kill them the remaining argument against whaling is an ethical one whales are highly developed mammals , and it is immoral to prey upon them that s a fine reason to spurn whale sushi oneself , but a lousy reason to prevent the japanese from partaking otherwise , hindus could try to prohibit our burger addiction granted , there are lots more norwegians and japanese than inupiat eskimos , the japanese scientific whaling effort is more about sushi than science , and none of us want to put whale populations in danger one solution would be to keep the moratorium on largescale commercial whaling in the open ocean , but to let any traditional whaling people \( including the japanese and norwegians \) harvest sustainable numbers of whales within 200 miles of shore sure , whales are magnificent but so are dogs , which end up on dinner plates in asia by insisting on the rights of our own natives to pursue the eskimo diet while denying similar rights to other whaling nations , i'm afraid we in the us are n't taking the moral high ground we 're just being hypocritical
red sox fans need n't overreact think of this sevengame series as a presidential election your candidate just won the new hampshire primary , but the race is far from over continuing their fourscoreandfiveyear quest to win a world series , the red sox got off to a terrific start last night , beating the dreaded yankees , 52 , in the first game of the american league championship series on the strength of three homers and tim wakefield s knuckleballs , the sox announced their formidable presence in the delta shuttle acela train fung wah bus series david ortiz , the dominican carl yastrzemski , broke a scoreless tie with a monstrous tworun shot into the upper deck off mike mussina in the fourth , and todd walker and manny ramirez added solo shots in the fifth as boston bolted to a 40 lead meanwhile , wakefield was in the nospin zone , frustrating the yankees with an array of pitches that floated like butterflies and stung like bees boston s slugging was nothing new to those who followed the sox this year , nor was it a surprise to the yankees the sox went 910 against the yankees in 2003 , but they roughed up the yankees' pitchers for nine or more runs six times the sox and the yanks , american league rivals for 100 years , will be at it again tonight in the bronx before the series splashes down at fenway park on saturday in a superhyped matchup of aces pedro mart nez versus roger clemens the patriotic pregame ceremony did not go as smoothly as planned none of the players flipped off the crowd and sox reliever mike timlin made sure byung hyun kim kept his hands in his pockets the american bald eagle , swooping in from center field toward the mound , missed his mark for the first time in memory as the anthem ended and two jets performed a flyover , the eagle looked disoriented and almost came down on the heads of derek jeter and alfonso soriano reggie jackson threw out the ceremonial first pitch and mussina threw out the next one at 8 18 pm the red sox leadoff hitter , center fielder johnny damon , who sustained a concussion in a frightening collision with his teammate damian jackson in game 5 against oakland , was on the bench but not in the lineup damon has been ruled out until at least saturday the red sox' owner , john w henry , wearing his version of a cowboy hat , sat in the owner s box next to the chief executive , larry lucchino against his instincts , lucchino has been giving thoughtful , measured responses to all questions regarding a yankees franchise that he characterized as the evil empire earlier this year we knew the road to the world series would go through new york , lucchino acknowledged the yankees' principal owner , george steinbrenner , who ripped lucchino for the evil empire remark , kept an eye on the boston brass from his luxury box king george was surrounded by the likes of billy crystal , robin williams , donald trump and henry kissinger most sox hitters came into the game with abysmal career numbers against mussina , but he was not at his best he was wild in the second inning and had to pitch out of a jam after walking two batters , he went to a 30 count on catcher doug mirabelli before getting him to ground out to the mound on a 32 pitch mussina threw 39 pitches in the first two innings wakefield , the senior member of the sox squad in continuous service , had a pretty good knuckleball going jorge posada and hideki matsui cracked singles in the second , but they were the yankees' only base runners in the first six innings ramirez opened the fourth with a scratch single that grazed off mussina s glove ortiz was next and he worked the count to 32 , fouling off several pitches , then launched a shot into the third deck to give the red sox a 20 lead ortiz was 0 for 20 in his career against mussina before hitting his first postseason homer the blast was greeted with cheers by a significant portion of the sellout crowd , indicating a rare infiltration by red sox nation into the yankees' ballpark the sox are becoming a team that plays 162 home games , but new york represents the final beachhead for the traveling sox fandom the first controversy of the series \( it wo n't be the last \) came in the top of the fifth when walker led with a high fly ball that appeared bound for the rightfield foul pole a fan , sitting in foul territory , reached over and appeared to stop the ball from hitting the pole the rightfield umpire , angel hernandez , signaled that the ball was foul , but he was overruled by the crew chief , tim mcclelland , at home it was walker s fourth home run in the six postseason games with two outs , ramirez muscled a shot over the fence in right and did his usual jog down the firstbase line wakefield , who starred with the pirates in the 1992 nlcs , took a twohitter and a 40 lead into the seventh those who were around in '99 when these two teams met in the alcs know that the red sox were never really in that series they dropped the first two games in new york and lost in five this year is already different the yanks might actually be a little scared this time photo the eagle challenger paying a call on jason giambi ,

greenwich township , nj new jersey , far more densely populated than any other state more crowded than japan or india , for that matter is on course for another distinction it will be the first state , landuse experts say , to exhaust its supply of land available for development the prospect of running out of open space to build on , a phenomenon that planners call buildout , is at the heart of gov james e mcgreevey s wellpublicized campaign against sprawl in poll after poll , voters in this most suburban of states say they hate what they see , and elected officials on all levels have taken note roughly two million of new jersey s five million acres are developed , and a little over one million are protected by various levels of government the state has promised to acquire or preserve enough land , including farmland , to bring the number of protected acres to two million by 2009 some of the rest is unsuitable for development , leaving less than a million acres to be fought over since those estimates were made a few years ago , some of those acres have surely been developed the pace of suburban development is a powerful issue in many other states after a 10year onslaught of building , but the political and economic tensions are especially raw here , where more people are scrambling over less open space builders accuse the governor of thwarting the american dream , environmentalists say builders will kill agriculture , and many towns try to avoid the costs of growth , like developing infrastructure and building schools , by zoning out housing that would bring in children the pattern in new jersey is the very definition of sprawl land consumption is increasing faster than the population is growing as in other parts of the country , land is consumed three to four times faster than the population grows we 're taking bigger bites with each wave of development , said barbara lawrence , the director of new jersey future , a landuse planning organization some project that buildout will occur within 20 years , while new jersey s population of 84 million is expected to grow by 1 million in that period , but other estimates are that buildout could take many more decades the timing depends on population and employment growth , which can swerve wildly with the economy government could hasten buildout by putting more land off limits to development through environmental controls the debate now under way will determine whether the population will continue to spread across the landscape or become more concentrated in the cities and older suburbs it will determine , in short , what a builtout state looks like new jersey officials do not know how much land has been consumed since the last statewide land surveys , taken in the mid1990 s estimates range from 16 , 000 acres to more than 40 , 000 acres a year mr mcgreevey says the state is losing 50 acres a day to development , a figure that other state officials describe as conservative but the rate of consumption may have increased in the late 1990 s , many landuse experts say , in a pattern entrenched across the nation american appetites for space have put eversmaller families onto everlarger lots in the '50 s and '60 s , a quarter of an acre was a lot , and half an acre was huge , said james w hughes , the dean of the edward j bloustein school of planning and public policy at rutgers now it s one acre , three acres , five acres that change , mr hughes said , portends selfperpetuating congestion each new resident , for example , adds 12 vehicles when you move into a mcmansion you need three cars to fill your threecar garage , mr hughes said , and a big suv for the two snow days per year each new resident spurs more commercial development , too since 1980 , mr hughes notes , retail space per capita has doubled and office space per capita has increased sixfold in northwestern new jersey , greenwich township , bordering the delaware river in the southern lobe of warren county , was transformed by the completion of interstate 78 and the office parks that came with it across the state from newark to look at the landscape here say , from the road between the new home depot and the new lowe s is to see how new jersey could quickly run out of real estate splaying east and west on former farm fields are about 800 of the new houses that brought the population of greenwich township to 4 , 365 in 2000 from 1 , 899 in 1990 , a 130 percent increase a few miles north , off route 57 , big lumber skeletons are rising at the grande at scotts mountain , a subdivision where the lots average 34 acres this is supposed to be a scenic highway , but it s all for sale , said mike king , the chairman of a civic group that is promoting development in the sagging town of phillipsburg , near greenwich township , and is fighting it in the outlying townships mr mcgreevey inherited a program that spends about 200 million a year to buy open space and preserve farmland , which he rolled into a bigger smart growth campaign to steer development to population centers , mostly by making it difficult elsewhere he issued an edict last month to restrict building near 15 reservoirs , rivers and streams , halting several projects just days from construction , and state officials are working on what they call the big map , delineating areas where they will impose restrictions on growth as for the governor , mr king said , he s thinking all those right things , but it s later than he seems to realize

the giant food retailer royal ahold said yesterday that its headquarters near amsterdam were raided over the weekend by dutch investigators seeking evidence in a criminal inquiry into the way the company has accounted for sales at partly owned foreign units the company has been embroiled in an accounting scandal for months , centered mainly on its american food distribution subsidiary , us foodservice ahold has said it has found a total of 11 billion in accounting irregularities , and it has replaced its chief executive , chief financial officer and other executives the criminal inquiry by dutch prosecutors is focused on another aspect of the original accounting scandal , involving the way ahold consolidated results from joint ventures in scandinavia , brazil , guatemala and argentina in the parent company s books ahold said that some 30 investigators descended on its headquarters in zandaam , just northwest of amsterdam , on saturday the company said it was cooperating fully with the investigation prosecutors also searched offices of ahold s accountants , deloitte touche , over the weekend deloitte confirmed yesterday that three branch offices in eindhoven , rotterdam and amsterdam were raided auditors in those three offices had worked on ahold s books deloitte said it had been told by prosecutors that it was not a target of the investigation but that some of its employees might be called as witnesses if the inquiry results in criminal charges anthony jagroop , a spokesman for the dutch public prosecutor s office , said that the investigation was expected to continue for at least several months none of the companies nor any of their executives have been charged with any wrongdoing ahold s stock initially fell more than 3 percent on news of the raids , but it recovered by the end of trading in amsterdam to close off 13 percent at 760 euros analysts said that the investigation was not a surprise but that it was still troublesome for ahold s new management and for investors it means extra management time and extra legal costs , said oscar poos of oyens van eeghen , an amsterdam brokerage house people close to the investigation said that prosecutors were particularly interested in documents known as side letters , confidential addenda to commercial contracts that are widely used in business for a variety of reasons , including keeping sensitive details from competitors in ahold s case , prosecutors are interested in side letters related to its foreign joint ventures , some of them majorityowned and some minorityowned , and the way the ventures' sales were counted by the parent ahold said earlier this year that it did not tell deloitte touche of the existence of some of the side letters was there deliberate intent in that , or was it na ve \? one person close to the investigation said that is what the prosecutor has to determine the question is , why withhold them \? ahold said yesterday that it turned over all the side letters to prosecutors in april in the past , ahold sometimes counted all of the joint ventures' sales as its own experts said that was an acceptable practice as long as its profit figures were adjusted to reflect the company s part ownership of the ventures but prosecutors suspect that ahold s accounting practices were meant to inflate some executives' bonuses , which were tied to sales mr jagroop of the public prosecutor s office said one possible charge , falsification of documents , carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a fine of 45 , 000 euros \( 51 , 000 \) a charge of fraud would carry stiffer penalties prosecutors would not say yesterday whether the targets of their investigation were the company , specific current or former executives , or both besides the dutch criminal inquiry , ahold is currently the subject of investigations by the united states justice department and the securities and exchange commission those investigations are reported to be centered mainly on possible fraud at the us foodservice subsidiary , which is based in columbia , md
laura de seroux s job has grown beyond that of horse trainer she has become the overseer of a living treasure , the manager of an athlete so talented that her limitations have not been discovered it is a task de seroux takes seriously , but she understands that there are different ways of viewing her responsibilities and different ideas about the best way to proceed should she protect , coddle and preserve azeri , the 5yearold mare who is the reigning horse of the year , staying on a schedule that could guarantee that the horse s record will never be tarnished \? or should she test a champion s greatness and accept the most ambitious challenge available a race against males \? everyone has an opinion de seroux s is the one that counts she s not a big amazon , she said there s a fragility to azeri , and i'm just not going to risk her mental health or her physical soundness so , i'm not very inclined to run her against males , to tell you the truth i think it s been proven in history that sometimes they 'll never come back the same if you do it that does not mean azeri will never test her skills against males de seroux and azeri s owner , michael paulson , have not closed the door on the subject , and they have listed the whitney handicap at saratoga on aug 2 as one her potential races personally , i know she could beat the boys , paulson said i see the way she trains we have n't seen the best of azeri yet she has a phenomenal engine the competitive side of me is curious and people are always asking us what we will do because she has been so dominant within her division still , de seroux is not inclined to try azeri against males at saratoga or anywhere else i am not a daredevil and i am not a risktaker , the 51yearold de seroux said i have learned that being conservative is very important in this business she learned that lesson while working as an exercise rider for charlie whittingham , the trainer whose patient style won him hundreds of major races de seroux has been training on her own since 1999 in 2001 , azeri , a budding star , joined her barn and de seroux has handled her cautiously since whittingham , who died in 1999 , would have been proud i got this horse , i unwrapped the box and there she was , de seroux said i treasure that and i treasure her she is so amazing that was evident to everyone last year as azeri shook off her lone career defeat , a secondplace finish in the la canada stakes on feb 9 , 2002 , at santa anita , and reeled off a sevenrace winning streak that included a victory in the breeders' cup distaff azeri was named horse of the year , in large part because none of the male contenders for that title were able to win on breeders' cup day she was only the sixth filly or mare to achieve that honor one other , moccasin , earned it without defeating males azeri s selection was not without controversy some thought she did not deserve the title because she did not prove herself against the best competition and because she raced outside california , her home base , just twice that added to the pressure for azeri to face males this year , but de seroux has not changed her tactics with nothing to prove in her own division , azeri has made three starts this year all against fillies or mares and she has three victories de seroux said she would like to stick to last year s schedule the clement hirsch at del mar , the lady s secret at santa anita and the breeders' cup distaff , also at santa anita the three races are restricted to fillies and mares should azeri win those races , she would have 13 straight victories , putting her within reach of the modernday record , held by , among others , cigar that could mean she would return next year as a 6yearold to aim for no 14 and beyond cigar was owned by paulson s father , the late allen paulson , who bred azeri as for running against males , de seroux is not getting any serious arguments from michael paulson male horses are typically bigger and stronger animals , he said azeri is at the top of her division , and what she has accomplished is pretty remarkable it s not that we 're against running against males , but we do n't feel any sense of urgency to do it her dominance is something to respect and to enjoy that depends upon your point of view not everyone enjoys seeing azeri , as the oddson favorite , pummeling the same horses race after race for now , though , that may be as good as it gets photo laura de seroux with azeri , the reigning horse of the year de seroux must decide whether azeri will race against males this year \( associated press \)
mcloud , okla becky pemberton , a nurse , is serving a 35year sentence at the mabel bassett women s prison here for grabbing money out of cash registers in stores in oklahoma city while she was addicted to heroin she did not have a weapon but the way ms pemberton figures it , she was lucky in her sentence the prosecutor originally offered her a plea agreement of 100 years ms pemberton , 48 , is representative of a nationwide trend that state officials , law enforcement authorities and criminologists are struggling to understand a rapid growth in the number of women being arrested , convicted and sent to prison nowhere has there been more attention focused on that trend than in oklahoma , where the incarceration rate for women is more than double the national average the legislature set up a task force this year to learn why nationally , from 1993 through 2002 , while overall crime was falling , the number of women arrested rose 141 percent , according to the fbi s uniform crime report in the same period , the number of men arrested fell 59 percent some individual crimes show even more striking disparities while the number of men arrested on charges of aggravated assault fell 123 percent in the decade , the number of women arrested on the same charge rose 249 percent drug arrests rose 345 percent for men in this period , 50 percent for women and the number of women arrested on embezzlement charges increased 805 percent , actually surpassing the number of men arrested on the same charges , the only crime for which that is true similarly , from 1990 through 2002 , the number of women in state and federal prisons jumped 121 percent , to 97 , 491 from 44 , 065 , said allen j beck , the chief prison demographer for the bureau of justice statistics by comparison , the number of men in state and federal prisons rose 84 percent in that period , to 1 , 343 , 164 from 729 , 840 in part , experts agree , the phenomenon is a statistical quirk because the number of women in prison has been so much smaller than the number of men , any increase translates into a larger percentage gain but some experts say the numbers also mean that something else is going on for one thing , said freda adler , a professor of criminal justice at rutgers university , with women taking on the social roles of men , they have the same opportunities to commit crime , especially property crimes like embezzlement and as time passes , ms adler said , women are committing more serious crimes and have longer criminal records , like male criminals this means they are more likely to be sent to prison and given longer sentences if they are arrested the police , prosecutors and judges ca n't just look aside anymore and say they are women , said ms adler , whose book sisters in crime , published in 1975 , was widely attacked by other scholars as antifeminist even today , some other experts disagree with her angela browne , a psychologist and assistant director of the injury control research center at the harvard school of public health , said there was no evidence that women had become more violent in fact , she said , the number of murders committed by women has fallen since 1980 the reason for the big increase in the number of women arrested on charges of aggravated assault , ms browne said , is that with the push to curb domestic violence , the police are now often required by law to arrest the woman as well as the man when there is a report of a fight between partners as a society , we are responding to behaviors differently than we did 10 or 15 years ago , she said it s an ironic result of an effort to protect women what is driving the increase in the number of women in prison , both in oklahoma and nationally , is the growing number of convictions for drug and property offenses nationally , in 2000 , 40 percent of court convictions leading to prison for women were for drug crimes and 34 percent were for property crimes , mr beck of the bureau of justice statistics said only 18 percent were for violent crimes and 7 percent for crimes known as public order offenses , including drunken driving , liquor law violations , disorderly conduct and vagrancy why the number of women arrested for drug violations has climbed so sharply is not well understood , said beth richie , a professor of criminal justice and africanamerican studies at the university of illinois at chicago but , ms richie said , there is strong evidence that more women going to prison are addicted to drugs than male inmates , and some drugs , including crack and methamphetamine , may have a more powerful affect on women women have also had much greater increases than men for all public order offenses over the decade , said richard rosenfeld , a professor of criminology at the university of missouri at st louis these are types of behavior where people are hanging out on the street , and they do suggest some changes in women s behavior , mr rosenfeld said nowhere has there been more attention focused on the growing number of women in prison than in oklahoma , where the legislature set up a task force this

east rutherford , nj , may 7 the defenders had cleared out to other spots kenyon martin went to challenge a layup by boston s eric williams , leaving the celtics' antoine walker alone to grab the rebound and score on an easy putback walker soared to the rim , and as has been the case every time the nets and the celtics have met this season , it all went wrong the ball slipped through walker s hands , one more mistake , one more frustrating moment walker is one of the cornerstones of the celticsnets rivalry , but he is nothing but frustrated as the clock ticked down in the final minutes tonight , another chance to win squandered , walker headed to the far end of the court and grimaced , wondering what had gone wrong when the buzzer sounded , he was the first player off the floor , choosing not to spend a minute more than necessary on the continental arena court walker endured another trying night , shooting 3 for 15 , turning the ball over 5 times and scoring 7 points in 45 minutes , only the third time this season he had been held to single digits the celtics , who struggle without topflight performances from walker and paul pierce , lost , 10495 , falling behind by two games to none in the fourofsevengame eastern conference semifinals to be honest , my guys did everything they could do tonight , walker said i did n't step up we 're getting great production from everybody and i'm coming up short i ca n't understand it i'm getting good looks tonight , i got great looks around the basket and they just did n't fall for me there is nobody to blame but myself paul is carrying this load he s playing like a superstar and i 've just got to come along with him pierce , who scored 34 points in game 1 , contributed 32 points , 11 assists and 10 rebounds tonight but walker came up empty again , missing his last nine shots of the game , including seven in the second half in game 1 , walker shot 6 for 20 and fouled out in the final minute , taking one of the team s most dangerous weapons off the floor in the regular season , he shot only 284 percent against the nets while walker has fought to find his game , the celtics have struggled , too , dropping three of four games in the regular season to the nets and eight of nine dating from last year s eastern conference finals , when the nets overcame a 21 deficit walker s numbers have been disastrous 5 for 19 , 5 for 18 , 3 for 15 and 6 for 16 in the regular season that is a stark difference from his overall production walker shot 388 percent from the floor and averaged 201 points over all this season it s just tough times , walker said i try to pride myself on being a good playoff player and i'm coming up short for the first time in my career it s only my second playoff appearance and the first series that i'm having trouble in i 've just got to bounce out of it it s not over with asked if he could sense walker s frustration , martin said it s not my concern if he s not feeling well , then do n't play i just try to make it tough on him that s all i'm doing that s what i'm continuing to do for the rest of the series the celtics mounted a furious comeback in the fourth quarter tonight , closing an 8266 deficit to 8582 when williams drove for a layup with six minutes remaining but after richard jefferson hit a jumper for the nets their first field goal of the fourth quarter after eight misses walker tried to change his luck he spun into the lane , tossing up a finger roll that bounded off the rim the nets raced upcourt , and kerry kittles hit a 3pointer the lead was back to 8 and the celtics were slinking to a timeout it was right there , walker said it was tough richard jefferson hits that jump shot to put them up 5 and then we go down and i miss that shot in the lane , they hit a 3 and that busts our bubble there photo kenyon martin of the nets reaching in against the celtics' antoine walker , who shot 3 for 15 last night \( barton silverman the new york times \)
iran made a series of important promises yesterday about its nuclear activities if it carries them out fully and promptly , they could go a long way toward easing international concerns yet iran has been less than candid about its nuclear activities in the past and appears to have used the cover of a civilian nuclear power program to develop weaponsbuilding capacity therefore , it bears the burden of convincing the world that it has no intention of producing nuclear weapons , now or in the future in yesterday s joint statement with the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , iran declared it would voluntarily refrain from uranium enrichment a process that , depending on how it is done , can produce fuel for civilian power reactors or nuclear weapons iran also pledged to sign and ratify an international agreement allowing surprise inspections of its nuclear plants and it declared itself willing to resolve all unanswered questions about its past nuclear activities to the satisfaction of the international atomic energy agency with this statement , tehran has responded to the main requirements of an oct 31 deadline imposed by the international community that is welcome yet iran needs to go further uranium imports should be suspended along with uranium enrichment centrifuges that can be used for enriching uranium should be dismantled , and no new ones imported or built it should also be kept in mind that iran s elected government does not always speak for all of the country s power centers its religious leadership must also see to it that the latest pledges are fully honored in letter and spirit it is troubling that a cleric involved in the negotiations yesterday emphasized that the suspension of uranium enrichment might not be permanent and that none of iran s latest promises were final until ratified by parliament russia also needs to put constructive pressure on tehran by delaying the completion of the nuclear power reactor that moscow is building for iran at bushehr the reactor should not become operational until tehran agrees that all enrichment of its uranium fuel will be done outside iranian territory in plants under full international safeguards iran must also agree that the plutonium produced by the reactor s operation will be sent abroad such agreements protecting the enriched uranium and plutonium associated with nuclear power generation from diversion to weapons should be an essential condition of all future reactor sales to nonnuclear weapons states , not just to iran the problem posed by iran is particularly urgent because it is now widely assumed that iranian scientists have already learned how to convert natural uranium into bomb fuel that leaves only one sure way for iran to persuade others to trust its repeated promises not to build nuclear weapons it must not only suspend uranium enrichment , but also dismantle , with international verification , all of its enrichment plants
naperville , ill valerie sefton loved jewelry , sometimes wearing a ring on every finger so when she died last september at the age of 27 after a fouryear battle with hodgkin s disease , her family decided to have her remains turned into diamonds , which they now wear themselves she loved jewelry and she loved rings , said william sefton , her father , in his office in this chicago suburb , where he runs a marketingservices company he wore a halfcarat diamond on his finger there may be people who think it s a weird thing to do , he said , but everyone who knows valerie thinks it s a wonderful tribute mr sefton , 52 , came upon the idea when lifegem memorials , a fledgling company based in another suburb , elk grove village , announced last summer that it planned to make diamonds from the cremated remains of people and pets he was the first customer since then , lifegem says , it has received thousands of calls from around the world and is considering opening satellite offices in europe and japan all we knew was that for those choosing cremation , there had to be a better memorial available than an urn full of ashes on the mantle , said gregory herro , 34 , a founder of the company and a former owner of a computer consulting firm he said the idea had come from a conversation among his friends and family about their own mortality we were all in favor of cremation , and here was our train of thought none of us wanted to be forgotten , he said we wanted something that would last forever diamonds last forever diamonds are made of carbon carbon is the building block of life why do n't we take the carbon of life and make it into a diamond \? the process begins with removing and purifying the carbon portion of the remains and turning it into graphite the graphite is placed in a vice that exerts 16 million pounds of pressure per square inch , the equivalent of a 3footwide column of concrete 2 , 000 miles high resting atop it the graphite is then heated to 3 , 500 degrees , turning it into diamonds mr herro said that the process took about four months , and that customers might have to wait six months for the diamonds because of a backlog of orders the diamonds , which are of good quality but not flawless , range in price from 2 , 300 for a quartercarat to 15 , 000 for one carat the cost grows as the size of the diamond increases , mr herro said , because larger diamonds require more heat and compression time in manufacturing customers can order up to 100 diamonds last may , mr sefton said , several months before an unsuccessful stemcell transplant rendered his daughter unable to communicate , she wrote a letter saying she wanted to be cremated and have her remains placed in small pouches and given to family and friends to spread where they wished i do not want to sit in a mantle somewhere to be a morbid reminder that i'm gone , she wrote her father said that he had been unable to discuss lifegem with his daughter because of her deteriorated condition , but that he thought it was in the spirit of what she had requested after the carbon was extracted from her remains , the remaining ashes were returned to her family mr sefton said he spread a portion of those ashes off the coast of maui while on vacation while we were there , we saw a bunch of surfers and sea turtles , and we sort of laughed about it , he said we said , 'ok , the very first place we put her , she s got turtles and surfer boys she would appreciate that' mr sefton said that spreading the ashes was far more difficult than the romanticized movie version of this parting moment , but that every time he gazed at the ring , i find myself smiling william allen lucas , whose 73yearold mother , marianne scott lucas of charlotte , nc , died on jan 11 , said he hoped to receive diamonds made from her remains in august mr lucas said his mother had told her family that she wanted to be cremated , but that the family could do whatever it wished with her remains after that the lucas family said it would have one of the lifegem diamonds made into a pendant that could hang in a window to reflect light like a prism i do n't think this is morbid or gruesome , mr lucas said it s like a photo what s the difference \? photo a diamond , now in the wedding band of william sefton , was made from his daughter s cremated remains \( jeff topping for the new york times \)
blagoveshchensk , russia , may 15 here on the siberian border with china , russia s first and only suspected case of severe acute respiratory syndrome lies in medical isolation demanding food and a good book , presumably unaware of the utter confusion trailing in his wake despite two weeks of testing , nobody is yet seeing whether 25yearold denis soinikov , a russian municipal worker who lives in a riverfront hotel frequented by chinese , actually has sars or , as it called here , atypical pneumonia nor is it clear when they will the diagnosis is sars with a question mark , gennadi onishchenko , the nation s chief public health physician , told russia s parliament in moscow on tuesday , more or less repeating what he and others have said for nearly two weeks but as moscow fiddles with its diagnosis , russia s far east is burning with activity , both serious and made for television , to combat an epidemic that may or may not be serious in itself and a regional economy which increasingly has come to rely on chinese trade and labor is starting to grind slower , with the area s substantial asian population living under a long shadow of rumor and suspicion it s all exaggerated , said one chinese merchant who would be identified only by his russian nickname , alyosha i think this guy they show on television here does n't have atypical pneumonia at all but i still see panic in the city while most russians here seem to be taking the suspected case in stride , local druggists have sold out of the masks recommended by officials to prevent the spread of the virus and some people said in interviews here that they worry about becoming part of an epidemic what ails mr soinikov is indeed a puzzler when he entered the hospital in early may , the clinical picture of his disease was exactly as it was described by the chinese , aleksei v tarasov , the chief doctor of the infectious disease hospital here , said in an interview moreover , mr soinikov had shared a hotel floor with roughly 50 chinese workers , some of whom traveled regularly over the amur river to do business in china doctors administered five tests for the sars virus and sent samples to moscow for analyses two came back positive yet in a weeklong quarantine of the hotel , none of the other residents developed sars symptoms including mr soinikov s girlfriend , nor anyone else in blagoveshchensk \( pronounced blagoveshensk \) a city of about 170 , 000 that is the capital of russia s amur region indeed , no one else anywhere in russia is reported to have the disease government officials are nevertheless treating the matter as if the nation was in the grip of a fullblown epidemic traffic in people and goods across the border has shriveled since may 3 , when mr soinikov s case came to notice , and airlines and trains have curbed most scheduled service to and from china some 3 , 500 miles to the west , moscow has begun disinfecting all public transportation and handing out leaflets on sars prevention locally , doctors and officials have been careful to stress that they are fighting a disease , not a race no chinese has come here since may 3 , and there are no other cases since then which could be assumed to be sars this is why it would be wrong to take measures against chinese people , vladimir smirnov , the amur region s chief public health doctor , said in an interview but that does not explain the scene in the blagoveshchensk main outdoor market , a bazaar where hundreds of stalls are split more or less equally between russian and chinese traders prodded by the local militia , chinese wear cotton masks or scarves those who do not are hauled away to the police station for citations or fines close by , virtually none of russian workers wear masks the local government took reporters this week on a supposedly secret raid on another chinese market to uncover false documents and medical violations among traders two maskwearing women pored over the papers of a handful of maskclad merchants at their deserted stalls , but found nothing serious we 've got about half of our usual customers , said long xian min , a 33yearold seller of electronics and video games from the chinese city of harbin nothing is coming in from china the flow of goods was cut around may 4 the sealing of the border has affected everything from blagoveshchensk s chinese restaurants to russianowned hotels and casinos that have seen a oncesteady flow of chinese tourists dwindle the federal government , some people here say , has been unusually tightlipped about the one case of sars identified so far and while mr onishchenko said this week that he believes there could be other cases of sars in russia , doctors here say his office has yet to share with them details of the tests conducted so far on mr soinikov if a case of sars is revealed , of course there is a need for caution but if the case is not confirmed , then why all these measures \?

in the eight months before the police found bruce jackson looking for food in his neighbor s garbage , three different state workers had visited his adoptive parents' home a total of 10 times yet none reported that there was a lock on the refrigerator , or that bruce , 19 , and three other adopted boys , ages 9 to 14 and all under 50 pounds , were so malnourished that their bellies bulged and their teeth and gums had turned black the discovery , coming after a year of searing criticism , administrative reforms and intense news coverage of the new jersey division of youth and family services , left agency and state officials demoralized and baffled as to how this one could have been missed nine workers who were responsible for investigating the household , either directly or as supervisors , will be terminated , agency officials said yesterday but critics of the system said it was incomprehensible that the state s child welfare system could have failed so completely , so soon they said the case cast doubt on reform that had already taken place the most shocking thing is that you are not talking about a child revealing abuse , but a child who was evidence of abuse , said cecilia zalkind , executive director of the association for the children of new jersey how is it that no one commented on the condition \? where were the schools \? where was the health system \? adoptive parents who want to be foster parents have to get medicals on everyone in the family why did n't this happen \? and the inexcusable part is there was a caseworker involved did she just assume they were not her responsibility \? at a news conference yesterday , defeated and angry family services officials had to admit their staff had missed warning signs almost entirely at the collingswood , nj , home of the adoptive parents , raymond and vanessa jackson with the exception of one allegation that the family was hitting bruce in 1992 a claim investigators deemed unfounded reports on the home from caseworkers over the years were also almost universally glowing as of this year , the jacksons had adopted all four boys as well as two girls , so the state had closed those files and would have had no reason to monitor those children , except for the fact that the jacksons were attempting to adopt a seventh child , a 10yearold girl as recently as last june , as part of a statewide safety assessment of all foster homes , the primary caseworker wrote that the foster parents show a lot of love and affection to all the children and it is a very supportive environment it was only this weekend , when familyservices officials were interviewing bruce in the hospital , that they learned that he had been frequently punished by being told to sit for hours in front of a tv that was not on he said that he had not been to school or a doctor or even a restaurant since being adopted in 1996 as a result of the findings in the jackson case , the agency said it was putting new policies in place for monitoring children who have been adopted , including mandating that they be seen by a doctor once a year the family services agency will also engage an outside group to review the results of at least half of the statewide safety assessments , which were just completed last week out of 14 , 300 foster children visited , the state only removed 31 the apparent lapses by the jackson family s main caseworker , who has not been named by the state agency or the prosecutor , are particularly puzzling to many officials charged with following the case of the 10yearold foster girl that the jacksons wanted to adopt , she was not directly responsible for the boys but she was in and out of the house on white horse pike eight times since february more than anyone else in a few dispatches , the caseworker did note that the boys were underweight for the june report , she also wrote , bruce suffers from depression and never fully developed physically and mentally but she did not see this as a problem , ascribing it to the parents' explanation that the boys had eating disorders to outsiders , the idea that four children all had eating disorders so severe that their growth was stunted at preschool levels seems so unlikely as to be laughable , but apparently the jacksons convinced numerous state workers from top to bottom , employees at the public agency believed the mother s claim that these children had eating disorders , said kevin ryan , the state s independent child advocate , who is currently reviewing a tangled web of multiagency interactions with the family going back more than a decade what we are looking at now is why no followup was done to verify this claim or get medical attention since these children were obviously starving photos the jackson family s home in collingswood , nj a neighbor of the jackson family , michael byrd , saw the adopted boys looking through the trash for food now , many are wondering how the boys' malnutrition failed to raise warning flags with the state \( photographs by dith pran the new york times \)
east hampton , ny , july 17 at two mile hollow beach , the longtime center of gay life in the hamptons , the language of the parking lot pickup scene is very specific on any given summer weekend evening , there may be dozens of men parked alone in the lot here when a driver arrives wanting to participate , he typically flashes his brake lights and parks then he may flip on his interior light and see who pulls up next to him otherwise , two cars may pass each other like jousting knights and , if they like what they see , pull into adjacent parking spots to meet immediate sex is usually the goal , and the men either have it in their cars or wander onto the beach or the dunes participants say they see the same faces cruising the lot every week , but one friday evening last month , four new men appeared in unmarked cars and wandered onto the beach they were undercover police officers and they soon saw two men having oral sex they arrested the men for public lewdness and three others for public urination since then , the east hampton village police department has run additional friday night undercover operations and increased uniformed patrols looking for sex offenders the crackdown has since escalated into a public controversy , with officials and some residents saying the operation is a response to clearly inappropriate and unlawful public behavior and many gays saying it has become a form of harassment it s like a bomb dropped here , said clifton nordmeier , 48 , one of the two men arrested last month on a public sex charge it s a real step back for us people do n't feel comfortable down there anymore but town officials and many residents say the actions are not antigay , but rather an appropriate attempt to curb illegal public sex acts this is not about being gay , said the east hampton village administrator , larry cantwell we have always recognized the gay community as an important part of east hampton the issue arose after the police received complaints from residents of further lane , a picturesque road lined with oceanfront mansions behind tall hedgerows and whose residents include jerry seinfeld , the art dealer larry gagosian and the washington lobbyist liz robbins there have been no additional arrests , but the police presence alone has riled many regular users of the beach and caused an uproar in the east end s gay community so has the action of some local residents trying to crack down on gay sexual activity here by hiring uniformed security guards to patrol the beach and parking lot and to videotape people engaged in sex acts mr nordmeier , a postal clerk from east hampton , said he was handcuffed on the beach that night , june 13 , and marched into the parking lot in front of many onlookers he was taken to the station house and charged with public lewdness and his name was listed in news stories i literally felt crucified , he said it was so public i felt like i had been strung up in the parking lot he was released later that night on bail and told by a judge recently that the infraction would be dismissed if he committed no other violations for six months tom kirdahy , a cochairman of the east end gay organization , said that most gay beachgoers agreed with and obeyed the public sex laws , but saw the recent resident and police action as crackdowns to stop us from meeting one another we want assurances this is not about homophobia , he said in early june , a group called the further lane association began complaining to the village police about public sex and urination by beachgoers the residents hired a private security firm to patrol the beachfront property , videotape beachgoers having sex and urinating and give the tapes to the east hampton village police department , said the police chief , gerard larsen jr none of the resident group s members have been identified publicly , but gay leaders and village officials say that their movement is spearheaded by the wall street investor ron baron , who last year bought a 23 million beachfront property , apparently unaware of the beach s history as a gay trysting place mr baron s gray , atriumstyle house is separated from the beach by about 400 yards of vegetation for weeks , uniformed guards have been stationed at the end of his property watching over men in skimpy bathing suits after the situation made newspaper headlines \( an east hampton star editorial called the arrests antigay and a witch hunt , and the east hampton independent ran the frontpage headline home sweet homophobia \? \) , the further lane association hired a publicist , who said the group would discontinue using security guards on the beach the publicist , cathy callegari , said that mr baron s was one of 10 households that make up the association she said that mr baron was far from homophobic and in fact had gone to great lengths to care for an employee with aids who died in 1992 this is not a gay issue , she said it s a legal issue mr baron did not respond to phone messages left at his office , but an assistant there sent an email message outlining the further lane association s recommendations for the beach , which include closing the parking lot at night and strictly enforcing public sex and nude sunbathing laws , with the intent to make our neighborhood safe and enjoyable for individual homeowners , their families and guests as well as residents and visitors to east hampton chief larsen insisted that the police enforcement was directed at illegal behavior , not at sexual preference it s a not a gay thing , he said it s enforcing the law if there are no crimes , then no one s getting arrested nobody s pleading not guilty they 're saying , 'this has been going on for 50 years why ca n't it continue \?

hayward , calif , sept 14 mike gorski thought he was done with active military duty when he left the marines for civilian life more than a decade ago and signed on with the national guard a few years later a banker with a new wife , kim , and a new house here , mr gorski , 33 , knew that he would have to spend one weekend a month in training and two weeks a year on active duty there was always the possibility of being called up for perhaps one sixmonth deployment but since the 9 11 attacks , mr gorski , a staff sergeant with the 870th military police company of the california national guard , has spent 16 months away from home , first at an army base in tacoma , wash , and most recently in the southern iraqi city of karbala he is likely to spend eight more months in iraq , and he has decided to leave the national guard as soon as he can it s just like being on active duty , he said in a telephone interview from karbala , where 125 members of his company are stationed and there s a reason you get out of active duty at the same time , you want to stay because of patriotism , so you join the national guard or the reserves all the guys are prepared for one deployment , especially in the wake of sept 11 but we 've basically returned to active duty , and that s not what we 're in for it s too much to ask it is attitudes like mr gorski s that have military officials deeply worried about an exodus from the statebased national guards and the reserves of the nation s armed forces since 9 11 , hundreds of thousands of citizen soldiers have been mobilized at a level thought to be the highest since world war ii those concerns grew last week when the army announced that about 20 , 000 reservists and national guard troops stationed in iraq and kuwait would likely have to serve a full year from the time they landed in those countries , extending their tours by several months it s different from desert storm , said maj gen paul d monroe jr , the adjutant general , or commander , of the california national guard , which has some 1 , 500 troops in iraq nobody was gone a year everyone went together and came home together now they have to think if they stay in , how many more times will they be mobilized \? that s paramount on their minds , and that s never been paramount on their minds general monroe , who was in iraq over the weekend to see his troops there for the first time and spoke by telephone , added , when i became adjutant general , i thought my biggest problem was going to be an earthquake nobody envisioned this but even as military officials fear problems with retaining reservists and national guard troops , recruiting has not suffered and has even increased in some parts of the country , officials say word of the extension comes as a new reality takes hold for the citizen soldiers and their families in the past two years , more than 212 , 000 reservists and national guard troops have been mobilized for war overseas and the fight against terrorism at home the president can mobilize reservists for up to two years in a fiveyear period without congressional approval , but long deployments were unusual until 9 11 , when reservists and national guard troops were called up to guard airports , army bases and forts , bridges , transportation systems or be sent overseas of the more than 290 american soldiers who have died in iraq as of today , 26 of them were members of the national guard , officials said , although none from the 870th have died it was unclear how many of the casualties were from army , air force , navy or marine reserves for the 870th , which has headquarters in pittsburg , calif , about 30 miles east of here , the extension would mean that instead of coming home in midnovember , they would stay through may 2004 most of them , who are now training iraqi police , guarding the local police station and performing other security tasks , had thought their tours would last about six months among the soldiers of the 870th are teachers , bankers , mortgage brokers , telecommunications experts , police officers and copy machine repairmen there is a father who has not seen his first child , one who has not seen his second and a grandfather who is raising his grandson mr gorski and his wife have it relatively easy they have no children , only two dogs , chesty and bosco they have been able to count on mr gorski s full income because his company , which he did not want to publicly identify , has paid his salary during his deployment in washington and in iraq that has helped them keep up the mortgage payments and allowed mrs gorski , who is pursuing a career in real estate , to devote most of her time to leading a support group for families of the 870th but for those with children , mounting bills and a reduced income , the hardships have become almost unbearable , several spouses and members of the 870th said in interviews two other members of the 870th besides mr gorski said they would leave the guard as soon as possible kathy martin is working fulltime as a mortgage broker and taking care of five children four of her own and one of her husband s while her husband , joe , a sergeant in the hayward police department , is serving in iraq with the 870th mrs martin said she feared that her husband , who was stationed at fort lewis for 10 months , would miss opportunities for promotion because of his absence mrs martin s first husband was an active duty sergeant in the army but she said being married to a reservist she married mr martin in march , 13 days before he was deployed was more difficult after mr martin served his 10 months at fort lewis , she said , we assumed we were finished , we assumed we had done our onetimeinamillion deployment for the national guard
two months after disclosing that its chairman was owed nearly 200 million , the new york stock exchange said yesterday that its other top executives were due 133 million in retirement payments the disclosures underscore how the exchange has paid all its senior executives , including a regulator and a parttime adviser , on a scale equivalent to some of wall street s top bankers as a quasipublic entity though , the exchange reported a profit of 28 million last year , a small figure compared with the numbers reported by the securities firms that it regulates john s reed , the interim chairman of the exchange , was quick to affix responsibility to the board and to richard a grasso , his predecessor as chairman who resigned because of a pay dispute these numbers are 'as they are , ' mr reed wrote in a letter to stock exchange members yesterday for our management team , the recommendations for compensation were made by mr grasso to the compensation committee of the board , approved by it and then by the full board the largest retirement packages were 22 million each to robert g britz and catherine r kinney , copresidents of the exchange and close associates of mr grasso they have worked there for nearly 30 years ms kinney and mr britz also received 36 million each in 2002 , and slightly more than 4 million in 2001 , according to documents released by the exchange perhaps more surprising were the compensation packages of edward a kwalwasser , the exchange s top regulator , and william r johnston , an adviser to the chairman and a former president of the exchange mr kwalwasser received salary and bonus of 17 million in 2001 and 15 million in 2002 , amounts that dwarf government regulators and exceed the compensation of his peers at other selfregulatory organizations mr johnston made 58 million in salary and bonus in 2001 as president , and earned 1 million as a parttime adviser in 2002 the numbers struck many stock exchange members as high , given that none of the payments were in stock or in any other way at risk dissatisfaction among floor traders contributed greatly to mr grasso s exit , but many floor traders talked about the latest disclosures as a final snapshot of the way the exchange had operated under him the numbers are alarming , said james rutledge , a stock exchange member but some members remain disappointed that they did n't break the numbers down further there are also questions about how a regulator like mr kwalwasser gets 1 million a search committee set up by the board is working rapidly to find a permanent chairman , and the new executive , expected to be named within months , may choose his own management team along with new leadership will come a new board and a fresh slate of directors , presumably creating a new , more accountable culture the pay levels are expected to be substantially lower in the future you have to go back to the board , said charles m elson , director of the weinberg center for corporate governance at the university of delaware the new ceo will develop his own team and salary structure all this just becomes a vestige of the old regime mr reed had tried to prepare the exchange membership for the latest numbers , so the disclosure that some of mr grasso s closest advisers were paid very well had been expected in his letter to exchange members , mr reed made it clear that such benefit packages would be a thing of the past we will clearly modify some features of our plans as well as their administration , he wrote unlike mr grasso , who took a payment of 1395 million with the intent to stay on as chairman , his deputies will receive their packages only when they retire other pay packages disclosed yesterday included those of richard p bernard , the exchange s general counsel , and richard a edgar , an executive vice president , who each made 11 million last year critics of the exchange were quick to point to mr kwalwasser s compensation as a ripe example of how the exchange s inherent conflicts had overcome its ability to genuinely fulfill its dual function as a regulator and a marketplace in addition to total pay packages of more than a million dollars annually for the last three years , mr kwalwasser will receive a lumpsum payment of 77 million when he retires william h donaldson , the chairman of the securities and exchange commission and the nation s top regulator , is paid 142 , 500 yearly mr kwalwasser s supporters say that a more appropriate comparison would be to mary schapiro , the chief regulator at nasd and vice chairwoman she is the regulator for the nasdaq stock market and was paid 1 million last year a former sec official , mr kwalwasser joined the exchange in 1984 and in 1990 became responsible for regulation and enforcement former stock exchange officials said that mr kwalwasser was not a member of mr grasso s inner circle , as were mr britz , ms kinney and mr johnston that mr kwalwasser s compensation was at least formally approved by the wall street chief executives whose firms he is bound to regulate remains a point of contention for exchange critics a regulator cannot work in the best interests of the public because his salary is being determined by those that he is regulating , said jack ehnes , the chief executive of the california state teachers retirement system , the nation s thirdlargest pension fund mr johnston , who has known mr grasso for more than 20 years , was president of the exchange from 1996 to 2002 like mr grasso s pay , mr johnston s compensation increased steadily during the boom years of the 1990 s bull market , peaking in 1999 at 7 million , which included 36 million in other compensation like savingsplan payments and accrued vacation the

at first , they are merely pleasing to the eye gracefully descending a spiral staircase to the stark clanging of bells , glamorous in full hair , snug skirts and heavy eyeliner , the women of nine appear to be but a beautiful blur of black and white swirling around antonio banderas , the only grown man in the production but as the revival of the maury yestonarthur kopit musical unfurls at the eugene o'neill theater , the nine principal women of nine begin to emerge as willful , complex , sympathetic individuals mary stuart masterson , for instance , is luisa , the loving but hardened wife of guido contini , the film director and incurable casanova played by mr banderas jane krakowski is carla , guido s oozingly sensual mistress chita rivera is liliane la fleur , guido s demanding , charismatic producer and laura benanti is claudia , guido s elegant movie star muse these and the show s five other leading women are stars in their own right or have star potential but nine is not a sure star vehicle while most of the actresses are often onstage , only periodically do their characters become prominent with a solo song or line the rest of the time they are singing as a chorus , carrying candles , moving chairs , supporting one another david leveaux , the show s british director , said giving the women of nine this dual responsibility as both ensemble members and leading ladies was deliberate we went out to find principal women and asked them to become an ensemble of principals , mr leveaux said while the actresses work collaboratively , the director said he encouraged each to make a strong contribution just because they occasionally recede into the background does n't mean they become indistinguishable or disappear it s one thing to create an ensemble based on everybody s suppressing their personalities , he said or you can create an ensemble based on everybody s ability to express themselves because the show s female parts are not conventional leading roles , the actresses' decision to be part of the show was not an obvious one some were concerned at first that , on paper at least , it looked as if they would have little to do in the end , every one of them said she felt lucky to be in the production , which has been nominated for eight tony awards , including best revival three of the women have been nominated for a tony award for best featured actress in a musical ms rivera , ms krakowski and ms masterson gathered recently before a show in the penthouse of the time hotel , near the theater on west 49th street around a circular table coincidentally yet fittingly similar to the one at the center of the nine set the women featured in the musical suggested that their sense of sisterhood was as satisfying as their moments in the sun at 8 o'clock we 're the last people out there , and we all need each other , ms krakowski said the ensemble of us all together is what makes the show work 'too small for who \? ' appreciating the importance of the show s ensemble nature was not immediate , ms benanti said , in part because americans are conditioned to think selfishly about fame in the states we choose to do things because they bring us to prominence , she said in london , for instance , you go back and forth from being a spear carrier to being hamlet what you learn is the value of the piece and i think it really minimizes ego ms benanti , who has received tony nominations for her performances as cinderella in last season s broadway revival of into the woods and in the 1999 broadway musical swing ! , said she turned down this production of nine five times after reading the script and realizing that claudia had only one major scene and song i literally counted my lines and went , 'no , ' ms benanti said her agent , too , kept saying the part was too small i finally just went , 'too small for who \? ' ms benanti said not too small for me too small for julia roberts \? yes and then they said chita rivera , and i was like , sure' the den mother several of the actresses said the prospect of working with a stage legend like ms rivera was a major factor in their decision to join the company that just made me so happy , said deidre goodwin , the show s lady of the spa , who recently played velma in the broadway revival of chicago , a role ms rivera originated opposite gwen verdon in 1975 sitting around the table talking , it was clear that ms rivera is the den mother of the group , the chairwoman emeritus , the beloved broadway veteran to whom her younger colleagues are eager apprentices the other women let ms rivera speak first , laughed heartily at her wry humor , emphatically nodded assent to her words of experience saundra santiago , who plays a cynical film critic , said the saddest thing to me now is just that my father is not alive to see me working with chita rivera ms rivera had her own initial doubts about doing nine , namely not wanting to do a revival it was the involvement of mr banderas that intrigued her enough to sign on i suddenly got this picture , ms rivera said antonio , he s going on an adventure it s like not wanting to miss a good party
jazz these days is the sum total of various cells , operating mostly independently this is why the overriding concern of wynton marsalis and jazz at lincoln center to bring the music together into a larger and more powerful entity is not just a practical consolidation of assets but an impressive form of idealism the institution has worked to teach its audience the music s history and to pull dancing back to jazz , at least to those areas that will accommodate it and with the first jazz jamboree , an event on friday night at avery fisher hall intended to be repeated in future seasons , the idea was to pick among the top bands in current jazz no matter how far apart the styles for a triple bill , and combine the principle performers for jamming the event featured mr marsalis s septet , with joe lovano as guest soloist dave holland s quintet and michael brecker s quartet it began with mr holland s group , which has become sophisticated beyond recognition since the mid1990 s here is one of the pinnacles of smallgroup arranging , though not in a fussy way the arranging is almost antifussy , given the perseverance of its ostinatos and its funky cycling grooves but as he did in juggler s parade , played on friday , mr holland incorporates short bridge sections stuffed with chords , only to return to the singlechord groove those grooves are subtle , and they keep changing for much of the set with mr holland on bass , steve nelson on vibraphone and billy kilson on drums none of the musicians articulated the beat , yet it was there , implied with absolute clarity and the group got plenty of mileage out of simple alterations improvised counterpoint is probably the best kind , and what these players could do , repeatedly , in various combinations including robin eubanks on trombone and chris potter on saxophones and clarinet was among the most impressive i have heard in years the set was capped by happy jamming , a piece for octet \( mr marsalis , mr lovano and mr brecker took part \) written for the occasion by mr holland when the horn players took their turns soloing , mr potter , on soprano saxophone , demolished the competition with dense , energetic blowing over the full range of the horn remember , this band is a selfcontained world , and mr potter has been in it for five years , learning the twists and turns the first half of mr brecker s set was a lull , only because it seemed so rigid mr brecker on tenor saxophone and adam rogers on guitar played long , hardnosed strings of short notes but then mr brecker played a solo interpretation of thelonious monk s monk s mood , a piece full of dense harmony , and a challenge for a monophonic instrument but he used the echo of the hall to create harmony , and paced himself well finally mr marsalis came on to play a tune grounded in driving quarternote swing in their backtoback solos , mr brecker roared through a jagged language of harmonic substitutions , while mr marsalis sounded chary and less comfortable mr marsalis closed with his septet , which played a handful of his own pieces brilliantly , including the noirish , simmering majesty of the blues he saved his best playing for the simplest piece of the night , an improvised blues he laid back , and then his playing surged in hard glissandos he took his time to develop a narrative mr lovano emerged , playing mr marsalis s ballad for trio , guy lafitte , and he improvised so dreamily that it was hard to tell when improvisation gave way to theme finally mr brecker reappeared for jig s jig , set over a new orleans parade beat he improvised in his titanic , modernharmony style and then in basic blues tonality something was ventured , something was gained new york s summer jazz festivals should have more nights like this
on a recent morning , the crimson buds of a neighbor s red maple tapped against my window as i watched dave avrin dump his fishing waders on the snowy ground like a body in a mafia hit for almost 20 years , we have celebrated each early spring by fishing through sudden snow squalls , hailstorms and even a few sunny days we have cleared inchlong icicles from our rods and dunked our reels in the river to free them of ice we have occasionally caught trout this year , we were off to fish the connetquot river on long island , and after our snowy winter , the weather seemed just a little too perfect for early spring i could picture the woodcock peening in the evening fields and forsythia and whitlow grass flowering my guess was that the fishing gods were smiling on us after countless laughs at our expense the connetquot river is nothing short of a miracle as limpid as a pond through most of its seven and a half miles , it seeps into the great south bay with barely a ripple standing in its waters , the suburbia of long island is magically filtered out by acres of wild red maple swamp and tussocks of sedge that protect mysterious bubbling springs at least as magical as the river is its transformation from private property to public parkland it was once owned exclusively by the southside sportsmen s club , but the land is now open to fishing as a part of a state park and preserve a hint of this exclusivity lingers in the highly regimented system by which fishing here is regulated an angler purchases the right to fish a defined stretch of stream for a numbered set of hours , called a beat this practice has been used for hundreds of years along british rivers to manage valuable stocks of salmon and trout , but for most anglers , this style of fishing takes some getting used to for one thing , it requires waiting in line and a certain amount of polite conversation for someone who stubbornly clings to the notion that flyfishing is a simple sport , talk of parabolic rod design or the best bonefish guides in cozumel can take the edge off nonetheless , i thank new york state just for the chance to fish here the stream might not have been protected at all , and with 280 , 000 visitors the beat system protects these edenlike waters from being loved to death dave and i arrived so late this year that we got the last two beats with only two hours of fishing time left , the meter was running as we raced past deer and turkey feeding calmly in the open fields of the old estate , animals so accustomed to these streamside fishing relays that none even looked up finally at creekside , anglers on neighboring beats cast rhythmically i struggled with a large chartreuse streamer fly , breaking leader tippet after leader tippet with clumsy knots , until , reduced to muttering under my breath , i managed to tie one properly as luck would have it , the fish were inclined to feed , and in just a few casts i tightened on a brook trout of about 12 inches just downstream , dave was dealing with a fish that seemed considerably larger in fact for the next 30 minutes several brook trout impaled themselves on the bright green fly , and then , as if to tell me they had gotten wise to my tomfoolery , stopped biting sifting through my fly box , i fished out a proven killer a size 12 hare s ear nymph the hare s ear is actually tied from the hair of a hare , but at threeeighths of an inch long resembles nothing so much as a dust bunny lashed with gold i cast upstream , letting the fly swing in the lazy current i watched each drift carefully , following the progress of the fly by watching the line a suspicious twitch seemed just odd enough to test , and as i lifted my rod a very dark rainbow trout of almost 16 inches leapt from the water , reentering like a knife blade the fish bore downstream and jumped again and again , growing increasingly sloppy as it tired noting the commotion , two hikers gathered on a nearby footbridge to watch , rooting first for me , and then for the fish as i gently returned her to the water dave had been watching too , and had taken a few trout himself before realizing that the beat had ended we each took a few last casts and reeled in our lines deer and turkey were still feeding as we headed back to the car for a long moment we watched them graze in the low winter sun with no leaks in our waders , and a few trout caught and released , we could afford to relax , and with a nod toward suburbia we headed to town for a beer and burger
yongkang , china in his 17 days of molding tool boxes , wang chenghua learned to work like a metronome he slipped strips of metal under a mechanical hammer with his right hand , then swept molded parts into a pile with his left he did this once a second for a 10hour shift , minus a halfhour lunch just before lunch on the 18th day , he lost the beat the hammer , backed by 4 , 000 pounds of pressure , ripped through the middle and ring fingers of his right hand , reducing them to pulp mr wang , 26 , now spends his days in the orthopedic ward of the yongkang first people s hospital , where wall posters advertise reattachment surgery for molders , millers , pressers and lathe operators who , unlike mr wang , salvaged their digits and limbs the work is so boring it is almost impossible to keep your mind on it , mr wang recalled one recent afternoon while resting on a dirty cot in his crowded hospital room but if you let your mind wander for just a second , it s over yongkang , in prosperous zhejiang province just south of shanghai , is the hardware capital of china its 7 , 000 metalworking factories all privately owned make hinges , hubcaps , pots and pans , power drills , security doors , tool boxes , thermoses , electric razors , headphones , plugs , fans and just about anything else with metallic innards people all over the world use yongkangmade parts they are the nuts and bolts of hundreds of brand name products , like bosch , black decker , and hitachi yongkang , which means eternal health in chinese , is also the dismemberment capital of china at least once a day someone like mr wang is rushed to one of the dozen clinics that specialize in treating hand , arm and finger injuries , according to local government statistics unofficial estimates run as high as 2 , 500 such accidents here each year lawyers , journalists and doctors say hundreds or thousands of injured workers are left out of the official count either because the boss does not have insurance , or because workers were not hired legally , or because city officials are under pressure to show that they have safety under control the reality , all over china , is that workplace casualties have become endemic nationally , 140 , 000 people died in workrelated accidents last year up from about 109 , 000 in 2000 , according to the state administration of work safety hundreds of thousands more were injured safety officials call this alarming but the steps the government has taken to address the issue occasional propaganda campaigns and isolated crackdowns on irresponsible bosses have done little to solve fundamental problems in china s emerging capitalist culture , where high rates of injury and death are tolerated as the price of economic progress in what has become the world s factory for laborintensive products over the last decade of surging economic growth , an endless supply of transient workers line up for jobs offering about 50 cents an hour , about onetwentieth of the average american manufacturing wage millions of eager chinese entrepreneurs help fill the shelves of walmart and target with sneakers and dvd players that get better and cheaper year after year last year china surpassed japan as asia s biggest exporter to the united states , and it replaced the united states as the largest exporter to japan but safety has suffered in this relentless drive , not least in yongkang some factories resemble operations at the dawn of the industrial age , where migrant laborers use rudimentary machines that can sever the limbs of those who succumb to momentary distractions workers usually have only elementary school educations and get no training they do not have the right to organize unions or , in some cases , even discuss workplace hazards xu xing metals seems typical its 50 workers press metal into strips for thermal cups , working in a dimly lit shed where bars cover broken windows the floor rumbles with the pulse of six metal presses workers have to shout over the roar to be heard li jiahao , a 38yearold master craftsman at xu xing , said he had long worried about safety , especially since his boss discovered he could save money by using wastewater instead of fresh water for the machines' cooling systems wastewater clogged the machines' pipes , requiring constant cleaning , mr li said i told him somebody was going to get his arm caught unclogging the filter , mr li said he said i had no right to speak mr li was scooping grime out of a cooling pipe one day in midmarch when the machine s rollers clipped his shirt , dragging his arm into the metal press , elbow first when coworkers wrenched him free , he could see his hand popping out of his shirt but felt nothing the arm was hanging by a few tendons it had to be amputated recuperating at the first people s hospital , where he is teaching himself to write and use chopsticks lefthanded , mr li said his boss at xu xing , hu xu , had paid for his medical care but refused to discuss compensation the boss claims this was operator error , not a safety problem , mr li said mr hu declined to discuss the case in a telephone interview pressed to explain what happened to mr li , he said , why do n't you ask him \? and hung up
the soul of the expatriate is a complicated thing , for though it may long for its native country with an overwhelming passion , it will often revel in its own independent spirit the very quality that helped it travel far from home after all , such a soul has followed its body over borders , perhaps over oceans , and has turned its back , in ways both large and small , on its upbringing perhaps that is why there were hardly any french people at a bastille day party on the lower east side yesterday this is no exaggeration an hourlong tour of the party , held outdoors on a closed section of orchard street , revealed that the french were out in such small numbers that one could sing la marseillaise in the middle of the crowd and attract no sympathetic voices there were crepes for sale and oceans of caf au lait to sip , but the paucity of french people was startling , to say the least although at another bastille day celebration , on the upper east side , some people were speaking french at the orchard street party , joe becker , 89 , a retiree , said i do n't think i 've seen any french people at all mr becker was sitting at a table under a white umbrella with his wife , dorothy there were some people speaking a foreign language over there a little earlier , but it was n't french , he said given the current state of francoamerican relations , greatly agitated by the war in iraq , one could theorize that french expatriates in new york had decided that any early celebrations of bastille day which is actually today would take place in the safety of their homes this year the only problem with this theory was there were no french citizens around on whom to test it out nonetheless , feeling savvy , a reporter approached a member of a band , les sans culottes , that was playing on a makeshift stage actually , none of us are french , said dan crane , the bassist , who performs under the pseudonym jeanluc retard we 're known as the city s no 1 fauxfrench rock 'n' roll band still clinging to his theory , the reporter asked mr crane if he believed the french were indeed celebrating their independence quietly i do n't think it s on the down low , he said clearly , you can see by the height of those cancan dancers' kicks that they 're not keeping it low at all impressed by mr crane s insight , the reporter waited until the cancan dancers had finished dancing and approached their leader with a simple question was she from france \? actually , i'm from brooklyn , she said , introducing herself as karen cushman her two dancing partners , she went on , were from indiana and michigan does it count if i have a french heart \? she asked growing desperate , the reporter took to asking random people on the street if they were french all of them said no then there was a glimmer of hope pardon \? said one gentleman parlezvous fran ais \? he was dressed in the elegant style of a frenchman but his accent left something to be desired was he an actual frenchman \? non , he said so he was not french then \? oui , he said the only recourse at this point was to barge directly into the nearest french restaurant and simply inquire if there were any people from france about , which is precisely what happened at the caf charbon on orchard street were there any french , any at all , there \? one woman answered in the affirmative her name was coco guichardan she was 41 and had come to new york from the french alps 15 years ago did she believe that geopolitics had dampened the party \? i think there s so many french people in new york that most of them are probably somewhere else , she said maybe they 're in brooklyn photo a cancan troupe performing at a bastille day party on the lower east side yesterday consisted of one dancer from brooklyn , one from indiana , and one from michigan in fact , almost no one at the party was from france \( frances roberts for the new york times \)
kirkush military training base , iraq , sept 15 the mock attack begins with whistles , because the new iraqi army needs to conserve its blanks within a few minutes , under the watchful eye of private trainers paid by the united states , a platoon of recruits overruns the enemy position like the rest of their battalion , these young men are only weeks from becoming fullfledged soldiers when they are ready , their new army will have 735 men in washington , politicians and military planners say the united states needs to rely much more heavily on iraqi soldiers and police officers , both to restore order and to lighten the load on overworked american troops defense secretary donald h rumsfeld has said that strengthening the iraqi security services is a top priority pentagon planners have optimistically spoken about replacing american soldiers with iraqi troops but on the ground here , the iraqi cavalry appears a long way off until now , the americanled occupying force has made only desultory efforts to train a force to replace saddam hussein s army of 400 , 000 , which disintegrated with mr hussein s defeat whether the americans simply underestimated iraqi resistance or whether the united states wanted iraq to depend on america for security as some iraqis contend the delay has fueled iraqis' distrust of washington s intentions and placed a heavy burden on american troops but continuing violence , american casualties and doubts about the war at home have prompted an abrupt change in strategy the united states hopes to train a force of 20 , 000 iraqis by next september , said maj gen paul d eaton , who is overseeing the creation of the new army that is almost triple the 7 , 000 previously planned an additional 20 , 000 people will be hired for supply duty and other administrative tasks in the new army , though they will not be trained as soldiers i did not anticipate the level of violence that we 're going through right now , said general eaton , the former commander of fort benning , ga , where the army trains its elite ranger units a plainspoken man expert in training troops , he now works out of an office at the occupying forces' headquarters in baghdad he commutes by helicopter to the base here in kirkush , in the desert between baghdad and iraq s border with iran , where the first battalion is being trained the new strategy calls for middleranking officers from the former iraqi army to receive a few months of training early next year the officers will then create two divisions totaling 13 , 000 troops , with only minimal american oversight even if the united states can find enough officers who pass security and other checks to carry out this plan , these troops will not be available until next summer , general eaton said over all , the united states plans to spend 22 billion in the next year training the new army , a figure included in the 87 billion that president bush has requested for military operations and reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan the new units will be lightly trained , to carry out tasks like guard duty and border patrols , rather than raids and weapons sweeps at first , they will carry only assault rifles and some light machine guns in a country where rocketpropelled grenade launchers are sometimes displayed at funerals the new army will be of little use against wellarmed guerrillas , much less as a deterrent to the established armies of iran and turkey , iraq s neighbors to the east and north , said anthony h cordesman of the center for strategic and international studies , a washington policy institute that is likely to remain the case for the next several years , he said one of the great problems here is that they are creating an iraqi army that is seen by most iraqis as not an iraqi army , but as a paramilitary force that looks more like a tool of the occupation than a national defense force , mr cordesman said that opinion is widely shared on the streets of iraq in kufa , a religious center 100 miles south of baghdad , a half dozen men agreed in interviews that america had acted deliberately to leave iraq s army weak it s not the right thing to do , said one of the men , hussan muhammad bush administration officials deny that allegation they say the future iraqi government will decide how many troops iraq needs and whether to allow the united states to establish permanent bases here , should the pentagon seek them this is the beginning , not the end , said walter b slocombe , the pentagon official in charge of rebuilding iraqi security institutions the future iraqi government will make decisions on how big the military should be general eaton does not argue that the new army can defend iraq on its own you apply the right force against the right threat , he said in the short run , he said , the new soldiers will mainly relieve american troops on less risky assignments like traffic checkpoints and highway patrols some of those duties would be similar to the tasks of a national iraqi police force , which mr rumsfeld has suggested will also play an important role in relieving the burden on occupying troops but the police force is also being built up slowly
albany , aug 21 by the time their names were called , the television audience had mostly melted away there was no need for a fancy suit or a frenzied entourage nfl fans were not clamoring for their autographs little kids were not walking around in their jerseys for david tyree , willie ponder and frank walker , being picked in the sixth round of april s draft by the giants came with varying degrees of relief , anxiety , anticipation and wonder , but no fanfare they would head to training camp with relatively small signing bonuses of a couple of hundred thousand dollars , and a lot to prove sixthround draft picks do not pencil themselves onto rosters they work hard and sweat and wait out roster cuts with their fingers crossed i came in with high confidence , said ponder , a wide receiver out of southeast missouri state but now , going through camp , i'm nervous , wondering because it s tough competition from top to bottom at receiver everybody s good , everybody s a player the first cut comes soon , with teams required to whittle their rosters to 65 by tuesday the giants have 83 players here and one more on the injured list saturday s game against the jets will be the final audition for some players ponder and tyree are trying to make it as receivers , walker as a cornerback , and none are likely to be cut this soon the giants would like to keep all of their 11 draft picks , but wo n't it s a numbers game the top draft picks have large signing bonuses invested in them , and the reputation of the giants' player personnel staff is also in their hands lowerround picks live a more tenuous existence last year we had to cut darian barnes and it broke my heart , general manager ernie accorsi said of the rookie freeagent fullback he won a super bowl ring with tampa bay accorsi said he was thankful that these three players were still available when the giants' sixthround picks came up waiving any of them would be a tough thing you always pick players with the potential to be starters , accorsi said once you start picking for depth , you end up with a team of mediocre football players tyree , ponder and walker handle the looming cuts with varying degrees of confidence ponder is the quietest of them and worries aloud about how much he has to learn , coming from a small college he watches the starters , amani toomer and ike hilliard , with a certain degree of awe there s a certain way you have to play in this league , ponder said you have to go full speed you have to know how to run the angles hopefully , i can keep learning , and if i'm here long enough , maybe i can be good like those guys tyree was thrilled to be drafted where he was he played at syracuse , but was never a featured wide receiver he had one eyeopening afternoon as a senior , a 9catch , 229yard game against virginia tech the giants picked him mainly for his value on special teams for me to be drafted , it was something special , tyree said the reality of it is , you see a lot of sixthrounders get cut , but i do n't look at it like that i feel like i 've got something special i'm going to work to get better i'm not going to make the same mistake twice i think that s huge on this level walker , the most voluble of the three , took his selection as an insult his agent had told him that he would be selected between the third and the fifth rounds , despite playing at tuskegee , a division ii college every team that did n't pick me , i just want to make them pay , walker said if i get cut , i 'll just go to another team , and the giants will be another team i have to make pay walker s progress has been interrupted by an injury he started out strong in camp but sustained a dislocated elbow and did not play in the first two preseason games he said the coaches are holding him out of saturday s game , but he will play against baltimore next thursday whatever happens , the veterans have told me to keep a clear mind , walker said i'm going to be a good player wherever i end up for hope , all any of them have to do is look at their own starting lineup , where they will find linebacker dhani jones , sixth round , class of 2000 extra points jeremy shockey ended his trainingcamp silence he responded to a question about whether he would be ready for the season opener by saying , we 'll see jim finn will start at fullback over the incumbent , charles stackhouse , in saturday s game coach jim fassel said that tailback tiki barber would see little action so he can evaluate the backups , dorsey levens and ron dayne photo with so many talented wide receivers in training camp , willie ponder is fighting the numbers game \( photo by dave oxford for the new york times \) \( pg d2 \)
for most of his career , david bradley , the owner of the atlantic monthly , helped businesses innovate around seemingly intractable problems before buying the atlantic in 1999 , he built a successful consulting firm , the advisory board , that eventually went public but after switching from consulting to owning , he realized that he had never come across something as dysfunctional as the economics of publishing magazines despite significant circulation and advertising gains and a passel of journalism awards since he acquired the magazine from mortimer zuckerman , the atlantic continues to lose millions of dollars a year so mr bradley , the consultant , advised mr bradley , the magazine owner , to take several steps that are both radical and simple , at least in the publishing industry charge readers more while shunning the cult of big circulation in 2004 , the atlantic monthly will cut its rate base , the number of copies promised to advertisers , to 325 , 000 from 450 , 000 \( the magazine s actual average circulation exceeded 500 , 000 last year \) and readers will be asked to pay almost twice as much to subscribe about 30 instead of an average of about 16 the changes come after the magazine decreased its frequency to 10 times a year from 12 , so the percopy price is even higher in my 20 years of strategy consulting , i do n't know that i came across a more complex proposition than magazine profitability , or at least , ours , mr bradley writes in a letter that will be sent to advertisers today the atlantic is hardly enron , but neither is it \( any time soon \) my third ipo in the letter , mr bradley writes that he will lower ad rates as the number of subscribers declines and suggests that the magazine will be delivering truly engaged readers , not junk subscriptions from thirdparty sources for years , particularly since the internet bubble burst , the publishing industry has been promising to charge consumers more and has proceeded to do exactly the opposite according to capell s circulation report , a magazine industry newsletter , the average price of a standard subscription has dropped 17 percent in the five years ending in 2002 common sense would suggest that during the biggest advertising downturn in more than a decade , publishers would ask consumers to pay a bigger share but in 2002 , the first year in which the audit bureau of circulations has kept track of average annual subscription prices , the average price per copy rose one cent , according to capell s june 2003 issue magazines like harper s bazaar , gq and vogue are charging less there are exceptions the economist has increased its subscription price over the years and now charges an average of 102 a year for its customers in the united states its closest rival in the united states on price is time inc s people , which charges 9904 , up from 9676 a year ago but a lush , beautifully produced magazine like vanity fair can still be had for an average of 1621 , and much lower if a consumer shops around , particularly on the internet the magazine industry has trained the american public to undervalue its product , the president of the atlantic monthly , john fox sullivan , said we are raising prices in a way that to our knowledge has never been done , and there are many people who are telling us that we are moving too quickly and we will regret it but we instinctively believe that there is a core of readers who will pay a good price for this magazine the atlantic monthly is working from a position of manifest strengths and profound weaknesses in the last three years , its newsstand sales have increased 94 percent while the average subscription renewal price has risen 35 percent its advertising pages were up 31 percent in the last two , very punishing years , and it has won five national magazine awards in the last two years but the reason mr bradley and mr sullivan are considering such a highrisk strategy is that the investment that drove those improvements has doubled losses at the magazine , to 8 million a year from 4 million , a company official said there has been a 50year tradition at the magazine of older male businessmen like myself managing the atlantic as a philanthropy , mr bradley said it was largely subsidized and dependent on finding the next mort zuckerman i think it s possible i may be the last member of that generation , and we have to find a way to make this wonderful magazine support itself dan capell of capell s circulation report said that the atlantic had the right idea , although he did not expect many other magazines to follow suit with the current advertising climate , i keep thinking you are going to see more people raising their subscription prices , he said but i doubt that it will have much of an influence on other people because they are too worried about their ad revenues david carey , the publisher of the new yorker , said of the atlantic s plan historically , this is really a 'bet the franchise' move , and the people who have tried it before have lost for better or worse , the modernday publishing model is ad leveraged , not circulation leveraged , despite the efforts of some smart people to change that mr carey has successfully raised the new yorker s subscription prices in recent years

held hostage , published today by w w norton , casts an unflattering light on machinations at the barnes and its estranged partner , lincoln university , that are drawing comparisons to the litigious mire of dickens s bleak house the central question before the orphans' court hearing the charities case is whether the testament of the foundation s combative founder , albert c barnes , can be legally broken so that the vaunted collection can be put under new board stewardship and moved to touristfriendly new quarters in central philadelphia from its historic home in a limestone gallery on a quiet main line estate in merion , pa it s the biggest trust case in america right now , said terrance a kline , lawyer for a group of students of the barnes who sought unsuccessfully to enter the case as opponents of any change in the foundation s status the barnes collection , with its 353 renoirs , c zannes , matisses and picassos alone , has been valued at more than 6 billion , but costly lawsuits and management problems have left the foundation broke and its treasures captive to the roiling crosscurrents of race and politics , ego and greed , wrote john anderson , the author of art held hostage and a contributing editor to the american lawyer it has become a neverending legal saga that has cost the barnes most of its endowment and the barnes and lincoln to some extent their good name , he said in an interview the book has won guarded praise at the barnes , which agreed to accept 200 copies to sell in its gift shop in return for granting the publisher rights to reproduce 12 color plates of some of the collection s most cherished works , among them matisse s joy of life , seurat s models and c zanne s woman in a green hat it did n't put the barnes in a bad light it put the leadership of the barnes in a bad light , said kimberly camp , executive director since 1998 none of those people are still involved but we 're still living down that legacy the book is particularly critical of the controversial former president of the barnes , richard h glanton , who led the foundation until 1998 during the period of the audit and remains a trustee of lincoln university on friday the exelon corporation , a utilities giant in chicago , confirmed a report that mr glanton , 56 , a senior partner at the law firm of reed smith and long active in pennsylvania republican politics , would be leaving philadelphia to join exelon starting today as a senior vice president for corporate development in charge of mergers and acquisitions mr glanton , reached last week and asked about his portrayal in the book , warned , be careful what you say , but refused to elaborate and said he would have no further comment a defamation suit against him by a former president of lincoln , niara sudarkasa , was dismissed but is under appeal the litigation tangle has its origins 90 years ago , when barnes , an antielitist and artbesotted patentmedicine multimillionaire , began assembling a trove of french postimpressionist masterpieces and african , medieval and american folk art that became widely regarded as the finest private collection in the nation often at war with philadelphia society , barnes set up his collection as an academy to teach common folk that art should be viewed simply for the interplay of its compositional elements and not for its documentary , historical or social information the collection was opened to visitors only on a limited basis following a lawsuit after his death in a car crash in 1951 it did not emerge until a decade later that barnes , who venerated black culture , had handed important control over his foundation to lincoln , a small black university 50 miles from the barnes in rural southeastern pennsylvania now much of that is under challenge in a complex case turning in part on the degree to which a benefactor s legacy can be modified or undone years after his death the proposed changes , steeped in commercial practicalities , are eagerly sought by the barnes s board and members of philadelphia s political and philanthropic establishment they have bridled under restrictions that , among other things , limit the number of visitors to just 1 , 200 a week but modifying the barnes s legacy is vociferously opposed by many barnes loyalists , and by lincoln university , which would lose its authority to nominate four of the barnes foundation s five directors in one of the many unusual aspects of the case , it was the barnes s board of lincolnnominated directors that surprised the university last sept 24 by filing for court approval to break the barnes s historic tie to lincoln doing so , they argued , would enable them to expand the board to attract new benefactors like the pew charitable trusts and the lenfest foundation , which have pledged to help raise 150 million for a new downtown home for the barnes lincoln , a 2 , 001student institution that is the nation s oldest black university , founded in 1854 , has won court standing to challenge any change in the foundation s charter
it is a tough time for the bond market july was its worst month in more than two decades , compressing a year s losses into 23 trading days interest rates have been rising , the federal budget deficit is growing and the nearly 22yearold bull market in bonds may be over but hightailing out of bonds is not wise the bond market can still be your friend bill gross , the pimco portfolio manager who runs the largest bond mutual fund , certainly thinks so his pimco total return fund lost 38 percent in july , its worst month ever , and he believes that low money market and treasury yields and the prospect of rising inflation are very damaging to investors but , he added , if done properly , a bond portfolio can be managed to be fairly investorfriendly over the next couple of years similarly , paul derosa , a partner at mount lucas management , a hedge fund , said , i think in some fundamental way treasury yields are fine with inflation around 1 percent , the real , or afterinflation , yield on a 10year treasury note is close to 35 percent that , he said , is the historical average an investor who bought 10year notes and put them away probably wo n't be embarrassed by the purchase , he said this may be hard to believe after all , the yield on the treasury s 10year note has jumped 116 percentage points in the last eight weeks , sending prices down sharply investors have watched their returns drop merrill lynch s broad domestic bond index fell 336 percent in july alone , more than in any full year since 1976 last month , intermediate bond funds , a category that includes pimco total return , lost 324 percent , on average , according to morningstar and some investors are beginning to turn and run last week , the fourweek moving average of flows to taxable bond funds turned negative for the first time since the end of 2000 , according to amg data services , with an outflow of 14 million just 11 weeks ago , money was pouring into these funds at a weekly clip of 3 billion amid all this , there are reasons to be positive about bonds the selloff went so far , so fast , that the outlook for further price declines has moderated in fact , treasuries have recovered somewhat in the last week and a half the yield on the 10year note is 427 percent , down from the 444 percent high on july 29 still , for those who want to buy now , yields are significantly higher and prices lower than they were in june although mr gross acknowledges that july was a terrible month , he says that now that it is over , it was better to get to higher yields quickly than slowly so you can start earning them the jump in bond yields has also given investors in money market funds now paying less than 1 percent a new opportunity to shift to bonds and some enclaves in the bond market still look attractive , including treasury inflationprotected securities , or tips , as well as municipal bonds and mortgagebacked securities some analysts also still like highyield and investmentgrade corporate bonds holding bonds as part of a diversified portfolio is always a good idea you do that because you know you are going to be wrong sometime about stocks , said james w paulsen , chief investment officer at wells capital management in minneapolis and you do n't want to get blown away admittedly , bonds wo n't be as friendly as they have been over the last two decades , when interest rates fell from the midteens to the lowest levels since the 1950 s that decline brought big capital gains as bond prices rose , nicely supplementing the yields paid by the government and corporations over the next few years , if the fall in prices and rise in yields continues at a much slower pace , mr gross thinks his total return fund can still earn about 5 percent a year resulting from the fund s expected average yield of 6 percent and a price decline of about 1 percent a year that is not great when compared with the returns of 116 percent in 2000 , 969 percent in 2001 and 898 percent in 2002 but given current expectations of highsingledigit returns for the stock market over the next several years , a 5 percent return in bonds is not bad the outlook for what mr gross called a very mild bear market in bonds assumes that the federal reserve will keep its benchmark federal funds rate at 1 percent , or lower , for a long time such a commitment , especially if made repeatedly , will restrain any rise in longer term treasury yields , mr gross said this year through thursday , the return for the total return fund was 195 percent , just below the average return of 209 percent for similar funds tracked by morningstar tips , municipal bonds and mortgagebacked securities now account for about 54 percent of the 72 billion in mr gross s fund the exposure to treasuries , which cannot be completely avoided , has been adjusted to make the fund less vulnerable to rate increases mr gross has sold 20to30year securities in favor of treasuries in the five to sevenyear range investmentgrade corporate bonds are also being deemphasized because they are trading too expensively , he said people have forgotten that corporations can go bankrupt , he added tips are mr gross s favorite , making up 10 percent of his fund that is an especially big bet , he said , because there are none in either of the fund s bond market benchmarks newly issued tips offer real yields from just under 2 percent to nearly 35 percent and compensate for inflation next on his list are taxexempt municipal bonds , which have been made attractive partly by the budget problems in california and the recall election scheduled for october this fiscal and political turmoil has sort of cheapened up municipals , he said , making it possible to buy a taxexempt general obligation bond with a yield that is very close to the yield on a comparable , taxable treasury security for example , the yield on 10year general obligation bonds is now 393 percent , compared to a 427 percent yield on the 10year treasury note , according to thomson financial four percent of the total return fund is in municipals mr gross said he would buy more tips and municipals if he could do so without distorting those markets and straying too far from the composition of the fund s benchmarks he likes the potential gain from munis so much that 40 percent of his own 401 \( k \) is invested in them , even though they are already taxexempt the rest is in tips fortunately , he finds mortgagebacked securities , the largest single sector in his benchmarks , to be an attractive investment mortgages make up about 40 percent of the fund and yield about 18 percentage points more than comparable treasuries even if the bond bull is out to pasture , every investor should have some bonds , he said but you have to be cautious about what you choose , he added photo bill gross , manager of the pimco total return fund , the largest bond mutual fund , says he believes that investors can earn a fair return in bonds over the next few years chart the end of a trend \? the yield on the 10year treasury note has increased recently , but it remains low by historical standards graph tracks the 10year

wimbledon , england this could have been the best day of the year in tennis , anywhere the round of 16 at wimbledon , everybody playing , weather permitting hard to know where to go first on a threatening day , the organizers put the women on first , undoubtedly assuming that the american women venus williams , serena williams , lindsay davenport and jennifer capriati would perform their appointed rounds in two sets , which they did with showers falling , the gate money was in the bank but then again , the gate money is always in the bank at wimbledon it is an honor just to stroll the grounds here got that straight \? then the men took over the damp grounds much is made of how the men sell more strawberries and pimm s and ice cream by playing bestoffive sets while the women play bestofthree on this day , in the round of 16 , the only day when everybody plays , it was surely true that the men worked longer and were more compelling than the women only one of eight women s matches went three sets , while most of the men labored for two , three , four hours more time for suffering all of england suffers when tim henman plays on a long cloudy evening , there was more national nervousness until henman held off david nalbandian of argentina in four sets but for sheer desperate energy , there was andre agassi scurrying around court 1 , trying to flag down the incoming fire from mark philippoussis , who is not called scud for nothing agassi had spent much of his tennis life trying to defuse the live ammo delivered by his american rival , pete sampras now , with sampras in mothballs , probably forever , agassi spent his last hours of this year s wimbledon chasing down the salvos by philippoussis , the australian artillery man philippoussis unloaded 46 aces , tying the wimbledon record set by goran ivanisevic in 1997 this was enough to beat agassi , 63 , 26 , 67 \( 4 \) , 63 , 64 , in 3 hours 13 minutes agassi kept taking surreptitious glances at the fieldlevel scoreboard to check the velocity of his opponent s serves he needed to know that he was not just flubbing some mediocre 100mileanhour serve you have to ask yourself 'what is beating me out here \? what is getting the job done \? agassi said if he hits a wide serve in the deuce court that i'm a little early on , i smother it in the net crosscourt , i want to know , did he hit that thing 103 and held me up or is he hitting it 109 and i'm actually seeing it well right now \? i should take that as a positive was he impressed with the numbers philippoussis was putting on the board \? no , agassi said with a smile he stopped impressing me a long time ago it takes more than that now agassi has been at this a long time , going back to juvenile tennis in the western states , when sampras , 16 months younger , played in the age category below him sampras did not have the speed of philippoussis , but he had better placement and consistency , none of it fun for agassi all his life , agassi has been a mobile little chap , lunging to return the big boys' serves and he did it with great success often enough it is always a desperate business , though somebody lets loose , and agassi lunges left or right , grunting and straining and extending his arms , just to return the ball yesterday s struggle was long and ultimately futile he is 33 years old , and he and his wife , steffi graf , are expecting their second child he admits he sleeps less than he would like his priorities are so straight that agassi does not even entertain questions about how long he can keep going i wo n't know when it s over with till it s there , he said after the match my plan is to be back here next year he has every right to wonder how long he can keep doing this he last won wimbledon in 1992 he concedes that he may not win it again it s always a possibility , yeah , agassi said you know , it s not sort of easy to win wimbledon , so for it to happen again would be quite an amazing thing agassi said he would be quite content to pack his things and go home to las vegas there he plans to throw his tennis gear back into the washing machine , to get the red clay dust from roland garros in paris out of the white socks i wear two pairs of socks when i play , he said i was wearing the dirty ones underneath he did not do anything sentimental , the way martina navratilova did when she plucked a few blades of expensive wimbledon grass when she made her last appearance as a singles player at center court of course , somewhat to her surprise , navratilova came back as granny the doubles specialist andre agassi waved yesterday he did not bend down and pluck at the lawn as far as he knows , he will be back at wimbledon the grass will still be here photo andre agassi was aced 46 times yesterday , losing a 3hour13minute match in wimbledon s round of 16 \( reuters \)

at an experimental store that opened last month in rheinberg , germany , customers do not just squeeze loaves of bread they scan them the extra future store is a pilot project of the metro group , a big germanbased retailer , and two unusual partners for a store sap and intel when shoppers enter the store , they are provided with a small touchscreen computer with a builtin bar code scanner the carttop computer also allows shoppers to scan their purchases for payment as they move through the store for items like produce that require weighing , the store has installed scales equipped with digital cameras that use imagerecognition software to figure out and then price the kind of object they are weighing our key objective is to demonstrate in a real store all possible advanced retail technologies , said christian koch , sap s project manager for the store much of the gadgetry relies on signals from radio frequency identification tags that are attached to cases and pallets that deliver merchandise or , in a small number of cases , individual products signals from the tag allow the store to track products and their sales , ultimately allowing automated reordering at least that is the idea of roughly 37 , 000 products in the store , only about 1 , 500 currently have the radio frequency tags on their shipping containers of those , only about 30 products , including gillette razor blades , carry individual tags that were applied by their manufacturers mr koch said that none of the partners had calculated the added cost of the store s extra features the point is that you have to get some knowledge about how these technologies work in real life , he said after seeing how innovations like radio frequency tags cope with hostile environments will they freeze after two weeks in a meat cooler , for example \? will cellphones interfere with the radio signals \? the partners will begin assessing the costeffectiveness of their changes before the store opened , however , the group made one change to accommodate new technology unusually for germany , plastic rather than metal shopping carts were provided engineers found that the usual ones played havoc with radio signals
since georgia heywood moved to greenpoint , brooklyn , two months ago , it s not unusual for her to wake up in a fright at 3 am and stuff her pillow into the freezer nor is it unusual for her roommate , larissa powers , to spray her bed with a toxic substance and consider burning all her clothes it s not that the two young women are eccentric they fear that when they wake up in the morning , they will be covered in itchy red splotches , courtesy of a particularly unwelcome greenpoint resident the bedbug i feel like a leper , ms powers , 26 , said the other night she was sitting in her apartment on india street , and she had just received a fresh round of halfdollarsized bites on her face and neck bedbugs have even invaded her dreams the apparent number of bedbugs invading greenpoint apartments and bloodstreams has exploded in recent months anthony lopatowski , the manager of safeguard exterminating services on driggs avenue , used to perform one or two bedbug exterminations a month since august , he said , he does several every week they were pretty much rid of , say , 5 or 10 years ago , mr lopatowski said , with the exasperated tone of a man whose old foe has returned for another battle now , they 're coming back with a vengeance he suggests that the increase is due to the recent influx of young greenpoint residents who pick up used furniture from the street or sleep on mattresses close to the ground nor is greenpoint alone in its bedbug misery antonio breton , the owner of license to kill bugs exterminators in washington heights , said that in recent months at least 100 customers from manhattan , queens and the bronx had bought a 25 bedbug spray that he sells and carolyn klass , an entomologist at cornell university , says that in the last few years , bedbug numbers have increased nationwide their methods are subtle and persistent according ms klass , bedbugs are just threeeighths of an inch long but will attach up to 500 eggs at a time to the underside of a mattress or the back of a picture frame once hatched , bedbugs need blood to molt into each stage of development , ms klass said they crawl onto a person s skin at night and suck blood for up to 10 minutes generations of bedbugs can feed on one person for years none of this is lost on ms heywood and ms powers , who go to sleep each night dressed like cossacks , as ms powers put it they tuck turtlenecks into their pants and their pants into their socks , and they have put shoes in the freezer , which they read on the internet is a way to kill the bugs though an exterminator recently visited their apartment , he told the women that bedbugs were likely to return in a few weeks as a result , they are still wary do n't let the bedbugs bite my mom said that to me every time , and i say that to people too , ms heywood said but we let them bite it s so medieval jeff vandam photo bedbugs seem to be making a comeback in the mattresses of greenpoint \( photo by afp corbis \)
federal authorities arrested a former senior trader with the enron corporation yesterday , charging him in a criminal complaint with manipulating the california power market during the state s energy crisis two years ago the trader , john m forney , was arrested at the offices of american electric power in columbus , ohio , where he now works according to the complaint , two former enron traders who have already pleaded guilty to manipulation including timothy n belden , the former head of trading in enron s office in portland , ore provided evidence against mr forney the charges in the complaint , which include conspiracy and wire fraud , stem from a series of trading strategies with names like death star and ricochet that enron used during the power crisis many of those strategies have already been publicly disclosed and examined by federal energy regulators and by congress the criminal case against enron traders in california has been complex , primarily because many of the strategies were not specifically barred by the highly complex rules governing the california energy system but in the complaint , prosecutors signaled a strategy of simplicity , largely sidestepping the issue of the rules' requirements instead , prosecutors are using a theory that anyone who receives money for what has been falsely represented as a service or product can be committing fraud indeed , while numerous government reports have studied the strategies , the complaint may well be the most carefully tailored examination of them it avoids hyperbole for instance , sidestepping the implication that the enron strategies brought on the power crisis while simultaneously laying out evidence of why the strategies would be attractive to traders brian k murphy , a columbus lawyer representing mr forney , said , none of the things he is being charged with are criminal he also indicated that his client was acting on the instructions of his boss , mr belden , who is now a chief witness against him in the criminal complaint , mr forney is described as the architect of certain transactions for example , it says death star in which enron was paid for relieving congestion on the grid when all it had really done was file papers for a circular trade involving no movement of electrons was also called the forney loop inside enron the complaint says that before mr forney took over a trading desk in 1999 , it had a reputation of producing paltry revenues , thus creating a possible motive for the pursuit of the strategies that brought in additional cash some of the trades , like ricochet , involved lying to california about what the state was purchasing , the complaint says in that instance , it says , enron parked power generated in california out of state , and then brought it back in that allowed the company to avoid price caps on power generated in the state , the complaint says some of the transactions took advantage of glitches , the complaint says for example , when certain hubs went offline , energy could not flow through them at times , enron filed a transmission schedule that would have the effect of reducing congestion , with the power flow going through the offline hubs as a result , the schedule would be canceled by regulators , but enron would still be paid for relieving congestion on the lines , even though it had done nothing in effect , it was as if someone had discovered a button on an automated teller machine that would cause cash to spew out and then pushed the button repeatedly some of the strategies affected the availability of electricity , the complaint says for example , california paid more for firm power , which meant that there was a backup available if energy was not delivered enron traders would identify power as firm even when it was not , and would be paid more , the complaint says but infrequently , the complaint says , the power was not delivered with no backup available , california dipped into energy reserves thereby increasing the risk of emergency blackouts , the complaint says
charitable donations of everything from mittens and food to property and planes is coming under congressional scrutiny , thanks to research raising questions about the real value of donated vehicles a report to be released friday by the general accounting office , the investigative arm of congress , finds that there were often wide discrepancies between the value donors of vehicles claimed as deductions on their tax returns and the amount received by the charities that were their beneficiaries vehicle donations cost the government 654 million in tax revenue in 2000 , but the study suggests that charities received less than 5 percent of the value donors claimed in twothirds of 54 donations to four charities that gave information to the agency for instance , one taxpayer valued his 1994 saturn sl2 sedan at 5 , 750 , the car sold for 1 , 350 and the charity received 968 in another case the gao examined , a taxpayer valued his 1986 toyota 4runner at 3 , 950 on his tax return , the vehicle sold for 300 and the charity received 5 in six of the cases , so little value was realized that the charities ended up owing money to the middlemen who handled the vehicles this report further exposes what s proving to be a rat s nest of problems in the area of aggressive valuation of inkind gifts , said senator charles e grassley , chairman of the senate finance committee mr grassley , an iowa republican , said his concerns went well beyond cars donations of land , art and intellectual property are all raising concerns , he said the finance committee will look at significant reforms in this area a committee staff member said it would probably consider a measure limiting the deduction vehicle donors can claim to the amount charities receive for the vehicles the committee is also looking into using the internal revenue service s art advisory panel , which examines values placed on donated art when questions arise , as a model for appraising claims for other noncash gifts we are looking at boats , planes , land , art , patent donations , pharmaceuticals , the staff member said all those things are open to abuse noncash donations are a growing part of the philanthropic world more than 30 percent of corporate philanthropy is in the form of donated goods , according to surveys by the conference board , a business research organization , and more charities are courting inkind gifts the uso , which provides support to american military personnel , started accepting cars as donations in january at the end of october , it had received 94 , 000 from 215 cars that were donated to it , or about 437 a car on average that is just a fraction of the 60 million the uso has raised this year , but in charity , every nickel and dime counts it s a very easy way for us to make money , said diane l rogers , the organization s director of corporate giving the america s car donations charity center handles the donation for the uso , determining whether the vehicle offered will generate any money , towing it , transferring title and selling it the uso gets 80 percent of the proceeds after charges related to the disposal of the vehicle are deducted critics and regulators say noncash philanthropy is rife with abuse while the internal revenue service has a compliance program to detect inflated valuations , it has told congressional investigators that it does not follow up on leads because it has higher priorities what is more , the irs plans to end the program in january , although in response to the general accounting report , commissioner mark w everson said the agency planned to reassess the program a spokesman for the irs declined to comment on the report rick cohen , executive director of the national committee for responsive philanthropy , a nonprofit watchdog group , said i 've always been concerned about the donation of anything that is n't cash cars are the tip of the iceberg in terms of noncash donations that warrant a whole new level of scrutiny mr cohen noted that proposals have been floated in congress to increase valuations of donated food , thereby enhancing the tax benefits of such donations , and to raise the ceiling on donations for which corporations could receive tax deductions pharmaceutical and technology companies are among the biggest corporate givers because of inkind donations according to business week , eli lilly valued its noncash philanthropy at 2048 million in 2002 , four times its monetary contributions microsoft and general mills also made the magazine s list of top 15 inkind givers , making donations they valued at 2071 million and 226 million , respectively sally corrigan , president and chief executive officer of gifts in kind international , a nonprofit group that serves as a conduit for corporate product donations , said individual donations of cars , land and other property were different from corporate contributions of inventory ms corrigan noted that corporations have other options for disposing of inventory , like liquidation or destruction , that lower their tax burdens in the same way a charitable deduction would , and that there are penalties for overstating the value of donations i ca n't think of anyone who would think it was a better idea to destroy a product than to give it away to a charity that can use it for people in need , she said states are increasingly pursuing complaints about inkind donations california has been the most aggressive , requiring vehicle donors to fill out detailed receipts and annually publishing a list that shows what portion of the proceeds of car donations went to charity and what went to commercial fundraisers the california attorney general s office has found abuses with other noncash gifts as well it investigated the jewish educational center in san francisco , which solicited donations of jewelry , art , vehicles and timeshares , among other things none of this stuff had a whole lot of value , particularly the timeshares and land , which often had contamination problems , said belinda j johns , deputy attorney general for charities when the receivers went to liquidate it , they could n't sell it
most church meetings take place in , well , a church this is true even for a lay group like voice of the faithful , whose motto is , keep the faith , change the church it s true , at least , in 187 of the 195 roman catholic dioceses in the country in eight others , including two of connecticut s three dioceses , the catholic church has banned the group from meeting on diocesan property which is why , on a late july evening , about 40 catholics who worship in the diocese of norwich , gathered in the colonial room , a light blue conference hall with a green rug in a days inn just off route 161 in niantic farther south , in norwalk , a group that once met at st jerome s said it was essentially kicked out last summer after speakers at a national voice of the faithful convention in boston offended bishop william e lori , who leads the bridgeport diocese the group now meets at the first congregational church in norwalk they pass the hat each month and donate 100 to the church besides the two dioceses that ban the group in connecticut , all or part of six other dioceses across the country have stopped voice of the faithful from meeting on church grounds they are camden , nj portland , me boston rockville centre , ny newark , nj , and baker , ore in april , the outgoing bishop thomas v daily of brooklyn became the first and only bishop to reverse his ban on the group voice of the faithful began with a meeting of 25 people at st john the evangelist church in wellesley , mass , in january 2002 the topic of that meeting was articles in the boston globe that priests involved in sexual abuse cases had been protected and moved around the country by highlevel church leaders according to its web site , voice of the faithful now has 30 , 000 members in 40 states and 21 countries there are 181 chapters in the united states , and james e post , voice of the faithful s president , said the group s budget is in excess of 500 , 000 , with four fulltime and six parttime employees the first connecticut chapter was organized in june 2002 at st bridget s in manchester , and there are now 10 chapters in the state with more than 800 members , according to jayne o 'donnell , the regional coordinator of voice of the faithful voice of the faithful has three goals , as stated on its web site to support those who have been abused , to support priests of integrity and to shape structural change within the church it is this last goal that concerns the group s critics , many of whom see a hidden liberal agenda that seeks to alter ancient church doctrine what do they mean by structural change \? asked cj doyle , executive director of the catholic action league they mean a weakened papacy , female clerics and a protestantstyle church government in bridgeport , bishop lori released a statement last august that cautioned catholics on the voice of the faithful movement i cannot support an organization like voice of the faithful which appears to promote dialogue and cooperation , the statement said , but which in reality prosecutes a hidden agenda that is in conflict with the teachings of the catholic faith joseph mcaleer , a spokesman for bishop lori , said the bishop will not meet with the group to discuss the ban or anything else , but has instead appointed highlevel contacts to communicate and meet with the group and has put a priest in charge of attending voice of the faithful meetings it makes no sense to encourage the discussion of topics that are not open for discussion , said dr mcaleer , meaning , married priests , women ordained to the priesthood and homosexuality voice of the faithful s dr post said the group speaks for those catholics who fall somewhere in between liberal and conservative , and who are disgusted with the way church leaders handled the sexual abuse scandal though he praises bishop lori for the work he has done to help heal the church in the aftermath of the scandal \( the bishop has set up a largely lay sexual misconduct review board to help him investigate accusations of priestly sexual abuse , for instance \) , he is also furious at the bishop and others like him who have banned voice of the faithful without even meeting with them to discuss the group s goals what disturbs me about bishop lori is his continued refusal to sit and meet with us , said dr post it s hugely presumptuous of him to think he knows what s on my mind without talking to me how does he impute motives to me without talking to me , without hearing me out \? it s an extremely arrogant posture for him to take dr mcaleer said the diocese has no record of any contact from dr post \( though he said the diocese has had requests to meet with the local voice of the faithful chapter \) voice of the faithful , however , provided a reporter with a copy of a letter written by dr post requesting a meeting with bishop lori dated aug 22 , 2002 dr post said he called the bishop s office three times in the weeks after he requested the meeting in writing , and that none of his calls was returned
eagle , colo , oct 9 the woman who accused kobe bryant of rape told police that he invited her into his hotel room and , after the two flirted , gripped her neck with both hands , forced her to lean face first over a chair and assaulted her , a sheriff s detective testified on thursday doug winters , a detective with the eagle county sheriff s department , offered the first detailed account of the events in bryant s hotel room during a preliminary hearing to determine whether bryant , an allstar guard for the los angeles lakers , would stand trial on a charge of sexual assault winters took the stand in a packed courtroom at the eagle county justice center and recounted a videotaped interview he conducted with the woman on the day after she said the attack occurred bryant , 25 , has admitted that he had sex with the woman , but he has said that it was consensual winters told eagle county court judge frederick gannett and a gallery of 50 that bryant flirted with the 19yearold woman on june 30 as he checked into the lodge spa at cordillera , where she worked at the front desk the woman told police that bryant , who was in town to have knee surgery , asked her for a tour of the hotel the woman said bryant then invited her into his room and raped her she was afraid that he was going to choke her , said winters , who was the only witness thursday the woman said the encounter had started with consensual kissing , but later , when she said she needed to leave , he grabbed her around the neck she said she needed to leave and said , 'no , ' at least twice , winters told the judge presiding over the lengthy hearing but she told the detective that she abided bryant s advances for fear that he would hurt her more she said she cried during the encounter , which lasted about five minutes the woman said that afterward , bryant repeatedly asked her not to tell anyone about the incident at one point , she said she agreed not to say anything to anyone because she feared he would harm her she was afraid that he was going to choke her , winters said winters said bryant was not holding her neck so tight that she could not breathe , but tight enough to restrict her movement winters also testified that the woman told him she had bled during the attack , and he said that the woman s blood was found on the inside of bryant s tshirt , based on dna tests during her crossexamination of winters , bryant s lawyer , pamela mackey , asked if the accuser s injuries would also be consistent with a person who has had sex with three different men in three days the prosecution objected , and the judge immediately emptied the courtroom and called the lawyers into his chambers gannett had admonished mackey earlier when she repeatedly named the woman during her questioning there was no other defense strategy than to smear the victim , said norman early , a former district attorney of denver that s why they wanted a preliminary hearing that s why all the experts thought there would be none , because nobody thought the defense team would stoop that low the hearing will continue at 11 am eastern time on wednesday i had hoped that we would have concluded the evidentiary portion of this hearing , gannett said it creates a logistical nightmare many legal experts had predicted that the defense would waive the hearing to forego such lurid testimony , and some observers in the courtroom questioned the defense s decision to go forward this is a disaster for the defense , said jeffrey toobin , a lawyer who writes the legal affairs column for the new yorker these are vivid , awful images of bryant , and they will haunt him in every arena he plays in until the trial and maybe for the rest of his career during winters s testimony , the assistant district attorney craig crittenden submitted photographs taken of the woman during a nurse s examination early on july 2 , including vaginal injuries and one depicting what winters described as an injury to the left jaw area bryant , who is free on 25 , 000 bond , left the lakers' training camp in hawaii on wednesday to appear at the hearing he faces up to life in prison if convicted of the felony charge craig silverman , a former deputy district attorney in denver who was at the courthouse yesterday , said so far , this shows kobe to be a crude , boorish adulterer , but the charge here is sexual assault a jury has to be convinced that he forced her to have sex photo kobe bryant and his lawyer , pamela mackey , entering the eagle county justice center yesterday in eagle , colo \( photo by associated press \)
san francisco , nov 22 he was not a very serious law school student , one of his former professors says he has a reputation for floating farfetched defense theories , some fellow lawyers say he even lost his most recent highprofile case involving felony shoplifting charges against the actress winona ryder but none of that matters much anymore for mark geragos , america s celebrity lawyer du jour a theology student in college who friends say is anything but hollywood hip , mr geragos represents two of the most attentiongrabbing criminal defendants in the country , a pop star , michael jackson , and a former fertilizer salesman , scott peterson he reminds me of an old ethnic lawyer of the last generation , the guys who have strong friendships and strong enemies and who are flamboyant , said harland w braun , a friend and fellow lawyer who has represented the actor robert blake he has an inner strength that you do n't normally find in los angeles on thursday , when mr jackson surrendered to the authorities in santa barbara on child molesting accusations , mr geragos , 46 , was at his side two days earlier , he was in modesto with mr peterson , who is accused of killing his wife , laci , and their unborn son it was there in a modesto courtroom that mr geragos s pager went off with news that search warrants had been executed at neverland , mr jackson s home near santa barbara he likes walking the high wire , and he is up there now , said another bigname lawyer , gloria allred , who represents mr peterson s former mistress , amber frey , and who has long been an adversary of mr jackson there is not a whole lot of oxygen up there we will see how he does mr geragos , who spent friday in a los angeles courtroom on an unrelated murder case , said in a telephone interview at the end of the day that the news media demands on his time were proving more exacting than his growing caseload there were so many calls to his pager about 700 over one 24hour period this week , including about 620 from reporters that the pager became disabled , he said at one point , i thought of throwing it in the ocean , he said to some degree it is embarrassing i suppose because i do n't think any of this is about me it is about the client hopefully it passes and passes quickly even before this week , mr geragos had a run of highvisibility clients , beginning with his socalled breakthrough cases in 1998 and 1999 in those cases he represented susan mcdougal , the jailed whitewater defendant accused of obstructing justice by kenneth w starr , the independent counsel during the clinton administration it was after winning ms mcdougal s acquittal in two trials one unrelated to whitewater that mr geragos became well known outside the armenianamerican community in los angeles , where he had grown up and followed in the footsteps of his father , paul geragos the elder mr geragos worked in the district attorney s office before starting a private practice father and son now work together , along with mr geragos s brother matthew and a staff of other lawyers he is the greatest lawyer i have ever known , mr geragos said of his father it was his father who had suggested that mr geragos volunteer to help ms mcdougal , who had been in jail in los angeles with no money to hire a lawyer one day he showed up at the jail unannounced , ms mcdougal said , suggesting that as someone of armenian descent he had a special appreciation for victims of government oppression i always tease him about my case launching him into the limelight , ms mcdougal said he was just absolutely perfect i hope megalawyering does n't change him at all he is one of the best people mr geragos went on to represent president bill clinton s brother , roger , in a drunken driving case , and former representative gary a condit , who came under suspicion when police investigated the disappearance of the intern chandra levy , who was later found dead other prominent clients included ms ryder and the hiphop star nathaniel hale , known as nate dogg but the peterson and jackson cases , coming in tandem and with both defendants vilified in the public , jettisoned him into the stratosphere of the country s celebrity lawyers , said prof laurie l levenson , director of the loyola law school center for ethical advocacy he is not at the johnnie cochran level , he is the johnnie cochran , professor levenson said , referring to the lawyer perhaps best known for representing o j simpson on murder charges it is not that he tolerates the media he loves the media on the very day mr geragos was defending mr jackson before a bank of television cameras in santa barbara , another lawyer to the stars , robert shapiro , was wrapped up in a hollywood sideshow that served only to highlight mr geragos s newfound ascendancy mr shapiro was in a courthouse in a los angeles suburb with phil spector , the rock music producer accused of murder the household names of today are mark geragos and johnnie cochran , professor levenson said perhaps most widely recognized for his frequent appearances on cable television shows like cnn s larry king live , mr geragos is an unabashed selfpromoter who seeks out the spotlight , friends and colleagues say , whether it be on national television or at an armenianamerican banquet in los angeles his friend and loyola law professor , stanley a goldman , who provides legal commentary on the fox network , said mr geragos had been shooting for the stars ever since he left law school , where professor goldman was among his teachers he was always a very public kind of person , said professor goldman , in the sense that he claims that he rarely showed up for class because he was organizing rock concerts i like mark geragos a lot of people do n't he can be extremely pushy mr geragos said the notoriety has served him well i certainly do n't shy away from it , he conceded in the telephone interview i think that i am able to effectively advocate for my client in a case that is high profile but there have been some drawbacks before taking mr peterson as a client , mr geragos was among the armchair legal analysts who discussed the murders on television , at one point describing the circumstantial case against mr peterson as damning mr geragos now says he is convinced of mr peterson s innocence , and since the judge in the peterson case issued an order limiting participants' discussion of the case , mr geragos no longer makes regular television appearances nancy grace , an anchor for court tv and a former prosecutor who has often sparred with mr geragos on television , said she respected his skills as a lawyer but sometimes took exception to his tactics ms grace said mr geragos saw truth in shades of gray and invoked defense strategies as a ploy to win over jurors if i were charged with double murder , i would definitely call mark geragos , ms grace said what geragos has is a certain affability that persuades the jurors that is what sets him apart from many other lawyers it is not something that can be learned it is not something that can be practiced it is part of his nature even so , ms grace was not prepared to anoint mr geragos as the next legal sensation of the ilk of mr cochran we will have to wait and see about that , she said remember , johnnie won his case photos mark geragos

to the editor i'm afraid that nicholas d kristof has misunderstood the reason behind the wave of antiamericanism in canada \( column , march 7 \) we do n't hate americans we hate how we are treated by america we are constantly reminded that the united states government holds our country and our people in very low regard the united states ignores freetrade rulings to stop punishing canadian farmers and loggers with illegal tariffs , and then turns around and cries foul when the canadian government tries to protect the same groups from these attacks when canadian soldiers were accidentally killed by american forces in afghanistan , it was barely covered in the united states media , and president bush seemed nonchalant since 9 11 we have been told that canada is a haven for terrorists , even though the terrorists lived in the united states for years and none acted through canada and there is the awful treatment of canadians crossing the border if you want to know why there is antiamericanism , look at the anticanadianism that predates it mark salt orangeville , ontario , march 7 , 2003
jack gelber , whose play the connection , with its raw , graphic depiction of the deadend life of drug addicts , sent a shock wave through contemporary american theater , died yesterday in manhattan he was 71 and lived in manhattan the cause was waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia , a cancer of the blood , said his wife , carol the connection which opened off broadway at the living theater in 1959 , was so realistic that it seemed more like life than like theater in its time it polarized theatergoers as well as critics but was soon accepted as innovative in style , substance and language i was so affected and energized by 'the connection , ' edward albee said yesterday it was exciting , dangerous , instructive and terrifying , all things theater should be speaking as a friend , he added , jack was never bitter , always honest , tough and uncompromising mr gelber was also a theater director and teacher and wrote a dozen plays , but the connection , which he wrote when he was 26 , remained the cornerstone of his career when it opened , it received negative reviews in new york s daily newspapers , including the new york times , in which louis calta dismissed it as a farrago of dirt critics for other publications were quick to grasp the work s significance writing in the nation , harold clurman said the play was arresting in its authenticity and said it is as if one had looked for a moment into a corner of our city to breathe the rank air of its unacknowledged dejection the play reeks of human beings the connection won obie awards for best new play , best new production \( directed by judith malina \) and for warren finnerty , who played one of the leading roles it became the signature piece of the living theater , the off broadway company founded by ms malina and her husband , julian beck eventually the play was presented around the world along with mr albee s first play , the zoo story , which opened off broadway the following year , the connection helped to redefine the boundaries of theater it is a play within a play , introduced by actors playing the director and the author , who , the audience is told , has been living among drug addicts as the play itself begins , the addicts are waiting for their connection , a dealer named cowboy while they wait , they play jazz the spontaneity of the dialogue and the interplay with the audience challenged theatrical convention , causing some theatergoers to believe they were eavesdropping on actual addicts the realism was accentuated by the fact that the actors solicited money from the audience during intermission in the second act , a man planted in the audience stood up and interrupted the performance the actor in the original production , uncredited in the program , was martin sheen despite the improvisational air , the play was carefully scripted , and mr gelber was a serious , accomplished playwright in his demeanor he could be disarmingly soft spoken , the opposite of the confrontational quality of this initial work though none of his other plays had the success of the connection , he maintained a vigorous career , especially through his many years of teaching and encouraging young playwrights , actors and directors yesterday arthur kopit praised the connection as seminal work that had a visceral effect on the audience and also stressed that mr gelber was passionate about his teaching mr gelber was born in chicago and graduated from the university of illinois coming to new york in the mid1950 s , he got a job operating a mimeograph machine at the united nations he had many friends who were jazz musicians , and having become involved with a small theater company , he decided to write a play that would combine his interest in jazz and theater he and his wife were married in 1957 , and the next year , in haiti , he wrote the connection , drawing on his knowledge , he said , of the seamier side , the underbelly of life on his return to new york , he submitted the play to the living theater , which was beginning to make its own reputation as one of the most adventurous of experimental companies when the play closed in 1961 , it had run for 722 performances in 1962 it was made into a film by shirley clarke \( with a screenplay by the author \) , breaking cinematic ground with the earthiness of the dialogue mr gelber s other plays include the apple , square in the eye , the cuban thing \( which he directed on broadway \) , sleep , barbary shore \( his adaptation of a norman mailer novel \) and rehearsal he directed many plays , including the kitchen by arnold wesker , the kid by robert coover , seduced by sam shepard and franz x kroetz s farmyard in 1964 he published a novel , on ice he taught at columbia university and brooklyn college and in recent years in the actors studio program at the new school university the night before he died , he was at circle in the square on bleecker street , working with his students on a theater project last june at the last frontier theater conference in valdez , alaska , he and other playwrights \( august wilson , john guare and mr albee \) acted in scenes from their own plays in a play titled dylan s line , mr gelber gave a poignant portrait as the father of a troubled son in addition to his wife , he is survived by a son , jed , of manhattan a daughter , amy , of brooklyn and two brothers , jules , of scottsdale , ariz , and david , of austin , tex speaking about the connection , a year after its opening , mr gelber said , the whole experience had a kind of magic quality to it after ms malina and mr beck accepted it , he said , he was involved in every aspect of the production , the casting , the rehearsals , the box office in my innocence , he said , i wanted to know everything

one day last fall , when the weather had cooled and summer seemed to be over , i went down to my local basketball court , on hudson street between horatio and gansevoort streets , where i 've been going for seven years the court , which is wedged between the west village , where i live , and the meatpacking district , is on the loose circuit of courts upon which players , as it were , like to play but it looked a little emptier than usual the players there were mostly those diehards whose compulsion to play basketball is somehow suspicious basketball junkie there s a phrase you do n't hear much anymore it s a bit morbid , but there is some truth to the formulation i played a few games and then , after nearly everyone had gone home , i lingered to shoot around in the strangely early dusk the trance of the court , into which i had fallen so happily all summer long , was broken i saw from the inside how the place must look from beyond the chainlink fence that surrounds it a wide swatch of asphalt in the middle of the city , with dented hoops , a playground at one end , a softball diamond at the other , the whole thing populated by dog walkers , bench sitters , kids , parents , some derelict types and guys in baggy shorts playing basketball , all in a space officially known as john seravalli park just then the person i have come to call the crazy lady approached me , with an unusual expression on her face will you take one of these \? she said , handing me a flier it s really important the crazy lady , whose name , i later learned , is lana , was not , in fact , crazy she was just very brave , but the two qualities sometimes blur i started thinking of her as the crazy lady when i arrived at the court one afternoon and found her at the center of a mob of basketball players , defending her kids and their friends against what are normally understood to be the laws of playground the issue , as is so often the case , was real estate there is a point in the afternoon when a critical mass of players have arrived , and the halfcourt games move over to the full court lana s kids were shooting on the fullcourt basket when they were suddenly overrun by the players , all of them itchy to get their hands on the ball lana has frizzy gray hair , wears sandals and jeans , and smokes cigarettes her face often registers a what in god s name is next \? expression that i associate with city parents the day of the turf war i arrived to find her standing in the middle of the full court , a cigarette in one hand , a cellphone in the other and , like gandhi , refusing to move words were exchanged voices were raised finally , a halfcourt basket was secured for the kids and , like refugees given a new homeland , they were ushered to their basket before lana yielded the full court to the mob this autumn day , however , she approached me with a stack of fliers in her arm and an odd look on her face according to the flier , the parks department was considering a proposal to tear up the playground , resurface it with artificial turf and turn it into a private softball field the nearby xavier high school would help pay for the renovation the gates would be padlocked , the ground green , and there would be soccer practice by day and little league games by night who could argue with that \? quite a few people , apparently but the tenor of the flier , and the fact that a community board meeting had been arranged to discuss the proposal , suggested that , unknown to us , wheels had been turning for some time all summer we had been involved in the drama of our playground while , just like a horror movie , a huge monster was almost upon us now it s spring on the first nice day i went down to the court there was a game in progress at each of the three halfcourts , and a crowd of people waiting to play arriving at a basketball court is a seemingly casual thing , but who actually gets to play is determined by a number of byzantine rituals involving such things as how well known you are to the regulars , how well respected your game is , how you look , what color you are \( and there are a very wide range of colors \) , how you dress , walk , talk but these rules are not written down they are implicit they incorporate the rules that pertain to the world outside the playground the rules enforced by the police , for example but there are variations , additions and deletions , and no one on hand with a clipboard and a whistle to enforce them this is not gym one of the more important rules is that , in certain circumstances , there are no rules that first day , everyone was in an unusually friendly mood i slapped people five vague communications were made , along the lines of , how you been \? , answered by various words and noises that equated with good i saw a guy i recognized go by on a bike , a fiercely quick , whippetthin kid the color of turkish coffee whom i have privately nicknamed the assassin , in part because he is so lethal on offense and in part because he usually wears the expression of someone who is prepared to kill you most basketball players exist in a state of mild irritation , like magicians who cannot get a certain trick to go just right street ball elevates this irritation to a style , and a lot of people on the court sport a homeboy version of the travis bickle line you talkin' to me \? as though they are just waiting for someone to tick them off you been playin' ball this winter \? someone asked the guy on the bike yeah , he replied in a way
washington , feb 12 responding to sharp bipartisan criticism from lawmakers today about the independence of the board investigating the columbia space shuttle disaster , nasa rewrote the board s charter tonight in ways it said would ensure that the panel was free from the influence of the space agency the changes remove any requirement , real or perceived , for the board to coordinate or await approval from nasa for any dimension of the board s investigation , the nasa administrator , sean o'keefe , said tonight it was not clear , however , whether the revised charter addressed all of the concerns expressed by lawmakers today at the first hearing into the shuttle disaster members of the house and senate told mr o'keefe then that they had reservations that the board would be allowed to conduct a sufficiently credible inquiry in the new charter , for example , task force team members are still to be approved by nasa officials leaving unchanged a major provision that some lawmakers had objected to nasa s action tonight followed a fourhour hearing in which the republican who is chairman of the house panel that oversees the space program told mr o'keefe that the investigative board lacked the independence and latitude needed to conduct an appropriate inquiry those pointed comments , by representative sherwood boehlert of new york , the chairman of the house science committee , were echoed by some other lawmakers at the hearing their remarks show that lawmakers in both parties have become increasingly concerned that the board , set up by nasa to investigate the disaster , remains too closely tied to the space agency to conduct a credible inquiry the comments were intended to pressure nasa into making sweeping changes to eliminate the possibility that the board s findings would be called into question by critics who might say the board was subject to influence by some of the same nasa officials whose own performances could be the target of the investigation mr boehlert had complained that under the inquiry board s original charter , it makes it look like if they want to do something that s not part of the policy manual of nasa , they 've got to march over to nasa headquarters and get approval representative bart gordon of tennessee , the ranking democrat on the house space subcommittee , bluntly told mr o'keefe , i'm afraid this wo n't pass anybody s smell test of independence one week ago , in response to pressure from lawmakers , nasa officials agreed to transfer authority over the investigation to the board itself , which is led by adm harold w gehman jr but after examining the changes made by nasa , lawmakers said they still believed that the board s credibility would suffer because the panel is composed mostly of military and government officials , because it is still required to clear certain activities through nasa and because it is staffed by agency employees lawmakers have demanded several changes , like lengthening the time the board has to complete its inquiry allowing the board to hire anyone it wants without review by nasa officials allowing the board to conduct its activities without being subject to nasa s own policies and procedures and broadening the board to include leading academics and engineers from outside government , as well as people with financial expertise who can dissect nasa s budget the new charter deletes any reference to a time period for the panel to complete its work and provides for public release of board s report as soon as it is completed mr o'keefe also said tonight that it was his understanding that members would be added to the board to expand the external expertise after the hearing , mr o'keefe offered diplomatic but circumspect comments about the changes requested by the lawmakers , which he termed important feedback the demands , he added , were a very thoughtful and i think earnest request and observation from several members here that i intend to take very seriously mr gordon , who has led democratic calls for a more independent investigation , expressed frustration after the hearing that the matter had not been resolved , even though it had been 11 days since the columbia disaster mr o'keefe agreed to do the same thing he has numerous times before , which is to take everything under consideration , mr gordon said , despite the fact that democrats and republicans all have made it very clear that it was imperative to have a truly independent commission so that it could be credible mr gordon repeated his calls for the white house to appoint its own commission , just as president ronald reagan did after the 1986 challenger explosion there s a continuing reticence of officials to take the nasa hammer or sword from above the neck of this investigative commission , he said mr o'keefe was the sole witness at today s hearing , which was put on by the house science committee and the senate commerce committee both panels will have more hearings this year examining the causes of the columbia disaster as well as the costs , safety and goals of the nation s space program in his testimony , mr o'keefe suggested it was unlikely that budget cuts which some lawmakers say drained money away from the shuttle program played a role in the disaster he said instead that trends in the program s safety record had shown improvements in recent years in spite of costcutting there were also improvements in the safety margins , he said based on what nasa officials have learned , mr o'keefe said , it does not appear any systemic failure occurred on the columbia we had no indications that would suggest a compromise to flight safety during the 16day mission , he said senator olympia j snowe , republican of maine , asked why a request was not made to use military telescopes to examine the shuttle for any tile damage after film captured a piece of foam insulation from the shuttle s external fuel tank striking the columbia shortly after liftoff mr o'keefe responded that there have been incidents like this before and that it had been determined in previous cases of comparable circumstance not to have been a safetyofflight consideration the circumstances here were it came off of the external tank as the entire shuttle orbiter system was traveling at 3 , 600 miles an hour , mr o'keefe said the piece came off , dropped roughly 40 feet at a rate of something like 50 miles an hour which he described as the equivalent of a styrofoam cooler blowing off of a pickup truck ahead of you on a highway every incident we 'd seen before that , every model we ran , every analysis that had been done on every prior case demonstrated no significant damage in that circumstance , he said of the 4 , 000 sensors aboard the shuttle orbiter , none of them indicated any anomalies during that 16day flight , he said noting that the columbia experienced swings in temperature of several hundred degrees during the day as it flew in and out of the sun s glare , mr o'keefe added , if there was any penetration , any damage that could have been evident , the assumption was those sensors would have picked it up

newark , feb 8 it was just after 11 pm at the cave lounge , a lively neighborhood bar on the south edge of downtown newark the older crowd was beginning to filter out , handing the evening over to younger patrons already beginning to dance , play pool , and sip cocktails the bartender , sonya fortenberry , 36 , had just slid a hennessy and water to her friend teresa holder when the man with the hooded sweatshirt and the assault rifle appeared in the doorway ms fortenberry was laughing with ms holder when the man opened fire i just remember a lot of screaming and blood and bullets everywhere , said ms fortenberry , who was not seriously wounded despite having been shot three times everything got hit people , dishes , glasses , the walls he did n't even step all the way in the door all you really saw was the gun ms holder , believed to be in her 30 s , who lived in newark and was a mother of five , was killed , as were two men identified by the police as edward byers , 35 , of newark , and abdul malik muhammad , 37 , of piscataway newark detectives were still searching last night for the gunman , who also wounded three people , including ms fortenberry and this lowincome , tightknit community was still trying to understand how this warm neighborhood spot could be subjected to such violence the two most seriously wounded patrons , a man and a woman whose names were not released , remained in critical condition at university hospital in newark , the police said about 25 people were in the bar at the time of the shooting , said lt derek glenn , a spokesman for the newark police department but neither the police nor witnesses could offer a clue about the killer s motive , if he had one the bar is in the ground floor of an aging threestory building on halsey street , a hardscrabble block lined with auto body shops and oncemajestic buildings that have long since been vacant and boarded up yesterday , the block was cordoned off with yellow police tape a longstanding oldtimers' hangout , the cave , with its cozy feel , pool table and small dance floor , had become popular lately as a weekend latenight spot with the younger local crowd neighbors said that the bar had occasional minor fights , but no real violence or other problems still , the establishment had hired uniformed security guards as weekend bouncers , from 11 pm on they patted down patrons only if they were strangers , said ms fortenberry , adding that the guards had not yet taken their usual spots at the door when the gunman appeared this was a family bar where everybody knew everybody , said john hayes , 36 , a construction worker from newark who was in the bar friday night mr hayes described the cave as a place where patrons favored hennessy cognac , hiphop music and heated matches of pool eight people stood around the pool table just before the gunmen appeared , mr hayes said , and a dj had just begun spinning dance records the cave was like family , he said yesterday , standing in his 11thfloor apartment a block away he stared past his high school basketball trophies and down toward the bar , where police cars stood guard witnesses described the gunman s weapon as an automatic rifle most people say it was an ak47 , said mr hayes , who added that he had been a regular at the cave since he had a job cleaning it as a teenager and people in this neighborhood know their guns that is precisely the problem with the area , said thomas ellis , president of enough is enough , a local anticrime community group for much of the day , mr ellis was the only person standing in the cold outside the bar you have six people shot , three of them killed , in a poor black neighborhood , he said if this happened most other places , you 'd have a sea of news cameras and people but , here , nobody cares not even the community on friday night , ms fortenberry said , the shots probably lasted about 10 or 15 seconds , but it seemed like forever she dropped behind the bar and did not realize for five minutes that she had been shot , she said , adding i thought i got cut by the broken glass , plus i was in shock she was trapped behind the bar by the bulletriddled bodies of mr muhammad and mr byers , known at the cave as big cat ms fortenberry , who also works as a medical assistant , took the men s pulses malik had none , but big cat had a faint pulse , she said , sobbing lightly i was like , 'big cat , it s me , baby , ' because i used to go out with him ms fortenberry was hospitalized overnight and released leaning on a crutch yesterday and staring at the shuttered bar , she said that friends had persuaded her last year to leave another bartending job to take the position at the cave they said i 'd be much safer at the cave , she said , because it s a family bar
two years ago in may , not long after laying eyes on a yearling sired by unbridled and out of the mare toussaud , bobby frankel proclaimed he had finally found his kentucky derby winner and could not wait until 2003 two days ago at aqueduct , after riding that nearly grownup colt to a halflength victory in the wood memorial , jerry bailey offered his conviction that empire maker was a threat to capture the triple crown considering that the colt was among 37 , 587 horses foaled in north america in 2000 and that there has not been a triple crown winner since 1978 , that is some serious prognostication from a hall of fame trainer and a hall of fame jockey maybe they are just projecting their own desires to fill holes on what most consider to be holeless r sum s frankel has won the eclipse award as the nation s outstanding trainer the past three years and has won nearly every major stakes race except , of course , the one that matters most the kentucky derby bailey has won the derby twice and has taken home the eclipse award as the nation s outstanding jockey in six of the past eight years about all he has left to accomplish is riding a 3yearold into the history books as the 12th triple crown winner or maybe empire maker is just that gifted and might be just as fortunate as , well , affirmed in 1978 , the last horse to sweep the derby and the preakness and belmont stakes empire maker was indeed smashing last month in an effortless nineandthreequarterlength victory in the florida derby , but his victory in the wood on saturday was even more impressive because it came at what amounted to half speed frankel had not pushed empire maker on the training track leading up to the race , and bailey sat upon him as unobtrusively as a hood ornament for the entire mileandaneighth route when empire maker passed funny cide in the stretch and appeared to daydream a bit , bailey never flinched , even as funny cide and jose santos came at them he always has a tendency to get distracted , bailey said if i hit him , he would have gotten back into it , but i let him goof off a little bit if i had really gotten into him and we would have won by more , it would have defeated the purpose of saving something for the kentucky derby as vital as having a good horse and a great plan are at this time of year , the blanket of roses does not land on a horse s back without a great deal of luck empire maker has had it more precisely , his contemporaries have been victimized by bad luck last year s 2yearold champion , vindication , was injured before making his 3yearold debut another undefeated 2yearold , sky mesa , is hobbled and off the triple crown trail and on saturday , badge of silver , a colt that had won three of four lifetime starts , was scratched from the blue grass stakes after a hairline fracture of the cannon bone was discovered in his right front leg still , there are likely to be 19 other horses in the starting gate at churchill downs on may 3 , but none have displayed the speed and class of empire maker his luck has extended to his trainer the derby s likely second choice , peace rules , winner of the blue grass on saturday , resides in frankel s barn as well so what can keep frankel from his first derby victory and bailey from taking his first step toward a crowning career achievement \? everything in the next 19 days , empire maker could crack a hoof , sprain an ankle or sustain a cut from a protruding nail in his stall the noise and spectacle of more than 150 , 000 fans could spook him on derby day he could detest the surface the way point given , another overwhelming favorite , did in 2001 , and finish out of the money empire maker could get stuck in traffic in an unwieldy field or hit the churchill downs stretch and discover that a mile and a quarter is just too far to sustain peak speed challengers like brancusi , ten most wanted or even funny cide could blossom at the right time and run the race of their lives as enthralling as the countdown to the derby is to horseplayers , it will be harrowing to frankel and bailey frankel grew up in brooklyn playing the ponies and knows better than most that horse racing is a game of odds in the past 23 years , only two favorites have won the derby spectacular bid in 1979 and fusaichi pegasus in 2000 and what are the odds that frankel was right two years ago in may when he saw a kentucky derby winner in empire maker when everyone else just saw an unnamed yearling frolicking in a pasture \?

a new global treaty that imposes restrictions on exports of genetically modified seeds , animals and crops is set to take effect , injecting a new element into already heated international disputes over agricultural biotechnology the treaty , known as the cartagena protocol on biosafety , was agreed upon by more than 130 nations in january 2000 but could not take effect until formally ratified by 50 nations the 50th , palau , just gave its endorsement , so the protocol will go into effect in 90 days , on sept 11 , the united nations environment program said yesterday the treaty allows countries to bar imports of genetically engineered seeds , microbes , animals or crops that they deem a threat to their environments it also requires international shipments of genetically engineered grains to be labeled the united states reluctantly agreed to the treaty in 2000 after intense negotiations pitting it and a handful of other cropexporting nations against everyone else while washington has not ratified the protocol , american exporters to countries that are parties to the agreement will have to abide by the rules , a senior state department official said this official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said the effect of the treaty would depend on the rules for carrying it out , which have not been written yet he and others said that many countries were already putting into place their own rules regulating imports or requiring labeling of genetically modified products , making the treaty less significant than it otherwise might have been the united states recently filed suit at the world trade organization challenging the european union s de facto moratorium on approval of new genetically modified crops , arguing it is not based on sound science the new treaty contains language that could bolster europe s case , at least morally it allows countries to bar imports of genetically modified products even if there is not enough information to prove scientifically that the products are dangerous recognizing a potential conflict with wto rules , the framers of the biosafety treaty were careful to state that it neither supersedes nor is subordinate to other agreements l val giddings , vice president for food and agriculture of the biotechnology industry organization , a trade group , said the new treaty would have little effect over all and none on washington s case against europe there s no way you can possibly read it or construe it that would allow a trumping of wto obligations , he said kristin dawkins , vice president of the institute for agriculture and trade policy , a nonprofit group in minneapolis that opposes genetically modified foods , said the treaty bolstered opponents of biotechnology because it establishes that genetically modified foods should be treated differently from other foods
baghdad , iraq , dec 30 a month after american troops occupied baghdad , the family of dr taki almoosawi was gathered at his baghdad home , watching one of the arab satellite channels that have become popular since the toppling of saddam hussein made it possible for any iraqi , not just the ruling clique , to have satellite receivers and suddenly there it was old film clips of executions looted from the archives of the general security directorate , the most powerful of mr hussein s secret police agencies there , too , in the last terrifying moments before he was blown apart by a grenade his executioners had taped onto his chest , was the nephew who had disappeared without trace more than 18 years before , mehdi salih almoosawi when the secret police came for him and other males in the family in december 1984 , mehdi was a quiet 22yearold student at a baghdad technical college , a karate champion just back from service as an infantryman in the iraniraq war , the father of two infant children he was accused , along with dr moosawi , of planting bombs in karamanah square in baghdad , though dr moosawi says that the charge was false and that the real offense was speaking , among friends , in ways that were critical of mr hussein in all the years since mehdi s arrest , there had been no rest in the search for his nephew by dr moosawi , a britishtrained physiologist the doctor himself was released after several months , on the intervention of an acquaintance who was a cousin of mr hussein , but he was haunted , he says now , by the anguish of having left mehdi in the dungeons of the secret police headquarters in central baghdad when he saw the tape on al jazeera , an arab station that has frequently been criticized for whitewashing mr hussein s rule , dr moosawi said , he was overcome with anger and disgust , as well as shame that it had been mehdi who died , not him he also felt at that moment , he said , that any price iraqis paid for the overthrow of mr hussein , including the ravages of the american invasion , had been worth it in my own mind , i was already dead from the moment that mehdi disappeared , he said i wished only that it could have been me , sitting there in the desert only later on , when i remembered that the americans had come here to end this terror , did i begin to think , well , we were all dead , but we have been resurrected , we have been born again what happened to mehdi , and what became of his family as they balanced their quest for him with a relentless theater of fealty to mr hussein , is a grim and grimly familiar parable of the terror inflicted on 25 million iraqis during the 24 years of mr hussein s rule the critical view the family now takes of the americanled occupation may also hold clues for the united states as it confronts a brutal insurgency and grapples for some formula that will bring american troops home they did a very good job for america and for iraq in getting rid of saddam , and we thank them , dr moosawi said now , they are young boys lost in a foreign country , and every day there is a bomb in the road they live a terrible time so please tell them , we would like that they would leave our country as soon as possible , as soon as they have arranged a stable government to replace saddam dr moosawi embodies much of what america has brought to iraq on the instruction of american officials , all 63 of iraq s universities and technical colleges held elections this summer for presidents , vice presidents and deans dr moosawi , once a pariah among his colleagues because of the taint he bore from his brush with the secret police , is now vice president of mustansiriya university , a proud if dilapidated institution in baghdad that was founded by one of the ruling caliphs of the islamic world in the 13th century through all the years of the search for mehdi , the family s hopes had been sustained by contacts with a senior officer in the mukhabarat , one of the prime agencies in mr hussein s constellation of secret police agencies , which exacted money from the family , saying it would buy food , clothes and medicine for mehdi in an undisclosed prison it was a deceit of a kind that became common as mr hussein s government came ever more to resemble an entrenched mafia whose brutality and greed metamorphosed into unrelenting terror the moosawis suffered as grievously as any other from that murderous terror , dr moosawi said , listing 9 members of the extended family who were executed under mr hussein , and 30 others who are still missing , presumed dead , after being taken away by the dictator s enforcers yet nothing had prepared the family for seeing the horror of mehdi s end in the secret police film , which is available on a compact disk that sells on handcarts in bazaars all over iraq dr moosawi , 50 , hands copies of the cd to visitors to his university office , although he says he and most other members of the family , including mehdi s father , salih , and his mother , zeineb , have never been able to watch through to the film s dismal end
under almost any other circumstances , harold j nolan might have rallied local conservationists as soon he got wind of a neighbor s plans for a new development in his rural corner of the jersey shore the plan , as first proposed last spring , would have allowed mr nolan s neighbor to carve up his 65acre property in the bucolic navesink section of middletown township into a halfdozen lots for new homes for many in this upscale community , especially those drawn to navesink by its open spaces , dense woodland and pockets of pristine nature , the plan bordered on sacrilege still , mr nolan and a handful of other residents thought it seemed pointless to ring up the local conservation foundation for this simple reason the neighbor who was planning the development was a trustee with the foundation , and had recently been commended for his efforts on behalf of the environment and the neighbor just was n't any neighbor he was max weinberg , the longtime drummer for bruce springsteen and the e street band and the leader of his own group , the max weinberg 7 , and the music director on late night with conan o'brien mr weinberg s presence adds a touch of celebrity to a kind of zoning dispute that has become all too common across a region where the ecoconscious sometimes find themselves trying to cling to dwindling unspoiled land in the face of unexpected opposition their own neighbors legally , he s within his rights , but to me it s an ethical question , said mr nolan , 56 , a thirdgeneration middletowner and a professor at georgian court college some people might say it s selfish on the part of his neighbors , but it goes beyond the neighborhood to the town , which is losing all its open spaces areas that do n't need to be developed are being developed mr weinberg s telephone number is unlisted , and several telephone calls to his lawyer , michael b steib , were not returned like mr nolan , other residents of mr weinberg s navesink neighborhood conceded that the drummer could certainly march to his own beat it is , after all , his property still , they said that by floating the subdivision proposal , mr weinberg violated a tacit compact with his fellow residents in the opinion of some of us , we 've been betrayed , said richard b scudder , the chairman of the newspaper company medianews , who has lived in navesink for more than a halfcentury we 're conservationists this is a community that believes in preserving the serenity of nature and the way of life he seems to be a pretty relentless opponent of the kind of standards that we 've tried to have here not only that , but some find more than a bit of hypocrisy in mr weinberg s conservationist stance and the development plans i certainly find it ironic that he has won a conservation award a year ago and is a trustee on the conservation board and yet has applied to develop land on his property , said another neighbor , kristen breitweiser town officials , while aware of the dispute , said that none of the objections of mr weinberg s neighbors were enough earlier this year to keep the planning board from approving his application to subdivide his property usually you have people saying , 'i'm afraid i'm going to get flooded' or 'i'm worried about traffic , ' middletown s planning director , anthony p mercantante , said , reeling off common complaints against applications for projects like mr weinberg s here , none of that materialized he said he did not think mr weinberg s plan would seriously affect navesink s environment the original concept has been scaled back by half and now involves only three homes over 30 acres but mr mercantante said he could relate to the dismay of some residents people are used to the area the way it is , and they do n't want to see it change , he said that s understandable mr mercantante said there is no formal timetable to begin clearing trees or building the three homes he also noted that planned zoning changes in the area and routine extensions of building approvals may mean that nothing is built for years it may be that he never develops the land , he said no matter how the dispute between the drummerturneddeveloper and his natureloving neighbors is resolved , it may serve as further evidence to support the expression , you ca n't pick your neighbors but , mr mercantante said , i think some people wish they could
east rutherford , nj , dec 1 some football players never learn to pace themselves , to take it easy for one play or one series or even to sit out a game to let an injury heal their patron saint could well be steve mcnair , the quarterback whose tennessee titans suffered an unexpected 2417 loss to the jets on monday night never mind that his team is now 93 never mind that the titans face a key game next sunday in nashville against their main division rivals , the indianapolis colts \( also 93 \) with or without mcnair , the titans figured to handle the jets logic dictated that mcnair rest the right calf muscle he strained a week ago against the atlanta falcons mcnair , a 30yearold , ninthyear pro , would have none of that with a lift under the right heel to ease the strain , he played the entire game and before it was three minutes old , he and justin mccareins had combined on a 59yard touchdown play the pass sailed 65 yards and mccareins caught it in stride mcnair looked healthy enough mcnair threw another touchdown pass , for 8 yards to derrick mason with 1 minute 52 seconds left in the game those touchdowns aside , this was not one of mcnair s best performances with his dangerous running ability compromised by his injury , he passed up opportunities to run a quarterback draw for a touchdown and others for first downs in all , he completed 21 of 35 passes for 272 yards and 2 touchdowns , with 2 interceptions and 3 sacks still , in one sense , mcnair was a winner coaches often decide that if a player cannot practice , he should not play , but that seldom applies to superstars mcnair did not practice all week but he was at the titans' practice facility by 6 am every day , and when he was not sitting in at a player meeting or watching practice , he was getting treatment for his injury when he left at 7 pm , he took home an electrical stimulator to tone the injured muscle and a coldcompress unit to keep the swelling down when mcnair arrived at giants stadium on monday night , he did not know if he could play the titans had listed him as questionable , meaning his chances were 5050 at 6 o'clock , he walked onto the field and started warming up with coaches watching , he dropped back he rolled out he threw passes to an equipment man the entire warmup took 10 or 15 minutes then mcnair returned to the locker room and the decision was made mcnair felt he could play at 7 30 pm , an hour and a half before game time , the titans announced their final mandatory roster scratches mcnair had passed the night s first test we weighed heavily the chance for an injury down the stretch , titans coach jeff fisher said after the game the lack of practice was not new to mcnair last year , after a rib injury , he played the last five games of the season without a day of practice his presence then , as now , was all important to the titans , who have become one of the nfl s elite teams mcnair is their undisputed leader the titans might become ordinary without him because his backup , billy volek , although a fourthyear pro , has limited experience volek s chief claim to fame is that he preceded david carr as fresno state s quarterback volek , like mcnair , is fearless and aggressive and has a strong arm he won the backup job in training camp from neil o 'donnell , who had held it for four years last weekend , when mcnair was injured midway through the second quarter , volek took over and helped the titans turn a 2114 deficit into a 3831 victory volek has far to go to reach mcnair s level mcnair started this game with a quarterback rating of 1063 , the best in the nfl this season , with 18 touchdown passes and 4 interceptions he had 2 , 440 yards passing and 114 yards and 3 touchdowns rushing at 6 feet 2 inches and 229 pounds , mcnair has the strength and the ability to carry the ball he is one of five nfl quarterbacks with career totals of at least 19 , 000 yards passing and 3 , 000 yards rushing \( the first four were fran tarkenton , john elway , randall cunningham and steve young \) more than a halfhour after the game , mcnair was still getting treatment from the trainer fisher indicated that his quarterback had survived the game his calf is a little tight , the coach said , but we expect him to be ok and play next week

the god of before the time when god came to seem omniscient and omnipresent and the world came to seem a single thing in which he could always be imagined as present but from which he would always be experienced as absent god imagined and experienced in this way is the god of the later books of the hebrew bible as well as of the new testament and he remains , by and large , the standard god of our culture but a distinctly different god is discerned , kugel says , in presumably early biblical passages in which human beings by turns imagine god as absent so truly absent that he needs to be informed of what has gone on while he was away and experience him as present , so truly present that he can be seen and touched as easily as the man he typically appears to be in such moments these are the demonstration passages for the god of old , a deity who , hologrammatically as it were , can be invisible one moment and visible the next , depending on your angle of inspection now you do n't see him , now you do kugel , the starr professor of hebrew literature at harvard university , is the author of a prodigiously learned book several times as long as the god of old , published in 1997 under the title the bible as it was that title stood in audible contrast to the bible as it is namely , the bible as experienced in the usual straightforward modern way without the padding , embroidery or adornment of its supplementary legends and ancillary texts there are a great many of these , an entire literature of which , in that book , kugel showed himself magisterially in control kugel s god of old is not the god of kugel s bible as it was the period that concerned kugel in the earlier book lasted from about 200 bc to ad 200 god as he was worshiped then was the normative god for that book in a strange way , he remains normative in this new book as well , yet the author is determined to explore early deviations from what would later become the theological norm the seven short chapters in this book put me in mind of another short , deeply learned but utterly accessible book of seven chapters , jorge luis borges s seven nights true , the last 50 pages of kugel s book consist of bibliographical and other notes , which are a proof of his erudition and a resource for professional students of the bible yet the lectures themselves are as clear as water , explaining themselves effortlessly as they go even the word mesopotamia is glossed on the spot , lest any child be left behind in these discussions , for all their conversational tone , kugel subtly directs the reader s attention from picture to frame , from assertion to assumption , from text to subtext the object of my inquiry , he writes , seems to be considerably more elusive , and thinner , than the usual stuff of scholarship it is certainly something that resists being rolled into a ball and summarized in a few sentences kugel refers to the object of his inquiry a bit conspiratorially as the project yet even a reader put off by the capital letter senses that the author is up to something rolling the project into a ball and summarizing it as a reviewer rudely must , i would call it an attempt to participate vicariously in the earliest imaginings of god as these can be glimpsed in the least selfconscious , most takenforgranted assumptions of , mainly , the first seven books of the bible i began this review with a line from paul luard because what kugel collects here is the fragmentary record of an aesthetic breakthrough a snap , an epiphany , a perceptual transformation of the ordinary into the extraordinary now you do n't see it , now you do if you do the record of such moments , kugel writes , can be fitted together , if at all , only tentatively , and by the most active effort of theological imagining true enough to recover theological imaginings , one must be theologically imaginative whether the god imagined in the oldest imaginings that the bible has preserved for us to read is preferable to god as he was later imagined is itself a matter for either aesthetic judgment or theological preference or some blend of both early is not necessarily better than late moreover , in one controverted biblical case after another , early is not even necessarily early the dating of texts is a nightmare from which biblical history will never awake still , whether or not kugel s early pudding is religiously more nourishing than the late alternative , it provides considerable pleasure in the eating let me offer three linked examples
when the freeagency courting period officially began at 12 01 am on july 1 , there was no one pushing harder than mark cuban , the owner of the dallas mavericks he was already in miami , about to drop a 22 million offer on the table for alonzo mourning , an aggressive statement to a player who missed the 20023 season mourning nearly bit last week , he put his chances of being a maverick at 80 percent cuban was also courting jason kidd , trying to arrange a visit and pushing for a signandtrade deal but with the official signing date still three days away , the mavs have been shut out they are not alone dallas and san antonio were among the most vigorous suitors in the freeagent market each felt it was one piece away from being the elite team in the league while the los angeles lakers reshaped their roster and took the mantle of the hunted team in the west , the nets upped the ante in the eastern conference everyone else was left to scramble to plan b i think , like anything in life , that you have your 'a' scenarios all the way through z , donn nelson , the mavericks' president of basketball operations , said you hope that you can come away with the topflight free agents , but i do n't think you can get down or depressed when things do n't go your way he added , the rule is , expect the unexpected the unexpected has arrived while setting priorities , some veteran players are putting a good chance to win a title ahead of the additional millions of dollars that the lesser lights of the nba are flashing denver , with 18 million in salarycap space , and utah , with about 20 million , have watched as kidd returned to the nets and took mourning , formerly of the miami heat , with him as gary payton and karl malone committed to the lakers for sums far below what the market could have held and as jermaine o'neal and p j brown elected to stay in indiana and new orleans if you want to compete in the new nba , the lakers set the standard last week the nets are the only team so far that can claim it is in the chase odds are , the lakers are going to be 757 , one nba coach said the only games they lose will be because they did n't care i would doubt they 'd lose a playoff game i did n't lose any championship aspirations from my team because , looking at the top , i did n't have any the spurs , who were in the enviable position of having about 16 million in cap room , being the defending champions and having a likable superstar in tim duncan as a recruiter , had their most desired targets pass them by now general manager r c buford is left to consider his own plan b , and trying to soothe the ego of his young point guard , tony parker , who was none too pleased with the recruitment of kidd to play his position at the end of every season there are changes that are made that impact people that are important to you , buford said you hope that those relationships are strong enough that they stand the test of time the spurs may still be the favored choice of the remaining free agents , but they can consider standing pat for a year and pursuing kevin garnett or kobe bryant , who will be free agents next year this summer s next tier of free agents is full of potential , but does not boast veteran credentials centers michael olowokandi , brad miller and rasho nesterovic are next in line , but none have come close to accomplishing what mourning has among point guards , gilbert arenas , andre miller , speedy claxton and kenny anderson are still available clippers power forward elton brand is a restricted free agent , and the team seems set on keeping him in some respects , nelson said , it could work out where the bestcase scenario is not the first scenario you project try telling that to miami , which lost mourning because he wanted to win it has 11 million to spend and nobody to give it to try telling that to the knicks , who used to rule the spending session but are left to pick over leftovers with a 49 million midlevel salarycap exception i think what happens is , players get to a certain point in their career and have financial security , said mark bartelstein , the agent for brown and miller so where you 're playing , who you 're playing with , becomes very important the heat s coach and president , pat riley , said mourning left in pursuit of something that we were n't able to do in miami , which is to win a championship he added i cannot give him what he needs we have to rebuild this franchise here and that is hard these days for all but the lucky few photo mark cuban and the dallas mavericks lost out on jason kidd and alonzo mourning \( associated press \)
longfeng , china the redandwhite banners with the latest government propaganda fluttered above the grimy main street , warning farmers at an outdoor market about a substance that might not spring to mind as a dire menace rat poison yet the chinese government regards the most lethal form of the poison , called dushuqiang , very seriously since oct 1 , anyone convicted of making , storing or selling the poison faces a prison sentence or even death government agents have raided illegal stocks and urged residents to hand over any private stashes stamp out dushuqiang , the tumor threatening people s lives , declared one of the banners another banner prodded , if there is dushuqiang at home , please hand it over and you will rest assured all the government interest raises the obvious question why \? the answer is that in a country where private gun ownership is prohibited and where serious violent crime is considered rare , dushuqiang has become a murder weapon in a highprofile case on oct 21 in this mountainous region of hubei province in central china , officials say a woman killed 10 guests at her husband s funeral banquet by sprinkling poison on the food nor are such attacks particularly unusual the world health organization lists poisoning , accidental or intentional , as one of the top 10 causes of death for chinese ages 5 to 29 one chinese web site , sinacom , has already reported a possible copycat poisoning in which funeral guests were sickened but not killed the authorities also reported a poisoning on oct 23 in shaanxi province in which 16 people were hospitalized , they said , after a jealous barbecuestand operator poisoned the food at a barbecue stand that was outselling him several times a year , the chinese news is filled with tales of restaurant owners poisoning the food in rival restaurants , or of teachers poisoning students , or , as happened a few years ago , of a zookeeper poisoning animals to spite his boss the worst case happened last year when 49 people , many of them children , were killed in an intentional poisoning hypertoxic rat poisons have become a tool for criminals , a massive threat to public health and safety , warned a recent report in the statecontrolled china work safety news the motives for the deliberate poisonings , many of which occur in rural areas , are often the same sorts of grudges , feuds and animus that lead to killings everywhere with other weapons in short supply , the poison is popular for those who want to kill , though officials say most of the poisonings , fatal and otherwise , are accidental many rural people are unaware of the poison s extreme lethality still , some analysts believe that the attacks offer a window into the frustrations felt by some rural chinese whose lives are remote from courts and other legal means of settling disputes in rural areas when conflicts happen , there is no way to solve them , said ming xia , an associate professor at city university of new york who studies crime in china most likely , the local leaders will be arbitrary in solving the conflicts they do not give it justice statistics are often unreliable in china , but various reports in the state news media suggest that there are about 100 , 000 serious food poisoning cases a year , both lethal and otherwise , with up to 70 percent caused by rat poisons or pesticides dushuqiang is so lethal that the government first banned it more than a decade ago , though apparently with little effect it contains tetramine , a chemical that attacks the nervous system the demand for effective rat poison remains great because china , with 13 billion people , also probably has billions of rats mr xia said that under mao , the government regularly sponsored and coordinated nationwide rat extermination campaigns , but that such efforts were now far less sweeping like the recent government program to train 10 siberian foxes to hunt rats that are destroying crops and woodlands in northwest china guo yongwang , a ministry of agriculture official , said the government began cracking down on illegal rat poison in april only to have the program interrupted by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars still , officials say they have already seized more than 105 tons of illegal poisons , mixing materials , bottles and containers the efforts have been quite effective , mr guo said you wo n't be able to find dushuqiang and other highly lethal rat poisons in the market , although there still might be some illegal peddlers selling them secretly here in longfeng , a town along the mountainous trucking route that runs through the western section of hubei province , the outdoor market has stalls selling fresh produce , tofu , sides of beef , spices and glass containers filled with fish until the recent crackdown after the funeral poisonings , the market also apparently had peddlers selling banned rat poisons one clerk in a hardware store beside the market said that the number of peddlers had declined in recent years but that the poison could still be found he said he bought a small supply a few years ago people are still selling it , a woman selling cabbage said farther west , in the city of lichuan , officials have handed out leaflets warning people to turn over dushuqiang by nov 25 or face fines and possible prison time if they are caught with it the lichuan police , who led the investigation into the funeral poisonings , refused to discuss the case or provide any details but reports in various staterun newspapers say the confessed murderer , chen xiaomei , had been estranged from her husband and her oldest son when her husband died , mrs chen was reported to have sprinkled the poison on the food at the traditional funeral meal she told officials she had wanted only to sicken her family members so that they would need to ask for her help in paying for medical treatment instead , the poison killed 10 guests , including members of mrs chen s family then , little more than a week later , a similar poisoning occurred in zaoyang , also in hubei province initial reports said 34 people had been poisoned , though none fatally other recent cases include that of an anhui province villager poisoned by his wife a chain of poisonings in jiangxi province that left 7 people dead and a factory in guangzhou where more than 200 workers were poisoned news of the funeral poisonings has already spread in the most isolated farming areas here in hubei tian shigui , 45 , lives in a small house along the trucking route and raises corn she spends much of every day slowly working through the piles of corn , picking off the dry kernels either for making cornmeal or for feeding her pigs she said that she knew people who used illegal poisons but that she considered them too risky , even though her corn makes a tempting target for rats it s not safe , she said it would hurt my pigs so she has resorted to another timetested solution a cat photo chinese rescue workers tried to aid a man sickened by food spiked with rat poison in tangshan , a town in jiangsu province , in september 2002 a total of 49 people , many of them children , were killed in the incident the owner of a snack shop said he poisoned the food served at a rival s shop \( photo by associated press \) map of china

almost anything is possible when the yankees talk trades because they have the most money and the most pressure to win george steinbrenner , their principal owner , demands a championship every season , and he gathered his top executives yesterday in tampa , fla , to fix whatever might be wrong with his firstplace team a person familiar with the meetings said the yankees were pursuing a number of deals before today s 4 pm nonwaiver deadline but finding the kind of blockbuster move that could placate steinbrenner might rest on parting with their best prospect , pitcher brandon claussen the yankees traded right fielder raul mondesi to arizona on tuesday , leaving an opening for an everyday hitter in their lineup while several highprofile outfielders are available , the yankees could find a fit at third base , where cincinnati s aaron boone would be an upgrade over robin ventura one general manager who has spoken to the reds said all of their players are available except outfielders adam dunn and austin kearns boone whose father , bob , was fired as the reds' manager along with jim bowden , the general manager , on monday wants out the yankees resisted dealing claussen in potential trades for relievers ugueth urbina and scott williamson but the reds are starved for pitching their lack of it is a reason bowden was fired and if the yankees offered claussen , the reds might give up boone the yankees could also offer cash to the reds , who took back money when they dealt williamson to boston on tuesday the dodgers are also chasing boone , who is batting 273 with 18 homers and 65 runs batted in he is not eligible for free agency until after next season and could give the yankees the longterm answer they are seeking at third the thirdbase prospect drew henson did not play yesterday for class aaa columbus , but one yankees official said he had not heard henson s name in trade talks in addition to their failed pursuit of williamson , the yankees have long coveted the reds lefthander gabe white , though he had a setback yesterday in his rehabilitation from a groin injury the yankees' talks on williamson , after general manager brian cashman had said he was satisfied with his revamped bullpen , indicated a restlessness steinbrenner and cashman did not return phone calls seeking comment yesterday cashman kept manager joe torre updated , talking several times with him before last night s game with the angels in california when asked by reporters in anaheim if he expected the yankees to make a move , torre said it would n't surprise me , but that s the answer i always give i know there s talks going on brian giles , juan gonzalez and vladimir guerrero are the most prominent outfielders available the yankees have been interested in all of them at some point , but none will come easy the pirates believe that by including giles in a deal , they can shed the majority of the 42 million they owe catcher jason kendall for the next four years the yankees have no interest in kendall , and the padres are trying to work out a trade with pittsburgh giles has veto power over trades to all teams except atlanta and the national league west teams , but his agent , joe bick , said giles has an open mind whatever they come to us with , we will look at and consider , bick said then there is gonzalez , whom the rangers would love to trade gonzalez has a strained calf and is not eligible to come off the disabled list until next monday , , but a rangers official said the bigger hurdle would be getting gonzalez to waive his notrade clause , which he would not do when texas tried to trade him to montreal earlier this month the official said he doubted gonzalez would be dealt still , gonzalez s agent , fernando cuza , said gonzalez could leave the rangers he s open to being traded and playing for another team , cuza said omar minaya , the expos' general manager , said he spoke with the yankees yesterday , but not about guerrero minaya said he would have to be overwhelmed to deal guerrero or starter javier vazquez i could be a seller if somebody really gives me a very , very good deal , minaya said
tel aviv , jan 29 as prime minister ariel sharon set about wooing potential coalition partners today , a familiar question recurred in israeli political circles what does mr sharon want \? with his smashing victory over the leftofcenter labor party , he is now in position to do precisely what his rightist likud party officially demands to prevent the establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and the gaza strip mr sharon would now easily have majority support in parliament to expel yasir arafat , the palestinian leader a step he has said he wants to take and to accelerate the already rapid growth of israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza he is free to tighten the already harsh restrictions on the more than three million palestinians who live there yet today mr sharon urgently appealed for the seemingly crippled labor party , whose votes he does not need for a majority , to join a new governing coalition likud soared from 19 seats in the 120seat parliament to 37 , while labor fell from 25 to 19 , its poorest showing ever the appeal awakened a longrunning debate over what , precisely , mr sharon is after he has repeatedly said he would make painful concessions for peace , but he has not spelled out what the concessions would be one theory , held by palestinians and leftist israelis , is that mr sharon , master strategist , is seeking the political camouflage that labor s participation would give his rightist policies amram mitzna , labor s leader , believes that labor played that role for mr sharon in his last coalition government and paid the price for its compromised identity in the voting on tuesday the other theory , held by many settlers , is that mr sharon , master strategist , wants to confound the hawks by reaching a historic peace agreement with the palestinians the labor party would serve as political leverage , not camouflage according to that theory , mr sharon , at 74 , wants to vault into the ranks of israeli peacemakers like menachem begin and yitzhak rabin , and to erase the blots on his own record meir sheetrit , a moderate likud politician , likes to say that with a second term mr sharon has the chance to make history or be history i think he wants to make history , said mr sheetrit , who favors the resumption of a peace effort there is , of course , another possibility that mr sharon is a master tactician , not a master strategist , and that he is trying to survive in office and retain the backing of the united states while advancing in a general direction , rather than toward a specific goal mr sharon opposed the oslo peace agreement as a threat to israeli security , and as palestinian violence has continued , israel has taken back almost all of the autonomy that was granted to the palestinian authority under oslo mr sharon always feared and distrusted yasir arafat , and under mr sharon israel has in effect imprisoned the palestinian leader in ramallah mr sharon always supported the settlements , and under him the settlements have grown the prime minister supports what he calls a longterm interim arrangement with the palestinians that is effectively what he has now , with no talks toward a final settlement of the dispute under way all this has happened with the bush administration s acquiescence if not outright support my guess is , without the deaths and the loss of life , the situation now is probably as close to what he would want as he could imagine , said asher arian , a political scientist at haifa university he s not really negotiating he s not moving he s building the settlements according to that theory , mr sharon actually means what he says as , it might be noted , he himself claims what i say , i mean , and what i mean , i say , mr sharon recently told foreign reporters in his autobiography , warrior , mr sharon wrote that while he was leading israel s crack paratroopers in the 1950 s , he decided that a policy of mere retaliation or deterrence was not enough to secure a haven for jews in a region dominated by arabs his goal , he said , was to create in the arabs a psychology of defeat , to beat them every time and to beat them so decisively that they would develop the conviction that they would never win in march of last year , mr sharon said of israel s response to palestinian terrorism the aim is to increase the number of losses on the other side only after they 've been battered will we be able to conduct talks that was before israel began what has proved to be its biggest military offensive since , as defense minister , mr sharon led the invasion of lebanon in 1982 mr sharon s repeated answer to the americans' various forays into peacemaking here has been a quick yes , followed more quietly by modifications he has taken that approach to the road map to peace and a palestinian state that the bush administration is drafting with diplomatic allies mr sharon says he accepts the road map , but that he also wants numerous changes made over the last two years he has added conditions to a resumption of negotiations with the palestinians , and the bush administration has agreed to each one first mr sharon demanded that the palestinians halt all violence and dismantle all terrorist organizations then he demanded that mr arafat be replaced , and that the palestinians reform their security forces , economic system and governance today mr arafat offered to meet mr sharon immediately , but the prime minister dismissed the proposal , declaring in a statement that mr arafat was tied to terrorism and will not be a partner for negotiations president bush effectively endorsed mr sharon s conditions in a speech in june the draft road map , by contrast , demands that israel also speedily make concessions , including stopping settlement construction in saying he accepts the plan , mr sharon means that he accepts what mr bush said in june mr sharon has said he will accept an eventual palestinian state that would occupy less than half of the west bank and none of jerusalem and be demilitarized israel would control its airspace he envisions the borders of this state as being made final in perhaps 10 years under mr sharon s plan , israel would retain areas of the west bank that he regards as essential to security areas where , not incidentally , most of the settlements have been built he thinks he can settle the problem at a lower cost , and on a longer timetable , said shimon peres , long a leading figure in the labor party , who served as mr sharon s foreign minister in the unity coalition he said he doubted that any palestinian leadership would agree to mr sharon s terms the likud does n't understand that to make peace with the palestinians you need the palestinians , he said another of mr sharon s former ministers from labor , ephraim sneh , said today that the time had come to end the guessing game over whether the prime minister wants to make peace or war instead of judging between two assumptions , mr sneh said , i suggest something different let him act , and if he goes in the right direction we shall give him full support , even , if needed , to join him after he did the right thing asked what labor would consider a possible litmus test to demonstrate mr sharon s intentions , mr sneh said he should dismantle the many settlement outposts built in the last two years that israel has considered illegal photo supporters of ariel sharon celebrated in tel aviv on tuesday night \( associated press \)
dino s is calm and civilized on weekdays , raucous and rough edged on weekends although its atmosphere offers two different experiences , there are some constants among them are consistently tasty italian food , gargantuan portions , pennywise prices and obliging , though inexperienced , waitresses dino s , a sharplooking restaurant at 31 south middle neck road \( 5164825592 \) in great neck , is named after dean martin four televisions show his movies continuously the restaurant features a prix fixe , fivecourse familystyle dinner for four or more that provides an avalanche of food there s also a threecourse familystyle spread for less than 20 and an la carte menu offering normalsize portions that cost more than the same dishes when they are ordered as part of the familystyle array the fixedprice dinners theoretically enable patrons to order free seconds of any dish only eaters with king konglike appetites could possibly take advantage of this dino s twolevel dining room was designed with red shaded lamps , track lighting , bare tables , highindustrial ceiling , banquettes and hard surfaces what it does n't have are tablecloths , soundproofing or softness the gifted executive chef and his talented kitchen crew do an amazing job of turning out quality dishes on a massproduction , conveyorbelt schedule unfortunately , on frenetic weekends , the food was virtually shoveled out to tables whether diners were ready or not salads , appetizers and serving plates all arrived together despite a request to deliver pastas and entrees separately , they too came in one fell swoop the result was not only too much to eat , but a table that simply could n't hold four familystyle platters , four plates , eight glasses , wine and bread satisfaction is more likely on a quiet week night after dallying over the light ricotta cheese spread , olive oil and bread , we ordered the fivecourse extravaganza of salad , appetizer , pasta , entree and dessert , plus a beverage there are 17 pasta choices and 10 entree picks four diners can select two familystyle preparations for each course we opted for bountiful bowls of chopped gorgonzola salad packed with tomatoes , olives and chick peas , and a very fresh , but rather tame caesar a dish of alternating slabs of tomatoes , crisp skinned eggplant and goat cheese as well as a rich , creamy spinach , fontina cheese casserole are appetizers i 'd order again our two pastas a respectable linguine with red clam sauce , dotted with tiny tender clams and a mammoth pan of tomato sauce , and wild mushroomcovered cannelloni cylinders stuffed with a chicken and veal mash drew smiles all around a rustic , onthebone chicken scarpariello loaded with peppers , potatoes , onions and shards of sausage would have been even better with more garlic unordered sides of fried and mashed potatoes also made an appearance on our table and later on our bill a teepee of moist , mediumrare tuna around sundried tomatoes , capers and olives on a bed of escarole offered heft and flavor on a slow monday , the la carte choices were more varied tiny , tender baked clams oreganato \( 8 \) bathed in a winepowered sauce was

at a pricey 12 were more than half the cost of the fivecourse dinner , were surprising i expected lobster mixed into the risotto , but despite the dish s bursts of intense flavor , there was none , though there was a rich , luxuriant caper berry r moulade there were no disappointments in main courses from the la carte menu a big batch of butterflied shrimp oreganato \( 19 \) shimmered on the

whipped cream and chocolate syrup , a fluffy tiramis and four slabs of good dark chocolate mousse cake were all homey successes rampant serving errors and a policy of accepting only american express cards or cash diminished the dino s experience the service mishaps included who gets what delivery of dishes , waitresses disappearing for long periods , ice cream that melted because there were no

the artist laurie simmons is best known for her photographs of miniature rooms populated by dolls images that evoke , especially for baby boomers like simmons , both nostalgia and dislocation but her 20year obsession with domestic interiors took a new turn recently when someone gave her a copy of the instant decorator , a 1976 doityourself book by frances joslin gold line drawings of conventional rooms on transparent acetate pages allowed readers to insert samples of their own fabrics and wallpapers to get an idea of how their own rooms might look the book s fundamental flaw the misleading discrepancy between the scale of actual fabric and wallpaper patterns and that of the rooms did n't matter to simmons instead , the collage aspect of the book inspired her to break the confines of the dollhouse rooms she was used to working with and to introduce furniture and figures clipped from magazines and comic books , as well as threedimensional objects , into her domestic universe below , simmons discusses her new work my identity has for so long been as an artist who uses dolls the book presented a situation where i could bring in so many other elements real things , fake things , photos , cartoons here , i 've got the entire world and history of magazines and media my own photography collection instead of having to work with just the dolls and furniture that i actually own it s like grafting i can hybridize , and all these images can coexist collage suddenly seemed such a new and fresh way to work but these things only start out as collages , and then i photograph them i have no interest in them as collages things only start getting interesting when there s a neutral skin over everything i want everything to have the same value i 've always subscribed to the theory that the detritus around us is ultimately very random , because of all the stuff that moves in and out of our lives so none of these decisions were made too deliberately i would think , i want to do a pinkandgreen room , and i would just do it the decisions i 'd make would be to colorcode the room , but the individual elements in the room would be decided fairly quickly i love to have the chance to use drawings and cartoons of people all in one place dolls are sanitized and desexualized , which always appealed to me but now i have a cast of characters , with expressions , that are always available sex comics and fashion and news magazines are sources they do n't have expressionless characters so it s harder to avoid narrative now dolls are by nature expressionless , but it s hard to find a photo or a cartoon of a figure that does n't have emotion just by putting them into the picture , i'm creating a story it s hard to work this way without finding characters that interact and i had always been pretty antinarrative i always wanted to make pictures that were neutral overviews of a scene or memory i was n't interested in interactions between the characters also , the dolls were n't the main characters of those earlier rooms the furniture and d cor were important those pictures were about giving everything equal weight something s not quite right in all my work , so the fact that there s a builtin scale disaster in this book made it easy to work with you 'd end up with a club chair with a maneating cabbage rose first , you 've got a fantasy room that s not a real room at all then you use fabrics and wallpaper that are totally out of scale so what do you end up with \? a cartoon for me , it s great it has allowed me to explore the same subject i 've been exploring for 20 years , but with a completely different cast of characters , a different set of furniture but the sense of dislocation is the same as it is in the work i made 20 years ago at first glance , everything seems right and then there are all these insidious little reminders that nothing is real i try to make everything as accurate as possible , given the inherent limits of what i do but they 're still off drawings the instant decorator \( green living room \) \( 2002 \) , by laurie simmons , was inspired by a 1976 doityourself decorating book the finished artwork is a photograph of collaged elements right the instant decorator \( black and white living room \) \( 2002 \) , simmons s transformation of a line drawing in the book , above \( the instant decorator , by frances joslin gold \( clarkson potter , 1976 \)
rewire the place , of course build new bathrooms fix the roof widen the exit stairs expand the sculpture studio and get rid of those noisy , windowmounted airconditioners in the delicate fanlights of the secondfloor gallery but by all means , preserve the ghosts that is the philosophy guiding a renovation that will begin next month at the 111yearold american fine arts society building at 215 west 57th street , home of the art students league of new york this anomalous hive of artistic activity in midtown is an atmospheric and official landmark for which the word venerable and the word dilapidated might have been coined the last major project here was the installation of an elevator in the midtolate 50 s , said ira goldberg , executive director of the league , which teaches drawing , painting , sculpture and printmaking he seemed almost proud of the fact we have a real mandate not to change the place , mr goldberg said the membership does n't want the ambience to change there are ghosts here which , if you walk around the building long enough , are palpable unfortunately , none appeared , even flickeringly , during a recent visit not william merritt chase , daniel chester french , childe hassam , robert henri , john sloan , paul manship , georgia o'keeffe , thomas hart benton , yasuo kuniyoshi , george grosz , stuart davis , reginald marsh , ben shahn , alexander calder , louise nevelson , mark rothko , paul cadmus , jackson pollock , romare bearden or roy lichtenstein but it was easy to imagine their presence , like palimpsest on the old wainscot walls , in studios they would have little trouble recognizing o'keeffe , for instance , studied with chase in a fourthfloor studio washed in north light instructors and students today not only covet that glorious light but also believe themselves connected to an artistic pedigree by working there , said stephanie cassidy , the league s archivist there are more tangible connections to the past gasjet wall sconces , a wellpreserved coalfired burner and brass doorknobs stamped with the initials a f a s the american fine arts society , of which the league was a founding member , commissioned the building from henry j hardenbergh , architect of the plaza hotel and the dakota apartments on west 72nd street the need for renovation is particularly obvious on a rainy day this is our drainage system , mr goldberg said , pointing to a plastic bucket under a dripping skylight outside studio no 13 the 57th street building will close after classes on sunday to permit a 79 million renovation and repair of basic mechanical and structural systems this is the first of a threepart , 15 million project that is eventually to reclaim the voluminous vanderbilt gallery , which has been a studio for a half century , for use as a public exhibition hall this could be one of the grandest gallery spaces in new york , mr goldberg declared the columnfree , 4 , 000squarefoot room , modeled on the galerie georges petit in paris , has a skylight ceiling 26 feet high george washington vanderbilt , a grandson of commodore cornelius vanderbilt and the builder of the biltmore estate in asheville , nc , gave the gallery to the american fine arts society in 1892 as a 100 , 000 christmas present it was used by the society of american artists , the national academy of design , the national sculpture society and others the gallery was converted to a studio after world war ii , mr goldberg said , to accommodate the crush of students attending under the gi bill of rights public exhibitions are now held in a secondfloor room that was originally a lecture and dining hall of the architectural league of new york it has three arched leadedglass windows and , hidden behind a false wall , a sixandahalffoot mantelpiece of carved oak and pink marble but with only 2 , 000 square feet of space , it is inadequate for shows organized by curators , mr goldberg said reopening the vanderbilt gallery will mean losing studio space , so two new studios are to be built atop the onestory midblock portion of the building , invisible from the street the cost of restoring the gallery is estimated at 22 million the new studios would cost 25 million the building would also be made accessible to the disabled with contingency allowances and operating costs , the total construction bill would come to 15 million the design is by kossar garry architects the league has the money for the first phase , mr goldberg said , but must raise the balance it also hopes to raise 9 million for scholarships , for building maintenance , for an endowment to pay instructors and to sponsor exhibitions and lectures in the vanderbilt gallery until september , most classes will be held in 575 eighth avenue , at 38th street , where the league is renting 10 , 500 square feet of space sculpture classes will be held at the elizabeth foundation for the arts , 323 west 39th street a party on may 6 will inaugurate the capital campaign , with tony bennett as host \( he studied painting at the league with everett raymond kinstler \) after that the construction workers will move in what the ghosts will do is

the eerie whine of precisionguided missiles over baghdad contrasts with the equally shrill but increasingly muddled debate over the legality of the conflict the transatlantic war of words has laid bare competing visions of the purpose of the united nations security council was the council meant just to pass judgment on the use of force or to organize its collective use \? given the imbalance of power between the united states and the rest of the world , should it embrace american military might or seek to constrain it \? unless these contradictions are reconciled , the council will be relegated to dealing with local crises , as in east timor and sierra leone the united nations will retain operational roles in peacekeeping , mediation , humanitarian relief , human rights , development and nationbuilding but if lesser powers contrive to turn the council into a forum for counterbalancing american power with votes , words and public appeals , they will further erode its legitimacy and credibility given the experience of the league of nations , the architects of the united nations were determined to bind american power and global decisionmaking , not to set them at odds the united nations , sadly , has drifted far from its founding vision its charter neither calls for a democratic council nor relegates the collective use of force to a last resort it was a wartime document of a military alliance , not a universal peace platform pleas for reform of the security council , however , stress equity and representation not effectiveness and responsibility the reformers would mimic the political correctness and practical impotence of the league s council then , as now , most states had little stomach for enforcement it was n't supposed to be this way by combining muscle and legal authority , chapter vii of the united nations charter promised to set the united nations apart from the feckless league yet , as france , russia and china looked the other way , saddam hussein stripped the united nations security council of its credibility layer by layer last september , president bush ungallantly pointed out that the council , like the proverbial emperor , has no clothes however weak his multilateral credentials , on this he is right the council has shed credibility for so long that more worldly leaders have forgotten what it looks like his warnings about the united nations morphing back into the league of nations have fallen on deaf ears in capitals that would prefer a weak council to a strong one dominated by the united states they are as ambivalent about american power as washington is about international organization reforming the security council is inconceivable without a reconciliation among the major powers paris and berlin should understand that neither european unity nor global leadership can be built on a platform of denial and demonstrations neither paris nor london is about to cede its permanent seat to the european union , and intraeuropean bickering has been a major obstacle to security council reform for its part , the bush administration should do more listening and less preaching most countries are neither friends nor foes , and none likes to be taken for granted if washington shows more respect for the agendas of others , they are more likely to respond to ours as long as the united states has more military and economic power than any other country , the voting rules in the security council will appear arbitrary under such conditions , the council should vote less and seek consensus more , giving rogue states less opportunity for employing splitting tactics projecting a positive vision , the united nations charter speaks of concurring votes of the permanent members , not of their vetoes the big five the united states , britain , france , russia and china were meant to seek common ground , not to deny the validity of one another s security concerns or to posture for public approval since the united nations no longer tries to organize or oversee the use of force itself , this has been left largely to the discretion of member states even secretary general kofi annan has acknowledged that unilateral military action is sometimes necessary the forced removals of idi amin in uganda , or the khmer rouge in cambodia , were justified in the eyes of the world because of the internal character of the regimes , he said in june 1998 likewise , the council did not authorize the use of force by the west in kosovo , the united states in afghanistan , russia in chechnya , or , most recently , france in ivory coast opponents of the war in iraq have been highly selective in their reading of the united nations charter it is a compact by which the member states accept constraints on their use of force in the context of a binding system of collective security those who for years have sought to weaken the sanctions and inspections efforts in iraq undermining this compact have set the stage for the use of force it is hypocritical for them now to claim that the rest of the charter s rules are sacrosanct unless both the enforcement and legal pillars of the charter are reinforced , what is left will indeed look a lot like the illfated league of nations will the real united nations please stand up \?
how should we read tom paulin s new book of poetry , the invasion handbook \? paulin is the irish poet and oxford professor whose invitation to speak at harvard was rescinded after he said in an interview that brooklynborn settlers on the west bank should be shot dead \( he has since been reinvited \) paulin is also famous for having led the attack on t s eliot for his antisemitism he argued in a passionate review of a book on the subject that you ca n't separate the poetry from the poet s malignity so do we read paulin as he has read eliot , scouring his poems for evidence of his hatred of jews \? or do we disdain the journalistic trick of turning a writer s statements against his own work and entertain the possibility that paulin is a misunderstood philosemite , as he says he is , whose poetry is on the whole sympathetic to jews \? in a recent issue of the london review of books , paulin published a poem objecting bitterly to being called an antisemite the poem s title is on being dealt the antisemitic card but though he claims that his remarks about the settlers were misquoted , he has never explained what he meant to say in the poem he also argues that an earlier poem , killed in crossfire , in which he calls israeli soldiers the zionist ss , is antizionist , not antisemitic , but whether or not you 're offended by the equation of israelis with nazis , he still does n't explain why he included a line in which he calls people who believe official israeli accounts of palestinian casualties dumb goys compared with these polemics , the invasion handbook comes off as a tempered account of the political and cultural events leading up to world war ii the book , the first in what he plans to be a threevolume epic , has even been characterized as a work of antiantisemitism paulin defenders , including , most recently , bruce shapiro in the nation , cite poems that are well disposed toward walter benjamin and disapproving of kristallnacht as evidence of paulin s fellow feeling with jews it should be pointed out , though , that neither admiration for benjamin nor distaste for kristallnacht is exactly a courageous or groundbreaking position one curious fact about the invasion handbook is that it has attracted great praise even from reviewers who frankly admit that they ca n't understand the half of it the poems weave together snippets of text from an encyclopedic range of sources and traffic intimidatingly in halfforgotten moments in diplomatic , economic and military history paulin employs obscure historical references to make familiar accusations against pathetically deluded , if wellmeaning , government ministers and the less wellmeaning upperclass appeasers another difficulty is that paulin favors vernacular northern irish words like toltering and loy , not found in the current oxford english dictionary he is a master prosodist , though , so even when the nuances of a poem escape you , you may still be entranced by its snappy conversational rhythms and their interplay with delicate meters and strong rhymes in the london review of books , frank kermode concluded his positive but puzzled review by calling for some sort of companion volume , some guide on the lines of all those ancillary efforts devoted to pound , eliot and joyce none has been written as yet , but paulin recently published an essay in the times literary supplement that makes a start without actually mentioning his own poetry , paulin gives us some keys to the interpretation of the invasion handbook paulin s essay may seem , at first , like an unrelated bit of literary history an argument about the british economist john maynard keynes s effect on t s eliot according to paulin , eliot based much of the waste land , and parts of other poems , on keynes s great 1919 treatise , economic consequences of the peace , a furious attack on the treaty of versailles and its bankrupting of germany the invasion handbook , as it happens , makes the same point one of the book s longer and more important poems , the four , for instance , simply recites keynes s words , with the addition of a line dismissing as banal and consoling the poem an american made of them \( the waste land , that is \) once you start looking for eliot in the invasion handbook , in fact , you spot him everywhere paulin devotes an entire poem to mocking eliot s cold indifference to the fate of the jews , but in a subtler way , he lets eliot s language and imagery pervade at least a dozen other poems that paulin feels possessed by eliot should n't be a surprise you ca n't write about the years between the wars without grappling with the waste land , the work that helped characterize postworld war i europe for the englishspeaking world the draughty , empty house in eliot s poem is europe ruined by a colossal war and a punitive peace , paulin wrote in the essay its vicious aftermath can be felt in the speaker s bitterness , his senescent prejudices those senescent prejudices , which paulin called , in his earlier essay on eliot s antisemitism , something intractable and frightening at the diseased heart of european culture , are what he longs to undo in the invasion handbook he wants to make us feel how eliot toned down the economist s angry calls for justice into a kind of languorous , detached pessimism that led , at best , to neutrality but as borges pointed out about don quixote , you ca n't write the same book twice calling the french prime minister georges clemenceau , one of the villains of versailles , sterile and fruitless his pitted cheeks scurfbark feels less like pastiche than like piling on paulin s derision of puffedup diplomats , his condemnations of dictators and appeasers , thunder down from the lofty perch of hindsight his pronouncements on history smack of finger wagging , not original thought it is this shrill style , more than the actual subject matter , that ties the invasion handbook to a poem like killed in crossfire when it comes to jews , paulin actually feels or seems to want to feel guilty he has written of his shame at not having taken eliot s antisemitism seriously enough , and in the poem about kristallnacht he rather grandly affixes the blame on protestant christianity itself he comes across , in any event , as someone who needs to belabor the obvious in order to drown out his own conscience he is not an antisemite , at least not in the chilly way eliot was paulin is something slightly less dangerous , because easier to spot he s a thug drawing \( robert grossman \)
cleveland , oct 18 almost everyone involved has long conceded that the united states olympic committee needs an overhaul the deed was done here this weekend at a threeday meeting , and almost everyone was dutifully saying how great it was that included most of the members of the executive committee and the directors who were voting themselves out of office despite that apparent concord , there was an unhappy undercurrent all hands agreed that the 20member executive board would be eliminated , and it was the discontent arose because of who would have how many votes and who would have none on the new board the board now has 125 seats the revisions passed by the united states senate \( the house is considering them \) and the olympic committee s slightly different plan , which was passed here , reduced the number drastically the new board would have four or five outside directors , two sports federation officials , two athletes and the three americans who are members of the international olympic committee the plans , designed by separate task forces , sound innocent enough , but not to some groups the national federations that govern olympic sports they say the 1978 amateur sports act , which will now be replaced , guarantees them 51 percent of the vote the athletes' advisory council , which says the same legislation assures athletes of 20 percent of the vote a board of directors in which one class of director would have clear majority and control of all usoc matters would violate the olympic charter , obviate the need for consensus among board members and diminish the voice and vote of athlete members , the athletes said in a resolution the ioc , which contends that its members would be slighted because the three of them combined would have only one vote colleges , junior colleges and high schools , which would have no representation in a joint letter to the olympic committee , they said , the task force has disenfranchised the educationbased community the national governing bodies of sports like bowling , racquetball and roller skating , which are part of the pan american games but not the olympics they will have no guarantee of representation on the board disabled athletes , who said they would be disenfranchised many of these who have complained will suffer the executive committee voted without dissent friday to use the committee s taskforce plan on saturday , the board voted down amendments to add educational and disabledsports representatives , then approved the new plan in a voice vote of the 105 board members here , only five voted against the reorganization all five came from disabledsports groups and said they objected not to the reorganization , but to their lack of a nonvoting seat they ramrodded this thing through , said bobbie beth scoggins of frankfort , ky , president of the usa deaf sports federation they did n't want to have a dissenting vote the olympic committee hopes to put its new management in place by january in time for the athens olympics next august whenever congress agrees on a new plan , it will supersede the committee s that does not faze bill martin , the university of michigan s athletic director and the acting president of the olympic committee we expect they will do nothing more than tweak our new program , he said we 're on the same page in other business , the board took the first step to decertify the united states taekwondo union as a national governing body because of mismanagement and financial shortcomings if a series of mandated hearings goes according to expectations , a new governing body will replace the taekwondo union

rio de janeiro , march 9 an argentine judge has ordered arrest warrants for four iranian government officials who he says helped organize and carry out the 1994 bombing of a jewish community center in buenos aires that left 85 people dead but the judge balked at a recommendation by prosecutors that more than a dozen more senior iranian officials , including ayatollah ali khamenei , iran s spiritual leader , also be indicted he offered no public comment , and the decision is likely to intensify criticism from a variety of quarters that he has not pursued the case aggressively enough the 400page ruling , by judge juan jos galeano , made public on saturday , was the first time that argentina has formally accused iran of involvement in the july 18 , 1994 , blast the deadliest single antisemitic incident since world war ii the judge also cited evidence from the state intelligence agency that armed units of the proiranian armed group hezbollah were also involved , though no hezbollah member was mentioned in the indictment the highestranking iranian official cited is ali fallahian , a former minister of security and intelligence mohsen rabbani , formerly the cultural attach in the iranian embassy in buenos aires during the mid1990 s , was named in the indictment as operational director of the attack the other two officials indicted were ali balesh abadi , a diplomatic courier and ali akbar parvaresh , a former education minister and a former deputy speaker of the iranian parliament who is currently the leader of an influential conservative religious group none of the officials are now in argentina , and the indictment was accompanied by a request that interpol apprehend the four men but the likelihood that they will be arrested , unless they travel outside iran under their own names , is remote the indictment drew an angry reaction from iran , where the foreign ministry spokesman , hamid reza asefi , said today that no evidence of iranian involvement has been provided , and dismissed the charges as made up by zionist circles in israel and the united states if the argentine government fails to make up for its mistake , iran will adopt appropriate measures , he warned to a large extent , the accusations echo those contained in secret testimony offered to argentine judicial and intelligence officials by an iranian defector named abdolghassem mesbahi once a highranking iranian intelligence official , mr mesbahi defected to germany in 1996 , reportedly because he was upset at the agency s involvement in the killing of dissidents in iran and abroad according to a transcript of the testimony he offered in 1998 and 2000 , copies of which were obtained by the new york times last year , mr mesbahi said senior iranian government officials , including ayatollah khamenei and thenpresident hashemi rafsanjani , personally ordered , organized and financed the attack on the jewish center , the argentine jewish mutual aid association , known as amia he said they were also behind an earlier attack on the israeli embassy in buenos aires in 1992 in which 28 people died the decision for the 1994 attack was taken in khamenei s office in 1992 , mr mesbahi said , according to the 100page transcript , at a meeting presided over by rafsanjani and attended by other senior officials the committee that took the decision for the bombing in 1992 was composed of the guide or leader , the president of the republic , a former minister of foreign affairs , the intelligence chief and leaders of islamic religious groups and militias , his testimony said mr mesbahi also told argentine investigators that payment for the attack in 1994 came from a 200 million bank account in switzerland controlled by ayatollah khamenei and a son of the first leader of the iranian revolution , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini mr mesbahi also implicated mr rabbani and hadi soleimanpour , then the iranian ambassador to argentina , in carrying out the bombing in an interview on friday in buenos aires , eamon mullen , the chief argentine government prosecutor in the case , said the charges against the iranian officials are based not only on mr mesbahi s declarations but also eight years of analysis and a recent report filed to judge galeano by the argentine state intelligence service , known as side mr mullen declined to discuss the contents of the report , which he described as secret and confidential but argentine officials have built up a substantial body of evidence , some of which they have made available to selected journalists that material includes immigration records showing iranian officials leaving and entering argentina under false names around the time of the bombing as well as telephone records of calls between iranian embassy officials and suspected hezbollah members living in the triple frontier area where argentina , brazil and paraguay converge since being appointed in 1994 to investigate the case , judge galeano has been criticized by human rights and jewish community groups , lawyers and the press in argentina for what they describe as a lack of diligence in pursuing leads that could solve the case he did not respond to requests over the past two weeks for an interview aware that the investigation was coming to a head and that nearly 20 officials were suspected , the iranian foreign ministry late last month summoned argentina s charge d'affair s in tehran for what was described as a tonguelashing the argentine foreign ministry did not respond to repeated requests for information on that meeting , but the official iranian news agency said iranian officials dismissed the argentine prosecutor s request for a mass indictment , saying it was based on groundless allegations on saturday , the argentine foreign minister , carlos ruckauf , said no state of conflict currently exists with iran this is a decision of the judiciary and not of the argentine government argentina s interim president , eduardo duhalde , expressed concerns about the country s continued vulnerability to terrorist attacks and the dangers of standing up to terrorist states argentina was the only country in latin america to take part in the americanled coalition that drove iraq out of kuwait during the persian gulf war , but mr duhalde indicated that in the event of another war with iraq , argentina would sit on the sidelines we 've been through some difficult moments , like the gulf war in 1991 , he said in an interview with a radio station last month , on the same day the prosecutors made their recommendation i do n't know if

baghdad , iraq , aug 11 in one of its first major decisions , iraq s interim government appointed a 25member team today to draw up a procedure to produce a new constitution ibrahim jafari , president of the iraqi governing council , said at a news conference that the committee would not write the constitution itself , but rather devise the mechanism by which it would be drafted the task of the constitutional committee is to move with all segments of society to decide on the best mechanism for writing the draft of the constitution , mr jafari said a new constitution is seen as a cornerstone of the democratic iraq that american leaders overseeing the occupation here are trying to bring about the process , ultimately expected to lead to democratic elections , is part of the effort under way here to erase a history of dictatorship and misrule and begin a tradition of representative government in basra today , rioting eased as british soldiers ferried in millions of gallons of fuel and restored electricity to large parts of the city the power outages and fuel shortages , coupled with daytime temperatures of 120 degrees and higher , set off two days of demonstrations that left at least one person dead british troops distributed some 25 million liters of gasoline enough to last five days and to fill more than 500 , 000 car tanks to gas stations throughout the region , officials said american soldiers assisted in the effort , escorting 25 gasoline trucks across the kuwaiti border on basra s streets , the lines of cars that had stretched for miles from gas stations in recent days virtually disappeared crowds cheered as convoys carrying fuel arrived , and there were none of the riots or demonstrations that unfolded over the weekend officials say the shortages of fuel and electricity in basra have been brought about by a number of factors , including power cuts caused by sabotage , crumbling infrastructure and widespread looting of gasoline the shortages have fed off one another the power cuts have shut down many gas stations , and the lack of fuel has prevented many people from running the gasoline and dieselpowered generators that take over when the power system fails to fend off the saboteurs , the british military said it was building up its forces to protect power lines and electricity contractors military officials met with local tribal and religious leaders in an effort to forestall more unrest , said lynda sawers , a spokeswoman for the british military in basra in baghdad , mr jafari said the committee empowered to draw up the constitutional mechanism might choose from any number of possibilities but as an example , he said it could call a constitutional convention , bringing together anywhere from 100 to 200 people elected from around the country his example is an important one , in part because one of the country s most important religious leaders , ayatollah ali alsistani , has issued a religious edict , or fatwa , demanding that iraq hold elections to select representatives to draft a constitution there were few details released on the 25 committee members appointed today , although council members say that many of them are judges and lawyers and that all are men despite the tentative nature of the day s events , the decision was a significant one for the council , appointed by america s civilian administrators last month among its remaining tasks is the selection of a cabinet to take over the daytoday administration of the national government since its inauguration , the council has been regarded with skepticism by many iraqis , who view it as a largely powerless american creation intended to defuse iraqi desires for selfgovernment in fact , it has taken few substantive actions so far the decision today , if carried out , could ultimately transform the iraqi nation , which drew up constitutions three times in the last century , in 1924 , 1958 and 1964 the possibilities inherent in today s events were not lost on some council members , who see the task at hand not as just the drafting of a political document but also as the creation of iraq s first citizens schooled in selfgovernment we have no experience in this , governing a democracy , said naseer k chadirji , a member of the governing council at 70 , mr chadirji said , he had voted in an election only once , in 1954 it s a little like raising a child , he said but we can do it photos a british soldier talked yesterday with a shiite cleric at a gas station north of basra about organizing distribution of some of the millions of gallons of fuel that were brought into the area in southern iraq \( photo by tyler hicks the new york times \) ibrahim jafari , president of the iraqi governing council , at a news conference in baghdad yesterday \( photo by afp getty images \)
chicago the cubs have gotten off to a rollicking and not wholly unexpected start this season in their annual , seemingly quixotic quest to end their 94year drought as world champions they began the season by drubbing the mets , 152 , in the season opener for both teams at shea stadium , and added to their success by winning 13 of their next 22 games , behind their troika of impressive young starting pitchers , kerry wood , mark prior and matt clement , and the predictably explosive bat of sammy sosa , who remains healthy and in the lineup despite a recent scare in which he was beaned and his batting helmet cracked into pieces the cubs , meanwhile , have landed solidly in first place in the national league central now , unfortunately , they are confronted with some 140 more games in which to reach the pinnacle , a world series championship it is something they have not attained since 1908 , when the ottoman empire also went into serious and permanent decline the cubs often start quickly , like racehorses that are known as morning glories , then fade as the race grows ever longer the june swoon in chicago is as famous as al capone , or oprah they used to say there was a swoon in san francisco , too , dusty baker said the other day , but you just had to disregard that and he disregarded it so well that he led the team to the world series last year , only to lose to the anaheim angels in seven games now , baker is not only the cubs' new manager , but he is also their shining symbol of hope yet another , some cynics might say while the giants have overcome the swoon song , they did not have to hurdle the melancholy history of the cubs no team in the recorded history of professional sports has , in fact the cubs , who rolled to the thirdworst record in the national league last season , have n't been in a world series since 1945 , a year in which a good number of the best big leaguers wound up in foxholes now , for cub fans , any new wrinkle is cause to see , or to believe they see , a silver lining in the perennially dark clouds here was a proven winner ! but in baker s opening statements to the news media on the first day of spring training at hohokam park , in mesa , ariz , and his first day under a cubs cap in the dugout , there was an omen , as though the bad cubs bug had bitten him upon arrival he took up the issue of the plethora of day games at wrigley field you certainly have to add that into the equation , if they are the only ones who have n't won in a long time and still playing day baseball , baker said you wish they 'd put some more night games in the summertime these are already builtin excuses for failure , yes \? but it s true that most players play most of their games at night , starting in the minor leagues , baker said in the visiting team s manager s office before the season opener for the most part , we 're the swing shift , from 3to11 people but , it was suggested , since the cubs play 81 games at home and all but 18 of them are day games do n't they have an advantage in being able to adjust to the difference better than visiting teams \? not necessarily , baker said , because they only play three games at a time at wrigley field , and then are gone ah , but some of those games are played after visiting teams have , as baker said , trouble sleeping because day games in chicago give ample time to party at night on rush street , among other areas noted for the social ramble even sosa is on record as saying the cubs would be better with more night games he even had a newspaper headline taped to his locker all last season let there be night i do n't know , said rey sanchez , the mets' shortstop , who played seven seasons for the cubs , from 1991 to 1997 it does n't appear that day games have hurt sammy too much \( sosa did not hit more than 15 homers in any of his first four seasons in the majors he belted home run no 500 this season , his 12th with the cubs \) if the heat supposedly wilts the cubs , then why did n't it wilt others , like greg maddux , who left the cubs as a free agent after a cy young award season , or bill madlock , who led the national league in batting two straight seasons , then was traded \? and how was it that ferguson jenkins and ernie banks and billy williams did n't disappear in a puddle of sweat under the summer sun \? it is evident that over the years it has been poor management , not the lack of lights at night , that has done in the cubs other teams have folded at various points of the season , but none other than the cubs have copped a plea using sunstroke as a defense you have to turn the situation into a positive , sanchez said as a professional , you have to make your adjustments you have to go at a slower pace in the heat maybe you only run 90 percent to first base on an easy grounder maybe you do n't work as hard outdoors doing extra work , but build yourself up indoors the body adjusts and you have to understand if you party , it s not going to take you over the edge perhaps the earlyseason success is indeed a sign of gleeful things to come for the cubs this season when the cubs collapsed in late april last season a case of april anesthesia \? some cubs players , including outfielder moises alou and first baseman fred mcgriff , complained about the weather too cold , they said in the cubs' dugout before a recent night game , when the wind was blowing fiercely off lake michigan , and the temperature was barely above freezing , baker sat in a windbreaker and gloves he was asked if the weather the cold , not the heat was detrimental to the fortunes of his team you 've got to deal with the elements , baker said , apparently dusting weather excuses under the bench there are 10 million people in chicago , and they deal with the elements the cubs can , too the squinteyed jury is out photos dusty baker , the cubs' new manager , disregarded the talk of a june swoon when he led the san francisco giants to the world series last year this year he has all that melancholy chicago cubs history to contend with \( photographs by associated press \)
word on the street was that some bigshot wiseguys from new jersey were going to be doing a little business down by the brooklyn waterfront yesterday , so joseph fazzia stepped out in front of his warehouse to scope things out you know joey , the guy who runs the school bus contracting establishment down there in red hook and wears that gold chain under his sweater he remembers the stories his father told of the gangs that ran this waterfront a generation ago he does not find this current crop of wiseguys so intimidating they 're fictitious characters , mr fazzia said dismissively , firing up a parliament and staring off down the block yesterday , the sopranos came to red hook the neighborhood once famous for its mobcontrolled docks was crawling with the boys from new jersey , and for some , it was as if longlost friends had returned home there were tv cameras everywhere , and cops and firefighters silvio was yelling at cars there were young dudes in aviator sunglasses and blue jeans and tight tshirts standing next to traffic cones , doing the same job the traffic cones were supposed to be doing and strangely , the crew from jersey carried their weight around just as the oldtimers used to do you ca n't park on this street , one crew member said the block , he said , was rented tom bruno was pacing every so often , he would get a call on his cellphone he was trying to look like a face in the crowd in fact , he was trying so hard that he was wearing a name tag made of tape that said tom face in crowd mr bruno retired from the new york fire department a few months after the terrorist attack on the world trade center , and now he works helping out on sets the bigshot mobsters hired him to come out here and stand around , and he was pretty sure he knew why they picked red hook they needed to be in new york , but they had to pick some place that was obscure and out of the way , he said this is it while historians say red hook got its name from the color of its soil and the way it juts into new york harbor , others have more nefarious explanations some people say the name comes from the way the painted prostitutes used to hang out over on coffey street some , though , say it s none of your business why it s called red hook the mobsters who , for a day , had taken over this neighborhood filled the streets yesterday with wires and racks of clothing and fabric chairs they had a big wind machine , even though it was naturally windy they work in strange ways michael hollander , 40 , a mechanic who repairs ships , kept his distance he knew what the mobsters were up to , with the car with the bustedout window and everything , but he spoke in riddles i know what it is , mr hollander said , leaning against a wall it s right after sex in the city , or something like that , he added cryptically but what , for these wiseguys , was right after sex \? a cigarette \? ask somebody with a cigarette , if you want to know so badly mr fazzia , over in front of the bus warehouse , was generous with the cigarettes he said that he hands them out free to pretty girls , and the photographer he was talking to seemed to qualify mr fazzia , 50 , has an easy laugh , and he wore a black leather jacket and tan pointy leather shoes behind him in the warehouse , a bumper sticker on a forklift said hoffa '96 this neighborhood has changed drastically , he said , referring to the area s past days of mob control this is little soho you do n't have that element here anymore still , he was all too aware of these wiseguys from new jersey , who were taking a break to eat lunch under a big white tent on the street corner he said that those guys used too much profanity and that their leader did not behave the way wiseguys are supposed to i'm not a mobster , but if the guy s such a tough guy , why does he have to hit his kids \? mr fazzia said i shoot my kids a look and they stop doing what they 're doing mr fazzia lighted another parliament and started pacing the wind was picking up again , off the deep , dark , quiet water nobody touched the car with the broken window photo from left , lenny d'amico , louis yaccarino and joseph fazzia watched yesterday as tv mobsters from new jersey shot scenes in brooklyn , bringing back memories of gangs that controlled the docks a generation ago \( photo by andrea mohin the new york times \) \( pg b3 \)
i like that it s still there even though i ca n't see it , said the artist andy goldsworthy as the tide rose quietly over his mound of stones on the rocky coastline of long island sound in late 2001 the coneshaped mound , known as a cairn , was part of a yearlong project to build three temporary and three permanent sculptures across the united states the cairn on the sound , battered down by waves , has long since disappeared , but it lives on through a series of spectacular photographs documenting the temporary cairns these photographs form the centerpiece of a traveling exhibition at the neuberger museum of art at purchase college mr goldsworthy has been branded a treehugger and a luddite it is true softspoken and bearded , the shy , 46yearold artist lives in a tiny rural village in scotland it is cold and rains a lot up there , but he does n't mind , spending his days pottering about the countryside searching for leaves , stones , twigs , petals and even icicles , which he fashions into lovely , evanescent sculptures that he likes to refer to as earth works some of his creations are permanent , although most are ephemeral , enduring in photographs that he exhibits and publishes in books most of his works are known only though reproduction mr goldsworthy s photographs of the lost cairns are panoramic and lush they are also nicely installed across three walls of what is , well , a barn of a museum there is an odd , sad tenderness to these photographs that i ca n't put my finger on mostly , though , i think it comes from a tension between the solidity or monumentality of the cairns and the constantly changing light and weather conditions around them perhaps the most dramatic photograph is of a cairn in iowa ringed with the dancing , reddishyellow flames of a controlled prairie fire mr goldsworthy s artwork might well be about nature , but they are not natural mr goldsworthy s sculptures tend to work best outdoors to bring them into a museum has always been problematic , and most of the sculptures in the exhibition bear this out one piece consists of a pair of fragile mesh screens fashioned from cattail stalks affixed with scottish thorns another piece is made of tree branches coated in hair , hay and clay , while a third is a drawing using ferns each is a skilled performance in frugality , but they are all too quickly forgettable artwork ca n't just be poetic it has to say something the exception is an exquisite leaf horn made from chestnut leaves and thorns it is eminently tactile , demanding to be touched looking at the object you are touched in return , stunned by the delicacy and the simplicity of the form resembling a spiral shell , it almost seems natural of all the artists who went back to nature in the 1970 s , bewitched by a woolly romanticism , none did so with such sensitivity and gentleness as mr goldsworthy if mr goldsworthy s photographs and sculptures are not enough to persuade you to spend an afternoon at purchase , then perhaps you will be swayed by one of the artist s permanent cairns it is under an oak near the entrance to the museum you see it from the car on the way in , the surrounding landscape blanketed in snow it looks achingly perfect from a distance , like an outsize egg , its chalky white stones gleaming in the harsh winter light up close it is placidly elegant a faberge egg of earth art mr goldsworthy created similar sculptures in des moines and san diego in an effort to traverse the country in cairns the thinking behind this axis of obelisks is a bit fuzzy , at least on my reading of the catalog , although it is worth noting that in des moines the cairn is encircled by three blocky limestone walls from each of the walls a hollow has been cut matching the shape of the cairns on the west and east coasts i have n't seen this eggcup stonehenge , although i imagine the experience is stirring the creation of this continentsize sculpture was a significant departure for mr goldsworthy whereas previous cairns were knocked together with scavenged stones , the artist working through eye and feel alone , these cairns were made with quarried limestone using precise calculations mr goldsworthy even flew a team of stonemasons from scotland to help cut and fit the stones each cairn is 8 feet high , with a 21foot circumference and required close to 25 tons of stone this is one artwork that mr goldsworthy has made to last three cairns is at the neuberger museum of art , purchase college , 735 anderson hill road , purchase , ny , through april 13 information \( 914 \) 2516100 photos passage , far left , an installation by andy goldsworthy , is on view at the neuberger museum of art a detail from the work is at left also on display are photographs by the artist of his earth sculptures , like east coast cairn \( galerie lelong , new york \)
las vegas , april 18 the wrapping of the hands took a halfhour , nothing unusual in boxing hands are a vulnerable part of a fighter s body , and in the case of floyd mayweather jr , the delicate instruments of violence hurt chronically that makes punching opponents almost as painful for mayweather , the undefeated lightweight champion , as it is for the men he is hitting bad bones run in the family , mayweather s father , floyd mayweather sr , said from oscar de la hoya s training camp in california so does bad blood , which is being spilled in some ugly prefight hype for a fight that may never happen mayweather jr , now 26 and a world champion since age 21 , is unbeaten in 29 professional bouts with 20 knockouts , but none since 2001 because of his bad hands floyd mayweather sr , a fringe contender as a welterweight more than 20 years ago and now the selfproclaimed finest trainer in the world , says his son has deteriorated since throwing him out of his house here and replacing him as his trainer with his uncle roger mayweather mayweather sr and his brother roger , a twotime world champion , make up a rivalry that is hotter than most inside the ring my father is jealous of me , mayweather jr said at the top rank gym here as rafael garcia , a 73yearold cornerman who worked for roberto duran , edwin rosario and vito antuofermo , was patiently applying gauze and tape to his brittle hands his career never took off he knows as a fighter he was never as good as me in fact , he was never better than me at nothing the younger mayweather left wednesday for fresno , calif , where on saturday he will defend the world boxing council 135pound title against victoriano sosa of the dominican republic sosa \( 3522 with 26 knockouts \) is a good hitter , though not in the class of a second cousin , sammy sosa of the chicago cubs mayweather called sosa a solid opponent and insisted he was not looking ahead but he talked more about de la hoya and his estranged father than he did about sosa and with de la hoya a heavy favorite over yory boy campos on may 3 , there has been more interest in the possible de la hoyamayweather confrontation than in either of the two apparent mismatches mayweather would be jumping up 19 pounds to challenge de la hoya but before anyone can say david and goliath , there are other marketing tools that the promoter bob arum is eager to use it would be the first time a fighter would be looking across the ring at his father in the other corner , arum said it s an incredible story line , said arum , who is planning it for cinco de mayo next year , not father s day de la hoya said again this week that he had nothing to gain with a fight like that , though arum said he was sure he could persuade de la hoya to accept the challenge mayweather jr says that de la hoya s reluctance is his father s work , that his father knows i can beat oscar and does n't want me to fight him mayweather sr called his son a liar , and that was one of the milder admonitions he said his son s got to try to rain on his daddy s parade , meaning he would be expected to excuse himself from de la hoya s corner , and miss a big payday , if de la hoya were to fight mayweather the bible says , 'honor thy father and thy mother , ' and three years ago he kicked me out of the house for a man named james prince , who has made 3 million from my son while i made 75 , 000 , mayweather sr said prince is a rap music producer who is mayweather jr s manager , a relationship that is not expected to be renewed when the contract expires soon three of mayweather jr s young children had the run of the gym as he was having his hands taped mayweather called to his 2yearold daughter , iyanna she toddled away instead she must get that from her grandfather , mayweather jr said he was not worried about possible daddy dearest marketing for a de la hoya fight if that s what s going to sell , sell it , he said show me that money he flashed a smile that could light up arenas yet for all his talent , mayweather jr has not attained superstar status , and he blames arum , whom he will leave next year when their contract expires mayweather jr is unquestionably one of the best fighters in the world in boxing digest s ratings , de la hoya is no 3 and mayweather no 4 behind roy jones jr and bernard hopkins but mayweather sr said his son would have no chance against de la hoya oscar s too big for him he 'd walk right through my son , he said mayweather jr said pernell whitaker beat de la hoya easily in a controversial decision that went de la hoya s way in 1997 , and there s no difference between me and whitaker , except i punch harder he also cited shane mosley , who beat de la hoya in 2000 , and who has a rematch with de la hoya on sept 13 mosley ai n't in my league , mayweather jr said it was suggested that he might be overjoyed to beat arum s biggest star while leaving arum next year and at the same time defeating his father s fighter that s the beauty of it , mayweather jr said that s the story behind it photos floyd mayweather jr , above , wants a shot at oscar de la hoya and his trainer , floyd mayweather sr , left

the floating hospital was not a true hospital , and that was precisely its charm for more than a century it floated up and down new york city s waterways , making a clinical checkup feel like a day at the beach in the summer , the familiar barge would ply the harbor as its staff offered primary health care , nutrition counseling and entertainment for children and for the needy who might shy away from other clinics in the colder months of recent decades , it offered its services while tethered to a manhattan pier generations of patients climbed aboard to have their teeth examined , watch a magic show or just take a refreshing cruise and see the statue of liberty we 've had patients come and say , 'oh , my grandmother was on this ship , and so i wanted to come , ' said angela amendola , a physician assistant but the ship has run aground though it still calls itself the floating hospital , the clinic has moved off the barge and is looking for a permanent home on land while the hospital s basic mission has not changed in its 130odd years on the water , the waterfront has in the past , there were few objections to a barge that tended to the sick and indigent near working or derelict piers , far from the homes of the elite but now , as city residents and officials are rediscovering the potential for commercial development , housing and recreational oases along the waterways , the floating hospital has found itself largely unwelcome the barge , the lila acheson wallace , has sat idle in brooklyn since december , and the agency has set up shop on east broadway , near clinton street , in manhattan , in a nondescript clinic where it began seeing patients last week the hospital plans to settle permanently in long island city , queens , as soon as it can find an available building or lot hospital officials say the area has been designated by the federal government as an underserved community our mission does n't say we will be a ship , said ken berger , president and chief executive officer of the agency , who described the decision to abandon ship as painful our mission says that we will provide health care and social services to underserved people the boat where many patients were treated at no charge was actually the flagship and headquarters of a much larger enterprise with 66 satellite clinics throughout the city \( except staten island \) , in westchester and on long island in addition to medical care , the organization provides rehabilitation and social services to homeless and immigrant families , the retarded , victims of domestic violence and people with hiv but it was the ship , a barge powered by a tugboat , that gave the agency its identity over the years , as more than five million patients went aboard the lila acheson wallace and her many predecessors the concept evolved from cruises begun in 1866 by the new york times for newsboys toiling in the smoggy , sweltering city it became a summer institution , touring the east and hudson rivers with children , the elderly and the disabled later , it was not only a mobile clinic whose many distractions offset the fear and pain of a trip to the doctor , but also a summer retreat for those without a cottage or beach at the same time , the ship was an extreme example of the beliefs about disease in the late 19th century , said david rosner , a director of the center for the history and ethics of public health at columbia university in that period , before the role of bacteria was fully understood , disease was seen as being rooted in personal behavior , he said , and hospitals threw in a dose of moralizing along with the medicine by removing patients , some of them tubercular , from congested areas of the city , the floating hospital was trying both to cure them and to isolate them from the evil influences that had gotten them sick in the first place , he said , including immorality , bad habits and lousy decisions on the part of the patients , who were , for the most part , poor residents of the city s slums by the 1870 s the hospital was shuttling poor children around the city s waterways so they could breathe the sea breezes , take a salt bath and see a doctor while their mothers relaxed on the boat throughout the years , the hospital , operated until 1980 by st john s guild , a private philanthropic group , also staged festive events in 1949 , sanitation workers dressed up as cowboys to entertain 1 , 200 children who had participated in city cleanup drives in 1973 , when the hospital retired the lloyd i seaman , one of the five official barges that have been used by the hospital , passengers debarked from the final voyage in tears over the decades , the barge has come to rest at several spots , including piers on the lower east side , in west midtown and in harlem , said ellie tintopoitier , the hospital s chief operating officer , adding that its last regular home was at pier 11 , near wall street after sept 11 , 2001 , the city

dvd has resuscitated video sales , and now it is reviving rentals in april 2002 rental revenue from vhs and dvd combined was down about 4 percent from the same period in 2001 , and general weakness continued for much of 2002 the lowpriced dvd was eating into vhs enough people were spending 17 or so to buy a dvd , rather than rent a disc or videocassette for 3 , to help depress rentals but last month rental revenue was up 66 percent from last year again the reason is dvd in 2003 to date , a 78 percent increase in dvd rentals more than makes up for a 23 percent decline in vhs rentals dvd is about equal with vhs in rental revenue and should surpass the cassette in number of units rented that s going to happen pretty quickly , said sean bersell , a vice president of the video software dealers association looking for more profit , the movie studios price dvd s low to sell , not to rent in 2002 dvd sales were 87 billion and rental revenue 29 billion nevertheless , many people still prefer to rent most movies , not buy them mr bersell s organization represents primarily independent dealers \( many of them neighborhood video stores \) that for the most part rent movies rather than sell them like a walmart as the number of dvd households grows \( now about 43 million \) , mr bersell said , more renters are appearing , as they always have for vhs dvd penetration is really going down to the mainstream of the market , he said at that level not everyone wants to buy everything , as has often been the case with socalled early adopters who first came to the format if it s an event title , like a 'harry potter' or 'lord of the rings , ' you might want to own it , he said otherwise you just want to watch it or as the question was posed recently in a trade publication would you rather buy simone for 19 or rent it for 3 \? last week the top 15 on video business magazine s dvd bestseller list included two versions of harry potter and the chamber of secrets \( one full screen and the other widescreen \) and two versions of drumline the top 15 on the dvd bestrenter list went further afield with titles like far from heaven , red dragon , one hour photo and road to perdition none were on the bestseller list , but certainly they are the kind of film that people want to rent for its part , drumline , the best seller released on april 15 , was also the no 1 dvd renter that points to another dvd phenomenon the newest , bigger titles sell strongly as well as rent but distributors say that most copies of secondary films are going to stores that rent them rental outlets like the low dvd wholesale price far from heaven , for instance , is 1890 wholesale for dvd and 6930 for vhs that means stores can stock more copies for renters you ca n't buy all of it anyway , mr bersell said

berlin with their tales of love , treachery , politics and death , plots of operas can be mindbogglingly complicated hardly less convoluted , though , is the wagnerianlength drama gripping berlin s three opera houses as they struggle to survive dwindling audiences , shrinking subsidies and plunging morale the curtain has just gone up on the third and perhaps final act , but the end is still unclear the future of governmentsponsored opera in berlin may be in the balance in practice , even more is at stake in a peculiar way over the last three years the opera story has become a gauge of the still volatile relations between the two halves of this longdivided city and even a test of germany s willingness to give berlin the profile of a genuine capital city when act i began , things were simpler after german unification in 1990 , the new government of a single berlin inherited the deutsche oper from the west and the staatsoper and the komische oper from the east thanks to support from the federal government the three flourished , encouraging berlin s ambition to become the cultural capital of central europe but by the late 1990 s , with federal aid for berlin s culture sharply reduced , act ii brought recognition that the city could no longer afford three opera houses that consumed onequarter of its cultural budget in 2000 the city therefore proposed merging the deutsche oper and the staatsoper , assigning each its own repertory after a counterattack led by daniel barenboim , music director of the staatsoper , the initiative was abandoned now a new leftleaning city government has a fresh proposal with berlin close to bankruptcy , the protests have been muted there may be disagreement over what should be done , but there are no longer doubts that something must be done and this time the plan includes an implicit threat if it fails , the curtain will probably fall on act iii with the closing of one opera house desperate to cut its own deficit , the city has decided to reduce the annual opera subsidy to 1125 million from 123 million , eliminating 220 jobs , around 10 percent of the present opera work force to do this it proposes uniting the three houses' costume and set workshops and shrinking their three dance companies into a single corps their orchestras , however , will lose only 18 players and their choruses just 5 singers the three opera houses would be brought under a new berlin opera foundation headed by a general manager with the job of supervising the houses' longterm finances and encouraging them , although not ordering them , to coordinate their programs to avoid having three different productions of the magic flute on one evening , which has happened this is the optimistic scenario none of it will happen , warns thomas flierl , berlin s culture minister and the man behind the plan , unless the federal government comes up with 13 million annually through 2008 to help pay for this transition and if the money is not included when next year s federal budget is announced in june , the deutsche oper and staatsoper will be merged and reduced to one orchestra , one chorus and one ballet company so far the only loud protest has come from mr barenboim , who argues that the staatsoper and its orchestra , the staatskapelle , both based in the former royal opera house on unter den linden in eastern berlin , is being punished for being successful the government has stolen 7 million which we earned from our tours , he said in a recent interview all this money that we saved in this way has been expropriated simply because they have terrible debts and the worst thing is that , when we complain , we are told we lack solidarity mr barenboim said he could live with reducing his orchestra to 128 from 135 players , but he objected to cutting the staatsoper s annual subsidy by 43 million to 415 million he also dislikes the idea of a berlin opera foundation the staatsoper is the only house in artistic and financial good health , he said so you put one healthy house together with two sick houses does n't thomas flierl know that sickness is contagious \? mr flierl s response is conciliatory i regret what i had to do , he said in an interview but this is an emergency , and we had no choice i am aware that this action has brought complications , but taking these savings will not damage the essence of the staatsoper s operation the staatsoper has one further advantage mr barenboim is on good terms with peter mussbach , the general manager in contrast , at the deutsche oper , after a longrunning feud , christian thielemann , the music director , has forced udo zimmermann to step down as general manager at the end of this season and at the komische oper , relations are strained between albert kost , the general manager , and the man named to succeed him next year , andreas homoki , now artistic director mr zimmermann said he welcomed mr flierl s plan if it prevented the merger or closing of any opera house but he worries whether a single workshop can properly serve the three houses since our own workshops are already working to capacity , he said he added that he also feared that the artistic autonomy of the opera houses would gradually be undermined by the financial crisis
seoul , south korea , jan 7 half a century ago , the waves of chinese coming to korea were soldiers pouring over the yalu river to impose communism today , the waves of chinese are delegates to trade and investment conferences or are other foot soldiers for capitalism with japan , asia s largest economny , stagnating , south korea , no 3 in asia , is experiencing extraordinary growth in trade and investment with china , which is no 2 in five years , we built a route network in china that took us almost 30 years to develop with japan , said kim yong jin , the manager for korean air lines at incheon , seoul s 56 billion airport , where china traffic is jumping 20 percent a year china , already the largest destination for south korean investment , is now south korea s largest export market , based on sales , which expanded 29 percent in 2002 but as china has become south korea s largest economic partner almost overnight , it has also become a threat for years , korea has long been the lowcost , highefficiency producer , but now chinese labor is eating into the south korean margins , said scott snyder , korea representative for the asia foundation , a research group partly financed by the united states government the koreans have to run faster they are starting to feel the warm breath of china on their backs korea s leading exports to china last year were cellphones and computers , displacing steel and petrochemical goods by 2010 , the korean government forecasts , china will be on a par with korea in such major industries as cars , semiconductors and shipbuilding in other industries , the gap is measured in months south korea s shipbuilders , the world s largest , are turning to building liquefied natural gas carriers and other valueadded vessels , since china s shipbuilding industry is already focusing on the market for simpler vessels in 2000 , korea s 534 billion in information technology production amounted to 5 percent of world production , below china s 6 percent and korea s information technology production is not growing as fast as china s , several recent studies warn china has already outstripped korea in desktop production , printed circuit boards , semiconductors and videotape recorders china is going to , sooner or later , compete with us and catch up in all sectors , said lee jung hoon , a yonsei university international relations professor by 2007 , south korea s industrial hollowing is expected to spread to such technologyintensive industries as electronics and automobiles , as production lines may start moving to china already , almost half of the major production companies around seoul have moved lines offshore , largely to china in 2001 , for the first time , south korea recorded an absolute drop in manufacturing workers , a loss of 45 , 000 jobs thank god , mao zedong gave us a 20year head start , song hee yhon , dean of the college of northeast asian studies , said , referring to the founder of modern china s lowgrowth communist economics in three to five years from now , korea could face the same difficulties as japan already , korea is experiencing trade skirmishes with its new biggest economic partner china , dismayed by its large trade deficit with korea , has imposed restrictions on 16 types of korean products , while seoul did the same with 6 of china s last year , most famously , beijing put tariffs on south korean mobile phones to retaliate against seoul s tariffs on chinese garlic still , china seems destined eventually to overtake other countries' economic presence here , including that of the united states there has already been some shifting in finance , for instance , american banks like bank of new york , bank of hawaii and fleet national bank are closing south korea branches , as are the japanese banks fuji and asahi at the same time , branches are being added by two chinese banks the stateowned industrial and commercial bank of china and the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation unit of hsbc holdings the us is still extremely important because of the investment we have here , the technology we bring here we have 40 , 000 korean students in the states , said tami overby , executive director of the american chamber of commerce in korea but in a decade , korea s economic ties with china will eclipse those with the united states , a majority of 51 future leaders of south korea , age 30 to 49 , predicted when they were interviewed a year ago by gallup korea for a project commissioned by the national defense university in washington koreans , who love surveying themselves , give clear signs of making an unchecked investment stampede into china in one study , almost 7 out of every 10 korean overseas investors chose china as their destination , according to the korea chamber of commerce and industry \( a federation of korean industries report calculated that the average price of land and the average wage in china are , respectively , onefourth and oneeighth the levels in korea \) in a survey of executives at south korea s 50 largest business groups , 56 percent said they planned to expand investments in china this year none planned to reduce investments , according to the federation of korean industries , which released the poll last week the pace of deals announced here is dizzying
washington , june 5 attorney general john ashcroft today defended the justice department s detention of hundreds of illegal immigrants after the sept 11 terrorist attacks and urged congress to give the authorities still greater power to pursue terrorism suspects mr ashcroft , in five hours of testimony before the house judiciary committee , made his first public comments on a report from his inspector general that criticized the department s treatment of 762 illegal immigrants after sept 11 he said we make no apologies for holding suspects as long necessary to determine whether they had links to terrorism in the end , none of the 762 suspects were charged as terrorists al qaeda is diminished but not destroyed , mr ashcroft said he said the nation must be vigilant we must be unrelenting , he said we must not forget that al qaeda s primary terrorist target is the united states of america mr ashcroft told lawmakers that the authorities need still greater powers to track and pursue terrorists the usa patriot act , as the sweeping antiterrorism law that grew out of the sept 11 attacks is known , has sparked official votes of protest from more than 100 communities around the country because of civil liberties concerns but mr ashcroft said the law does not go far enough and has several weaknesses , which terrorists could exploit undermining our defenses mr ashcroft , a strong proponent of capital punishment , said the penalties for some terrorismrelated crimes should be toughened to include the death penalty he also urged congress to allow the authorities to detain terrorism suspects before trial without bond and to clarify what constitutes illegal material support of terrorists , the standard the justice department has used against terror suspects we must make it crystal clear that those who train for and fight with a designated terrorist organization can be charged under the material support statutes , he said mr ashcroft s lengthy and impassioned defense of the justice department s counterterrorism campaign and his push for greater authority met with strong endorsement from many , but not all , of the republicans on the judiciary panel representative f james sensenbrenner jr , the republican chairman of the panel , said that while the justice department had made impressive strides in fighting terrorism , he remained concerned about the potential threat to civil liberties posed by the long reach of counterterrorism efforts to my mind , mr sensenbrenner said , the purpose of the patriot act is to secure our liberties and not to undermine them just last month , the senate rebuffed efforts by senior republicans to make permanent some critical provisions of the patriot act that are to expire in 2005 the concerns raised by mr sensenbrenner , and echoed in even stronger terms by virtually all the democrats on the panel , signaled that mr ashcroft may face a tough sell in seeking to broaden the justice department s authority to pursue terrorists some of us find that the collateral damage may be greater than it needs to be in the conduct of this war , said representative howard l berman , democrat of california democrats said they were particularly concerned about the report released on monday by glenn a fine , the justice department s inspector general the report found significant problems in the way the authorities arrested and treated hundreds of illegal immigrants as part of the sept 11 investigation the report found that the authorities had made little effort to distinguish real terrorist suspects from those who became ensnared by chance in the investigation many suspects were jailed for months , often without being formally charged or given access to lawyers , and some inmates in brooklyn were physically and verbally abused before they were cleared of any terrorist ties , the report said while the report drew no conclusions about the legality of the justice department s actions , representative robert c scott , democrat of virginia , suggested that the denial of the detainees' civil rights and evidence of physical assaults by justice department employees might have risen to the level of criminal conduct the congressman asked mr ashcroft whether he planned to appoint an outside counsel to investigate the accusations further , but the attorney general responded that i have no plan at this time to employ a special counsel in this matter mr ashcroft said the department s civil rights division had investigated 18 complaints of abuse by guards against immigrant prisoners and had found in 14 cases that there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges four investigations are pending we do not stand for abuse , he said mr ashcroft said he also wished that the department could have resolved cases against many of the 762 illegal immigrants more quickly god forbid , if we ever have to do this again , we hope that we can clear people more quickly , he said we 'd like to clear people as quickly as possible there s no interest whatsoever that the united states of america has in holding innocent people , absolutely none it s costly it takes up resources that makes it difficult for us to do what we need to do with other people who are threats but mr ashcroft stressed repeatedly that he believed the policy of detaining people for as long as it took to clear them of terrorist ties was the right one , and he said that several illegal immigrants did have terrorist connections that are still considered suspicious one suspect was the roommate of one of the sept 11 hijackers , and another was found with jihad material and more than 30 pictures of the world trade center , mr ashcroft said mr ashcroft said past data showed that people who were facing deportation and were released from custody on bond fled about 85 percent of the time , and he said he was not willing to take that risk with the suspects apprehended after the sept 11 attacks we had had to balance the risk , mr ashcroft said and in doing so , he added , we did not violate the law photo attorney general john ashcroft testified yesterday before the house judiciary committee , asking that

blacksburg , va who is no 2 \? it is probably a southern california team that has lost to 500 california or is it florida state , a team that was beaten at home by miami , which in turn , was waxed on saturday by virginia tech , a team that two weeks ago was pounded by noncontending west virginia \? partisans of ohio state and louisiana state , which have a loss each , are praying their teams win the rest of their games , wow the computers , woo the poll voters and land in the runnerup slot of the bowl championship series ranking because of the way college football s rankings are configured , it pays far too much to be no 2 to poach some rhetoric from senator joseph r biden jr , such a pursuit looks unamerican last week at a senate hearing , biden , a democrat from delaware , used those words to describe how the bcs decides which college team receives a shot at the national championship he did not know that the system relies on a television contract with abc that is cut by commissioners of six major conferences composed predominantly of state universities and is worth 900 million over eight years you want a definitive national champion \? then it is time for a playoff not an elaborate one , just an inclusive fourteam , threegame shootout that could easily exist under the current bowl system that system is apparently precious to athletic directors , chamber of commerce types and their ubiquitous representatives in the garish pastel blazers why \? because as biden intoned last week , the bcs system looks like a rigged deal worse than that , the bcs ranking system is transparent to a fault seven antiseptic computer services including the new york times computer ranking conspire with voters in the news media and coaches polls , none of whom have the time or interest to watch every team play every game but still help decide the best teams from no 1 to no 25 suggesting a playoff is heartbreaking for the multitudes who argue passionately that what makes college football unique is that every week is a playoff and in the previous five years of the bcs , the result has been satisfying five undefeated teams have won the title but now the presidents of nearly half of the division ia colleges that play football have banded together and presented a convincing case that the bcs has too much control they are also peeved that their share of the 900 million the bcs generates is barely 5 percent , about 42 million it is indeed disturbing when miami coach larry coker can watch his team be drilled , 317 , by virginia tech and say afterward that he sees no reason his hurricanes cannot find their way back to the national title game there is going to be a oneloss team in it , he said it may as well be us there s no doubt the novelty of the bcs ranking has worn off the solution is straightforward at the end of the regular season , college football should designate four teams for a championship playoff , with the first criterion for inclusion being an undefeated record if the season were over now , for example , that would mean including topranked oklahoma from the big 12 , a bcs conference , as well as undefeated texas christian , which is languishing at no 12 in the bcs ranking because it belongs to conference usa , which is not in the bcs then , instead of selecting the other teams based on decimal points in the computer rankings or a beauty contest among human voters , the universities could appoint a rotating panel of officials from each conference to make the final choices let them use the computers and polls as indicators , just as the selection committees for the ncaa men s and women s basketball tournaments use the rating percentage index and useful information like current injuries and a team s performance in its last few games to determine whether a team is at its peak but more important , up to two dozen people would watch every tape of every team in contention for a national championship it is unusual for two division ia teams to finish a season undefeated unbeaten teams have met in the bcs title game twice in the last five years currently , only oklahoma and texas christian hold that distinction that means , on average , the selection committee would pick two teams with one loss they would be the arbiters , for example , of whether virginia tech s victory over miami was more worthy than the hurricanes' defeat of florida state it is a heck of a lot better than hanging such a decision on soulless computers or the whims of harried voters once four teams were determined to possess nationaltitle mettle , the first two playoff games could be rotated \( or auctioned off \) to bowl games in the middle of december the winners would meet in the national title game after new year s day just as it is now , it does not matter which bowl game plays host to the big show this leaves the importance of the bowl games intact , gives the little teams that can a place at college football s bountiful money table , and offers at least a hint of equality it also squares the most american of sports with a lawmaker s indictment that the way college football s champion is decided is inexplicably unamerican photo quarterback matt leinart has emerged to put southern california in contention for the bcs title game \( photo by associated press \)
rabbi yaakov y horowitz s version of american history 101 runs something like this when the colonies were settled , the shochet , or kosher slaughterer , was not far behind when gold prospectors flocked to california , so did the kosher inspectors when passover arrived at army camps during the civil war , so did the matzo the founder of american jewish legacy , a nonprofit historical organization , rabbi horowitz has created an exhibit of kosher practices that offers glimpses of how jewish dietary laws were followed from the earliest arrivals of jews in the mid17th century into the last century the development of judaism was tied to kosher food , rabbi horowitz said last week i have to get the word out that all of this stuff we 're dealing with , the history of traditional jews , is endangered people with memories are dying before their oral histories are taken synagogues are being demolished archives are being thrown out of synagogues and basements the rabbi s historical account , illustrated on a series of large display panels , was briefly on display last week at kosherfest 2003 , a trade fair at the jacob k javits convention center with a headspinning array of kosher products , such as gnocchi in tomato and basil sauce , margarita mixflavored nuts , ginger teriyaki marinade , 400 bottles of french wine and poppy chocky wocky doodah gourmet popcorn sensations together , the exhibit and the trade show conveyed a remarkable evolution , from a sometimes primitive struggle for traditional jews to observe ancient dietary laws to a modern industry with 170 billion in sales that also markets to mildly observant jews , seekers of healthful foods , vegans and the lactoseintolerant the rabbi s effort is tied to the 350th anniversary of the arrival , in 1654 , of 23 jews in new york historians say they were the first group of jews to reach north america , and institutions across the jewish world are using the occasion to celebrate the history of american judaism the rabbi said he was also hoping to take his display on the road rabbi horowitz is a greatgrandson of the founder of the bostoner hasidic community , and leads the bostoner bais medrash congregation in lawrence , ny the exhibit s theme also fits nicely into his day job , which is supervising rabbi of the b manischewitz company while paid by the union of orthodox jewish congregations of america , he is assigned to the company , which pays the orthodox union for its services richard a bernstein , the chairman of manischewitz s holding company , rab holdings , has personally donated to the legacy and said he planned to back the exhibit s tour in colonial times , the beneficiaries of kosher sales were mainly congregations congregation shearith israel , which was established in new york in 1654 and built what the exhibit says was the first synagogue in the colonies , had a monopoly on the kosher meat supply until 1813 congregation mikveh israel of philadelphia , which had roots dating back to 1740 , produced passover matzo for the jews of the city and provided donations for the poor a kosher table was prepared for jews in philadelphia in 1788 at a celebration marking pennsylvania s ratification of the constitution , although the exhibit s account has a hazy moment , calling it the ratification of the bill of rights as it does today , the degree of observance varied in savannah , ga , in 1738 , a lutheran minister , martin bolzius , wrote , the spanish and portuguese jews are not so strict in so far as eating is concerned as the others are the german jews on the other hand would rather starve than eat meat they do not slaughter themselves the exhibit includes accounts of the difficulty of trying to maintain dietary laws amid the hardships of the frontier the helena daily independent described a montana woman named mrs wolf sabolsky in the 1870 s as so rigid in her observance that she might be said to have been a vegetarian indeed , kosher slaughterers traveled from town to town , butchering as they went rabbi benjamin papermaster came from lithuania in 1890 to serve the jews of north dakota his son isadore recalled the rabbi s regular visits to an outpost of jews in starkweather he spent several weeks there as each of the colonists wanted to put in his supply of kosher meat and fowl for the winter as railroads spread , jews in small great plains towns waited for deliveries by train , often receiving food that had spoiled the kosher food business grew slowly until the late 19th century , when the large influx of eastern european and russian jews created a broader market new york had more than 5 , 000 kosher butchers and 1 , 000 slaughterers , the display said , which gave rise to scandals over the sale of meat fraudulently presented as kosher in the early decades of the last century , established companies began marketing to observant jews the final part of the exhibit shows advertisements for

gov james mcgreevey of new jersey has united lawmakers from both parties with his plan to make up the state s budget shortfall of 5 billion all sides agree his solution is horrible it cuts into health care for the needy and the elderly , whacks support for higher education and guts spending on the arts the price for keeping the governor s promise not to raise income taxes mr mcgreevey s message , a combination of do n't blame me , i told you so and read my lips , sounded more like an excuse than a real plan to ease the devastating hits , the democratic speaker of the assembly , albio sires , has suggested raising taxes for the wealthy , a notion some republicans are not dismissing out of hand threequarters of new jersey residents polled in a recent starledger eagletonrutgers survey liked the idea , saying they would support higher taxes for citizens earning 500 , 000 or more a year , the people who benefited most from the recent federal tax cuts the resulting 600 million in revenue would go a long way toward restoring some of the more draconian cuts it could also help cushion localities that would have to raise property taxes to make up for lost revenue from trenton mr mcgreevey has already proposed cutting state property tax relief for highincome homeowners , but the overall effect of his budget would inflict pain that is broader and deeper none of this has swayed mr mcgreevey , who is haunted by the memory of james florio the last democratic governor , who lost reelection after he raised the income tax the mention of his name is akin to invoking remember the maine ! for democratic officeholders the governor is challenging lawmakers to show how they can do better , within the constrains of the current tax structure like gov george pataki in new york , mr mcgreevey obviously intends to make sure that if taxes do wind up getting raised , the responsibility will lie at the legislature s door that may be good politics , but it s bad leadership times are difficult , and mr mcgreevey can only make them worse by refusing to consider every option and ducking the hard choices
to many of us who grew up in the 70 s , the freakishly jaunty theme from zoom is more than just a television jingle it s a musical time machine so wo n't you zoom zoom zooma zoom ! come on and zooma zooma zooma zoom ! come on , give it a try ! we 're gonna show you just why ! we 're gonna teach you to fly high ! does n't it just make you want to do that joyous wiggly arm thing , the one made famous by bernadette \( i'm bernadette ! \) yao \? ok , maybe you had to be there but if you were there , back in the free to be you and me 1970 s , zoom was not so much mere entertainment as a tiny , bouncy cult , a latter day mickey mouse club but mellower , groovier \( you can still see it on videotape , in collections available from wgbh video \) the show featured an everchanging ensemble of everykids , including the infamous bernadette , tracy , leon and edith , each with his or her trademark move peppy in their striped shirts , they performed goofy skits and games , from zoom raps to zoom goodies they told riddles they did projects involving boiled eggs and stickpins and most alarmingly , they spoke ubby dubby , a private language that sounded like someone gargling with mashed potatoes the 70 s were undeniably a brilliant time for children s television , but zoom stood out from everything that surrounded it sesame street , the electric company , fat albert and the cosby kids even at 10 , you could taste the vegetables disguised as french fries in contrast , zoom was zany , and only the tiniest bit educational it was also very , very kidlike , in the best possible way stupidsmart like mad magazine , lighthearted like laughin , with a musical theater streak straight out of godspell for any kid longing to belong , it was impossible to watch zoom without imagining joining the cast , a fantasy the program encouraged by peppering the skits with suggestions and recipes from viewers \( zoom even managed to transform a zip code into a musical earworm oh , two , one , three , four ! send it to 'zoom' ! \) thirty years later , the cast members seem almost shocking in their littlekid vibe they 're spazzy instead of poised , radically unlike the current crop of sexy tween divas and boyband refugees there s a mellow 70 s flavor to their army jackets and mary hartman braids and among the skits , the decade s politics peek in here and there in one zoom news segment , the newscaster announces in libertyville , ill , peter phillips reports 'i wrote to the president of the us all he wrote back was 'dear peter , the president enjoys hearing from you' he did n't answer any of my questions ! none ! i do n't think it s fair just because i'm a kid does n't mean i do n't know anything there s a new zoom on pbs now , complete with email instead of snail mail , as well as a dandy web site \( the show is on channel 13 in new york at 3 30 pm weekdays check local pbs listings \) the new zoom has plenty of the charm of the earlier version same corny jokes \( what s worse than raining cats and dogs \? hailing taxicabs ! \) , same viewersuggested crafts and recipes \( cinnamon toast ! \) most of the difference is stylistic there s an emphasis on gelled bangs instead of silky bowl cuts , and more highfiving the stripes have been replaced by bright purple and orange triangles there s a sad lack of ubby dubby and let s be honest pbs kids dot org ! just does n't roll off the tongue like the old zip code but the kids are just as endearing and dorkycharismatic , with chubby buzz the new bernadette and the show is still wonderfully noneducational \( unless you count introducing vulnerable children to mime the practice is really worth it , and it s an easy way to entertain your friends ! \) for all i know , it s possibly too innocent for your average 10yearold , that jaded creature raised on gossip girls and grand theft auto but if it s not zoom classic , that s ok ubits stubill gubood fubun photo on the new zoom , from left , rachel , estuardo , kaleigh \( rear \) , matt , caroline , aline and garrett \( photo by mark ostrow wgbh educational foundation \)

london handwringing diplomats on both sides of the atlantic are saying that it seemed like such a good idea at the time they are having second thoughts about this week s fullfledged state visit of a us president to the united kingdom the invitation was made two years ago by prime minister tony blair , when america was popular as a sept 11 victim , but the visit will begin at a time when both blair and president bush are being reviled in europe for joining forces to overthrow a dangerous tyrant because finishing that job is costing more in blood and treasure than was foreseen , the antianywar crowd is up in arms in trafalgar square , apostles of cutandrun have put up stopthewar signs \( as if we are n't trying to \) they are reported to be planning a demonstration , including the great photoop of pulling down a mock statue of george bush in front of bbc and al jazeera cameras add to this the usual grumbling about traffic jams that are already beginning as barriers are put up and a thousand american officials and journalists descend on britain with security requirements not to mention complaints about the cost to the crown of providing accommodations at buckingham palace and you have pressure to cut the visit short or to curtail the activities blair is having none of that though under fire from many in his labor party , he has made certain that the visit will proceed with all the trimmings that are safe he is determined to underscore what churchill called the special relationship between the us and its mother country nor is bush apologetic about being her majesty s official guest at a time of trial on the contrary , in pretrip interviews with the quality british press that triggered some stalwart editorial support , he delivered the message he refined in his age of liberty speech that our necessary global war on terror cannot be separated from the political struggle to extend human freedom his halfhour advance interview with sir david frost was telecast here yesterday morning frost asks penetrating questions in a respectful manner , which is the best way to open up bush the response showed britons an american far more rational , articulate and idealistic than the cowboy caricature of the leftist , eurocentric press when asked about potential changes in a second term , bush only said he would talk to cabinet members after the election , but made an unequivocal commitment on his running mate cheney s for certain his reelection would augur consistency in foreign policy a return to appeasement is not in the offing british viewers were more interested in what blair s unwavering support of the coalition meant for britain s key role as a bridge between continents first test would the us treat the proposed independent european defense force as undermining nato \? bush s answer was to trust completely tony blair s assurance to the contrary i take his word for it and as to the british captives being interrogated at guant namo a source of irritation here bush indicated that something would be worked out on this trip officials at the antiisrael bbc , which has long blatantly sided with palestinians in its middle east coverage , must have been stunned at the next answer asked if america s support of israel obstructs peace , bush recalled the hopes raised when palestinians chose abu mazen as the prime minister who would confront terrorism bush said he had then advanced the idea of two states side by side i trusted abu mazen i said to sharon , 'listen am i out there by myself \? ' the israeli prime minister said he was with him progress was being made , bush told frost about abu mazen , and he was shoved out telling it as he sees it in this case , showing how yasir arafat , not ariel sharon , is the roadblock to the road map curries no favor with protesters , many of them muslim but it is what bush believes to be true , and he says what he believes history will respect that in britain this week , two statesmen are tying their white ties without pomp in tough circumstances , united in taking the political heat like the allies they lead , they have been through the wars together
scott seelagy and a friend eagerly set out about sunrise tuesday on their second day of bear hunting after lunch , the two men were separated on hamburg mountain in sussex county , nj as night fell , mr seelagy found himself trapped in icy , waistdeep water in a swamp next to a golf course named irony of ironies black bear golf club thanks to his cellphone and 12 gauge shotgun , a police officer who recalled coldweather survival training in the marine corps and a band of rescue workers who slogged through frigid water , mr seelagy was saved from the bog but his experience was a reminder that it was not just the bears who faced peril during new jersey s first bear hunt in 33 years i never really panicked to the extent i said , 'oh my god , i'm going to die , ' mr seelagy , deputy mayor of sparta , nj , said yesterday from his bed in morristown memorial hospital but i was worried i was going to lose my feet , or at least some toes his ordeal was the most harrowing reported for hunters as new jersey s black bear hunt entered its third day yesterday martin j mchugh , the director of the division of fish and wildlife , reported that 66 bears were killed on the hunt s second day tuesday and another 36 dead bears were hauled to the state s seven bear checkin stations through midafternoon yesterday , bringing the twoandahalfday total to 218 he said state officials had no plans to stop the sixday hunt before its scheduled end saturday before he was rescued , mr seelagy \( pronounced salaygee \) , a 42yearold lawyer and father of two , spent about three and a half hours in the swamp , much of the time in the frigid water he called his wife , kimberly , by cellphone from the swamp about 5 pm to ask her to call the police a rescue party was mobilized , and eventually grew to about 50 firefighters and ems workers from seven rural towns about 8 15 , mr seelagy said , he was pulled from the bog on a wiremesh sled , dripping wet , his legs and feet numb , and airlifted by helicopter to the hospital seven of his rescuers who trudged through the icy waters were treated for exposure tuesday night in two area hospitals and released , officials said mr seelagy said he knew none of their names but would learn them and thank each personally i'm grateful to every one of them , he said in a telephone interview they risked their lives , their health and their safety for me he was reported in fair condition at the hospital the 66 bears killed tuesday included 44 females and 22 males , continuing the first day s pattern , when 76 females and 40 males were killed mr mchugh said the biologists believe that most pregnant bears and those with cubs are in dens and that the females afield are mostly younger ones looking for food hunters are barred by law from disrupting dens , he said rules of the hunt let each of the 5 , 300 permitted hunters to kill one bear of any sex , age or size mr seelagy said he was a hiker , skier and golfer who just started hunting this year he said he became lost tuesday afternoon , then climbed to the top of a ridge and saw familiar sights in the distance , including the golf course he headed down for it and found himself in the middle of the brushy snowcovered swamp , which had looked like flatland as soon as he entered it , the ice crumbled with each step he took after mr seelagy called his wife and she called the police , police chief joe kistle of franklin , nj , and a patrolman , edward o'rourke , 30 , from neighboring hardyston , set out in the chief s car , its siren blaring through his cellphone , mr seelagy summoned them to a nearby golf course fairway then officer o'rourke found him in the pitch black , first by walking toward the noise as mr seelagy fired shotgun blasts , and then by blowing his police whistle , shining his flashlight , and yelling as mr seelagy directed him closer over the cellphone at one point in the swamp , they rested on a log and officer o'rourke opened his uniform shirt and placed mr seelagy s feet in his armpits to warm them , a technique he said he learned as a marine in the 1990 s eventually , other rescuers reached mr seelagy with the wire sled mr seelagy said he was eager to hunt again , but my wife says no
days before city and state officials are scheduled to narrow the design competition for the world trade center site to two architecture teams , larry a silverstein , the developer who holds the lease to the property , charged yesterday that rebuilding officials were ignoring his right to rebuild the site as he sees fit in a letter to john c whitehead , the chairman of the lower manhattan development corporation , mr silverstein also said that none of the current designs for the site meet the requirements set out by rebuilding officials or the projected future demand for office space in addition , he said , he believes that for safety reasons , the occupied parts of any building should be limited to no more than 65 or 70 stories significantly shorter than many of the proposed designs though the letter , dated yesterday , was addressed to mr whitehead , it was a shot across the bow of the entire rebuilding process and the political forces that are shaping it copies of the letter were sent to the governors of new york and new jersey , the mayor , officials of the port authority of new york and new jersey , and others the letter , laced with references to ways that mr silverstein could make rebuilding tough if not impossible , makes it clear that he and the port authority , which owns the site , disagree on some significant points mr silverstein said he controlled the insurance reimbursement funds from the destruction of the trade center , the only private source of funds for redevelopment rebuilding officials have privately disputed that assertion , saying that ultimately the port authority is entitled to the money mr silverstein says his lease gives him the right to rebuild if the buildings on the site are destroyed , but he and rebuilding officials disagree about exactly what he is entitled to rebuild a representative in mr silverstein s office said that he was traveling yesterday afternoon and could not be reached for comment howard j rubenstein , a spokesman for mr silverstein , said the letter was not intended to threaten the rebuilding effort or the officials managing it rather , he said , it is an effort to get this program moving effectively , utilizing the insurance funds that will come to him to rebuild he wants to work with the process so that the final product will meet the needs of downtown , mr rubenstein said in a phone call and a second letter to mr whitehead yesterday , mr silverstein sought to reassure him that he wanted to build spectacular , architecturally distinguished buildings that would restore the skyline and provide for active street life edward skyler , a spokesman for mayor michael r bloomberg , said that mr silverstein s voice was important in the rebuilding process , but was not the only voice matthew higgins , a spokesman for the development corporation , disputed mr silverstein s contention that many of the designs were not feasible we respect larry silverstein s opinion , along with the views of so many who have an interest in the future of the world trade center site , including the public , he said greg trevor , a spokesman for the port authority , said larry silverstein is an important stake holder in this process the port authority will certainly take his views into account the timing of mr silverstein s letter was notable on monday , eight officials representatives of the development corporation , the port authority , the mayor s office and the governor are scheduled to meet to choose two or more teams of architects as semifinalists in the design process for the trade center site they are expected to agree to request further work on designs by studio daniel libeskind , whose plan would create a memorial space in the excavated pit where the towers stood , and by think , a collaboration of architects whose favored plan includes two latticework towers devoted to educational , civic and cultural facilities according to officials who have been reviewing the designs , the libeskind and think plans have gained favor with the development corporation s siteplanning committee as well as with a plurality , at least , of city , state and authority officials the officials said the libeskind and think plans most gracefully combined space for a memorial to the victims with cultural venues , transportation centers and potential office and retail space whichever team of architects is chosen , mr silverstein said , he expects them to work with the architecture firm of skidmore , owings merrill , which he has hired to develop a plan for the site rebuilding officials expect to select the winning designer by the end of february rebuilding officials face an additional challenge in making their decision how much attention to pay to public comments that strongly favor a third plan , by foster and partners , that calls for giant , twinned towers evoking the original twin towers rebuilding officials have expressed consistent doubt that enough companies could be found to occupy the upper floors of buildings as tall as the original towers and mr silverstein says in his letter that rebuilding towers more than 1 , 000 feet high is not only unsafe but is also economic folly photo larry a silverstein , leaseholder on the world trade center site , says none of the designs meet projected requirements \( suzanne dechillo the new york times \)
isaac newton by james gleick illustrated 272 pages pantheon 2295 in this age of the doorstop memoir , the concreteblock life and times , the cannonballheft threevolume biography , who could possibly complain that a new biography is too short \? james gleick s isaac newton , however , merits that distinction mr gleick was acclaimed in 1987 for chaos , a lavishly illustrated and detailed account of an emerging science and its chief practitioners a great virtue of the book was that much of what he told us was completely new , to the general public and even to many scientists he had no literary forebears to build upon and so had to forge his explanations and descriptions from scratch , which he did brilliantly his 1992 biography of richard feynman , genius , offered a full account of feynman s scientific achievements , some of which were notably arcane and difficult to communicate to a popular audience mr gleick , however , had no trouble doing so who better than he , therefore , to write a scientific biography of newton \? and indeed , mr gleick has given us the man and his mind in their full craziness for newton was an inspired madman , a scientist whose genius was counterbalanced by some rather odd personality traits he had an overriding penchant for secrecy , sometimes writing in code and withholding many of his discoveries from publication , in some cases for decades he combined an apparent modesty \( if i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants \) with a selfrighteous hatred of anyone who dared to criticize him or to claim that they had anticipated one or more of his theories or inventions as leibniz did regarding the calculus when the priority dispute between them erupted in 1711 , each wrote anonymous tracts accusing the other of dishonesty it lies upon leibniz , in point of candor , newton wrote , to tell us what he means by pretending to have found the method before he had found it newton was gripped by a mania for alchemy , a passion for biblical exegesis and an obsession with the color crimson he at one point underwent what used to be called a nervous breakdown \( as mr gleick puts it , he veered at least once to the brink of madness \) along with all this , mr gleick presents an account of newton s science his formulations of the laws of motion and the inverse square law , the principle of universal gravitation , his explanation of diffraction , and so on much of this story is familiar to any educated person \( we understand space and time , force and mass , in the newtonian mode , long before we study them or read about them , mr gleick acknowledges \) and in consequence he devotes an overlarge portion of his account to putting newton into context and describing the theories of his predecessors , at times including figures of doubtful relevance an 11page chapter on the earthmoon system , for example , mentions not only aristotle , copernicus , kepler , galileo and descartes but also john wilkins , empedocles , julius caesar , francis bacon , herodotus , the venerable bede , the romish divines , the stoics , moses , christopher columbus and voltaire worse is the fact that mr gleick does not always interpret the theories of these predecessors correctly , especially those of the ancients he claims that the infinitesimal \( which he defines as a quantity smaller than any finite quantity , yet not so small as zero \) was anathema to aristotle whereas in fact aristotle embraced the concept , saying in the physics that in the direction of division every determinate magnitude is surpassed in smallness and there will be a smaller part mr gleick claims that the greeks had a principled resistance to mathematicizing our corruptible , flawed , sublunary world he continues , 'geometry belonged to the celestial sphere , whereas in fact geometry arose out of land surveying , and the term itself is greek for earth measurement mr gleick tells his story with an economy of language that often borders on terseness , as if there were only so many words in the writer s toolbox and a clear danger of running out of them before the tale ends occasionally , this leads to formulations of admirable compression and pithiness we deem the universe solvable the human mind , though bounded in a nutshell , can discern the infinite and take its measure but the same austerity with words does not serve mr gleick well when it comes to explaining some of newton s major discoveries the calculus , for example calculus is a staple of science , a methodology whose value to mathematics is analogous to that of valence theory to chemistry or dna to molecular biology it is a technique for finding the area under a curve , a moving body s rate of change or for computing other values , but exactly how it accomplishes these miracles is not adequately explained by mr gleick , who in the end resorts to gnomic metaphors differentiation and integration are the same act , inverted the procedures seem alien , one from the other , but what one does , the other undoes time and space joined speed and area two abstractions , seemingly disjoint , revealed as cognate this might make sense to someone already steeped in the calculus , but it leaves a neophyte none the wiser as literature , mr gleick s book is elegant , even jewellike he does not waste a word but as science writing , too much of the book is written in epigrams , and the clarity of its explanations suffers as a result photo james gleick \( beverly hall pantheon \)
since 9 11 the world has felt increasingly fragmented reading the papers , one senses that many americans are emotionally withdrawing from the world and that the world is drifting away from america the powerful sense of integration that the gogoglobalizing 1990 s created , the sense that the world was shrinking from a size medium to a size small , feels over now the reality , though , is quite different while you were sleeping after 9 11 , not only has the process of technological integration continued , it has actually intensified and this will have profound implications i recently went out to silicon valley to visit the offices of google , the world s most popular search engine it is a mindbending experience you can actually sit in front of a monitor and watch a sample of everything that everyone in the world is searching for \( hint sex , god , jobs and , oh my word , professional wrestling usually top the lists \) in the past three years , google has gone from processing 100 million searches per day to over 200 million searches per day and get this only onethird come from inside the us the rest are in 88 other languages the rate of the adoption of the internet in all its forms is increasing , not decreasing , says eric schmidt , google s ceo the fact that many internet companies are in a terrible state does not correlate with users not using their products verisign , which operates much of the internet s infrastructure , was processing 600 million domain requests per day in early 2000 it s now processing nine billion per day a domain request is anytime anyone types in com or net and you ai n't seen nothin' yet within the next few years you will be able to be both mobile and totally connected , thanks to the pending explosion of wifi , or wireless fidelity using radio technology , wifi will provide highspeed connection from your laptop computer or pda to the internet from anywhere mcdonald s , the beach or your library says alan cohen , a vp of airespace , a new wifi provider if i can operate google , i can find anything and with wireless , it means i will be able to find anything , anywhere , anytime which is why i say that google , combined with wifi , is a little bit like god god is wireless , god is everywhere and god sees and knows everything throughout history , people connected to god without wires now , for many questions in the world , you ask google , and increasingly , you can do it without wires , too in other words , once wifi is in place , with one little internet connection i can download anything from anywhere and i can spread anything from anywhere that is good news for both scientists and terrorists , proamericans and antiamericans and that brings me to the point of this column while we may be emotionally distancing ourselves from the world , the world is getting more integrated that means that what people think of us , as americans , will matter more , not less because people outside america will be able to build alliances more efficiently in the world we are entering and they will be able to reach out and touch us whether with computer viruses or anthrax recipes downloaded from the internet more than ever the key point is not just whether people hate us , says robert wright , the author of nonzero , a highly original book on the integrated world the key point is that it matters more now whether people hate us , and will keep mattering more , for technological reasons i do n't mean just homemade wmd s i am talking about the way information technology everyone using email , wifi and google will make it much easier for small groups to rally likeminded people , crystallize diffuse hatreds and mobilize lethal force and wait until the whole world goes broadband broadband a much richer internet service that brings video on demand to your pc will revolutionize recruiting , because video is such an emotionally powerful medium ever seen one of osama bin laden s recruiting videos \? they 're very effective , and they 'll reach their targeted audience much more efficiently via broadband none of this means we , america , just have to do what the world wants , but we do have to take it seriously , and we do have to be good listeners we , america , have to work even harder to build bridges , argues mr wright , because infotech , left to its own devices , will make it so much easier for small groups to build their own little island kingdoms and their island kingdoms , which may not seem important or potent now , will be able to touch us more , not less
it s a warm spring day , and i'm hurtling around a bend coming dangerously close to the edge of a leafy , treelined road somewhere in the hudson valley i drop the car down a gear and , glancing out the window , spot a strange object in a nearby field rising from the earth is a dramatic weldedsteel pyramid the size of a smallish apartment building hollow , in the shape of a capital a , you can

reveals at least 10 such parks around new york city , many with firstrate works by outstanding artists ranging from the late 19th century to the present new york has the pick of them , although new jersey and connecticut also have worthwhile sites surprisingly , few are well known to the public although sculpture has been displayed outdoors since ancient times , sculpture parks and gardens have a relatively recent history as a premodern phenomenon , they derive from the european gardens of the renaissance and baroque in which statuettes aligning low colonnades were used to mark barriers throughout the greenery as a modern phenomenon , the idea derives from artists of the early 20th century , like hans arp , henry moore and barbara hepworth , who were attuned to sculpture s relationship to the outdoor environment in this country , sculpture parks and gardens are a fairly recent idea the first was reputedly brookgreen gardens , in south carolina , southwest of myrtle beach , built in 1931 by archer huntington to house the lifesized figurative bronzes of his artist wife , anna hyatt huntington , along with other artists working in the classical tradition it was followed shortly after , in 1939 , by the sculpture garden at new york city s museum of modern art since that time , many splendid sculpture parks , museums and gardens have opened all over the country partly , they 've arisen from a need for expansive outdoor areas to show earthworks and monumental metal sculpture , which came into their own as an art form in the 1960 s , and partly from a realization that the outdoors can enhance the experience of viewing sculpture the open spaces , and changing wind , light and weather conditions combine to create a setting unrivalled by any museum

in the early 1980 s , tony margolis would languish at his second home , on the gulf coast of florida , and construct a fantasy familiar to anyone who has ever been on a vacation what if you just never returned to wherever it was you came from \? mr margolis had an accomplice in these imaginings his business partner bob emfield , who lived down the shore from him , on bonita beach we started kidding around about this guy who did n't have to go home , who never had to leave the beach , mr margolis said when he needed beer money , he 'd go into his closet and pull out a shirt , one of many , from a seamstress he 'd met in borabora he 'd sell it to a friend , and make whatever he needed to get by mr margolis and his partner never gave up work to sit permanently under a straw umbrella sportswear executives , they started three separate men s wear lines in 1992 , one meant for the man whose sense of abandon had freed him of ever having to file another expense report they called the label tommy bahama a third partner , lucio dalla gasperina , designed the line , which consisted primarily of silk hawaiian shirts by the end of 1993 , its first year in business , tommy bahama had generated 35 million in sales the following year , the figure nearly tripled today , the company operates 32 stores around the country , and annual sales exceed 300 million , mr margolis said that is about 100 million more than the yearly revenues for sean jean \( the partners' two other lines , one geared toward skateboarders and the other bearing the unfortunate name linguine bob , were failures \) tommy bahama has met with such success that this month oxford industries of atlanta acquired the brand \( and its parent , viewpoint international \) for 325 million the new capital will allow for 30 new tommy bahama stores , selling not just polo shirts and washed silk trousers but plates and bed linens , to open over the next three years , said mr margolis , who will continue as chairman from his office overlooking bryant park in manhattan to some , tommy bahama may conjure images of middleincome actuaries , yet the clothes have shown up at charity polo matches in greenwich , conn , and in the dining rooms of exclusive country clubs like piping rock on long island at the nassau country club in glen cove , ny , the head golf pro , andrew pohalski , said that in the last few years , the clothes , worn mostly for afterthefairway lounging , have sold out in the club s shop i do n't always want to order a lot because i'm apprehensive about it , he said then they 're the first clothes to sell out the enduring appeal of island kitsch \( remember trader vic s \) may in a way be responsible for tommy bahama s success in that demographic stratum there are so many parties out here themed toward the tropics , said tom tinling , manager of rothman s , a men s shop in southampton , ny people come in , and they want tommy bahama the company has worked to attract the more upscale man as well in the midtolate 1990 s , motivated in part by its wish to distinguish the line from competitors' knockoffs , it began to buy fabrics in europe and to use more muted prints , mr dalla gasperina said two years ago , it began to run ads in magazines like w and town country in retrospect , it hardly seems that the early 1990 s were auspicious for a new clothing line embracing visions of lassitude status attached to professionals who worked the hardest the hightech world was beginning to flourish , and the era quickly produced an aesthetic that telegraphed the new premium placed on industry the machineage nylons and sleek economical lines advocated by prada caught on largely because the style made you look neurotically pressed for time but tommy bahama s initial emphasis on silk hawaiian shirts was not intended as an antidote to that cultural ethos rather , mr margolis said , the founders chose the style because silk could be imported cheaply besides brightly colored shirts with giant printed images of flora and fauna , the company offered loosefitting shorts and knit tops , none intended for the office the clothes first sold in small men s shops eventually they made their way to stores like saks fifth avenue in 1996 , the company opened its first store , in naples , fla , and included a restaurant , jamaican bay rum in theme the shop and dining room brought in 9 million that year , far surpassing expectations today , hawaiian shirts make up only about 20 percent of tommy bahama s business , the rest coming in part from slouchy pleated pants and an emerging line of women s clothes designed by a vanished star of 80 s fashion , christian francis roth when we opened the first store in naples , it was kind of a laboratory , mr margolis said what we found is that most who gravitated to it were not new york types , but midwestern types and canadian types no stores are in the northeast but the tommy bahama man is not so easily defined could he barbecue \? mr dalla gasperina said absolutely could he fly around in a private jet \? absolutely the company s founders refer to tommy bahama as an aspirational lifestyle brand , but the label is in some sense just the opposite , given that the term is used to denote fantasies of patrician breeding , or at the very least a cool , acquired urbanity tommy bahama dress shirts cost about 110 , 40 or so more than the average white cotton dress shirt at j press , but the brand is trafficking in the spirit of solid middleclass populism and nostalgia for a time when 5 pm was not thought of in the workplace as midafternoon all the clothes are cut generously enough to accommodate waistlines never reduced by personal trainers , and the line still has shirts emblazoned with sentiments like maximum martinis , minimum bikinis jim schutter , a realestate broker in chicago , is in some ways the company s typical and dream customer , because he wears tommy bahama not only to play golf but also to his office , when temperatures permit he does not exclude hawaiian prints from his professional wardrobe i have one of those stressful jobs , said mr schutter , who is 54 and the father of a 5yearold i'm a very conservative person , and this is my own small rebellion photos a tommy bahama huntingstyle jacket , a step away from the hawaiian shirt the company s founders , from left bob emfield , lucio dalla gasperina and tony margolis \( rebecca cooney for the new york times \) jim schutter , a realestate broker in chicago , in one of his many tommy bahama prints the store in naples , fla \( jake herrie for the new york times \) \( lexey swall for the new york times \)
with trade rumors encircling him like a halo , latrell sprewell taught the young , brash and underachieving los angeles clippers the art of shooting the basketball last night at madison square garden while the clippers were talking trash and making cocky gestures , sprewell was putting on a shooting display that would make allan houston envious setting league and franchise records , sprewell made all nine of his 3point attempts and scored a seasonhigh 38 points in leading the knicks to a 10592 victory his total of nine 3 s was an nba record for 3pointers in a game without a miss it was a knicks record for most made in a regulation game when you 're on like that , you just throw it up there , said sprewell , who made 14 of 19 shots over all some you 're looking at like , 'is that going to go \? ' and the next thing you know , it s in the hole there were a couple of those shots that did n't necessarily feel good leaving my hand , but it rattled home when you 're on and feeling it like that , anything is going in for you with the feb 20 trade deadline approaching , speculation about sprewell s possible exit from new york has been rampant having long been a subject on the rumor mill , sprewell has come to ignore the trade talk , and he said last night s performance was not his way of telling management not to trade him i do n't look at it as any kind of statement , sprewell said i'm just trying to play well if i could make any kind of statement referring to the whole trade situation , it s just that since i 've been off injured reserve , we 've been playing winning basketball the team is a couple of games over 500 , and we feel like we could be a lot better i think that s the real thing i would hang my hat on just the fact that we have been playing better as a team , not anything that i 've done individually the knicks are 2019 since sprewell returned from a broken right hand after missing the first eight games of the season they are 2126 over all heading into tomorrow s firsthalf finale against the threetime defending champion los angeles lakers , and just two games behind eighthplace washington \( 2425 \) in the race for the final playoff spot in the eastern conference despite the knicks' obvious improvement since sprewell s return , officials around the league insist that the knicks are looking to move him before the trade deadline that will not please knick fans , thousands of whom were chanting sprewell s name whenever he touched the ball in the final minutes last night sprewell s admirers can rest assured , however , because according to three league officials , the knicks' chances of trading him are slim in this age of the luxury tax when teams over the salary cap will pay a dollarfordollar tax this summer clubs are looking to dump longterm contracts , not add them sprewell , 32 , has three years and 405 million left on his contract they 're dangling sprewell all over the place , but it s going to be difficult to trade him , said one eastern conference general manager , who spoke on condition of anonymity none of the rebuilding teams are going to take him because of his contract the only teams that would take him are those that are making a push for a championship , those that feel that getting him might put them over the top but a team like that is not going to give you equal value because giving up a really good player would hurt them the notion of the knicks trading sprewell for players in the final year of their contracts does not make sense from a basketball standpoint it makes sense from a monetary standpoint in that it would lower their luxury tax but the knicks are so far over the salary cap \( more than 50 million \) that erasing sprewell s 12375 million salary will not give them much to spend on the free agent market so unless they get a topnotch player , the knicks are better off keeping sprewell they 're trying to trade sprewell , but they 're asking for an allstar in return , another eastern conference official said i do n't see that happening the knicks led for all but the first two and a half minutes last night , and with sprewell making two 3pointers , they went ahead by 14 in the first quarter down by 5547 at halftime , the clippers \( 1731 \) cut their deficit to 4 points early in the third , but sprewell made four 3pointers in scoring 17 points to lead a 2814 run over the next 10 minutes the previous nba record for 3pointers made without a miss was eight sprewell broke that mark with 4 minutes 45 seconds remaining he did not learn of the record until after the game , and when asked if he would have attempted another 3pointer if he had been made aware of the mark , he laughed and said , probably not that is also the answer to the question of whether sprewell will be traded this season photos latrell sprewell making yet another shot from behind the arc over all , he scored a seasonhigh 38 points \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg d1 \) elton brand guarded charlie ward , but the star of the game , and the trade rumors , was latrell sprewell \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg d3 \)

chesapeake , va , dec 4 the trial of lee malvo , the younger man accused in last fall s sniper attacks , moved into a new and crucial phase on thursday , as mental health experts tried to persuade the jury that he was insane at the time of the crimes a neuropsychologist described mr malvo as cheerful and goofy in a recent interview , an attitude he said was quite out of step with the seriousness of the situation an expert on deprogramming members of cults suggested that the relationship between mr malvo and john a muhammad , who has been sentenced to death for his role in the shootings , was a oneonone cult a social worker likened the two men to characters in the matrix , the science fiction movie robert f horan jr , the lead prosecutor , argued that some of the experts should not be allowed to testify at all and sought to limit the testimony of others he told the judge that none of the experts the defense presented or proposed to present could say mr malvo was insane in a legal sense we have an insanity defense that s like a puff of smoke , mr horan said there is no real claim that he was insane under virginia law the most defense experts had concluded in their pretrial reports , mr horan said , was that mr malvo s ability to tell right from wrong was severely impaired that was not enough , he said judge jane marum roush , in a comment from the bench , agreed with mr horan s description of the legal standard but still allowed the defense s first three expert witnesses to testify judge roush said the insanity defense required proof that mr malvo was categorically incapable of making the distinction i imagine someone is going to have to say at some point that the indoctrination in this case was so severe that it made mr malvo unable to know right from wrong , she said i would be sorely disappointed if there is no such testimony craig s cooley , a lawyer for mr malvo , responded , no more than i would be , and added that defense experts would testify that mr malvo was indeed insane in that sense still , thursday s testimony did not go that far mr malvo s iq , at 98 , is normal , said david schretlen , who teaches neuropsychology at the johns hopkins school of medicine and who spent a day administering tests to mr malvo in august but , professor schretlen said , his manual dexterity and the speed at which he processed information were abnormally low more striking yet , he continued , was mr malvo s lighthearted attitude during the interview mr malvo appeared goofy and strangely cheerful , he said that same attitude was apparent in court on thursday , with mr malvo sharing jokes and laughing with the courtroom deputies who guarded him he did describe himself as quite socially alienated , detached from other people , professor schretlen added he described himself as hypervigilant , suspicious of the motives of other people paul r martin , an expert on cults , had a rocky time on the stand , as judge roush sustained many prosecution objections to his testimony mr martin has not interviewed mr malvo and sought to discuss his own sevenyear experience in what he called a cult and about his work in deprogramming others who had been brainwashed mr horan objected , saying , there is no evidence of a cult in this case mr martin disagreed we call the situation a cult of one , he said defense lawyers withdrew mr martin from the stand and said they would ask him a different line of questions later carmeta albarus , a social worker , interviewed mr malvo for 70 hours in the last eight months she testified that mr malvo was initially very protective of mr muhammad , to whom he referred as his father they want to use me to kill my dad , ms albarus recalled mr malvo saying , and it will not happen mr malvo also said , to ms albarus and others , that his life and views could be understood by watching the matrix ms albarus did so i saw neo as lee , she said i saw morpheus as muhammad she was referring to the characters played by keanu reeves and laurence fishburne neo was 'the one , ' who was going to contribute significantly to changing the system , she said morpheus was to me the authoritative figure and the mentor mr horan objected frequently throughout the day , saying that evidence about mr malvo s background and psychological problems was being introduced in the wrong phase of the trial the jury is now considering his guilt if mr malvo is convicted , socalled mitigation evidence may be introduced by the defense in an effort to persuade the jury to spare his life they 're trying to use mitigation evidence on an insanity defense , mr horan said in the morning , judge roush issued an order barring lawyers in the case from talking with reporters she said the defense lawyers' outofcourt statements were improper i think it s an attempt to reach the jurors or the jurors' families , she said i'm putting an end to these press conferences the ruling was prompted by the publication in the washington post on thursday of a letter from mr malvo to a niece of mr muhammad the letter , which judge roush had declined to admit into evidence on wednesday , was written last summer , months before the shootings

new york city education officials have quietly instituted a new mandatory high school admissions policy that allows students this year to apply to as many as a dozen schools but will admit them to only one the changes are intended to reengineer a system that for decades has given the city s brightest students multiple offers to attend some of the most popular schools while others ended up assigned to schools they never wanted officials said their plan would ensure that far more students are accepted to one of their top choices , and that any student who applied to 12 was virtually guaranteed a seat in one of them some parents said they feared that it would limit choices , especially for better students the new system will not affect admissions at the six prestigious high schools that accept students based on an entrance exam , or at la guardia high school , which judges applicants by audition or a portfolio of artwork but admission to more than 200 other high schools will be decided by a computer using a complex formula intended to match student preferences with the schools they are qualified to attend schools will retain their admissions criteria , be it grades , an audition or simply a lottery , and will prepare a ranking of the students they want final assignments will be decided by computer schools chancellor joel i klein said in an interview yesterday that the new system , modeled on the method used to assign medical school graduates to residency programs , was the most efficient way of matching students to high schools while distributing opportunities as fairly as possible i have a chronic shortage of good high schools , mr klein said i am trying to maximize what s good for 80 , 000 kids in the system that s my obligation he added , the city of new york has gone to the model that is recognized by virtually any economist as the welfaremaximizing model the city s department of education , which often holds news conferences to announce big changes , did not publicly announce the new admissions formula , which will determine placement of about 100 , 000 incoming ninth and tenth graders applications will be distributed to students in midoctober and must be returned by midnovember in january , students will get a confirmation sheet , allowing them to adjust their choices under the old system , students received their admissions results in march , and students on waiting lists were given final decisions in april or may this year , some students will get admission offers in march , along with acceptances to the exam schools the remaining students will get results in april , and those that are still not matched to a school will be asked to submit another application there will no longer be any waiting lists peter kerr , a spokesman for mr klein , said yesterday that officials felt that efforts to publicize the changes within schools and at recent high school fairs in queens , brooklyn and staten island had adequately spread the news city officials insisted that the new process would give students more choices than ever before they can now apply to up to 12 programs , said john lee , executive director of student enrollment , planning and operations that s seven more than they were able to apply to last year some parents and guidance counselors who are just beginning to hear about the changes said they feared that the new system would restrict choice for many students , who have until now applied to high schools much in the way students apply to colleges you can choose to put 12 down , but when push comes to shove , they have placed you in just one school and you do n't have a choice anymore , said pamela wheaton of insideschoolsorg , a web site run by a nonprofit group , advocates for children alvin e roth , a harvard economist and one of the leading experts on such matching systems , said he agreed with the chancellor s assessment that the school system as a whole would benefit from the new admissions process , but , he said , some people were bound to be disappointed what i ca n't say is that it would be absolutely better for everyone , he said i think it s going to be better for many people it s going to be better for the city but i ca n't say that everyone will be better off because some people benefit from the private dealing , some people benefit from the inefficiencies the new application process is described in a high school directory that was distributed to students last month , mr kerr said , and a flier answering questions about the program was sent home to parents by junior high school principals we felt that all these activities were sufficient and that it was not necessary to make a general announcement to the public because this was after all a narrowcast announcement to eighth and some ninth graders and their parents , mr kerr said education officials pointed to a number of flaws in the old admissions process in many cases , a high school would simply not consider applications from students who did not rank it as their first choice

being an american chief executive means seldom having to make a financial sacrifice as stock prices remained submerged , many experts expected companies to compensate their top officers with more stock but fewer stock options last year , companies came through on the first part they handed out more stock over all in the form of restricted shares , helping their executives lock in some value but almost all of them also continued to give out options , according to a survey of 200 companies by pearl meyer partners , a pay consulting firm in new york although the average value of the grants fell along with the tumbling market , more than 40 percent of the companies giving grants raised the number of options they awarded , which could mean lucrative returns for their holders in a big market turnaround we 're not seeing much of a cutback at all in equity compensation , said ann yerger , deputy director of the council of institutional investors in washington though some executives are earning less incentive pay based on performance , she said , companies are making up for almost all , if not all , of that decline with restricted stock awards and continued options grants at the clorox company , g craig sullivan received 375 million in restricted shares he did not receive any in 2001 but he also received three times as many options in fiscal 2002 , a year in which the company s profit was little changed mr sullivan received 11 million options with an estimated value of 144 million , up from 325 , 000 options , worth 49 million , in fiscal 2001 , according to pearl meyer delta air lines gave leo f mullin 2 million in restricted shares he , too , did not receive any in 2001 he also received 963 , 000 options with an estimated value of 9 million , compared with 200 , 000 options in 2001 , estimated to have been worth 38 million at abbott laboratories , miles d white received 115 million in restricted stock and 635 , 000 options worth 112 million all told , the company s proxy statement shows , the five highestpaid executives at abbott received restricted shares worth a total of 31 million , up from 26 million in 2001 together , they also received options on 17 million shares , up from 12 million in 2001 abbott s shareholders , meanwhile , suffered a loss of 27 percent last year of the 200 large corporations surveyed by pearl meyer , more than half , 104 , gave their chief executives restricted shares last year slightly fewer than half , 97 , did so in 2001 all told , the restricted shares and other longterm incentives handed out last year were worth 185 million , up from the 177 million in 2001 the average value received by each chief executive was 17 million , down from 18 million in 2001 , but the share of total pay it represented rose to 163 percent , from 14 percent shareholders have long criticized restricted stock as free shares , given with no link to company performance a decade ago , such stock was even less popular with shareholders than options are now , consultants said the shares , which usually vest gradually over several years , drew scorn because they rewarded executives even if the stock price fell and did not recover restricted stock is making a comeback because some executives , feeling burned by an overreliance on stock options , want a less risky form of pay at many companies , restricted shares also offer a steady dividend stream holders of restricted shares earn dividends on them even before they can claim ownership of the shares and some reformers also came to see virtues in restricted stock , because the executives lose when the shares fall , just as shareholders do that better aligns the interests of shareholders and executives , supporters have asserted some companies did make a big shift away from options last year bank of america gave its chief executive , kenneth d lewis , 164 , 624 restricted shares worth 113 million he received none in 2001 each of those shares currently pays a quarterly dividend of 64 cents , making the grant worth an additional 421 , 437 in annual dividends to mr lewis his options grant was reduced to 200 , 000 from 750 , 000 in 2001 , a drop in estimated value of more than 10 million , according to pearl meyer bank of america wanted to really create transparency around executive compensation and how it s tied very specifically to performance and shareholder return , said eloise hale , a company spokeswoman still , 176 of the 200 companies gave their chief executives stock options last year , compared with the 104 that gave restricted stock that was about the same ratio as in 2001 with the stock market down , the average estimated value of those grants declined to 63 million , from 91 million in 2001 , and the average number of shares granted slipped about 4 percent , to 516 , 030 but 76 of the 176 companies that granted options gave more than the year before for the most part , options values are theoretical at the time the grants are made options give their holders the right to buy shares at a set price , usually the price of the underlying stock when the options were granted , during some future period if the stock price never rises above the exercise price , the options should expire worthless
washington , sept 13 when president bush informed the nation last sunday night that remaining in iraq next year will cost another 87 billion , many of those who will actually pay that bill were unable to watch they had already been put to bed by their parents administration officials acknowledged the next day that every dollar of that cost will be borrowed , a loan that economists say will be repaid by the next generation of taxpayers and the generation after that the 166 billion cost of the work so far in iraq and afghanistan , which has stunned many in washington , will be added to what was already the largest budget deficit the nation has ever known with a force that has surprised even critics of the administration , the iraqi occupation has pushed to the forefront a budget deficit that had previously existed mostly as an abstract red stain on democratic bar charts with no extra money available for the foreseeable future , real choices are being illuminated on capitol hill choices between electronic bombs and electrical grids , between low taxes now and lower retirement payments later should washington reconstruct iraq s schools and hospitals , lawmakers are asking , or america s \? should it pay for more than 100 , 000 american troops to stay in iraq , or for 40 million seniors to be offered prescription drugs through medicare \? and if it tries to do it all , should it keep cutting taxes \? the bush administration says it can do all of the above , once the tax cuts inaugurate a burst of economic growth democrats and virtually every mainstream economist say that something will have to give , very possibly the government s retirement promises to millions of aging baby boomers these questions have emerged as the most fundamental political issue dividing the two parties , affecting almost every vote on capitol hill and every speech in the current presidential campaign the deficit , once confined to congressional committee rooms and washington research organizations , has become a constant refrain among all the democratic candidates , who use it to attack the administration s tax cuts and financial stewardship \( none , however , have proposed a cutback in spending or a serious rethinking of bigticket entitlement programs \) the bleak choices now facing politicians and policy makers were hard to imagine when george w bush was inaugurated just 32 months ago , before the drastic turnabout of the federal budget as the decade opened , the overheated economy of the 1990 s had left the government with a flush of cash that seemed neverending there were 281 billion extra dollars in the budget that year , and the bush administration , looking a decade ahead , predicted that a cumulative 56 trillion surplus would build up by 2011 it seemed to be the brink of a golden era for washington , an unprecedented moment in history , in the words of the administration s first budget plan , issued a month after mr bush was inaugurated he vowed that almost all the national debt would be paid off and that retirement and health plans would be strengthened for the future by setting aside trillions in savings balanced budgets , so long in arriving , seemed to promise an end to wasteful interest payments and years of arguments pitting military spending against domestic programs and then , within months , the glittering promises crumbled the budget was upended by what economists now say were three independent forces gathering in power at once a steep economic decline , a political consensus to slash taxes and the effects of the 2001 terrorist attacks the surplus disappeared , replaced the next year with a budget deficit that has since grown to a record size the 56 trillion surplus once predicted for the 10 years ending in 2011 is now a 23 trillion cumulative deficit under the bestcase prediction issued by the congressional budget office two weeks ago the 8 trillion difference between those numbers has little precedent in american history the longterm budget forecast has declined as much in the last two years as the total revenue collected by the united states government from 1789 to 1983 a fall worthy of milton it really has been a miltonian experience , from the heights to the depths , said robert d reischauer , a former director of the congressional budget office , invoking paradise lost as a metaphor for the budget s fall the current fiscal year , which ends this month , was supposed to have ended with a surplus of 353 billion , the congressional budget office predicted two years ago today , the office says the year will end in a 401 billion deficit next year s deficit was projected to be 480 billion , but the new iraq spending will bring that to 540 billion or higher close to the 5 percent of the gross domestic product that many experts warn is a serious danger zone for the economy and now the painful effects of the budget s free fall are beginning to emerge though the deficit hardly spells ruin for the federal government , it already means spending battles over a variety of popular nonmilitary programs , from education to space flight to veterans hospitals to make room for the initiatives the administration favors like 15 trillion in tax cuts and at least 100 billion in new defense spending other programs are being squeezed more tightly than they have been in years
to the editor re losing a church , keeping the faith , \( oped , oct 19 \) andrew sullivan s witness to the intolerance of homosexuality in the roman catholic church makes me rage and cry at the same time , for the position of this church is so rife with contradictions it is no longer a secret that the christian church in the united states with the biggest investment in gays and lesbians is the roman catholic church they are scattered throughout the hierarchy , clergy and religious orders of men and women most are celibate , some have occasional relationships , and some have longterm relationships none of this is a problem , as long as it is kept a wellknown secret by its statements and actions against homosexuals , the catholic church wounds its own members and drives them away from the body of christ \( rev \) kenneth smits madison , wis , oct 20 , 2003 the writer is a capuchin franciscan priest
a new theory and a revised interpretation of earlier observations have bolstered the idea that mars has more water than previously thought and encouraged speculation about the possibility of life on the planet the new theory , identifying melting snow deposits as the likely cause of the many deep gullies on the planet , was announced yesterday at a briefing at the national aeronautics and space administration in washington photography from the mars odyssey spacecraft , orbiting the planet , inspired the suspected relation between melting snow and the gullies a week ago , other scientists reported new studies showing that both martian polar regions are capped almost entirely with ice , enlarging the planet s known reservoir of water until recently , the huge southern cap was thought to be predominantly , if not entirely , frozen carbon dioxide , or dry ice in yesterday s report , dr philip christensen , a planetary scientist at arizona state university in tempe , proposed that many of the eroded gullies on mars were probably carved by water from melted snow flowing beneath a thick covering of packed snow as a protective blanket , the covering was said to have warmed the deeper snow , thawing some of it and sheltering the flowing water from refreezing or evaporating in the thin atmosphere dr christensen said spacecraft photographs showed many gullies on the slopes of craters in the planet s midlatitudes they appeared to be emerging from under remnants of extensive snowpacks as dr christensen explained , snow on mars is most likely to accumulate most heavily on the coldest , polefacing slopes , as seen in the photographs the snow would presumably collect over the landscape through a period of deep cold , then would melt as the climate warmed melting begins first in the most exposed area right at the crest of the ridge , he said this explains why gullies start so high up over time , geologists said , the flowing water left deep cuts in the surface in places thought improbable , like the crests of hills among the suggested explanations were seeping groundwater , pressurized flows of groundwater or carbon dioxide and mudflows from collapsing permafrost none of these gained much support but dr john mustard , a planetary geologist at brown university , called the meltingsnow hypothesis very interesting and compelling and said it presented a fundamentally new perspective on the origin of martian gullies the research report is to be published soon in the journal nature , but is already available on the journal s web site \( www nature com nature \) biologists were particularly encouraged by the interpretation one of them , dr lynn rothschild of nasa s ames research center in mountain view , calif , said the possibility of liquid water on mars right near the surface was intriguing evidence that some forms of life could exist on the planet dr christensen said of the gully landscapes , if life ever existed on mars , i can think of no places where it would be more interesting to look for it in separate research , scientists at the california institute of technology in pasadena said they had found evidence to correct a decadesold model of what the martian polar caps were like when the first spacecraft flew close to mars , in 1965 , it determined that the planet s atmosphere was largely carbon dioxide scientists concluded that the two huge polar ice caps were frozen carbon dioxide even after a viking spacecraft in the 1970 s showed that the north polar caps contained water ice under a veneer of dry ice , scientists continued to believe that the south polar cap was dry ice now there is evidence to the contrary dr andrew ingersoll of caltech and his graduate student shane byrne reported in the feb 14 issue of the journal science that new spacecraft data revealed that both polar caps were made mostly of frozen water examining pictures and infrared measurements of the polar caps , the researchers found wide and deep pits in the upper layer of frozen carbon dioxide the pits penetrated to lower ice , which was too warm to be dry ice and so must be frozen water , the scientists said photo photos hint at plentiful water on mars the theory gullies on crater walls were formed by water from melting remnant snowpacks \( arrow \) \( nasa \)
the roman catholic church has detailed provisions , honed by centuries of sometimes painful experience , that regulate the election of popes it has virtually no provisions for the very modern problem of aging and physically or mentally declining popes that point is raised every time pope john paul ii , who is 83 , shows new signs of the degenerative parkinson s disease that afflicts him or of the other ailments bestowed on him by age and an attempted assassination arriving in slovakia on thursday , he could not continue delivering his talk at the airport , and again yesterday another vatican official had to read the homily the pope meant to deliver at an openair mass some catholics take exception to any discussion of papal infirmities as though it were an attack on the pope s leadership but in a world where the blessings of medicine are often shadowed by prolonged mental as well as physical incapacitation including senility , alzheimer s or coma it seems that the church has to address the question , not as a comment on this papacy but as an institutional reform for future ones indeed , there are two questions what to do in the emergency case of a pope so incapacitated he could not carry out his duties \? and how to make such an emergency much more unlikely \? popes can , of course , resign if they recognize their debilitation as recently as 1996 , pope john paul ii issued a document largely dealing with papal elections that also specified some conditions for a valid resignation there have been rumors that he has himself secretly readied a document to be issued when he no longer feels capable of his work but every time the possibility of a healthrelated resignation is raised publicly , whether for this pope or any other , it is swatted down by vatican officials such a precedent , they believe , would encourage a papacy s critics to press for a resignation less on grounds of health than opposition to the pope s policies in any case , resignation is no solution to the problem of mental incapacity , whether that developed gradually or suddenly through injury or stroke mental incapacity or intimidation would render any resignation invalid or , in a borderline case , suspect in a way that could create a crisis in the church church law indicates that special rules should apply in the case of the papal office being impeded but no such special rules have ever been promulgated what standard would be used to determine if a pope s mental condition rendered him impeded \? and who would make that determination \? this is a rather serious vacuum in the church s constitutional law , wrote the rev james h provost , a professor of canon law at catholic university of america his article , what if the pope became disabled \? appeared three years ago in an issue of america , the weekly magazine published by the jesuits , shortly after father provost s death the best the church could do , father provost suggested then , was rely on parallel cases , like the incapacitation of diocesan bishops \( the pope , after all , is bishop of rome \) bishops are judged impeded if they can no longer communicate , either orally or in writing still , that approach can go only so far since there are no real parallels to the office of pope in the catholic church thus , it would seem prudent to minimize the chances of such a problem even arising some people have proposed a mandatory age of retirement or resignation for popes like the one for bishops the pros and cons of this proposal were briefly examined by the rev john jay hughes , an emeritus professor of history at st louis university , in another article published in 2000 in america one worry is that the lingering aura of a retired pope might cast a shadow over the authority of his successor , or even that a retired pope could exercise an active role in the choice of that successor on the other hand , the power of medical science to prolong a pope s life almost guarantees periods of paralysis or decline for the church , if not outright disaster if bishops are asked to resign at 75 , father hughes wrote , would it not be reasonable to request the same of the bishop of rome five years later \? then he reminded readers that a papal age limit would probably have precluded the election of pope john xxiii , the man so many people , noncatholics as well as catholic , consider a saint , who was about to turn 77 when elected also sometimes discussed is the idea of a set term for popes , say 10 , 12 , or 15 years one advantage would be to make younger men more eligible for the papacy after a long papacy like john paul ii s , who was elected at age 58 in 1978 , the cardinals choosing a successor are wary of selecting a younger man who might serve for an equally long time it is sometimes joked that any younger cardinal of papal timber should come to the conclave that will elect john paul s successor with a doctor s note saying that he has a serious heart problem in an age of global travel and global media , the pope has become the public face of catholicism when john paul ii was physically as well as intellectually vigorous the church benefited from that image even when he became , as cardinal jeanmarie lustiger of paris said a few years ago , someone increasingly a prisoner in his own body , his suffering conveyed a message of endurance and spiritual strength but if he , or any pope , should become manifestly mentally enfeebled , the symbolism of his leadership would be drastically altered , as those who keep emphasizing that john paul has lost none of his intellectual acuity obviously recognize any changes in church law regarding an incapacitated pope , an age limit or a term limit will have to be made by the pope himself whether john paul applied them to himself or not , he could make them a final gift to the future church or his successor could establish the tone of his papacy by decreeing them within the first weeks of his election
it s time for people to show their cards , president bush said at a news conference at the white house on march 6 , not long before the decks of playing cards featuring the bush administration s most wanted among saddam hussein s associates appeared on the streets of new york that , said zachary levy , a freelance filmmaker , got him thinking many americans , he assumed , shared his frustrations about the administration s policies on a raft of issues , including the war , the environment and education who are the people in this administration anyway , mr levy , 29 , recalled wondering how many of them are really known to the people of the united states \? in may , mr levy asked two friends , ryan deussing and benjamin dailey , both filmmakers , to meet him for drinks at the john street bar near wall street he wanted them to help him create a deck of bush cards similar to the iraqi deck informative , not irreverent and including both highranking administration officials like defense secretary donald rumsfeld and lesser known figures like j steven griles , the deputy secretary of the interior who was once a lobbyist for the oil , gas and mining interests he now oversees the friends , none of whom has an mba or experience with business plans , agreed on three goals for their new venture to have fun , to create a new form of populist expression and to recoup their initial investment , less than 10 , 000 , charged to mr levy s mastercard five months later , they have accomplished all three , thanks in large measure to the internet and low overhead mr levy s onebedroom apartment on the upper east side is their office and warehouse the first shipment about 50 cartons , with a total of 3 , 000 decks arrived from carta mundi , a large playing card manufacturer in kingsport , tenn , during the last week of july the partners stacked them in the foyer and living room the place was so full , you had to walk in sideways , mr levy said then they sent an email message containing the web site they had created for their product , www bushcards com , to every friend and relative in their electronic address books can you pass this web site on \? was all the message said orders for about 10 decks arrived that day , mr levy said each of the 52 bush cards features a photo of an administration member and a quotation from the person or fact about him or her the ace of spades \?

when bartleby , the scrivener , is asked by his boss to help with some lawoffice drudgery , bartleby says what lowly employees everywhere long to say i would prefer not to despite his employer s attempts to change his mind , and to learn his reasons for turning down assignments , bartleby never says much more why do you refuse \? his boss asks i would prefer not to , bartleby replies placidly you will not \? his boss asks i prefer not , bartleby says bartleby , the mysterious hero of herman melville s famous story , resists not only specific projects , but the whole oppressive , joyless world of the wall street law firm that employs him he does n't make any sweeping ethical arguments he is no henry david thoreau melville s contemporary who urged people to let their lives be a counter friction to stop the machine but by quietly resisting what he is asked to do , bartleby shakes things up at the law firm until , that is , his life goes into its inevitable downward spiral melville wrote bartleby , the scrivener 150 years ago , in the late summer of 1853 the novella has proved to be one of his biggest successes , both critical and popular it has what all great literature has timelessness , and a depth that allows readers to find new things when they come back to it when i first read bartleby , with the 1960 s faintly lingering in the air , it struck me as a meditation on freedom , an existential yelp against oppressive social structures but rereading it now , in a world full of bad options that leave you yearning for none of the above , it feels like a cautionary tale bartleby s approach to life is pure , but untenable even when our choices are bleak , we have a duty to make the best ones we can the grim options offered by bartleby s office begin with the views a white wall deficient in what landscape painters call 'life , ' and a brick wall that offers at least , a contrast , if nothing more his job of scrivener , since made obsolete by the xerox machine , involves copying legal documents by hand when he is n't duplicating other people s words , he and his fellow scriveners are reading their copies back to one another to check for errors even bartleby s stodgy boss concedes that it is very dull , wearisome , and lethargic work that to people with sanguine temperaments might be altogether intolerable at first , bartleby completes assignments energetically but before long , when his boss asks for help with a small legal document , bartleby responds with the phrase that will become his mantra i would prefer not to his boss is taken aback , but there is much more to come bartleby turns down more work assignments he refuses to walk to the post office to check for mail before long , he refuses to leave the office at all , and starts to make it his home bartleby s boss an utterly conventional man who does a snug business among rich men s bonds and mortgages and titledeeds is oddly accepting of bartleby s almost mystical resistance rather than fire his recalcitrant employee , he keeps trying to persuade him to get to work in time , the boss moves his law firm out of the offices that bartleby haunts day and night when a new lawyer moves in , bartleby is taken away to the tombs , new york s aptly named prison bartleby continues his calm resistance there by refusing the food i prefer not to dine , he tells the cook his passivity eventually kills him , and the tale ends with a muchquoted exclamation ah bartleby ! ah humanity ! the story is , critics say , partly an allegory of melville s life as a writer when he wrote it , mobydick had just received a cool reception from the reading public , and melville was depressed at the thought of going back to writing more popular fare , like his sea stories typee and omoo the literary equivalent , for a philosophyminded writer , of scrivener work bartleby is also , clearly , a reflection of its age in the 1850 s , industrialization was creating a large number of factory and office jobs that were so dehumanizing that defenders of slavery tried to blur the distinction , referring to the bartlebys of the world as wage slaves i 've been thinking about bartleby lately , probably because my job compels me to follow world events the mess in iraq presents two seemingly unacceptable possibilities staying and having our soldiers killed daily , or leaving and ushering in chaos the only thing worse than confronting the north koreans about their nuclear weapons program , it seems , is not confronting them on the domestic front , omnibus bills in congress routinely tie the necessary to the intolerable after the blackout republican leaders refused to separate out a proposal to upgrade the power grid from a larger bill that gives the energy industry tax breaks , and the right to drill in alaskan wildlife preserves for californians , sending a strong message that the recall is an outrage means pulling the lever beside gray davis s name i have friends who now talk cheerily of selfimposed news blackouts , taken on to spare themselves the latest reports of corporate malfeasance , layoffs and killings of bus riders by suicide bombers in today s world of bleak alternatives , however , bartleby s story is a sobering reminder that what life requires is remaining engaged preferring , and acting on those preferences contemplating bartleby s sad end may give us some strength as we continue to stand up for troubling foreign policy options , settle for anemic legislative victories and vote for the lesser of two , or more , evils
mortals by norman rush illustrated 715 pages alfred a knopf 2695 norman rush s new novel mortals gives new meaning to henry james s description of a novel as a loose baggy monster mortals is a long , tedious and thoroughly haphazard production a kitchen sink of a book that possesses none of the pointillist detail of whites , the author s haunting debut collection of stories \( 1986 \) , and all the flaws of his 1991 novel , mating and more though mortals gradually gathers speed and focus near its conclusion , only the most persevering of readers are likely to slog through the book s 700odd pages to get there like mating and whites , this novel is set in botswana , where mr rush once worked in the peace corps , but africa turns out to be little more than a hollywood sound stage for the enactment of the hero ray s tiresome midlife crisis , his journey from selfabsorption and uxorious obsession , through pain and loss , toward redemption there are few vivid glimpses of the botswana that mr rush conjured with such vigor in whites and only passing glimpses of the social situation that ray and the other american characters find themselves in in africa instead there are oddly generic references to political and ethnic tensions in the country during the early 90 s and pages and pages devoted to the excavation of ray s character and emotional history , his relationship with his wife , iris , and iris s character and emotional history if ray were more of an engaging character or had the quirky intelligence and verbal idiosyncrasies of the unnamed narrator of mating this might make for livelier reading as it stands , we are stuck for the duration inside ray s head , or rather , since mr rush has opted for a stilted thirdperson narration , we are stuck inside a tiny , claustrophobic room with ray , one of the most narcissistic , selfdeluding and defensive heroes to come along in a while ray , we learn , is a schoolteacher and an operative for the central intelligence agency he used to fancy himself a milton scholar , but never buckled down to work and now thinks that had he stayed in america , he would have been nothing though iris hates his work for the agency , though ray has his own doubts about the agency s dirtier operations , he relishes the sense of power it imparts and the aura of mystery it creates around him mr rush describes ray s inner life like this he wondered if there was some quality common to death , women , and ufo s that made him want to not think about them he considered the question they were all similar , in a way , ontologically they were all entities that nothing could be done about the center of ray s daily existence is iris , and the first half of mortals is devoted to explicating their marriage in minute , blowbyblow detail ray is constantly making inventories of his wife s physical attributes her nose was of the essence of the type you could easily forget that it was a biological organ also it was europatrician that she flared her nostrils when she got incensed over something when he takes a bath with her , he thinks if only his love could travel into her mind physically , by pure resonance in some way , straight in , so she would feel it and know it her hair was perfect her body was heaven to him , the pastures of heaven , perfection despite \( or perhaps because of \) all this bad lawrentian writing , their marriage never seems like a real relationship it s hard to believe that after 17 years of marriage , iris and ray discuss their feelings about religion for the first time so you were a believer for how long \? or that they say things like i just wanted to touch voices when she calls him at the office to say hello given ray s relentless and highly possessive scrutiny of iris , it s also hard to believe that it has taken her nearly two decades to grow suffocated and restless when she announces that she is going into therapy with a doctor named davis morel , ray quickly becomes convinced that she is having an affair with him it just so happens in this highly contrived novel that morel is also the chief object of ray s attention as a cia operative in fact , ray has singled morel out against orders from his boss as a person of interest , and will make him his personal nemesis , someone he can focus on , in miltonian terms , as his great antagonist ray s plotting against morel will have serious political fallout on an array of sketchily depicted characters it will provoke an insurrection and result in the deaths of many innocents none of this is portrayed in remotely believable terms , and ray s efforts to sort things out which involve an arduous trek across the kalahari desert , reminiscent of a similar trek in mating feel similarly synthetic and contrived at one point , he strips off his clothes and straps a book manuscript to his chest , and impersonates a suicide bomber at another point , he confronts morel about iris while they are both being held prisoner by a renegade boer and a band of mercenaries these events are recounted in a ridiculously lumpy narrative that lurches awkwardly , in both tone and style , from romantic melodrama to political thriller to slapstick farce with all the grinding gear changes and unnecessary expenditures of energy of someone driving a car with manual transmission for the very first time a far cry indeed from the smooth and skilled performance that mr rush delivered in whites photo norman rush \( jerry bauer alfred a knopf \) \( pg e7 \)
washington , july 17 more details came to light today about how disputed language about iraq s possible designs on african uranium appeared in president bush s state of the union address the words in the january address were the subject of testimony before a senate committee on wednesday in his speech , the president said , the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa senior intelligence officials said today that in the closeddoor hearing on wednesday , alan foley , a cia expert on weapons of mass destruction , said he was asked by bob joseph , the director for nonproliferation at the national security council , whether the president s address could include a reference to iraq s seeking uranium from niger the officials said that mr foley s testimony indicated that he told mr joseph that the cia was not certain about the credibility of the evidence concerning niger and recommended that it be taken out of the speech the officials said today that , according to mr foley , mr joseph then asked him if the speech could instead include a reference to british intelligence reports that iraq was interested in seeking uranium from africa the government of prime minister tony blair included that information in an unclassified white paper on iraq and illegal weapons published last september according to intelligence officials , mr foley said he told mr joseph that the cia had warned the british that it was not sure about the information when the paper was published according to mr foley s account which the white house has said it could not confirm when mr joseph ultimately asked him whether it would be accurate to state that the british had reported that iraq was seeking uranium in africa , mr foley agreed however , mr foley did not tell the senate committee that he felt pressured by mr joseph , officials familiar with his testimony said mr foley s testimony about his conversations with mr joseph closely tracks with the version of events described last week by other cia officials , but his testimony conflicts with the version provided by the white house officials have said that mr joseph does not recall mr foley s raising any concerns about the credibility of the information to be included in the speech the conflicting recollections of the conversations between mr foley and mr joseph are now at the heart of the feud between the cia and white house over who is responsible for president bush s reference to disputed intelligence in one of his most important public speeches before the war with iraq a senior administration official , after checking with members of the national security council , today disputed mr foley s recollection , saying that none of the drafts of the state of the union ever contained a specific reference to niger the official said of mr foley s comments if that was the testimony , it is not an accurate accounting of events there was never at any time a mention of place or amount in any draft of the state of the union the only question mr joseph recalls discussing with mr foley was whether to rely on the language on the uranium used in the classified national intelligence estimate or the public british white paper an accurate accounting of events would show that the only conversation that took place was whether to use a classified or unclassified reference , a senior administration official said another senior official , at the white house , said nobody should be pointing fingers this was a case of two professionals just trying to do their jobs in the speech on jan 28 , the president referred to the fact that britain had received reports that iraq was seeking to buy uranium from africa , and never referred to niger three months earlier , at the insistence of george j tenet , the director of central intelligence , a specific reference to niger was removed from a speech mr bush gave in cincinnati just a week before that speech , the american intelligence agencies had described attempted purchases in niger and in somalia and congo in the national intelligence estimate provided to members of congress the question of whether that information was reliable and whether the white house pushed to make more of it than the facts warranted has gained significance in the growing debate over the bush administration s handling of intelligence before the war in iraq last week , mr tenet took responsibility for the dubious evidence getting into the state of the union speech , although he has said he did not read or review the speech the evidence concerning iraq s supposed interest in acquiring uranium from niger was discovered to have been based on false documents but today mr blair insisted that , because britain had other sources , it was confident of its report that mr hussein sought the material in africa on thursday , sen richard j durbin , an illinois democrat and a member of the senate intelligence committee , referred to the exchange between mr foley and mr joseph when he stated publicly that a white house official who had played a role in getting the uranium material into the state of the union address had been identified in wednesday s closed door hearing mr durbin suggested that the white house official had pressured the cia officer to approve the uranium reference it was clear to me that there were people in the white house who were in the process of negotiating with the cia , mr durbin said he called on the president to hold his staff accountable the president has within his ranks on staff some person who was willing to spin and hype and exaggerate and cut corners on the most important speech the president delivers in any given year , he said mr durbin s statements prompted an immediate rebuttal from the new white house press secretary , scott mcclellan , who said , i think that characterization is nonsense other democrats on the intelligence panel said they believed that mr tenet , who also testified before the senate on wednesday , has been taking responsibility to ease the political pressure on the white house i do n't think there is anyone who does not believe that george tenet has fallen on his sword here , said senator ron wyden , democrat of oregon and a member of the intelligence panel republicans reacted angrily to the accusations , suggesting democrats were trying to politicize the war and were nitpicking in their zeal to score political points , they 've sacrificed the national interest on the altar of partisan politics and are making accusations that are grossly offensive against the president , said senator mitch mcconnell of the kentucky , the secondranking republican in the senate meanwhile , officials said today that the documents now believed to be forgeries were obtained by the state department , which offered to have them reviewed by the cia but the cia did not do so until recently as a result , they were not determined to be forgeries until march
los angeles , sept 7 race and politics , two of the unsolvable riddles of california life , collided this morning at the corner of cesar chavez avenue and indiana street during the mexican independence day parade arnold schwarzenegger , who until two days ago was to be the grand marshal , was unceremoniously dumped when organizers rescinded his invitation instead , it was gov gray davis in attendance , the hero of the moment in the latino community for having signed a bill on friday that gives illegal immigrants the right to hold driver s licenses parade organizers said democratic politicians had put pressure on them to drop mr schwarzenegger , but mr davis s camp denied any involvement absolutely not , said peter ragone , the governor s spokesman we had no contact with anyone today s contretemps capped a week of racial pandering and wedgeissue politics in the california recall race that left none of the top candidates unstained mr davis was tagged by his critics as a toady to latinos and the far left when he signed the driver s license bill only a few months ago , before the threat of his recall , mr davis vetoed the bill because , he said , it lacked safeguards to stop criminals or terrorists from changing their identities by acquiring a california license it does not require a background investigation and other measures mr davis requested i am honored to have signed it , mr davis said today lt gov cruz m bustamante , who has run on the platform that the governor should not be recalled , but that if mr davis is recalled he is the best choice to replace him , opened the ethnic can of worms last sunday , when he accused mr schwarzenegger , an immigrant from austria , of being antiimmigrant mr bustamante , the grandson of mexican immigrants and the first latino elected to statewide office in california in a century , found himself accused of being a hypocrite as a state assemblyman in 1993 , he voted to deny driver s licenses to illegal immigrants , who had held the privilege for decades and mr bustamante was pilloried for exploiting the campaign finance laws to accept 15 million from an indian tribe that runs a casino today , mr bustamante announced in fresno that he had decided to resolve the questions raised by the republicans about my campaign finances , by spending the bulk of the 4 million in contributions he took from indians and big labor toward defeating proposition 54 , the initiative that seeks to limit the state government from collecting ethnic and racial data it will be on the same ballot as the recall on oct 7 mr schwarzenegger has yet to clear up confusion as to whether he briefly worked illegally when he first came to california in the late 1960 s mr schwarzenegger said last week in a news conference in riverside that he arrived in california in late 1968 on a visitor s visa and was not issued a temporary work visa until he landed his first movie role , in hercules in new york , which was shot in late 1969 mr schwarzenegger and a friend from europe , franco columbu , were brought to california by joe weider , the bodybuilding guru , who sponsored them , giving them a place to live and an 80 a week stipend the stipend was not enough to live on , said mr columbu , who arrived in santa monica in june 1969 mr columbu said last week in an interview that to make ends meet , he and mr schwarzenegger began a bricklaying and patio business called european brick works in 1969 mr schwarzenegger said today through a spokesman that they did not begin the venture until 1971 tom hiltachk , a lawyer for mr schwarzenegger , said today that his client arrived in the united states on a business visa in late 1968 , which allowed him to compete professionally as an athlete he was granted a temporary work visa in november 1969 and renewed it through june 1974 , when he was issued a green card , mr hiltachk said mr schwarzenegger became a naturalized citizen in 1983 at no time was mr schwarzenegger in the united states without a valid visa , mr hiltachk said his permanent residency and citizenship were granted by the ins without any concern to his visa status mr schwarzenegger often says at campaign appearances that he supports immigrants who do it the right way those who arrive legally , work hard and pay taxes he frequently reminds people that he was the penniless austrian farm boy who realized such fantastic dreams that he paid 15 million in taxes in 2000 and 2001 mr schwarzenegger says he would work to rescind the driver s license law if elected governor if some responses at the parade today are any indication , his appeals have not swayed many latinos schwarzenegger is a good actor but a bad politician , said leo alaniz , 43 , who was holding a placard that read , gracias davis no recall davis is going to win votes with the driver s license a man like mr alaniz would be a concern for the schwarzenegger campaign , except that he cannot vote he resides in california illegally , he said los angeles county alone is home to an estimated one million illegal immigrants , the vast majority of whom are mexican and while nearly half of the city of los angeles and onethird of the state is of hispanic descent , they constitute just 15 percent of voters whites , who make up half of the state s population , account for nearly threequarters of voters , with blacks at 6 percent and asians about 3 percent strategists for mr schwarzenegger say that their focus groups show that about 60 percent of voters will make immigration their determinant issue and because mr davis and mr bustamante supported the driver s license law , they risk alienating white swing voters , they say there s no question that davis flipflopped on the driver s license issue to shore up the left flank of his party , said arnold steinberg , a republican strategist but in doing that he loses the disaffected nonlatino democrats who are n't mexicanbashers , but are preoccupied by the overall net drain in services associated with them mr bustamante has nagging ethnic problems of his own he is still hounded by a gaffe he made in february 2001 in a speech before a black labor group according to newspaper accounts , the lieutenant governor was discussing the history of black labor unions and reciting the names of some of them that had negro in their titles when he uttered a racial slur instead mr bustamante apologized immediately and has done so repeatedly over the past two years for what he says was a humiliating mistake mr schwarzenegger s strategy of billing himself as the immigration reform candidate as well as the quintessential immigrant is not without its perils mr schwarzenegger freely admits that he voted for proposition 187 , a 1994 ballot initiative denying basic social services to illegal immigrants that was eventually struck down in court , but now says he considers some of its provisions to be draconian for instance , he says that he would not bar children of illegal immigrants from schools or hospitals , he said he wants it both ways , said bill carrick , a democratic strategist who is not involved in the recall race schwarzenegger wants to reach out to the angry white voters of the republican party who are most concerned about immigration this turns off latinos who the republicans are reaching out to on the other hand , he is saying to latinos , 'do n't worry about it , i'm an immigrant myself'
new york pays highest taxes , study finds a new york times headline this week it s what everyone suspected but did n't want to believe that new york s taxes are the highest in the land that s local taxes , as well as local and state taxes combined so says the citizens budget commission , and while its calculations do not include some of the most recent tax increases , its conclusions are not in dispute new york tops in taxes , thanks to all those public officials who ran on taxcut platforms why do n't new yorkers throw the bums out \? aha ! which bums \? find them , if you can the citizens budget commission presumes it has written a fiscal paper , but really has produced a guide to teflon politics new york has developed a nonstick system , one so fragmented that it insulates all but local politicians from traceable responsibility who , exactly , is to blame \? in albany , the governor and legislators set the standards for such highcost services as medicaid , education and pensions but they pay only part or none of the bill the burden falls on cities and counties , which either have to cut services or tax the people to satisfy the public , and meet albany s costly standards it s like ordering at a restaurant when somebody else is paying the bill , said charles brecher , research director of the citizens budget commission , a businessbacked research group its study highlighted something most new yorkers may not realize that while their local taxes are the country s highest , and their combined local state taxes are too , their state taxes are actually lower than in many other places new york s state taxes rank 29th in the country , with 68 per 1 , 000 of income going to state taxes that compares with a national average of 70 85 in california , 82 in michigan , 79 in connecticut , 74 in massachusetts add local taxes to the mix and the picture changes new york s local taxes are 72 percent above the national average , and its combined state and local tax burden are 26 percent above the national average because the governor and legislators push the burden down to local governments that practice no doubt eludes most new yorkers governors traditionally serve at least two , sometimes three , terms in new york , and legislators are virtually guaranteed reelection they protect their seats by controlling redistricting and getting generous campaign contributions from the special interests who want a friend in albany and voters keep reelecting incumbents because they bring home goodies and promise those costly services that local governments finance with high taxes the taxes that the very same voters resent the clearest example of what those taxes buy is new york s cadillac of medicaid programs , an old story going back to the days of gov nelson a rockefeller , a republican since the federal government picks up half of medicaid s bills and new york was already paying 100 percent of some health care , medicaid seemed like a bargain then , a windfall in washington money , even though the state had to pick up 25 percent of the cost and local governments in new york would pay the remaining 25 percent in distinction to most other states , which require no local contribution the program grew , local officials began screaming and have not stopped , the most recent cry coming from mayor michael r bloomberg but it s not just medicaid the pattern is broad nationwide , the average state share of localstate education spending is about 57 percent it s slightly under 47 percent in new york and albany sees to it that employees of local governments get generous pensions and fringe benefits paid for by local governments the legislature has a habit , just as congress does , of mandating costs they do n't have to pay for , said edmund j mcmahon , an analyst at the manhattan institute when the state legislature does things to drive up medicaid spending , it has to pay no more than a quarter on the dollar , 35 or 40 cents for longterm care the problem is , the legislature is able to garner political benefits from what they do without having to foot the whole bill and even those who run on a platform of conservatism , like gov george e pataki , do a little taxcutting and then get with the program as he geared up for his reelection campaign last year , mr pataki expanded medicaid by providing more people with even more services it s two steps back and one forward or vice versa , mr mcmahon said sort of like a dance the taxpayer shuffle

seven officers of the united states olympic committee yesterday demanded the resignation of the organization s president , marty mankamyer , saying that she had interfered improperly in the investigation into whether lloyd ward , the organization s chief executive , had violated its ethics code she no longer has our support and does n't have the necessary leadership skills to continue , bill stapleton , one of five vice presidents of the olympic committee who publicly demanded that mankamyer step down , said in a conference call with reporters the seven officials , all of whom are members of the organization s executive committee , said that if mankamyer did not step down , they would initiate the process of firing her , starting at a meeting of the executive committee feb 8 and 9 mankamyer , who said none of the officials had called her to request her resignation , said she would not quit we approach things in a different way , she said i think as we move forward we can work together she said the more pressing issue for her was a meeting in washington next week between olympic committee officials and senators ted stevens , republican of alaska , and ben nighthorse campbell , republican of colorado the senators demanded the meeting last week as discord engulfed the olympic committee over accusations of a conflict of interest by ward they said then that changes to the amateur sports act of 1978 might be required to mend the organization s governance problems i think that s going to be a turning point , mankamyer said the unrest on the committee prompted david f d'alessandro , the chairman of john hancock financial services , which is a worldwide olympic sponsor , to raise serious questions yesterday in a sevenpage letter to ward and mankamyer about how the committee raises and spends money , and how sponsorship fees are used it is no longer possible to overlook the seemingly nonstop turmoil and controversy that afflict your organization , d'alessandro wrote in the letter , a copy of which was obtained by the new york times in an interview , d'alessandro said of the olympic committee it s a dysfunctional family that keeps electing the daft cousin or uncle to the top job their bureaucracy must be blown up and restructured mankamyer is the organization s third president since 2000 ward is its fourth chief executive in three years the ultimatum to mankamyer , who was elected only six months ago , was related to the investigation of ward , who was accused of having helped his brother s company try to secure a contract for the coming pan american games after the 10person ethics panel ruled that ward s action created the appearance of a conflict of interest , the executive committee concurred , saying the only punitive action would involve the possibility of reducing ward s annual bonus , which comes to several hundred thousand dollars if he meets certain performance targets in the aftermath , one olympic committee board member , brian derwin , resigned , followed by the resignations of the organization s ethics compliance officer and three ethics committee members derwin , a supporter of mankamyer and a former olympic weight lifter , yesterday called the demand for her resignation an example of politics over integrity i hope she stays , derwin said i think she s right the demand for mankamyer to step down came from ward s powerful backers the five vice presidents of the olympic committee and the chairmen of its athletes advisory council and national governing bodies council the seven officials said yesterday that while ward had violated the olympic committee s ethics code , he did not deserve to be dismissed stapleton said the officials believe mankamyer s behavior put lloyd ward in a very unfair situation in a what amounted to an indictment of mankamyer s brief presidency and her involvement in the ward inquiry , the officers issued a fivepage statement that was bolstered by their remarks during the subsequent conference call with reporters they said in their written statement that mankamyer had orchestrated an antiward campaign to present the most damaging information and to present it in a way that would encourage the executive committee and the public to prejudge mr ward as unfit for continued employment they contended that mankamyer had used her position to undermine the ability of the ethics committee to conduct a fair review of ward the group said she used her control over executive committee meetings and agendas , along with the identification of select documents to present to the 21person executive committee , to undermine ward they also said in the statement that mankamyer had repeatedly raised questions about mr ward s character , his performance of his obligations as usoc chief executive and the process by which he was selected by a search committee to serve in that position the seven officials also accused her of having made inappropriate contact with the ethics committee mankamyer denied the accusations , and said that much of the dispute involved misunderstandings she said that her only contact with the ethics committee had been one telephone conference call with its members and she denied that she had tried to discredit ward i was on his selection committee , she said i supported him the demand for her ouster comes less than a week after the seven officers believed that she had agreed to resign they said their negative assessment of her management abilities had led them to ask her for her resignation in private on jan 12 mankamyer , who confirmed the chronology , agreed to resign the next day , and she asked that her departure be delayed until week s end by last thursday , though , she said , the resignations of derwin , patrick rodgers , the ethics officer , and the ethics committee members caused her to reassess the situation and to back off from resigning the whole landscape had changed , she said while the turmoil within the usoc is not new , it comes only four years after the salt lake olympic bid scandal , in which organizers lavished more than 1 million in cash and gifts on international olympic committee members but the current turbulence comes when new york is a candidate to play host to the 2012 summer olympics formal applications are not due until july with the ioc , which will make its final choice in 2005 in an analysis of how the wardmankamyer managerial war might affect perceptions of new york s bid by the ioc , d'alessandro said , i think the absolutely most dangerous thing that s going to happen is that the rest of the ioc is going to look at america and see a reason not to vote for new york but two members of the ioc said it may be too early to assess the impact on the new york bid richard w pound of canada said , i think the ioc is able to separate a dysfunctional national olympic committee from the candidacy of a big city like new york a second ioc member , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said they should get all this behind them at the earliest possible moment it s easy to make the connection between the problems at the usoc and the new york bid , but the decision is so far off
there is no seat for john ashcroft in the brooklyn courtroom where emile dixon , a convicted killer and crack dealer , is fighting for his life but as the jurors heard arguments last week about whether to impose capital punishment , mr ashcroft , the united states attorney general , was mentioned so often that he might as well have pulled up a chair this death penalty prosecution was ordered by john ashcroft , richard w levitt , one of mr dixon s lawyers , said in his summation on friday you do n't have to listen to john ashcroft jack smith , one of the federal prosecutors pressing for execution , mentioned mr ashcroft , too he told jurors that he had to answer mr levitt he s hoping one of you does n't like john ashcroft , mr smith said , adding , politics have no place here none the jury s deliberations on what penalty to impose are scheduled to begin tomorrow in federal district court in brooklyn the mentions of the country s chief law enforcement officer were unusual enough , in a trial focusing on the life and crimes of a flatbush drug dealer but they were especially notable because of the back story to the dixon case that the jurors were not told mr ashcroft did order federal prosecutors in brooklyn to seek execution , although they had recommended against it specialists in federal capital cases said the case was a model of the kind of prosecution that has been more common because of the bush administration s aggressiveness in seeking capital punishment justice department officials have said that mr ashcroft wanted a more consistent application of the federal death penalty mr ashcroft overrules local federal prosecutors and requires them to seek death penalties far more frequently than did janet reno , the attorney general in the clinton administration , according to the federal death penalty resource counsel project that agency , which provides information to defense lawyers in capital cases , said that mr ashcroft had approved capital prosecutions against 100 people , including 39 cases in which federal prosecutors had not asked for approval to seek the death penalty the rate at which ms reno directed capital prosecution when the prosecutors had not sought it was 14 percent , compared with 39 percent for mr ashcroft , according to the project s data which could mean that mr dixon s case will not be the last in which defense lawyers invoke mr ashcroft s name to foster jurors' doubts about capital punishment the attorney general , john ashcroft , who wants you to kill mr dixon , is wrong , mr levitt told jurors but mr smith said mr dixon deserved to die , not because of anyone in washington , but because of the violent life mr dixon had led in brooklyn this is about the facts you heard and what justice requires , mr smith told the jurors it has nothing to do with politics or who holds what office it has to do with your decision not the government , not the defense , not even the court , and certainly not john ashcroft it s your decision photos emile dixon , who is facing a possible sentence of capital punishment , and john ashcroft , the united states attorney general \( photo by getty images \)
new delhi , tuesday , june 10 a brutal attack on daw aung san suu kyi and her prodemocracy supporters a week ago has put an end to a faint spring in myanmar and signals a return to the harsh repression of the past , diplomats and political analysts say as much as anything , they say , the military junta has learned that in a country where it enjoys little public support , nothing works as well as sheer force if mrs aung san suu kyi s new freedom to travel and meet supporters in the last year was an experiment in conciliation by the ruling generals of the former burma , it was a disaster for them as they have in the past , they badly misjudged the public mood when they released her from 19 months of house arrest the wildly enthusiastic crowds she drew reaffirmed her place as a political force that is apparently unstoppable by anything short of a harsh crackdown they found that even though they rule with an iron hand , the people still believe in another , said sunai phasuk , a thai member of the human rights group forum asia who is an expert on myanmar people are afraid of the generals but they respect aung san suu kyi the generals' response was to clamp down on her , and to do so with a level of brutality that served as a warning to the rest of the country late on the evening of may 30 , militarybacked hooligans attacked her motorcade in northern myanmar with sticks , stones , slingshots and apparently with firearms , killing perhaps scores of people the state department has said that american diplomats who visited the scene said the attack was premeditated and carried out by forces supported by the government , while the burmese government referred to it as a clash instigated by mrs aung san suu kyi s supporters mrs aung san suu kyi and 19 of her lieutenants were detained around the country , scores of newly opened offices of her party , the national league for democracy , were padlocked a new roundup of her supporters has reportedly begun if they can get away with it , this is the end of aung san suu kyi , if not as a mythical figure then as a real threat to them , said josef silverstein , an expert on myanmar at rutgers university if people accept that she can be locked away and nobody can see her , and that other leaders can be silenced and that the party can be silenced , then they 've won the day at the moment there are few signs of popular protest the government has locked universities to prevent student uprisings , and the army reportedly has been placed on alert around the country when mrs aung san suu kyi was released from house arrest in may 2002 , she was given more freedom than she had had since the junta took power in 1988 after crushing a peaceful nationwide revolt at the cost of hundreds of lives in 1989 she was put under house arrest , which lasted six years , and in 1990 the generals made their first great public blunder by holding free parliamentary elections their candidates were trounced by the national league for democracy their response to that mistake was similar to their actions now they simply annulled the result and started imprisoning their opponents fifteen years after taking power , the ruling generals are back where they started , employing the method at which they are most successful , force they are back to ground zero , said aung zaw , the editor of a burmese exile magazine , irrawaddy there is such a deep scar , how are you going to reconcile , how are you going to heal it \? this is the ugliest political violence since 1988 this is the third time since 1988 and the election of 1990 that the generals have stepped in with force to cut short a moment of hope as in the past , they are hunkering down to take on the world , whatever the cost , said mr sunai of forum asia international condemnation has been led by the united states , and president bush said last week that he backed a move in congress to toughen current economic penalties against myanmar by cutting off virtually all imports other western nations have also protested , along with the united nations but myanmar is banking on a different , more forgiving set of partners now its giant neighbors china and india as well as the southeast asian nations with which it shares a loose political alliance in public at least , none of those nations have spoken out strongly against the crackdown news agencies in myanmar reported on monday that the chinese ambassador had told a united nations envoy that his country considered the events there an internal political affair the envoy , razali ismail , has met with the junta s top leaders during a fiveday visit and said today that he had received permission to meet mrs aung san suu kyi at her home she was reported to have been injured in the attack last week and has been in custody since then mr sunai said the timing of the attack just before the envoy s visit had been deliberate , emphasizing the junta s determination to defy outside pressure mr razali is the representative of secretary general kofi annan , who spoke out strongly last week , saying the people of myanmar were overwhelmingly in favor of change publicly , the ruling generals have closed ranks the military intelligence chief , gen khin nyunt , who is believed to have been behind last year s softer approach , made two speeches over the weekend blaming mrs aung san suu kyi and her supporters for the violence in what seemed a veiled warning , the general referred to the crackdown of 1988 and said the popular uprising then showed the need to maintain law and order everyone needs to abide by the rules and regulations to be observed everywhere , he said , adding , it is to be noted that the basic human rights would not protect those who violate an existing law
the warning signs had been accumulating for months a teenager s jealous rages , his frequent threats to kill his girlfriend and himself , episodes of violence some of the incidents were reported to school officials in tuckahoe , ny , and a principal met with both families to talk about it but until brian morris leapt to his death in front of a train last week , apparently in the mistaken belief that he had just killed his girlfriend , hardly anyone appears to have taken the signals of distress including an email suicide note the day before his death for anything more than the ventings of a somewhat troubled 17yearold i feel so sorry for him because he was crying out for help and had no one to talk to , said yvette maldonado , whose daughter , bridget , 17 , had been the object of the terrifying obsession that ended thursday night with brian s attempt to strangle her in her bedroom , and his own death minutes later on the tracks mrs maldonado , whose daughter suffered a gashed forehead and a bruised throat , said she believes that the school district is to blame for what happened to both teenagers she said school officials knew far more than she did about brian s threats she plans to sue the district for negligence and violations of school procedure , her lawyer , david worby , said yesterday at a news conference in white plains dr michael v yazurlo , the tuckahoe school superintendent , declined to comment beyond saying that the episode had been profoundly troubling for the 300 students at tuckahoe high school the school district is barred by federal law from releasing information about students , said gregg johnson , a lawyer retained by the district as the two sides brace for litigation , questions continue to swirl over what was done , or not done , to head off a tragedy in tuckahoe , a picturesque village of 6 , 300 people in lower westchester county on the surface , brian morris appeared to be an enviable young man , bound for college and success he was tall , goodlooking and popular , a star of the football team and the center fielder on tuckahoe s statechampionship baseball team last year , voted its most valuable player he was to graduate next month and planned to attend concordia college in nearby bronxville next fall his girlfriend was considered by many to be one of the most attractive girls at tuckahoe high but there had been signs of trouble for brian recently , including a fight with a teacher that led to his suspension from school below the surface , hidden from all but those to whom he was closest , brian s life appears to have been falling apart for months , mrs maldonado said in an interview at her home , he had been bedeviled by jealous rages , reacting tumultuously when bridget spoke to , or even mentioned , other boys she said he had threatened to kill bridget , her 9yearold brother , and himself if she tried to end their relationship mrs maldonado said all this was largely hidden , even from her , until about three weeks ago when paul siragusa , the high school principal , summoned her and bridget to meet in his office with brian and his parents , janine and timothy morris \( the maldonados are separated , and bridget s father did not attend , mrs maldonado said \) at the meeting , mrs maldonado recalled , mr siragusa said he had been told by a school guidance counselor that brian had threatened to kill bridget and her brother mrs maldonado said that brian denied making the threats , and that mr siragusa assured her that brian would do nothing rash ms maldonado said she was satisfied , and nothing else came of the meeting asked about the meeting , dr yazurlo confirmed that it had taken place , but refused to offer any details , citing the possibility of litigation the morrises did not respond to phone messages left at their home detective frank casey of the eastchester police department said that he did not believe the school had contacted the department about any death threats brian s father is a former officer in the department mrs maldonado said brian was suspended a few days later after a fight with a teacher in the following weeks , he continued making death threats to her daughter , mrs maldonado said , though bridget kept them to herself not until after brian was dead did her daughter tell her of the seriousness and frequency of the threats , she said had she known , she said , she would have called the police mrs maldonado said brian eventually began making his suicide threat specific he said he would throw himself in front of a train at the tuckahoe station on the metronorth railroad in recent weeks , mrs maldonado said , brian s jealousy worsened on one occasion , she said , he ripped up her daughter s notebooks and set a fire in her locker these incidents were reported to school officials , she said , but nothing was done finally fed up with his behavior , bridget told brian last tuesday that she was breaking off their relationship , her mother said the next day , she said , brian sent an email message to one of her daughter s friends , who gave bridget a copy my life is n't what people think , brian wrote the only thing holding me together was her the message added i just want to say goodbye tell her to remember i loved her on thursday night , the affair came to a violent end mrs maldonado said her daughter gave the following account of what happened
ever since the burden center for the aging moved its headquarters five years ago to first avenue near east 77th street , the tiny bus stop outside its front door has served as a transportation hub for its clients and for patients visiting the upstairs offices of several doctors specializing in geriatric care dozens of people also line up at the bus stop outside burden s nearby senior center at east 74th street and second avenue , especially after the daily lunch program but the metropolitan transportation authority plans to eliminate both stops , along with 12 others \( many on the upper east side \) , from the route of the m15 bus , which loops up first avenue and down second between south ferry and east 125th street extra space is needed between stops because the mta plans to introduce a fleet of longer , articulated buses to the route later this year five new stops will be added , but none will be close enough to the burden center , according to its executive director , william j dionne the nearest stop to the center will now be at first avenue and 76th street , a block and a half away keeping these two stops is critical for us , mr dionne said i 've often wished the city would add benches , because there are always so many people at the stops , and now they 're taking it all away deirdre parker , an mta spokeswoman , said the city had studied which stops were most essential and had made adjustments to fit the needs of riders for example , after receiving a complaint from state senator liz krueger about the impending loss of a bus stop outside the lenox hill senior center at east 70th street and second avenue , the mta said on wednesday that it would preserve the stop we reevaluated the situation and found that their concerns had merit , ms parker said concerns about similar stops , like the one outside the burden center , might have been addressed had the mta presented its plans to community board 8 , which covers the upper east side dan quart , the cochairman of the board s transportation committee , said the mta had altered its route with little advice from those who would be affected by the decision eliminating a stop directly in front of a senior center has no justification , mr quart said but even if they have legitimate reasons for moving stops , they should come and talk to the community about it first i feel like it s adhoc decisionmaking , and that s not good for anyone kelly crow photo \( michael nagle \)
chicago , june 4 the cubbyhole above sammy sosa s locker stall was bare this afternoon the day before , in the hours before sosa , the chicago cubs' slugger , was thrown out of a game for using a bat filled with cork against the tampa day devil rays at wrigley field , that area was thick with his bats but major league baseball officials had confiscated his 76 remaining bats to xray them today sandy alderson , major league baseball s executive vice president for baseball operations , said that all the xrays , taken by a radiologist , were negative we feel that the process was sufficient to determine the contents of the bats , alderson said we 're very confident all of those bats were clean and had no foreign substances in them alderson said bob watson , baseball s vice president for onfield affairs , who is in chicago , would determine what penalties to levy sosa played in tonight s 52 loss to tampa bay , going 1 for 4 in the most recent similar incident , in 1997 , wilton guerrero of the los angeles dodgers was suspended for eight games for using a corked bat in other incidents , penalties have included suspensions up to 10 games and fines up to 25 , 000 sosa is the highestprofile player to have been caught using an illegal bat he is the only player to have hit at least 60 home runs in a season three times and is one of 19 major league players to hit 500 in his career but he has been struggling this season , bothered by injuries , including a toe injury that sidelined him for 15 days last month sosa hit his last home run on may 1 on tuesday night , sosa s bat shattered when he hit a ground ball to second base in the first inning , and cork was found when tampa bay catcher toby hall picked up the barrel of the bat he handed it to the plate umpire tim mcclelland , who immediately ejected sosa baseball s rule 606 \( d \) says a player is out if he uses or attempts to use a bat that , in the umpire s judgment , has been altered or tampered with in such a way to improve the distance factor or cause an unusual reaction on the baseball this includes bats that are filled , flat surfaced , nailed , hollowed , grooved several innings later , baseball officials confiscated the 76 bats at sosa s locker alderson said he was comfortable with the security involving sosa s bats between the firstinning incident and the time the rest were taken away dusty baker , the cubs' manager , said that his first reaction to learning about the cork in the bat was when you 're busted , you 're busted sosa said after the game tuesday that he had used the bat in batting practice only , and then only four or five times , to give fans a treat by watching him hit balls out of the park he said that when he was in the ondeck circle , he grabbed the wrong bat from the bat rack and never realized it was illegal , even though the bat is lighter than the bats he regularly uses a corked bat allows a hitter to generate greater bat speed and , players presume , hit balls farther the commissioner is very concerned about this incident , alderson said , referring to commissioner bud selig he has a personal affection for sammy , but he wants a thorough investigation we hope to get it concluded as soon as possible there have been at least five similar incidents since 1974 , and players received suspensions ranging from 7 to 10 days in none of those cases did major league baseball take any of the players' bats except the illegal one used during the game why were all of sosa s taken \? i ca n't answer that , alderson said i do n't know historically but what we were trying to do in this instance was corroborate sammy s explanation for the incident we were simply attempting to prove or disprove his assertion espn was in possession of the bat with which sosa hit his 498th home run last year he now has 505 and had it tested that bat also came up clean , the network said when this was mentioned to sosa , he said evenly i know i told everybody it was a mistake while taking batting practice today , sosa , who is hitting 282 with 6 home runs and 24 runs batted in , cracked some halfdozen balls over the fence , hitting to all fields sammy s so strong , and so good , he does n't need a corked bat , said billy williams , a special assistant to the cubs' president and a former cubs star who is a member of the baseball hall of fame if he said it was a mistake , i take him at his word baker said , before being judgmental , you have to wait for the verdict when asked if this would taint sosa s career , baker said most great people have been tainted at some point in their careers and those who have n't been tainted have a saint in front of their names gene orza , the associate general counsel of the players association , said we are monitoring the situation we do n't normally get involved in a situation like this unless the player asks us to and files a grievance if punished by major league baseball , a player may appeal and play while the appeal is pending what seems apparent is that sosa , who was in the lineup tonight , will play in the weekend series against the yankees in the first meaningful matchup between the teams since the yankees swept the cubs in the 1938 world series i said yesterday and i say again today that i used the bat only in batting practice , sosa said today at a news conference before the game i'm man enough to take the blame , and to understand that i have to do that , and now i just have to go out there and play baseball he said that on tuesday night he was so focused on the game that he had no time to identify a bat that was different from his usual bats i just picked the wrong bat , he said sosa said he was dismayed at the news coverage of the incident the media today they got me like i am a criminal , he said that s something that really hurt me as a man they compared me to something like out of this world we 're all human we all make mistakes andy mcphail , the president and chief executive of the cubs , spoke in sosa s defense sammy is one of the most popular players in baseball , and he makes an effort to accommodate the fans , mcphail said , referring to sosa s explanation of why he used the corked bat in batting practice but there has been a culture in sports that is not ethical it goes back as far as the beginnings of the game there are hall of fame pitchers who scuffed the ball teams had people in the scoreboard stealing signals it s part of the culture of the game , and i hope we can grow out of it when sosa went to his position in right field to start tonight s game , he was met with cheers from the fans in the bleachers and several supportive signs like still lovin' sammy when he came to bat for the first time , he received a standing ovation from a majority of the 33 , 317 in attendance there were scattered boos he struck out swinging sosa struck out his next two times , as well in his final atbat , in the ninth inning , the crowd giving him a standing ovation , sosa singled to left field cheers rained through the ballpark photo fans supporting the cubs' sammy sosa last night baseball officials found no cork in his other bats \( associated press \)
charlottesville , va recent news articles have portrayed my father , leo strauss , as the mastermind behind the neoconservative ideologues who control united states foreign policy he reaches out from his 30yearold grave , we are told , to direct a cabal \( a word with distinct antisemitic overtones \) of bush administration figures hoping to subject the american people to rule by a ruthless elite i do not recognize the leo strauss presented in these articles my father was not a politician he taught political theory , primarily at the university of chicago he was a conservative insofar as he did not think that change is necessarily change for the better leo strauss believed in the intrinsic dignity of the political he believed in and defended liberal democracy although he was not blind to its flaws , he felt it was the best form of government that could be realized , the last best hope he was an enemy of any regime that aspired to global domination he despised utopianism in our time , nazism and communism which is predicated on the denial of a fundamental and even noble feature of human nature love of one s own his heroes were churchill and lincoln he was not an observant jew , but he loved the jewish people and he saw the establishment of israel as essential to their survival to me , what characterized him above all else was his total lack of vanity and selfimportance as a result , he had no interest in honors within the academy , and was completely unsuited to political ambition his own earliest passion , he confessed , was to spend his life raising rabbits \( flemish giants \) and reading plato he was first and foremost a teacher he did not seek to mold people in his own image rather , he was devoted to helping young people see the world as it is , in all its misery and splendor the objects of his teaching were the great books , those works generally recognized as the foundation of a liberal education but that alone was not a sufficient reason for reading them he began where good teachers should begin , from his students' received opinions , in order to scrutinize their foundation at that time , as is still true today , academia leaned to the left hence such questioning required an examination of the left s tenets had the prevailing beliefs been different , they too would have been subject to his skeptical inquiry among the received opinions of the time was an unquestioned faith in progress and science combined with a queasiness regarding any kind of moral judgment , or relativism many young people were confused , without a compass , with nothing substantial to admire my father s turning them to the great books was thus motivated not merely by aesthetic or antiquarian interest , but by a search for an understanding of mankind s present predicament what were its sources and what , if any , were the alternatives \? the latter he found in the writings of the ancient greeks furthermore , he insistently confronted his students with the question of the good life for him , the choice boiled down to the life in accordance with revelation or the life according to reason jerusalem versus athens the vitality of western tradition , he felt , lay in the invigorating tension between the two my father saw reading not as a passive exercise but as taking part in an active dialogue with the great minds of the past one had to read with great care , great respect , and try , as he always said , to understand the author as he understood himself today this task , admittedly difficult and demanding , is dismissed in fashionable academia as impossible rather , we are told , each reader inevitably constructs his own text over which the author has no control , and the writer s intentions are irrelevant the fact is that leo strauss also recognized a multiplicity of readers , but he had enough faith in his authors to assume that they , too , recognized that they would have a diverse readership some of their readers , the ancients realized , would want only to find their own views and prejudices confirmed others might be willing to open themselves to new , perhaps unconventional or unpopular , ideas i personally think my father s rediscovery of the art of writing for different kinds of readers will be his most lasting legacy although i was never a student of my father s , i sat in on a class of his in the 1960 s i think it was on xenophon s cyropaedia he was a small , unprepossessing and , truth be told , ugly man \( daughters are their parents' worst critics \) , with none of the charisma that one associates with great teachers and yet there was something utterly charming one of the students would read little chunks of the text , and my father would comment and call for discussion what marked this class was a combination of an engagement with questions of the highest seriousness \( in this case , what is the best form of government \) with the laughter of intellectual play it was magic if only the truth had the power to make the misrepresentations of his achievement vanish like smoke and dust drawing \( illustrations by monika aichele \)

could it possibly be , dr patrick campbell wondered , that doctors at his hospital in redding , calif , were cracking open the chests of perfectly healthy people \? dr campbell , an internist , first suspected trouble in redding medical center s cardiology program soon after joining the hospital in 1993 , according to papers obtained by federal investigators that year , one of his patients underwent openheart surgery even after the surgeon told dr campbell the procedure was unnecessary two years later , another patient received a coronary bypass , though the cardiologist s report said it was not necessary then there were the numbers tens of thousands of diagnostic tests , thousands of surgical coronary procedures the totals seemed more likely for a major university medical center than for a hospital in a rural community of about 90 , 000 people dismayed , dr campbell brought his concerns to stephen e corbeil , the hospital s chief executive at the time though dr campbell declined to comment on the meeting and mr corbeil did not return telephone calls , the papers obtained by federal investigators indicate that the administrator s response was succinct the young internist , he said , should mind his own business ultimately , dr campbell s concern proved to be everyone s business last week , the hospital s owner , tenet healthcare , agreed to pay 54 million to the government to resolve accusations that redding medical doctors conducted unnecessary heart procedures and operations on hundreds of healthy patients tenet did not admit any wrongdoing and agreed to cooperate with further investigations as disturbing as the accusations may be , there would have been a logic to what a patient called redding s little house of horrors a logic born of the twisted finances of american health care , which may have made the hospital less willing to hear concerns about two of its highestbilling doctors until federal agents raided redding last fall , tenet s business model was based on maximizing the dollars it could collect from medicare , the nation s biggest buyer of health care and medicare s complex formulas the template for private insurers , as well reward some kinds of health care more richly than others , and few more richly than cardiac care so it was that two heart doctors at redding dr chae hyun moon , the chief cardiologist , and dr fidel realyvasquez , its top cardiac surgeon became immensely powerful , people who worked there said tenet promised investors growing profits , and at redding , these people said , that required steady growth in cardiac care together , dr moon , who also sat on the hospital s board , and dr realyvasquez directed the california heart institute , the cardiac program that redding had started in the 1970 s , and it proved to be a bonanza 'we were constantly being pushed to bigger budgets , and there was no way to do it without the heart institute , one former redding administrator said people were terrified that moon would go on vacation , because of the effect a few days would have on the hospital s financial performance while few doubt the hospital would have responded to explicit evidence of problems in the heart program , like high death rates , the financial pressures created a disincentive to pursue less specific suspicions , people who worked at redding said and there were many suspicions besides dr campbell , more than half a dozen doctors , along with medical technicians and patients , expressed concerns to multiple administrators , according to people interviewed and records obtained by investigators there were also questions of competence one former executive said that two years ago , a representative of the company whose ultrasound machine dr moon relied on for many of his diagnoses warned that he was misusing it but the hospital never conducted the peer reviews that might have confirmed the critics' doubts i sometimes just shake my head at the american system , where the financial intent is almost cleverly designed to create mischief , said uwe reinhardt , a princeton university health care economist for administrators , it creates a conflict of interest when they 're trying to deliver the numbers at the same time that doctors are saying the hospital is doing too much cardiac surgery tenet s 54 million settlement with the government the largest ever for accusations of billing federal health programs for unnecessary care means that the company will not face criminal or civil charges but the company has been upended by the scandal , the first in a series of events to raise questions about the company s finances numerous executives , including jeffrey c barbakow , its longtime chief executive , have resigned , and its stock has lost almost threequarters of its value a criminal investigation of drs moon and realyvasquez is continuing , though no charges have been filed their work at the heart institute has been suspended , and dr moon has surrendered his medical license pending resolution of the matter lawyers for each of them say that , while other doctors' opinions about their decisions may differ , neither did anything illegal
washington , july 6 the bush administration has allowed states to make vast changes in medicaid but has not held them accountable for the quality of care they provide to poor elderly and disabled people , congressional investigators said today the administration often boasts that it has approved record numbers of medicaid waivers , which exempt states from some federal regulations and give them broad discretion to decide who gets what services but the investigators , from the general accounting office , said the secretary of health and human services , tommy g thompson , had not fully complied with the statutory and regulatory requirements to monitor the quality of care under such waivers the accounting office examined 15 of the largest waivers , covering services to 266 , 700 elderly people in 15 states and found problems with the quality of care in 11 of the programs in many cases , medicaid beneficiaries simply did not receive the services they were supposed to receive the medicaid beneficiaries were all eligible for nursinghome care but chose to stay in the community with friends and relatives rather than pay the high cost of institutional care , the states promised to provide a wide range of social and medical services known as home and communitybased care the general accounting office said , however , that the states often failed to provide those services and that the federal department of health and human services took no action to protect patients the federal government and the states spent more than 258 billion on medicaid last year , with the federal share accounting for 57 percent thomas a scully , administrator of the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services , said in an interview that he was not aware of the extent of the problem in written comments included in the report , mr scully said states were responsible for quality assurance for the federal government to review the quality of care provided under every waiver , he said , would require a new investment of millions of dollars and hundreds of additional federal employees in any event , he said , federal inspectors should not be marching through private homes to evaluate care the study was requested by senators charles e grassley , republican of iowa , and john b breaux , democrat of louisiana they favor home and community care as an option under medicaid , but expressed alarm at the findings in the report these waivers should be put on hold until the department gets a handle on the quality of care going to older and disabled americans , said mr grassley , the chairman of the senate finance committee right now there s no accountability , and that s wrong in a letter to secretary thompson , the senators asked the bush administration to submit a detailed plan for corrective action by july 28 the effect of a waiver is to exempt a state from certain provisions of federal law and regulations waivers allow states to provide services in selected geographic areas or to specific populations and to limit the number of people served or the total spent , actions not usually allowed under the medicaid statute for years , medicaid favored institutional care congress authorized home and community care as an alternative in 1981 since 1992 , the number of medicaid beneficiaries receiving such care under federal waivers has tripled , to 800 , 000 , and it is expected to continue growing with waivers , states can tailor services to individual patients , including those with alzheimer s disease , traumatic brain injuries , mental retardation and aids more than half the people receiving home and community care under medicaid waivers are 65 or older they receive all sorts of therapy , as well as assistance with bathing , dressing , shopping and other essential activities they cannot perform themselves in some states , the patients direct their own care , by hiring and training their own workers medicaid spending on such care soared to 15 billion last year , from less than 2 billion in 1992 as former governors , president bush and mr thompson have repeatedly said they want to give states more control over medicaid by speeding the approval of federal waivers sara rosenbaum , a professor of health law and policy at george washington university , said states prepare good plans of care for medicaid recipients , but there s no followthrough to see if people get the care states assume that home and community care will save money , without realizing that it takes real money to monitor the quality of care the congressional investigators found medical and physical neglect of some medicaid recipients but they said the full extent of such problems was unknown , because no one was enforcing basic safety and hygiene standards or systematically reviewing patients' records more than a dozen state waiver programs covering tens of thousands of people have gone more than a decade without any federal review of the quality of care , the accounting office said these programs were in hawaii , idaho , iowa , louisiana , missouri , new mexico , oklahoma and texas a waiver is normally approved for three years and can be extended , at a state s request , for five years at a time if the state shows that it has safeguards to protect the health and welfare of medicaid beneficiaries but the accounting office said federal officials had renewed many waivers without confirming that states had such safeguards many states sign contracts with social service agencies to manage care for medicaid recipients , but never review the quality of care or verify that services were actually provided , the report said in oklahoma , it said , 27 percent of medicaid recipients received none of their authorized personal care services , and 49 percent received only half of the authorized services maureen booth , a health policy expert at the university of southern maine , said the strengths of home and community care also complicated the task of guaranteeing its quality the beauty of home and community care is that it s flexible , it responds to the needs of individual patients with a cadre of support workers , ms booth said but to improve quality , you have to reach a whole myriad of workers employed by multiple agencies photo tommy g thompson , left , the secretary of health and human services , with senator bill frist \( carol t powers for the new york times \) \( pg a10 \)
washington , april 27 millions of lowincome americans face the loss of health insurance or sharp cuts in benefits , like coverage for prescription drugs and dental care , under proposals now moving through state legislatures around the country state officials and health policy experts say the cuts will increase the number of uninsured , threaten recent progress in covering children and impose severe strains on hospitals , doctors and nursing homes but those officials , confronting a third straight year of fiscal crisis , say they have no choice but to rein in medicaid , the fastgrowing program that provides health insurance for 50 million people many state officials are pleading for federal help as they face an array of painful tradeoffs , often pitting the needs of impoverished elderly people for prescription drugs and longterm care against those of lowincome families seeking basic health coverage the issue is already roiling state legislatures almost every state has made or is planning cuts in benefits , eligibility or payments to health care providers , according to the national conference of state legislatures the center on budget and policy priorities , a liberal research and advocacy group , estimated last month that as many as 17 million americans could lose coverage altogether under proposals advanced by governors or adopted by state legislative committees this year many more who keep their coverage may see it curtailed several large states , including california , florida and ohio , are considering proposals to eliminate dental and vision coverage for adults mississippi and oklahoma have reduced the number of prescriptions they will pay for other states , among them kentucky and massachusetts , are moving to tighten eligibility or admissions criteria for longterm care services in response to the turmoil in the states , moderate republicans on capitol hill have joined democrats in seeking legislation that would provide additional federal aid for medicaid , which is financed by the federal government and the states you ca n't have cuts of the magnitude the states are undertaking without it ultimately harming health care for some of the most vulnerable lowincome citizens in this country , said senator susan collins , republican of maine , a chief sponsor of the legislation another sponsor , senator john d rockefeller iv , democrat of west virginia , said , you do n't go down without a fight on this thing the bush administration has opposed such legislation administration officials and many house republicans say medicaid , created in 1965 as a pillar of the johnson administration s great society agenda , is unsustainable in its current form despite recent efforts to slow its growth , the cost of medicaid has increased 25 percent in two years and more than 50 percent since 1997 , and enrollment is rising at the fastest pace in a decade rather than simply pouring more money into the program , administration officials say they want to revamp it by giving states expanded power to run it shortterm financing relief does not solve the fundamental problem , said bill pierce , a spokesman for health and human services secretary tommy g thompson that s why the secretary put forward the proposal he did it changes the funding mechanism and gives them greater opportunity to craft benefits that are more flexible benefits critics say the administration proposal is an effort to limit federal responsibility for the program by converting part of it into a block grant as congress returns for a volatile debate over tax cuts and budget priorities , many lawmakers and health care advocates say the strains on medicaid will loom large the program , which now costs more than 250 billion a year in federal and state money , is the fundamental health safety net for lowincome and disabled americans medicaid insures onefifth of all children in the united states and helps pay for twothirds of all nursing home residents , many of them from middleclass families whose assets have been depleted by nursing home costs , which average more than 50 , 000 a year but medicaid has ripple effects that touch many more americans medicaid is , in many ways , a foundation for the health care system , said dr herbert pardes , president of new yorkpresbyterian hospital to cut medicaid is to hit the entire health care system states are now engaged in a sort of triage senator john b breaux , democrat of louisiana , said that in his state , where legislators face the prospect of cutting medicaid s projected budget by onethird , they 're saying 'what can you do to help \? because if you do n't , we 'll have to cut the two most vulnerable areas , education and health care' signaling the political fight to come in congress as president bush pushes for a tax cut of 550 billion over 10 years , mr breaux , an influential member of the senate finance committee , said , the problems we 're facing now make you wonder why we 're contemplating a tax cut of this size even a state like massachusetts , which has prided itself on expanding health coverage , recently dropped 36 , 000 longterm unemployed people from the basic health insurance rolls state officials say massachusetts may eliminate a prescription drug program that covers 80 , 000 elderly unless the federal government provides some help , and is considering a variety of other cuts and restrictions
the known world by edward p jones 388 pp new york amistad harpercollins publishers 2495 truth by jacqueline sheehan 294 pp new york free press 24 friedrich engels once said that he learned more about postrevolutionary french society from balzac than from all the professed historians , economists and statisticians of the period together the same might be said of slavery in america and these two first novelists , who write about its history not as if it were fixed in time , safely over and done with , but as if anything could happen in the chaos of the moment edward p jones s novel , the known world , opens with the death of a master of 33 slaves in antebellum virginia none of his property grows tearyeyed , though , at the news that henry townsend has died they surely do n't know that when he obtained his first slave he wanted to be the kind of shepherd master god had intended , someone who would provide good food for his slaves , no whippings , short and happy days in the fields by his death , he had learned his lesson it seems he had no choice but to chain a runaway slave in his barn and pay a cherokee patroller to slice a third of his ear off a familiar story , perhaps , so far there s a difference , though henry townsend is black in 1855 in manchester county , va \( a fictional place standing in for an actual historical landscape \) , we learn that there were 34 free black families and eight of those free families owned slaves henry townsend s freedom had been purchased by his father , augustus , a carpenter who bought his own freedom with money earned from his carvings and furniture , then over time bought his wife and son out of slavery henry himself financed his first slaves by making boots and shoes but why would a former slave himself buy slaves , especially against the wishes of his father \? though the novel never explicitly addresses this question , readers get the message because slavery was legal and believed to be sanctioned by god , because wealth and status consisted in owning human flesh and because henry wanted to be a better master than any white man he had ever known among the many triumphs of the known world , not the least is jones s transformation of a littleknown footnote in history into a story that goes right to the heart of slavery there are few certified villains in this novel , white or black , because slavery poisons moral judgments at the root as jones shows , slavery corrupts good intentions and underwrites bad ones , yet allows decency the odd occasion but only by creating such an enormous need for it the freshness of his story lies in its very incongruity and strangeness henry s first slave , moses , takes more than two weeks to process the news that someone was n't fiddling with him and that indeed a black man , two shades darker than himself , owned him and any shadow he made moses had thought that it was already a strange world that made him a slave to a white man , but god had indeed set it twirling and twisting every which way when he put black people to owning their own kind was god even up there attending to business anymore \? good question a known world is one seen and understood by god and therefore fixed and ordained jones s world , by contrast , is one that could come to pieces at any moment after henry s death , his wife grows dreamy and passive while her slaves betray one another or run off jones writes with a sense of narrative foreboding undercut by the erratic nature of events , and the result is a portrait of a society that is seemingly immutable but as tentative and fragile as the map of the americas for which the novel is titled , hung on the local sheriff s wall this map finds its echoes in the book s final chapter , when , by 1861 , the known worlds of manchester county and of henry s plantation have themselves become huge wall hangings in a hotel in washington , the folkart creations of one of the story s runaway slaves jones s talent for conjoining the ordinary and the marvelous is partly that of a miniaturist with a novel to write a finalist for the national book award for his collection of stories , lost in the city , he constructs the known world as a clockwork mechanism of stories within stories , some appearing as single phrases in a sentence , others spanning the whole book from henry s death , he spirals back to the history of a multitude of characters whose stories begin as faraway trickles before they swell into rivers these characters survive by negotiating mazes of moral contradiction , but they speak with a raw and lyrical bluntness jones has an exceptional ear for speech now buried in the past , though its echoes remain his own narrative style is doggedly declarative , slow , persistent , imperturbable and patient , but it gets the job done to call this novel mulepaced is not to be captious mules are noble animals in the world of the novel , and smarter than horses they wo n't work until they drop i could have done without the gratuitously bloody ending , if only because by then jones has so effectively shown that the death of the heart was slavery s worst horror still , the known world is an achievement of epic scope and architectural construction , which nonetheless reads like a string of folk tales told by someone slyly watching for your reaction tales told by a conjurer who distracts you so well that you never know what hit you

berlin , march 14 in a major speech delivered before a characteristically noisy session of the german parliament , chancellor gerhard schr der today outlined a longexpected program of economic reforms aimed at reducing unemployment and stimulating this country s stagnant economy mr schr der s main proposals , none of which came as a surprise , were aimed at making it easier for employers to fire workers , reducing the length of time unemployed people can receive benefits and eliminating some of the costs of the vast national welfare system the program also would increase public works spending , would make it easier for small businesses to hire temporary workers and would require unemployed people who have received welfare payments for a year or more to accept jobs , even if undesirable , that are offered to them by the state employment agencies today , the reform and renewal of the social welfare state has become unavoidable , mr schr der said but the long list of proposals by mr schr der , who governs through a coalition of his own social democratic party and the leftist greens , was carefully balanced between calls for changes in germany s elaborate and sometimes confining protections and a passionate defense of what mr schr der called a strong , performing welfare state our country has not become economically strong through the law of the jungle , through indiscriminate hiring and firing , mr schr der said in a speech applauded by members of his governing coalition and frequently jeered by the opposition on the contrary , our country takes its strength from its selfconfident workers , whose motivation stems not from fear , but rather from the desire to accomplish things together with enterprising employers mr schr der s speech , in which the chancellor reiterated germany s opposition to war in iraq , marked his effort to address this country s dismal economic performance , as well as to reverse the sense that since his reelection last fall , his government has been adrift , talking about needed painful reforms but not putting any into effect with unemployment now over 11 percent and growth rates close to negligible for two years , the program is seen here as a political doordie necessity for mr schr der , whose approval ratings , despite the popularity of his position on the iraq issue , have sunk below 30 percent the widespread assumption is that mr schr der , whose term has more than three years to go , needs to get a strong economic program through the legislature or his chancellorship will be seen as a failure , seriously dimming his party s chances to stay in power in the next elections in a brief foreign policy section near the beginning of his speech , mr schr der repeated his familiar calls for a peaceful solution to the iraqi crisis , saying that the government of president saddam hussein was cooperating better and more actively and that arms inspections are an efficient instrument that we have no right to bring to an end together with our friends in france , with russia , china and the majority of the security council , we are confident the disarmament of iraq can be achieved through peaceful means , he said but the main subject was germany s lifeless economy and the system of regulation and benefits that many in this country have come to see as a rigid , antiquated , sometimes even ridiculous obstacle to growth for several years now , german economic reform has been largely paralyzed as the country debates whether to maintain its comprehensive welfare system or accept a more unfettered market economy along american lines defending his proposal to force many of the jobless off the welfare rolls , mr schr der said , no one will be allowed to sit back at the country s expense , one of several statements likely to trouble the many labor leaders in his party in addition to calling for cuts in welfare benefits and for more flexibility in hiring and firing , mr schr der announced an economic stimulus package that the labor unions have been calling for , specifically a 165 billion investment in housing and public works projects aimed at creating jobs by stimulating growth mr schr der s speech , not unexpectedly , elicited criticism from both left and right in germany one green legislator , responding to advance reports of some of mr schr der s proposals , called them a shotgun blast directed at our people a labor leader , michael sommer , chief of the german federation of unions , said , what was presented in social and labor market policy today was not socially well balanced he said the unions would not accept the part of the package that would reduce unemployment benefits the leader of the conservative christian democratic union , angela merkel , who spoke in parliament after mr schr der , criticized the program as a tired , watereddown package unlikely to have any real effect chart keeping track economic growth in germany

it would hardly come as a shock if one were to learn that mike tyson spent his leisure hours hitting his head against the wall for the selfdestructive , selfloathing tyson , this might even be a pleasure trip , after what he has inflicted on himself over the years and it would hardly be eyepopping to see a blazing tabloid headline about him that would read , brainless man found in bottomless financial pit the news over the weekend that tyson , now 37 years old , has filed for bankruptcy after earning a reported gross revenue of 300 million to 500 million in the ring over some 20 years as a professional prizefighter ought not to come as a surprise to anyone who has followed the decline and virtual selfimmolation of a once great heavyweight champion that is , the fact that he has been reckless with his money does not surprise , though the figure , when perused in cold type , raises eyebrows two questions come swiftly to mind 1 how does a person blow this kind of money \? 2 why \? according to tyson , this is how a don king , the boxing promoter who grew hair by plunging a wet finger into an electric socket , robbed him \( tyson s suit against king goes on trial in september \) b his second wife , monica turner , blew millions on a lavish lifestyle and c monstrous legal fees tyson s financial adviser , so to speak , shelly finkel , said by telephone yesterday that he could not speak about his charge s money matters but said , i saw the quotes in the newspaper , and they speak for themselves they do \? not so fast , shelly now tyson , through his lawyer , apparently did admit that he had had a gluttonous existence himself from 1995 to 1997 , he spent 230 , 000 on pagers and cellphones , 410 , 000 on a birthday party , 8 , 100 for the care of his pet tigers and 65 , 000 for limousine services i remember seeing mike go into a jewelry shop in caesars palace in las vegas with a bunch of friends , and they closed the store for them , bert sugar , the boxing historian , said and later i asked the shopkeeper what had happened he told me 'mike was just handing stuff to his friends the bill came to over 500 , 000 in an hour but that sum of 300 million to 500 million , sugar said , is remarkable i did some figuring , he added , and to put that kind of money in perspective , if an average guy earns a decent salary of 1 , 000 a week , or 52 , 000 a year , it would take him 5 , 700 years to make 300 million and 9 , 600 years to make 500 million henry feldman , a manhattan certified public accountant , said if you split the difference and say it s 400 million that he earned , then you subtract maybe 100 million for expenses for trainers , managers , other professional stuff , and 150 million in taxes that still leaves 150 million now what \? now what , indeed a quizzical insight came from tyson s lawyer , debra grassgreen , who said in a statement as a professional fighter , who relied on others to manage his affairs , he discovered that his debts far exceeded his assets now , he has taken the lead in bringing order to his financial affairs this is comical , to be sure , for tyson has a history of not taking responsibility for his actions , including this apparent disintegration of his bank account his brawls outside the ring , his manic actions in the ring , his rape and assault convictions , his ravings , his lunacies , his matrimonial messes , his several mansions , his fleet of expensive pleasure cars , his decisions to rid himself of responsible advisers like bill cayton and take up with the duplicitous king , form the crazyquilt pattern of his bellicose behavior in the major team sports in america , there are schoolings on , among other things , financial matters all our drafted rookies are compelled to take a financial education symposium , greg aiello , a spokesman for the nfl , said we bring in outside experts to explain the best way to handle your money , and dealing with things like banking , budgeting and credit and then each team provides a program for players and their wives about the dos and do n'ts of investing and spending attendance at these seminars is voluntary boxing , an individual and relatively chaotic milieu , offers none of that not that tyson would have presumably stayed awake during any of them , anyway this is not to say that mike tyson is stupid on the contrary , he can be a charming and intelligent conversationalist he grasps a point when he wishes to but some other dark qualities lurk within his skull tyson has never seemed comfortable with himself he has said , i hate myself so much , you ca n't hate me as much as i hate myself regarding his brother , rodney , who grew up in the same tough brownsville area of brooklyn , and was employed most recently as a physician s assistant in the trauma center of a los angeles hospital , tyson said my brother was always something and i was nothing and i'm angry at the world only a solid investigation of the tyson cranium by perhaps a team of psychiatrists might determine if he tries to compensate in some way by throwing his money away as i was growing up , my mother often said when i asked her for a handout , do you think money grows on trees \? for tyson , the answer is yes , or sadly , if not tragically , it was photo mike tyson has blamed the promoter don king , his second wife and legal fees for draining his bank account \( photo by reuters \)
british drug regulators warned yesterday that glaxosmithkline s popular antidepressant paxil causes depressed children to become more suicidal and should not be prescribed for them that conclusion came from the combined results of nine studies on paxil , known as seroxat in britain , that the company recently submitted to british regulators it has become clear that the benefits of seroxat in children for the treatment of depressive illness do not outweigh these risks , the statement from the british government s medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency said the implications of the new pediatric data on the safety of paroxetine \( paxil \) in the adult population remains under close review alan metz , vice president for clinical development at glaxo , said the company was not warning american doctors against using the drug for depressed children he noted that paxil was not approved in the united states for treating children but that many doctors prescribed the drug for children anyway it s difficult for me sitting here to tell doctors what they should do with their patients , dr metz said glaxo , the british drug maker , has applied for permission from the food and drug administration in the united states to sell paxil to children who suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder that application is pending paxil has become increasingly controversial in britain the british drug agency recently required glaxo to remove a statement on its patient label saying that the drug was not addictive patients who stop taking paxil suddenly often experience dizziness , abnormal dreams , headaches and nervousness in britain , these are called withdrawal symptoms and in the united states they are called discontinuation symptoms , dr metz said paxil is part of a class of drugs that includes prozac and zoloft for years , lawsuits have contended that the drugs tend to increase violence and suicidal thoughts in vulnerable populations , but the makers of the pills have long denied this two years ago , a wyoming jury awarded 64 million to the family of a patient taking the pill who killed his wife , daughter and granddaughter according to the studies , patients taking paxil were 15 to 32 times more likely to have suicidal thoughts or episodes of selfharm compared with those taking a placebo the rate of suicidal behavior among those taking paxil was lower than the normal rate of such behavior among depressed children who got no treatment at all , dr metz said this is true because treatment even with dummy pills can be highly effective against depression none of the children in the studies succeeded in committing suicide paxil is glaxosmithkline s largestselling drug the company is in the midst of a legal fight to retain its exclusive hold over paxil s selling rights in the united states
east liberty , ohio shoppers for new cars are often frustrated when they ca n't get the newest model exactly when they want it their fickle tastes will be much easier to satisfy , however , as plants like the honda motor company s sprawling factory here become the norm in the industry in this factory 35 miles northwest of columbus , the small honda civic and the big , boxy element are being made not only in the same plant , but also on the same assembly line , a radical departure for the auto industry in the united states historically , the industry has had a method of one plant , one car as the cars roll down the miles of conveyor belts here , their differing sizes are made abundantly clear by two racks of roof liners soft fabric that stretches the length of a car , against the metal top which stand waiting to be installed inside the metal frame the roof liner for the element is 9 feet long , versus 6 feet for the civic s next to each other , they look like two garment bags one for a ball gown and one for a blazer depending on the vehicle that glides in front of them , workers take a roof liner off a rack and staple it into place the east liberty plant is at the front of a trend that is spreading rapidly through the american automobile industry flexible manufacturing it allows automakers to satisfy the rapidly changing desires of consumers , and it provides new vehicles nearly as often as fashion designers turn out new clothes every major company , from the big three automakers in detroit to companies in japan , germany and korea , is embracing the concept in theory , flexible manufacturing will let them build any combination of vehicles in one factory , regardless of size , design or body style the concept lets auto companies meet customer demand quickly , without wasting time and money tearing up factories companies that can put new vehicles on the market first stand the best shot at earning the highest profits none of us know four years from now what the right mix will be , said dennis c cuneo , executive vice president of toyota motor manufacturing north america that s why you have to be flexible dennis k pawley , the former head of manufacturing at chrysler who is now a consultant , said products are coming faster than you can blink an eye if you do n't have flexibility now , you 're dead there is already proof of the payoff this year , in an industry where each tenth of a marketshare point is fought over like gold , honda has picked up an impressive 11 points primarily because of two new vehicles the element and the honda pilot , a large suv both are built in flexible plants the element in east liberty , and the pilot in alliston , ontario the potential savings are enormous , too , wiping out the industry s longheld perception that flexible factories are too expensive to create and maintain three years ago , when general motors started production of the latest version of the chevrolet impala , it spent 240 million to retool its assembly line to add the vehicle at its oshawa , ontario , plant but , thanks to the flexiblemanufacturing system that it is installing in its plants , gm is spending just 45 million now to add new vehicles at its factories and it estimates that the cost will drop to 20 million by 2005 we will be prepared to move with the market , said gerald l elson , gm s vice president in charge of vehicle operations traditionally , entire factories have been used exclusively for a single kind of vehicle , like the endless rows of model t s that henry ford churned out a century ago even today , ford motor has six factories devoted solely to the fseries pickup , of which it sells more than 750 , 000 a year and , until this spring , the chrysler division of daimlerchrysler had three factories in the united states and europe that built only minivans , while its jeep plant in detroit operated 24 hours a day throughout the 1990 s building only jeep grand cherokees the singlevehicle plant was designed for economies of scale the only priority was to be the lowcost producer , mr pawley said the big problem comes when those vehicles do n't sell , and the factories have to be shut down labor contracts require detroit auto companies to pay laidoff union members practically their entire wages and all their benefits when plants are not operating this need to keep factories going also makes it costly for companies to introduce lowvolume vehicles , because their limited sales cannot pay for keeping an entire plant running in installing flexiblemanufacturing systems , the big three are aiming to race against japanese auto companies in a research report titled the joy of flex , michael bruynesteyn , an industry analyst at prudential securities , wrote that toyota and honda were ahead of the big three automakers in adopting flexiblemanufacturing concepts , in part because of the demands those companies face in japan there , customers' tastes change even faster than those in the united states , meaning that automakers have to offer wideranging lineups with dozens of cars and constantly introduce new products many will be sold only in japan , and for no more than a couple of years even a decade ago , mazda was able to build up to 14 different vehicles at its plant in hofu , japan , and eight at its factory in hiroshima
new york city and lawyers representing the homeless said they took an extraordinary first step yesterday toward ending a 20yearold lawsuit over the rights of homeless families in the deal , they agreed to create an independent panel with broad powers to help the city shape its longrange policy for such families for the last two decades , almost every aspect of the city s approach to handling homeless families has been contested in court from how quickly the families must be placed in shelters to the availability of baby bottle warmers in the office where they first enter the system the disputes have led to millions of dollars in fines for the city , and created a situation in which a state judge has dictated many of the particulars of city policy in announcing the agreement yesterday , both the city and the legal aid society , which has taken the lead in representing the homeless in court , said they were trying to break that cycle under the plan , a threemember panel was approved by both sides to mediate disputes between the parties for the next two years and , more importantly , review the policies toward homeless families the panel s members had been quietly involved in negotiations between the two sides in an undefined capacity since last thanksgiving the creation of the panel is only a first step at the end of two years , the panel is charged with making recommendations for resolving all litigation the lawyers for both sides , however , would be free to reject those recommendations , and , in the interim , the extensive court orders remain in effect the panel would have no role in the shelter system for single adults , which is the product of separate litigation , and the agreement would not affect the standing court order that requires the city to provide shelter for the homeless the surprise announcement came as the city and legal aid lawyers appeared in court to settle a less sweeping but related issue whether homeless families in shelters who refuse one appropriate apartment could be evicted on that matter , the two sides agreed that the families could be moved to a suitable apartment of the city s choice if the family refused to sign a lease for the proffered apartment , it would never be allowed back in a city shelter but would retain the option of living in an apartment of the city s choice mayor michael r bloomberg and his homeless commissioner , linda i gibbs , had made it clear from the start of his administration that ending this litigation , which they argued had stripped the city of its legitimate authority to make policy , was a top priority although yesterday s agreement stopped far short of their dream scenario , both were nonetheless visibly elated the mayor , who took the unusual step of appearing in court himself yesterday , later called the agreement momentous and said it would free the city from the shackles of court orders ms gibbs expressed her clear belief that the final outcome of the panel would be the nullification of previous court orders it is the understanding of all parties that it is an appropriate goal that the agency should be managed without the ongoing roll of the judiciary , she said but steven banks , a legal aid lawyer who has been lead counsel representing the homeless families , called talk of eventually ending ongoing court orders highly speculative at this point as part of the deal , the legal aid society agreed to withdraw all pending motions in front of the court and to refrain from bringing future motions for two years the plaintiffs could seek panel help in challenging department of homeless services policy only under extreme circumstances involving a major problem , according to the language of the agreement in the case that either side did not like a decision reached by the panel over a disagreement , it would have to show the court that the panel had acted in a way that was arbitrary and capricious still , there was plenty for the advocates for the homeless to celebrate for starters , they gave up none of the court victories they have achieved and added a layer of review of department policy that they could directly influence through the selection of panel members and through continuing consultations daniel greenberg , president of the legal aid society , said the deal gave advocates a way to make a positive contribution to planning city policy instead of limiting the advocacy group to a reactive and combative role he said the deal recognized we have an expertise that can be useful to fashion the best remedies mr greenberg added , we are pleased to be a resource in collaboration with government both sides acknowledged that the agreement could not mend overnight a deep gulf of mistrust that has grown between them the real test of the settlement will likely come only when the city experiences a crisis like it did last summer , when record numbers of families applied for shelter and hundreds ended up spending the night on the floor of the city s emergency assistance unit in the bronx in violation of court order last night , mr banks said that if everyone followed the agreement , that would not happen again but if it did \? mr banks sighed and said , i would start by talking to the panel , but i am an optimist the fact that mr banks , a fierce opponent of city homeless policy for more than two decades , can describe himself as optimistic about collaboration speaks to the immense transformation that has taken place in recent weeks those involved in the negotiations say many factors suddenly aligned to make this deal possible for starters , there was a homeless services commissioner , ms gibbs , with experience settling litigation she was at the administration for children s services when it settled its own class action lawsuit in 1996 then there was a new mayor who was clearly more sympathetic to the plight of homeless families than his famously combative predecessor the weak economy and a sour public mood may have influenced advocates for the homeless to settle while they were still winning in court , but the advocates deny that the final piece of the puzzle was the replacement of the position of special master , who had limited authority to settle disputes , with the new panel , which is made up of three wellrespected public policy activists and academics just after thanksgiving , the three had stepped in quietly to help with negotiations related to whether clients could be evicted from shelter and found themselves delving into the more core dispute the members of the panel are john d feerick , a former dean of fordham law school daniel kronenfeld , the former executive director of the henry street settlement , which runs a family shelter among other services and gail b nayowith , the executive director of citizens' committee for children of new york , who sits on an independent panel that similarly advises the city administration for children s services and has strong personal ties with ms gibbs photos justice freedman in 2002 homeless families sleep on the floor of the city s emergency assistance unit office in the bronx in 1997 \( julia fishkin legal aid society \) mayor

officials in new york city are crowing about the 166 million deal they announced with snapple to allow the company exclusive rights to sell its beverages in public schools and in city buildings joseph m perello , the city s chief marketing officer , said the city would reap significant profits on the strength of the snapple brand it s generating revenue and it s easing a burden on government , mr perello said and that s freed our principals to do what they do best but , according to some industry insiders , the schools portion of the agreement may be slightly below the going rate according to the terms of the deal , snapple , a division of cadbury schweppes , will be the exclusive beverage vendor for new york s 1 , 200 public schools for five years the education department will receive a minimum of 8 million a year in commissions and sponsorship money for athletic programs the city will receive at least 13 million a year based on sales in municipal buildings \( an additional 12 million a year will go toward advertising that promotes new york city and snapple \) the school rights alone work out to about 8 a year for every new york city student that is below the average of about 25 a student that companies typically pay for exclusive rights to sell drinks in schools , according to some consultants who broker deals between beverage companies and school districts mr perello disputes that the city may have undervalued the deal the 8 million figure is a minimum payment , he stressed , and highermargin deals were traditionally linked to agreements to sell soft drinks in schools , which new york city refuses to do the deal also prohibits snapple from advertising in schools but in other respects , the 166 million is a significant escalation in the battle to secure exclusive agreements with cities and particularly schools , where companies have the opportunity to woo pintsized consumers and retain their lifelong loyalty its magnitude is breathtaking , said michael riley , the president of public enterprise group , a consulting company in huntington beach , calif , that helps cities negotiate soft drink deals comparable deals only come out of the federal government for the pentagon or the department of defense it s certain to increase the pressure on other school systems to increase their rate of rewards on these arrangements snapple s contract with new york city schools is being closely watched by school districts across the country , particularly as more districts struggle with whether to ban soft drink sales for health concerns and thereby jeopardize lucrative upfront payments and vending commissions that help augment dwindling budgets the snapple deal , analysts said , proves that one action does not necessarily preclude the other oftentimes the large cola players may have been the only players in there , said michael c bellas , chief executive of beverage marketing , a market research firm now they have another one to look at much of this was made in the noncarbonated area these are the types of beverages that you 'll see more of the deal also makes snapple , primarily a juice , tea and water company , a major player in exclusive beverage contracts , heightening competition with soft drink companies like pepsico , cocacola and dr pepper 7up but perhaps more important , snapple s huge outlay of cash has set a precedent that is likely to take the beverage industry to another level jack belsito , the president of snapple , said the company s deal with new york was its first exclusive contract with a school district snapple approached the city after hearing that it was seeking sponsorship opportunities in the spring the company made its first pitch after the education department banned sales of sodas in public schools in june mr belsito said snapple first offered to stock school vending machines with two of its juice lines , nantucket nectars and mott s apple juice , and its bottled water line the company eventually agreed to create a line of 100 percent fruit juice drinks to comply with the education department s nutritional guidelines other companies , including pepsi veryfine juices poland spring , a unit of nestl and florida s natural , an orange juice company that is part of citrus world , also competed for the contract , but none had the size and scope of the snapple deal coke did not place a bid coke or pepsi could do similar deals because they have brands like tropicana , minute maid , aquafina and dasani in their portfolios , said john d sicher , the editor and publisher of beverage digest , an industry publication this deal is certainly a positive for snapple it s also a new way of looking at school beverage deals since snapple is making a juice product that will be sold only in schools , other beverage companies are also likely to feel more pressure to customize products for schools coke is already marketing swerve , a milkbased drink , that it developed solely for sale in schools the deal may also increase the use of consultants to broker exclusive contracts with food and beverage companies on behalf of the schools the school brokerage business is , for the moment , a cottage industry the octagon group , a sports and entertainment marketing company , represented new york schools in the snapple deal city officials said the consulting firm was instrumental in securing the agreement i do n't think this deal would have gotten where it is without octagon , mr perello said they played a critical role in pushing the doe to do this and together we worked to make this thing happen since the late 1990 s consultants have been gaining in popularity as they help schools negotiate complex deals both cocacola enterprises and pepsi bottling , the largest bottlers for coke and pepsi , said they did not participate in deals in which third parties , or consultants , were involved we do n't believe that it provides any additional value or assistance , laura asman , a spokeswoman for cocacola enterprises , said but beverage analysts said consultants , which have been pushing more profits in school beverage deals from cola bottlers to school districts , were here to stay you 're going to see more of these guys , mr bellas said when other cities view how new york has approached , or the money brought into them , they will likely want to have that type of expertise in their dealings with beverage companies photo for 166 million , snapple won exclusive rights to sell its drinks in new york city s public schools and city buildings at a

the son of a former iraqi diplomat at the united nations was charged yesterday with working secretly on behalf of iraqi intelligence officers who were seeking to track down iraqis in the united states who were hostile to the government of saddam hussein the defendant , raed rokan alanbuke , was charged with serving illegally as an agent of the iraqi intelligence service and is expected to appear today before a federal magistrate judge in united states district court in manhattan mr anbuke had no comment yesterday as he was led by agents to a van outside the federal building in lower manhattan , where he had been processed by the fbi he was not charged with spying , but rather faces a charge of failing to register with the justice department as an agent for a foreign government his lawyer could not be reached by phone for comment mr anbuke does not have diplomatic immunity , the criminal complaint said , and has been in custody since his arrest on march 25 on immigration violations his father , rokan alanbuke , was the deputy permanent representative to the iraqi mission and worked covertly for iraqi intelligence , according to the complaint unsealed yesterday the son originally entered the united states on a visa issued by the state department in connection with his father s diplomatic service , the complaint said after his father left the country , the complaint noted , the visa was invalidated , and mr anbuke remained in the united states illegally there was no indication when the father left the complaint said that since january 2001 , mr anbuke had secret contacts with five iraqi intelligence officers posted to the mission under diplomatic cover , including two described as counselors and two others described as guards the fifth appears to have also been a guard none of the five officers were named in the court document but one counselor was described as a former chief of station for iraqi intelligence in new york who operated under an alias and diplomatic cover and who was eventually barred from reentering the united states by the state department because of his intelligence activities the other counselor s mission in the united states was to kill a former iraqi government official , the complaint said the counselor was later declared persona non grata by the state department and expelled the federal complaint , signed by an fbi agent and filed by the office of james b comey , the united states attorney in manhattan , also indicates that american investigators have been aided by a confidential source described as a coconspirator who appears to be cooperating with the government there is no indication in the complaint that mr anbuke or those he worked for were able to kill the former official or other iraqi dissidents in the

still active in the united states , and that they had been successfully identified by the american government the officials said that the basic function of iraq s intelligence apparatus in the united states has been to monitor iraqi dissidents the united states government has limited travel by iraqi diplomats serving in new york , and mr anbuke may have been useful because he had more freedom of movement the fbi met with mr anbuke several times between july 2001 and january 2003 regarding his contacts with iraqi intelligence , the complaint said it said that after he was taken into custody last month , he acknowledged that three of the iraqi diplomats he was working with were iraqi intelligence officers serving in new york under aliases and diplomatic cover mr anbuke also admitted that

the 3yearold brooklyn girl weighed only 16 pounds when she was taken to the hospital she was covered in bruises and had a skull fracture there was a burn on her chest , possibly from a cigarette last night , her condition was so grave that the authorities feared that she would not live until morning , several investigators said the girl s mother , patricia aguirre , 25 , was arrested late monday night on charges that she abused the girl detectives were also questioning ms aguirre s boyfriend last night ms aguirre had taken her daughter , edith , to woodhull medical center on monday morning , reporting that the child had seizures on successive days , the authorities said in addition to the skull fracture , investigators said , the child had severe bruising of the brain and a number of older injuries consistent with continual abuse she was transferred to new york university hospitals center in manhattan , where last night she was in the intensive care unit , investigators said a spokeswoman said that the hospital would not comment on her condition because of privacy considerations ms aguirre at first told the police that she was not the battered child s mother , but that she had paid to have the girl smuggled to new york from mexico and that the toddler had already suffered the injuries and abuse when she arrived in the city in the last few days but by yesterday afternoon , detectives and prosecutors investigating the case had discounted many of the woman s early statements also , ms aguirre , in an apparent effort to frustrate investigators who were trying to piece together what had happened to the girl first gave the police an address on thames street in the bushwick section of brooklyn , where she had not lived for about a year , one investigator said ms aguirre also called someone who lives in that building and asked that they tell anyone who might inquire that ms aguirre lived there , the investigator said but detectives from two station houses and the brooklyn north homicide squad instead learned that ms aguirre lived nearby , at 92 george street , with her boyfriend , whom the authorities identified as edison gonzalez the couple s 5yearold son and edith , who has a different father , investigators said several neighbors in the threestory gray row house said ms aguirre and mr gonzalez fought constantly one neighbor , who lives above their fourroom apartment on the second floor , said she heard two loud slamming noises on sunday night , which she now believes were made during an assault on the child the police heard a similar report from a neighbor and said last night that they were investigating it neighbors also told detectives from the 83rd and 90th precincts that they believed the child was being abused , but none reported their concerns to the police or to child welfare authorities , a police official said one neighbor told the police that ms aguirre would punish the child by not feeding her and would run out to stop the neighbors if she thought the neighbors were giving her food , the official said the girl was tiny , said robert mohr , 47 , the landlord at the building i thought she was 1 year old , he said god she looked like she had an old lady s face the couple s upstairs neighbor , maria carmona , 46 , a housewife who said she heard what she thought was the child being assaulted early sunday morning , said the boy looked fine but edith , she said , did n't look like a regular little girl she looked scared ms carmona said the couple came from ecuador and relied on public assistance several other neighbors said they sold prepared food from their blue chevrolet lumina van , which was parked outside the house on george street yesterday ms aguirre was charged with endangering the welfare of a child and reckless endangerment , while prosecutors said the charges could be upgraded if the child died , officials said mr gonzalez was being questioned last night taking such cases to trial is often difficult , particularly when the injuries , like the skull fracture , are older and doctors cannot place a time when they occurred , said ama dwimoh , who heads the crimes against children bureau in the office of brooklyn district attorney charles j hynes , and who is overseeing the prosecution the unit handles cases of sex abuse of children under age 11 and physical abuse of children ages 17 and under when their parent or guardian is a suspect during initial interviews , ms aguirre told detectives that the child had a seizure on sunday afternoon , and then again on monday morning , several investigators said at 9 30 am monday , about an hour and a half after the second seizure , ms aguirre took the girl to woodhull , and the hospital notified the police , investigators said ms aguirre told the detectives that her boyfriend had initially told her not to take the child to the hospital because the injuries would prompt child welfare authorities to remove both children from the couple s custody , one official said as of last night , investigators had not corroborated that account , the official said but the 5yearold had been turned over to the new york city administration for children s services , which was weighing placement options for him , said kathleen walsh , a spokeswoman for the agency said despite the girl s condition and what neighbors described as constant battles between ms aguirre and mr gonzalez , the couple had never been reported to child welfare authorities a senior investigator said the police had never been called to the couple s home ms walsh said a review of the agency s record found no previous contact with the family we 've checked every name known to us and we show no history under any name or any spelling , she said last night , edith was struggling to survive she s fighting for her life or , i should say , what s left of it , one investigator said

the week with lynn and alfred was , as expected , perfect , no l coward wrote in his diary in december 1966 i was cosseted , tended and fussed over coward spent those seven perfect days in genesee depot , a rural hamlet in southeastern wisconsin , where , one would imagine , he would n't normally be caught dead but alfred and lynn were , of course , the lunts , coward s friends and frequent interpreters and they lived \( by choice \) at ten chimneys , the dairy state theatrical valhalla they created in late may , on the 81st anniversary of the lunts' wedding , the 60acre estate , restored to its original , highly ornate glory , was opened to the public as a museum and arts center tours of the house and grounds have sold out most days since then incredibly , ten chimneys a oneofakind oddity crowded with handpainted murals and antiques nearly fell victim to a developer s blueprint in 1996 it survived because of joseph w garton , a persistent madison , wis , restaurateur with a passion for theater mr garton and an associate , sean malone , hope the property will inspire theater artists today the way the lunts consistently influenced their contemporaries from the mid1920 s to the late1950 s , when alfred lunt and lynn fontanne , the fabulous lunts , reigned as the leading stage acting team of the day , ten chimneys was a near mythic retreat coward , helen hayes , laurence olivier , alexander woollcott , katharine hepburn and many more flocked there as carol channing , another guest , once said , what the vatican is to catholics , ten chimneys is to actors the sloping , wooded grounds , set in the middle of the hills and hollows of the kettle moraine , about 30 miles southwest of milwaukee , are dominated by a trio of buildings the threestory main house , to which the restless lunts continually annexed new rooms the cottage , nicknamed the hen house because it was not only a converted chicken coop but the home of alfred s mother and halfsister for years and the studio , a log cabin shipped from sweden and used to rehearse new roles and occasionally to imprison a procrastinating playwright across the street from the entrance to ten chimneys is the new program center , the only building on the property that the lunts had no hand in creating the plan is for the new threestory structure to become a national destination for traveling exhibitions , artistic retreats , conferences , workshops and master classes according to mr garton , president of the ten chimneys foundation , the center was essential to the property s survival i love theater history , he said in a telephone interview from his home in madison , but i never could have raised the money i did if i had pitched the place as just an interesting piece of theater history a 125 million capital campaign was successfully waged to save the estate and create the center if casual visitors did not know that ten chimneys was the private domain of two stage stars , they might guess it soon enough theatricality flares up at every turn the front hall walls are covered with murals of people offering pineapple , pheasant , liquor and other symbols of welcome the socalled flirtation room , with its six doors leading upstairs , downstairs and onto a balcony , could do service in a bedroom farce the drawing room is decorated with murals depicting dramatic biblical scenes the lunts were n't particularly religious , but they knew a good story when they heard one \( the cherubs resemble alfred \) it s all stage set , said the biographer margot peters from her home in lake mills , wis her new biography of the lunts , design for living , will be published by knopf in the fall they were not happy outside the theater , so they made their own theater and performed they were always on they used each part of their estate they would take guests to an arbor and would pack wine , very good china , linen a performance of a picnic carol channing , who stayed at ten chimneys in the 1960 s , saw it differently it was natural for them , said ms channing by telephone from los angeles some people think that s 'on , ' but it is n't that was the way we were uta hagen , who made her broadway debut with the lunts in 1938 in the seagull , put it this way they were theatrical , but not phony it is difficult today to explain the exalted station the lunts once held in the american theater fanatically loyal to the stage , they made only one major hollywood film together , a 1931 version of their breakthrough 1924 stage triumph , the guardsman it was a success , but the lunts liked artistic control , which hollywood did not offer they famously turned down a subsequent quartermilliondollar onepicture contract from universal with the telegram we can be bought , but we ca n't be bored this means that their fabled artistry exists for the most part only in written accounts and the memories of a fast diminishing number of colleagues and fans but fabled it was their sophisticated aplomb and naturalistic , overlapping style of delivery was widely celebrated it appeared effortless , but was not the lunts' sense of discipline could be terrifying for weeks , they would rehearse facing each other , legs interlocked , and would arrive at the first rehearsal letter perfect the tiniest gestures would be gone over endlessly , single lines tried 60 different ways on the closing night of design for living , fontanne rejoiced to a wondering coward over having finally perfected a difficult bit of stage business viewing road tours as nothing less than their duty , they breezed through months of onenight stands and they turned down bushels of party invitations , since an active social life might result in tired performances the payoff for this taxing regimen they almost never flopped one of the few places the lunts could let go and relax was ten chimneys or was it \?
sacramento , calif twice , john garamendi has run for governor of california twice , he has lost now , nine months after winning election as the california insurance commissioner a job he also held in the early 1990 s mr garamendi is back on the campaign trail , this time , he says , for the cause of reform his stated objective , as he shakes hands around the state , chats with grocers and fishmongers and labor leaders and delivers peppy speeches , is to win support for a plan to drive a stake into what many california business people say is their biggest , single problem the soaring cost of workers' compensation insurance but political friends and foes say mr garamendi , a democrat , may also be positioning himself for another run for the governor s office it is widely assumed that garamendi wants to run for governor again , said kevin spillane , a republican political consultant who advised mr garamendi s opponent , gary mendoza , a republican lawyer , in the election for insurance commissioner last fall the field of potential candidates for governor in 2006 is already crowded and , to many californians , that election seems far away but the workers' compensation problem is a real payday issue across the political spectrum , and mr garamendi is being widely , sometimes grudgingly , applauded for helping focus attention on it i'm in the process of building the best consumer protection agency in the country , mr garamendi said as he rode through los angeles recently in a chauffeured sedan , part of his barnstorming efforts to popularize his proposals here in the state capital , he has been pressing the legislature to take steps to reduce medical , legal and administrative costs , which he says are the main factors pushing insurance prices for california employers he wants standardized medical procedures and fees and the use of generic drugs , and he wants a medical review panel and an ombudsman to resolve disputes and reduce litigation but the proposed changes threaten some of the state s most powerful political forces and , although mr garamendi says he is increasingly optimistic , meaningful compromise is proving difficult a lot of bills have been introduced and the bulk of them have been bottled up in the legislature by special interest groups , said senator chuck poochigian , the chairman of the republican caucus in many ways , workers' compensation is a perfect issue for mr garamendi it provides an opportunity to raise his already high profile among voters with little political risk the price of workers' compensation insurance has risen higher in california than anywhere else in the country , costing jobs and forcing some businesses to close or leave the state but the problem is so big and so bewilderingly complex that even if he fails to achieve major change , he stands a good chance of winning praise for having fought the good fight mr garamendi , a former football player at the university of california at berkeley , former peace corps worker in africa and veteran of the state legislature , with a reputation for intelligence and a willingness to take on complex issues , is not denying he dreams of higher office but , for now , he says , he is concentrating on insurance if i look too far into the future , he said , i'm going to miss the opportunity to do what needs to be done today and tomorrow mr garamendi , who grew up on a ranch in the foothills of the sierras , served as bill clinton s campaign manager in california in 1992 after he was defeated in the gubernatorial primary in 1994 , the clinton administration found a job for him as a deputy secretary in the department of the interior in 1998 , mr garamendi opened a washington office for a los angeles investment firm , then went on to run for insurance commissioner his wife , patricia wilkinson garamendi , also served in the clinton administration and is now an assistant secretary in charge of international economic development for california they have six children mr garamendi , 58 , is well known in california on the streets and in airports , people call out to him he chats easily with them and tells them to urge their legislators to focus on workers' compensation he recently spent a full day talking workers' compensation with business owners in los angeles and was up at dawn the next day in sacramento to speak at a labor breakfast then he went on to address the associated general contractors of california he s trying to position himself as the moderate , probusiness democrat in the 2006 primary for governor , mr spillane said senator jackie speier , the chairman of the senate insurance committee , a democrat and political ally , said mr garamendi was first and foremost a candidate , adding i do n't think you can rule him out for 2006 \( like many other prominent democrats in california , mr garamendi said he would not be a candidate this fall should the state s republicans force a recall election of gov gray davis \) in his zeal for the spotlight , mr garamendi is an anomaly among the 51 insurance regulators in each of the states and the district of columbia
as last week s earnings report from interactivecorp indicated , the growth of online ticket sales continues unabated more than half of the 11 billion worth of tickets sold by the company s ticketmaster division in the third quarter were bought online , reducing ticketmaster s reliance on more capitalintensive sales channels like ticket outlets and telephone banks and just as the internet has proved a boon to ticketmaster and competing brokers like ticketscom , so too has it helped entertainment businesses and sports franchises fill seats that might otherwise have gone unsold the national basketball association s memphis grizzlies are a case in point the team moved from vancouver , british columbia , in 2001 after a feeble sixyear tenure there it settled into the 21 , 000seat pyramid , and is planning a new 250 million arena , the fedex forum , scheduled to open in memphis next year in either arena , the grizzlies face the challenge of selling seats for one of the worst teams in the league , playing in the nba s smallest market mike golub , the team s senior vice president for business operations , said that because the grizzlies must attract fans from well beyond their metropolitan area , the internet has become an important sales tool this technology makes our region smaller , mr golub said by emailing 25 , 000 people on the team s email newsletter list , as well as past customers , with news about coming games and other memphisarea events , he said , fans are more likely to make the trip people around here are conditioned to driving five hours for a game , he said it is difficult to quantify the web s effect on sales , he said but email alerts and other online features like one that enables groups to buy and manage tickets in bulk have helped fill seats , no question the web will also be instrumental in helping the grizzlies sell advancepurchase seats at the new arena , mr golub said using a service by ballena technologies , the grizzlies plan to begin enabling prospective ticket buyers for the 200405 season to see 360degree views from any section in the arena , including the 59 luxury suites you can talk all day about the new sight lines in the forum , but until you demonstrate it with this tool , it wo n't really hit home , mr golub said fans get very emotionally invested in their seats it s like buying a new home , just not necessarily the same price well , in some cases , maybe indeed , luxury suites at the new arena will sell for 99 , 000 to 225 , 000 for a 41game regular home season the grizzlies are hardly unique in their reliance on the web according to nba executives , online sales represent 70 percent of all nonboxoffice ticket sales for tickets sold remotely , it s far and away the preferred medium , said bernie mullen , the nba s senior vice president for marketing and team business operations among other things , mr mullen said , the internet has reduced ticket buyers' reliance on scalpers , thanks to technologies that allow ticket holders to forward unused tickets to friends , or sell them online with services like ticket forwarding , which is provided by ticketmaster , ticket holders , for a transaction fee of about 2 , email a digital version of their ticket to a recipient in the handoff , ticketmaster voids the bar code on the original ticket and issues a new one to the recipient , who then prints out the ticket and bar code from the computer bar code scanners at the ticket gate validate the ticket the nba is also working with ticketmaster to study the buying history of its fans , and it sends email alerts about games they may be interested in , said brenda spoonemore , senior vice president for interactive services at the league s entertainment division other sports leagues are also enamored with online ticket sales , even in cases where such sales might seem superfluous the new york giants football team have sold out every game since it moved to giants stadium in 1976 , and have about 23 , 500 people on its season ticket waiting list yet john mara , the giants' executive vice president and chief operating officer , said internet ticket sales were a potentially important tool in reducing noshows the economic effects of noshows are significant parking alone costs 10 to 15 a car , and the team receives 25 to 30 percent of stadium concession sales last month , the giants were the first national football league team to roll out ticketmaster s teamexchange service , an online auction that works similarly to ticket forwarding , except that recipients pay a percentage fee above the face value of the ticket as of late last week , about 500 tickets had been resold for the team s first three home games , but the feature could grow in importance , mr mara said , depending on the team s performance it s not unusual late in the year for us to have 5 , 000 or 10 , 000 noshows , mr mara said if it s a poor season , that number could go way up noshows are more problematic for the national hockey league , which depends heavily on parking and concession revenue because the money it receives from television rights is much less than that of the nfl , nba and major league baseball scott carmichael , vice president for club relations for the nhl , said about 90 percent of the league s fans have online access , and more than 60 percent of singlegame purchasers now buy their tickets over the web we 'll see that 60 percent number continue to climb as this technology evolves , mr carmichael said beyond sports , music fans have also been quick to migrate to online ticket purchases , said chris hearne , the executive vice president for tickets and customer services at clear channel entertainment clear channel , which owns or operates more than 125 arenas and other entertainment sites in the united states and abroad , will sell more than 1 billion in tickets online this year , or more than half its total , mr hearne said clear channel relies on ticketmaster to provide ticketing services in most of its locations mr hearne said clear channel s online sales efforts have allowed us to do things that were never before possible , like emailing lastminute offers for concert tickets , merchandise and backstage meetings with band members one such offer this summer , auctioned by clear channel on ebay during the lollapalooza tour , resulted in the sale of 10 tickets for an average of 900 each ticket auctions have been a source of controversy since ticketmaster introduced a service last month allowing entertainment sites to sell seats to the highest bidders clear channel tested the service with a sting concert in october in new york with prices averaging about 90 in the 1 , 680seat hammerstein ballroom but the company is moving very carefully with this , mr hearne said we 're most concerned about pricing tickets out of the reach of fans david goldberg , ticketmaster s executive vice president for strategy and business development , said none of the company s clients was currently planning another auction they 're approaching it cautiously , he said , probably rightfully so but , mr goldberg said , lost in the speculation that people might be forced to buy the best seats for 1 , 000 at auction is the idea that the new system might benefit other fans by his reasoning , if people paid the venue higher prices for the best seats , rather than buying them from scalpers or brokers , the remaining seats could be offered at lower prices the biggest story should n't be that someone paid 1 , 000 for a front row seat , he said it should be that because of that person , someone else was able to see the show in the last row for 5 and those seats might 've gone empty photo

kibbutz yagur , israel , oct 5 at this treelined kibbutz , one of the oldest and largest in israel , the big event at the nursery school on sunday was supposed to be a birthday party for 4yearold liran zeraviv instead , the class was greeted by a social worker who faced the task of explaining that liran and four of his family members , spanning three generations , had been killed by a palestinian suicide bomber a day earlier in the nearby city of haifa the kids do n't understand , and we do n't understand either , said hillel levyatan , 62 , a lifelong resident of the kibbutz , a communal farm we 're all in a state of shock in a country as small as israel , it seems almost everyone knows someone touched by the violence that was true at the kibbutz , but until saturday , none of its 1 , 300 residents had been harmed during the past three years of fighting the bomber , a palestinian woman , entered maxim , a seaside restaurant , and detonated her explosives next to the table of brouria zeraviv , 54 her son bezalel , 30 his wife keren , 29 and the couple s two children , liran and noya , a 1yearold girl another family , the almogs , lost four members in the attack , including a couple , 71 and 70 , their son , 43 , and a 9yearold grandson the bombing came the day before the start of jewish holiday yom kippur , the solemn day of atonement made unspeakably sad for the tightknit community at the base of the treecovered hills just east of haifa brouria zeraviv s husband , dr freddy zeraviv , an orthopedist who specializes in treating back problems , did not attend the lunch , and was in mourning on sunday at the kibbutz they joined the kibbutz in 1985 , which made them virtual newcomers in a community that was established in 1922 , and where a fair number of residents spend their entire lives a kibbutz can be a very closed society , said benny shilo , 66 , another lifelong resident but they fit in and were all strong members of this community because they had such a good nature families like this make you happy to live here brouria zeraviv could often be seen with her grandchildren at the playground her son bezalel was training to be a chef , and his wife had served as an assistant at the grade school and was working at the greenhouse like most residents , they had lowkey and relaxed lives , though haifa , the country s busiest port , is just a few miles distant more than any other israeli city , haifa has been a place where jews and arabs have coexisted in relative harmony the restaurant that was bombed has been coowned by a jewish family and an arab family for nearly four decades about 50 arabs work at the kibbutz , which has a factory that produces metal cans and plastic tubing the farm fields grow cotton and genetically modified tomatoes , cucumbers and watermelons the kibbutz also provides hebrewlanguage courses for jews moving to israel like most communal farms built on a socialist ethos , the residents of kibbutz yagur have tended to be liberal politically , with a tradition of supporting peace talks with palestinians despite all the middle east turmoil over the decades , the only previous attack that so directly affected the kibbutz was in 1933 , when three residents were killed by arabs as they returned home one night , mr shilo said we have never had such a colossal disaster like this one , mr shilo said he predicted that at the funeral on tuesday , everyone from the community will be there , and i'm sure it will include our arab employees , who will also feel our grief photos brouria zeraviv and her granddaughter , noya , shown above in an undated photograph , died in the haifa bombing also killed were , from left below , noya s mother , keren , her father , bezalel , and brother , liran

blagoveshchensk , russia nobody would ever mistake the las vegas casino welcom s you ! cries a crawl of red lights above the door for a las vegas casino there is no faux great pyramid , just a nondescript room with seven slot machines , a roulette wheel and three poker tables no luxury hotel soars above the betting parlor the only floor show is a very drunk prostitute trying and failing to find her way out the door but most of all on this may evening , the las vegas is not las vegas because there are no gamblers at 10 pm in downtown blagoveshchensk , barely a halfdozen forlorn figures are feeding the slots or placing bets , compared with 30 on an ordinary night here more telling still , only one of them is chinese we like to gamble with the russians , the one chinese man , 21yearold li yanchou , a student at a blagoveshchensk teachers' institute , said between bets tourists , businessmen who have money a lot of them would like to come here but they 're not that is bad news for the las vegas and for the casino macao on the opposite corner , the owl a few steps down lenin street , the amursky a few steps up lenin street , the uzbek restaurant and kasino just across lenin street , and a halfdozen others unlikely as it seems , blagoveshchensk , a downattheheels city of 170 , 000 in remote southern siberia , has carved itself a prosperous niche as the mecca for chinese gamblers or had , until the ailment a local man was suffering from was tentatively diagnosed in early may as russia s only known case of sars , or severe acute respiratory syndrome faster than you can say snake eyes , local border posts snapped shut and the casinos' chinese clientele all but dried up local officials have since said the disease was not sars , but health officials in moscow have said they stand by the original diagnosis until tests prove otherwise who could know that this thing would happen \? said the manager of the macao , who gave her name only as svetlana usually we rely on tourists now the only chinese here are the ones who live in the city for blagoveshchensk residents , it is a piece of uniquely bad luck with a falling population , no dominant industry and no sightseeing outside a handsome but crumbling stock of siberian log cabins , the city appears to have but one natural advantage it sits on the amur river , with a chinese province of 39 million people just 500 yards away on the opposite bank local entrepreneurs made the most of it the city and outlying areas now have 13 casinos , with 3 more on the drawing board , all catering to chinese patrons there are far more casinos here than anywhere in russia , save moscow \( population 10 million \) the area s gambling joints pump more than 11 million a year in taxes into government coffers not as much as the booming gold mining industry , but enough to make gambling one of the major businesses in amur province by most estimates , 7 of every 10 blagoveshchensk customers come from across the amur gambling is illegal in most of china , and while underground betting parlors thrive there , a jaunt to russia is less furtive and perhaps more fun russia s far east has larger and more cosmopolitan cities vladivostok and khabarovsk that offer not just casinos but also direct air service from china by contrast , little blagoveshchensk does not even have a bridge across the amur incoming gamblers take boats in the summer , drive across the frozen river in winter and ride hovercrafts in spring and fall , when ice floes rule out other options yet blagoveshchensk seems to have captured the chinese heart part of it , apparently , is that chinese fear the far higher crime rates in bigger russian cities , and part is that in major towns they must compete for a preferred spot at the tables with sharpelbowed , highstakes russian gamblers in khabarovsk and vladivostok you have to pay an entrance fee to gamble , said marat makrtchyan , owner of two casinos and president of the amur province association of gambling organizations none of the casinos here charge entrance fees for us the main clients are the chinese , and chinese of different levels lowincome chinese may gamble at one table , and we can set up a vip table for rich chinese and they feel this atmosphere many come from heihe , a chinese city of about 70 , 000 directly across the river but increasingly , mr makrtchyan said , they are coming from big cities like harbin and even beijing , as well as the great population centers of southern china sars is believed to have originated in southern china , and as the russian authorities have focused on the chinese presence in the border area of siberia as a potential entry route for the virus , casinos have been seen as a potential vector mr makrtchyan scoffs at that , although not every casino operator agrees the macao , for example , sprays its gambling hall with disinfectant every three hours after all , mr makrtchyan said , european nations have kept their borders open even as they treat genuine cases of sars it s a typical russian attitude 'what if \? ' he said it s very easy to destroy established economic links by illiterate steps photo the las vegas casino , at lenin and shevchenko streets in downtown blagoveshchensk , is one of five gambling parlors within a stone s throw , and one of 13 in the metropolitan area of the downatthe heels city \( sergei kivrin for the new york times \) map of russia highlighting blagoveshchensk blagoveshchensk draws gamblers from china , just across the border
phoenix , june 18 bishop thomas j o'brien of the phoenix diocese resigned today , succumbing to a year of turmoil over the sexual abuse crisis in the church and the more personal disgrace of being arrested in a fatal hitandrun accident for decades , bishop o'brien was known as a selfeffacing builder of schools and an advocate for the poor but he also recently acknowledged having protected priests from numerous complaints of sexual abuse friends and associates described the 67yearold roman catholic bishop as a fairly timid and spiritual man who fell into deep despair under the strain of the disclosures of repeated cases of sexually predatory priests under his supervision and relentless pressure of a prosecutor who this month won an extraordinary admission of misconduct from the bishop he has been unraveled by all of this , said michael c manning , a lawyer who represented bishop o'brien for several months last year he is just basically a meek , shy , utterly nonsecular man , a guy who went right from the high school into the seminary with no realworld experiences the troubles multiplied over the weekend , when , the police said , bishop o'brien struck a pedestrian here in a fatal hitandrun accident on monday , bishop o'brien was charged with leaving the scene of the accident , a felony he was escorted past a row of news cameras as he was led into the county jail for booking , a humiliating punctuation to his 22 years as spiritual leader of the diocese after posting bond , the bishop went into seclusion at his house and drew up his resignation , which the vatican quickly accepted i love and support the catholic people , even those who may have felt disappointed in my leadership this past year , he said in a statement the vatican announced his departure this morning , citing church law that allows a cleric to step down because of illness or some other grave reason he retains his miter , but all his churchly authority is gone the vatican named archbishop michael j sheehan of santa fe , nm , as interim administrator of the diocese here archbishop sheehan took over the santa fe archdiocese a decade ago and has settled 200 sexual abuse claims against priests and established a zerotolerance policy for clerical misconduct church officials said it could take as long as a year before the vatican settled on a permanent bishop we ca n't change the past , but we can do a lot about the future , archbishop sheehan said this afternoon at a news conference here although none of bishop o'brien s friends offered an excuse for his problems , they said he had been so depressed and distracted by the accident investigation that he seemed to lose the ability to deal with the challenges of daily life , including driving bishop o'brien grew up in indianapolis and attended st meinrad seminary college in indiana he was ordained in 1961 , fulfilling a calling that he felt from age 10 , an aide said his first assignment was at the immaculate conception parish in douglas , a border town where he ministered to hundreds of mexican immigrants he rose quickly through the hierarchy in arizona , becoming bishop here in 1981 , when he was in his mid40 s mr manning said although the bishop was popular with many parishioners , particularly hispanic immigrants , others in the community believed that he was ill served by a small coterie of overprotective diocesan officials who reinforced his tendencies to avoid tough decisions or fight the wrong battles many catholics and noncatholics alike have been critical of his role as bishop over the years and felt was not the strong leader that the church and this diocese needed , mr manning said many believed over the last 15 years he received very poor advice but richard romley , the maricopa county attorney who this month reached the unusual agreement under which bishop o'brien acknowledged mishandling cases of priestly abuse , said it was the bishop s actions that put many children at risk according to court documents and victims' advocates , the pattern was set as early as 1979 , when the family of mark kennedy , a 10yearold altar boy in tempe , went to father o'brien , then vicar of the phoenix diocese , to complain that a parish priest , the rev patrick colleary , had molested their son mark kennedy s mother , doris , said in an interview today when we went to o'brien , the first thing he said was 'did you tell anyone \? ' when i told him i had talked about it with one of my friends , he pointed at me across the desk and thundered , 'you should n't have done that ! ' and then he basically threw us out of his office father colleary was transferred to another parish , where his predatory behavior continued , according to prosecutors he was charged with felony child abuse this year and has fled to ireland , where mr romley is seeking his extradition bishop o'brien continued to shield abusive priests throughout his tenure as bishop , according to prosecutors and victims' families in his many years as bishop of this diocese , o'brien had a pattern of not responding to victims of abuse , always protecting the priests , always protecting the church , said paul pfaffenberger , organizer of the phoenix chapter of the survivors network of those abused by priests , or snap , a victims' group his personal theology in the church is very much geared toward social services , justice toward the poor , toward acceptance of all people as children of god the only time that he seems to be out of character is when he is threatened then he has shown tendencies both for fight and for flight
stockton heath , england in their sixyear struggle to prove that they are not a party of incompetent hasbeens , britain s sadsack conservatives have tried nearly everything they have hired and fired party strategists and spokesmen they have introduced and discarded new logos and slogans they have switched leaders three times , most recently in october , when michael howard , a former home secretary , usurped the chronically hapless iain duncan smith but the party has yet to convince voters like ian talbott that it presents a plausible alternative to prime minister tony blair s labor government , which swept into power in 1997 their leaders just are n't strong enough , said mr talbott , 49 , a lifelong tory who looks back with rueful nostalgia on the days when margaret thatcher was prime minister and the party seemed to know what it was and what it wanted fed up , he voted for the liberal democrats in the last election the conservatives do n't seem to have many policies , do they \? mr talbott said the conservatives were the dominant force in british politics through much of the 20th century , producing political giants like mrs thatcher , stanley baldwin and winston churchill , and setting the tone for britain s view of itself and its place in the world but after a long period marked by damaging struggles for power , internal policy disputes on issues like europe , an inability to capitalize on missteps by mr blair s government and the steady usurpation of traditional conservative positions by the newly centrist , even rightist labor party , the conservatives are struggling to find their way much of its problem has been in identifying a leader with the stature to take on mr blair , who has a gravitas that is at times distinctly presidential none of the postthatcher tory leaders john major , lampooned as a colorless nonentity who tucked his shirt into his underpants william hague , who never overcame the handicap of looking like an infant alfred e neuman and mr duncan smith , who sounded as if he had a chicken bone permanently lodged in his throat could effectively compete with mr blair because they 're such an elderly , narrowly based party , they 've saddled themselves with a variety of incompetent leaders , robert harris , the author and political columnist , said in an interview but if mr howard is supposed to engineer a conservative renaissance , it has not yet happened when asked if they would vote conservative in a national election , only 30 percent or so of those surveyed in a recent poll said they would a figure that has been largely unchanged in recent months , despite the drop in mr blair s approval ratings over issues like crime , the iraq war , and public services the concerns facing the conservative party , i think , are wider and deeper than just the personality of the leader , nick gibb , a conservative member of parliament , wrote recently in the guardian it goes to the whole direction of our policies we have policies about how people can escape from state services and opt out , but do n't really have an agenda or an understanding of what s actually wrong with our comprehensive schools and with our hospitals meanwhile , the party has blundered itself into irrelevance in much of the country it holds just 163 seats of the 659 in parliament it has no parliamentary presence in most of england s northern cities , including liverpool , newcastle , leeds and bradford there is only one tory member of parliament from scotland and none from wales stockton heath , a pretty village of small shops , big houses and pleasantly comfortable people , is classic tory country a suburb of warrington , midway between manchester and liverpool , it lies in a parliamentary district that used to be solidly conservative but the party lost its seat to labor by 191 votes in 1992 in the last election , in 2001 , the labor candidate romped in by a margin of 7 , 397 votes , out of 45 , 497 cast part of the problem here , as elsewhere , is that tories are old although the party says that its numbers are growing fast among college students , the average age of the country s 250 , 000 or so duespaying members is more than 60 i'm now 60 , and i'm still one of the younger ones here , said mike haworth , former chairman of the warrington south conservative association many of those older tories look at the 1980 s as the high point of british conservatism , and they see in michael howard , 62 , a reassuring link to those days he served as employment secretary and home secretary in conservative governments but his strengths his experience , command of his material , tough debating skills and his natural appeal to the right based on his record are weaknesses in today s altered political landscape he represents the old guard at a time it is unclear what relevance the old guard has to the future of the party howard reminds people of the past , said vernon bogdanor , professor of government at oxford university the present opposition is not credible because of the public s memories of the conservative governments of the 1990 s , and because they do n't seem to have a coherent theme or set of alternatives
phnom penh , cambodia , april 15 it seems straightforward enough some of the worst mass killers of our times are living freely now in cambodia , playing with their grandchildren and tending their flower gardens they should be put on trial last month , after six years of difficult negotiations , cambodia and the united nations agreed to set up an international tribunal to try the top leaders of the khmer rouge , inventors of the killing fields but instead of cheering , human rights groups have risen up in opposition the problem is that retreating from its policy in similar tribunals in other countries the united nations has effectively ceded control of the proceedings to local judges under a complex formula that gives them the power to make the final call on who is prosecuted and who is convicted cambodian law will take precedence over the guidelines agreed upon for the tribunal , reducing the united nations in the words of its legal counsel , hans corell , last year to a technical assistance provider to a cambodian court in cambodia , where the judiciary is weak , corrupt and politically docile , that means prime minister hun sen will be the master of ceremonies , with results that are predictable only to him on the world stage , it means that the new cambodian formula , with its more relaxed approach to international law , will now be a united nationssanctioned precedent that other countries can demand for themselves justice is not served by diluting international standards to suit the occasion or a government in power , amnesty international said in a statement last december in addition , some experts are challenging the decision to limit the trial to the top leaders and those who were most responsible , effectively granting amnesty for lower ranking killers from the perspective of truth and justice , a de facto show trial of a few senior political figures would almost be a worstcase scenario , said steve heder , an expert on cambodia at the school of oriental and african studies in london but this trial is the only one on offer the cambodian formula is the best the united nations is going to get after running up against a brick wall in its talks with mr hun sen s men time is on the side of the killers , who caused the deaths of 17 million people through execution , starvation , disease and overwork when they ruled cambodia from 1975 to 1979 their chief , pol pot , is dead with the surviving leaders old and sick , this could be the last chance to put them in the dock so at its bluntest , the question now is whether a potentially flawed trial is better than no trial at all even if real justice is not done , will it be worth it to see these extraordinary creatures on display , facing their accusers and making their elaborate excuses \? it would offer at least a gesture to their victims the formula agreed upon is not in itself fatally flawed it s how it s applied that counts the proof of the pudding is in the eating , said the former american ambassador , kent weidemann , admittedly stringing together clich s do n't let the perfect be the enemy of the good let s give it a shot the worry is that the door has been left open to the kind of manipulation that is standard practice in cambodia after much wrangling , the two sides agreed to set up a mixed tribunal with both foreign and cambodian prosecutors and judges in an awkward supermajority formula , cambodian judges would dominate but would need the vote of at least one foreign judge for any decision the cambodians would have the advantage in resolving disputed rulings the first caution in any analysis is that a trial could still be derailed mr hun sen has an almost perfect record of making promises he has no intention of keeping and of undermining the country s democratic processes negotiations to create a tribunal have been punctuated by breakthroughs that came to nothing the arguments in favor of proceeding are essentially based on wishful thinking who knows \? things could go well mr hun sen could break his habit of preaching what he does not practice he could turn out to be a champion of democracy in disguise he could loosen his dictatorial grip and let justice take its course if things go terribly wrong , the united nations can pull out at any point it would be a shame to waste this opportunity , mr weidemann said if it fails , it fails but honestly , i think that would be a real shame certainly , the arguments of the idealists stand on firmer ground international standards must not be compromised it is foolhardy to base one s hopes on the good faith of the cambodian government the country needs to see real justice done as a foundation for democratic reform the cambodian people deserve better than this after all they have suffered the alternative , though , seems to be to let the old killers fade away undisturbed do the people who make these sensible arguments really want to be the ones who finally close the door on any trial for khmer rouge leaders \? honestly , it would be a real shame photos three inmates held at a khmer rouge prison in phnom penh , cambodia , from 1975 to 1979 cambodia and the united nations agreed last month to set up a tribunal to try top leaders of the khmer rouge , who were responsible for about 17 million deaths \( photographs from photo archive group tuol sleng museum of genocide \)
tehran ahmad batebi , a student activist , ran so afoul of the government that he received a death sentence in 1999 it was never carried out , but he languished in jail until on one recent day he was

the united nations human rights envoy , ambeyi ligabo a few days later , mr batebi had a weak voice and said that he could not talk much , said his father , mohammad baqer batebi , who spoke with him

arrested like many other students , he had taken part in prodemocracy rallies and staunchly supported president mohammad khatami mr batebi is the symbol of a normal student , and what he has gone through shows the kind of pressure all these young students go through , said ahmad zeidabadi , a journalist who was once a fellow prisoner of mr batebi despite the pressure , none of these students , including ahmad , ever asked for clemency the tough days in prison have shattered him at the cafe , he pulled out of his pocket a fistful of medicine that he says he needs to calm his jittery nerves it is a kind of disease of the nervous system , not multiple sclerosis but similar to it , that could be cured under normal condition , he said he has lost teeth and has hearing problems and bad vision because of the beatings of his face he has bad lungs , for which he blames his cell s location in the basement next to the main sewage pipe most prisoners are sick because of lack of air and the harsh smell of the chemicals used to kill the smell , he said one of his cellmates , akbar mohammadi , had lung surgery three years ago , he sneaked a letter out of prison describing the beatings he underwent and how guards once pushed his face into a clogged drain full of excrement the authorities at the prison summoned him twice to carry out the death sentence they told me to take off my clothes and wear a white dress , he said in the interview every single bone was shaking in my body , and i could hear their sound , he said about the first time he felt the rope around his neck he was reprieved , but the next time , they kept him on the stool for two hours before they announced that the execution had been postponed before i was jailed , i thought that the stories others told about their prison experiences were exaggerated , he said but i told only onetenth of what happened to me the prison memoirs of other activists told of similar experiences habibollah davaran , another political prisoner , wrote that he had been beaten repeatedly until he passed out farhad behbehani wrote that his feet had been beaten that then he was forced to walk in freezing weather until his new arrest , mr batebi lived in a cell with a dozen other political prisoners , including two other activists , mr mohammadi and mehrdad lohrasbi , who received death sentence at the same time he did he developed close ties with a colleague , abbass amir entezam , who has been in prison for 25 years every day , after reading two government newspapers , the men discuss politics mr batebi reads in the mornings and goes to the bath to wash his clothes for three years now , mr batebi has been able to study sociology from prison , and can take exams at payamenour university the condition is that i should not speak to any of the students , he said his joy in prison is a spanish guitar , which he luckily found in the cultural section of the prison and learned to play prison has turned mr batebi , once very religious , into a secular person i read many books and saw different people in jail , he said i learned that i have to depend on myself and no other power to survive despite the common feeling of disappointment toward president khatami , mr batebi says he owes his life to him thanks to him , there were at least a couple of free newspapers to write about ahmad batebi and force the authorities to throw away the death sentence , he said i would have certainly been executed years earlier two weeks ago , while he was out , he attended the memorial service for the brother of a dissident cleric , abdullah nouri , where he exchanged greetings with mr khatami he chatted with the reformist speaker of parliament , mehdi karoubi , who promised to speak to judiciary officials to

paris , march 21 the french authorities said today that the discovery monday of a small quantity of the deadly toxin ricin at a paris train station probably thwarted a terrorist attack by islamic militants but they said they had no proof the conclusion was drawn from contacts between groups of militants in france and britain , they said , where ricin was discovered in january during an antiterrorist sweep in london one can make a connection even if we do not posses the proof today , the interior minister , nicolas sarkozy , said mr sarkozy , speaking on french radio , said the police had also found acetone and ethanol at the gare de lyon , where the ricin was found during a routine check of lockers a mixture of the three can make an extremely nasty poison , he said he added that acetone and ethanol could also serve with castor beans to produce ricin , which is relatively easy to make into a powder or mist french officials were particularly troubled because the arrests in london in january of six suspected militants , who were found to have ricin , came after the british authorities received information that the french police had obtained during a series of earlier arrests of suspected militants in the suburbs of paris since november , the french police have arrested 29 suspected islamic militants , mostly of north african origin , including several who belonged to a cell with ties to separatists in chechnya and to al qaeda france s antiterrorist police have been on heightened alert , fearing attacks , possibly in reaction to the war in iraq prime minister jeanpierre raffarin appealed for calm , telling reporters , there is no particular reason today to be anxious , none , but simply attentive to all that can happen , because today the forms of terrorism are evolving , and we also have to evolve in our vigilance jonathan stevenson , a terrorism expert at the international institute of strategic studies in london , said the discovery of ricin on both sides of the english channel shows a serious willingness to cross a threshold from conventional weapons to weapons of mass destruction , or at least mass disruption
washington , nov 15 the securities and exchange commission failed for years to police the mutual fund industry effectively because it was captive to the industry when writing new regulations , was preoccupied by other problems on wall street and was severely short of staff and money , current and former officials say i believe this is the worst scandal we 've seen in 50 years , and i ca n't say i saw it coming , said arthur levitt , the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission for nearly eight years under the clinton administration i probably worried about funds less than insider trading , accounting issues and fair disclosure to investors by public companies the senate will hold two hearings in the coming week as lawmakers and the commission begin to consider how to overhaul the oversight of an industry caught in an escalating series of accusations each week , there are new revelations of wrongdoing , fraud lawsuits and executive resignations at companies that were previously considered to be some of the most responsible in the industry in numerous instances , top executives are accused of trading rapidly in and out of their own funds to reap profits at a cost to other fund investors many brokers failed to give appropriate discounts to customers and a large percentage of funds appear to have provided confidential and potentially lucrative portfolio information to large customers , possibly in exchange for their business some regulators say that while many of these practices may have existed during the boom years of the 1990 s , they may have accelerated in more recent years as the market declined current and former officials say that just as the mutual fund industry exploded in size it now controls 7 trillion for 95 million investors a litany of regulatory lapses , political pressures and market forces coincided to sharply undercut oversight there have been decades of looking the other way , said gary gensler , a former treasury under secretary in the clinton administration , former cohead of finance at goldman sachs and coauthor of the book the great mutual fund trap , published in 2002 at its core , the scandals reflect the fact that mutual fund governance is broken and washington has stood by and allowed it to remain broken , for a long time , without any real effort to reform the system to the benefit of investors none of the more than a dozen cases that have now been brought resulted from routine inspections by the commission , current officials said before the recent scandals , which were exposed by state regulators , the commission s examination unit was never specifically assigned to look for the sorts of trading abuses that have been revealed critics and former officials also say the industry s trade organization , the investment company institute , exerted enormous influence both at the commission and in congress in shaping what critics believe has been a lax set of policies that have further hampered enforcement efforts one of the clearest examples of the industry s clout can be seen in the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 , the landmark legislation that was congress s response to the wave of corporate scandals that included enron and worldcom the broad corporate governance reforms and antifraud provisions of the act have been felt in boardrooms across the nation but at the urging of the institute , the drafters granted the mutual fund industry significant exemptions from some of the more important provisions those provisions enacted stringent conflictofinterest rules , required greater disclosure of transactions between management and large shareholders , and imposed tougher requirements on management to monitor internal controls \( the institute ultimately failed , however , to persuade the commission to exempt it from requirements under the sarbanesoxley act that mutual fund executives certify their financial results \) moreover , some critics and former officials say that the commission has not imposed tougher disclosure rules and tighter management requirements because of the influence of the institute , an accusation that its executives strongly deny lynn e turner , a former chief accountant at the sec during the 1990 s , said that it was routine in weekly senior staff meetings for officials to consider the views of the institute and that senior staff members were always concerned about taking on the organization he also said that it was rare for the commission to adopt a regulation against the institute s wishes they were one of the more forceful organizations , mr turner said you 're talking about people that were pretty wealthy they had influence influence on the hill , and influence with the staff in a speech three years ago marking the institute s 60th anniversary , mr levitt , the former sec chairman , praised the partnership between the commission and the institute the ici and the commission continue to work together towards making the mutual fund industry the most trusted , transparent and respected in the world , he said
foxboro , mass , oct 12 giants running back tiki barber lay facedown on the wet gillette stadium grass sunday , the ball long since knocked from his hands getting up to chase the play would be futile looking up was too painful he could hear everything he needed to know it s horrible , barber said i did n't watch i knew the giants had committed two turnovers on their first three offensive plays , and barber s fumble was being spirited 38 yards into the end zone by new england patriots linebacker matt chatham those 7 points would be all new england needed it was one more touchdown than the giants managed in a 176 loss the early sense of impending doom came with matching gloom , a pesky rain and a chilling wind , the kind of day when it is hard to tell where the clouds stop and the fog starts less than three minutes into the game , mud had already turned barber s white jersey into a brown smear and things would go downhill from there for the giants all week , the giants had been lectured about the evils of turnovers by coach jim fassel they had been given extra study time fassel did everything but send them into timeout yet on the first play of the game , quarterback kerry collins s pass was batted at the line of scrimmage by defensive end richard seymour and intercepted by cornerback tyrone poole the patriots did not score , but barber s fumble gave them another chance chatham scored barely two and a half minutes into the game by the time the game ended , the giants had committed five turnovers and caused none they had fallen to 23 under the most dispiriting circumstances we 're not very good right now , barber said it starts with myself we know we have talent and we have to do things to win games instead of the things that lose games for a while , though , the patriots \( 42 \) were as bad as the giants , minus the turnovers in the swampy conditions , their offense went nowhere for a half , gaining 29 yards and a single first down quarterback tom brady completed one 7yard pass but the patriots still had a 73 lead the giants had mustered some offense but kept misfiring when it came time to score they settled for a 22yard field goal by brett conway , the replacement for the injured matt bryant , but he missed two , from 47 and 49 yards , in the half when you get a couple of turnovers , that s the way it is , new england coach bill belichick said when you get five turnovers and they do n't get any , it s probably a 95 percent winning percentage in the nfl in the third quarter , the patriots' offense came to life long enough to put away the game their first drive of the second half reached the giants' 10 , and adam vinatieri kicked a 28yard field goal on the patriots' next drive , the giants appeared to have the momentum again defensive end michael strahan smothered brady for a 10yard sack , pushing the patriots back to their 9 with a thirdand16 brady , though , found receiver david givens open on the left side of the giants' errorprone zone defense , and the 21yard gain put new england on the move later in the drive , brady hit receiver david patten with a 39yard pass it was a perfect throw and an acrobatic catch along the sideline by patten despite excellent coverage by cornerback will peterson that got the patriots to the 18 running back mike cloud scored from the 1 three plays later for a 173 lead it was the one burst new england needed to end all doubt we just tried to block better and eliminate penalties , belichick said honestly , that is what we were trying to do we said we are just going to run the stuff that we know and let s stop screwing it up the giants could not stop making the same mistakes collins threw two more interceptions in the second half to match his two in the first he attempted 59 passes to tie his career high , completing 35 for 314 yards , but could not get past the turnovers and other mistakes it s disappointing , collins said it s frustrating some of them have been bad luck but we have to stop it it s careless but you ca n't play scared , either , but we have to be more careful with the ball for their part , the giants' defensive players were not boasting or pointing fingers they had held new england to 220 yards , which is more than respectable , and brady was a fairly woeful 8 of 21 passing for 112 yards it was the second straight strong game for the defense , but both games had their humbling moments , the thirdquarter touchdown drive by the patriots being one of them the defensive players also know their offensive counterparts offered plenty of support when they gave up reams of yardage against dallas and washington we needed to be winning at halftime and we were n't , safety shaun williams said i look at it as , their defense scored a touchdown and we did n't that could have helped our team a lot , if we could have gotten a turnover or even a score on defense it s a team sport i have a lot of confidence in our offense they put us in position to win , so you ca n't say much about them i know they 'll be back the giants were saying the same thing about themselves they are far too familiar with slow starts they were 34 last season and made the playoffs with a late charge of course , they were also 34 in the 2001 season and finished 79 linebacker mike barrow stood in the middle of the locker room and proclaimed that he still believed the giants were headed for the super bowl others wished the start of that road would get smoother one of these years the slow starts have become frustrating i ca n't tell you why , barber , who ran for 71 yards on 22 carries , said i wish i could i wish i could get that demon out of here , get guys to do exceptional things , get myself to do exceptional things we 're making too many mistakes over and over and over again some of them have been more painful than others , particularly the ones experienced face down on a wet field on a day that would only get more dreary extra points giants kicker brett conway missed two of his four fieldgoal attempts , and coach jim fassel said he ran an extra play to get closer to another field goal in the fourth quarter , but quarterback kerry collins was intercepted one of conway s misses , a 49yarder in the second quarter , was partly blocked conway is filling in while matt bryant recovers from a pulled hamstring fassel said he would not evaluate whether he wanted a different replacement until monday conway said the wet conditions were a problem they were n't ideal , put it that way , he said photos tiki barber s fumble , above , on the giants' third offensive play was returned for a touchdown by matt chatham , right \( photographs by associated press \)
when robert moses unveiled long island s parkways and levittown advertised its reasonably priced cookiecutter homes , new yorkers could n't uproot themselves from the city fast enough to claim their own patch of grass and breathe in all that fresh suburban air but now a recent study suggests that the twocar garages that go with that suburban dream may actually be hazardous to your health the study , which surveyed 200 , 000 men and women living in 448 counties across the country , found that people living in communities marked by sprawling development walked less in their daily routine and weighed more than people who live in more compact urban areas suburbanites , the study found , are also more likely to become obese and suffer from high blood pressure health and nutrition experts on long island say this study , the first to directly link obesity with the way communities are designed , simply reinforces what they have been saying for years that long islanders need to work on increasing their level of physical activity some planners and developers have heartily embraced the study s results , saying that it supports their efforts to redevelop downtown areas and create more pedestrianfriendly communities but others view the results with heavy skepticism and criticize the study as antisuburban and antidevelopment even if you ca n't walk a block or so to pick up a quart of milk in long island , they argue , the suburbs provide more parks and open space than cities do and therefore more opportunities for exercise and physical activity debbie brown , a recent transplant to dix hills from brooklyn , let out a big laugh when she was told about the study as she waited for her order at the drivethrough window at a dunkin' donuts in hempstead oh , i believe it , she said my exercise agenda is horrible , and i do n't walk anywhere a woman who was two cars behind ms brown agreed people do n't even walk around the corner out here , and nothing is convenient without a car , she said it s just a different way of living she said that she and her husband refused to buy a car for 12 full months after they moved from new york city to rockville centre in 2001 but now that they have succumbed , she said , she was too embarrassed to give her name because i'm so excited to have discovered this drivethrough reid ewing , the lead author of the study and a professor at the national center for smart growth at the university of maryland , said that researchers have found that the amount of physical activity people got during their leisure time did not vary much between cities and suburbs the difference is n't in their leisure but in how they spend the rest of their time , he said in an urban environment , you move more for transportation purposes instead of walking out of the house and into your car , you 're walking to lunch or the subway , and you 're climbing up and down those subway stairs the study used data from surveys compiled by the centers for disease control and prevention it found that in manhattan the most compact urban area in the nation an average adult weighs 1611 pounds , while the average adult weighs 1658 pounds in nassau county and 1664 in suffolk county the expected probability of obesity also increased from west to east , with 115 percent probability in new york city , 17 percent in nassau and 178 percent in suffolk patrick duggan , the executive director of sustainable long island , a group that promotes pedestrianfriendly development , thinks he knows why we have such limited walkability in long island communities , he said we just live such sedentary lives that it s not a big jump to make the correlation between sprawl and obesity mr duggan said his group hoped to study the way the design of specific long island communities affects health and obesity we just have not thought about the health implications when thinking about the design of our communities , he said i think the study is significant enough that planners and policy makers need to take notice , and we need to think about how if you 're driving all the time , you 're not contributing to your health in a meaningful way lee e koppelman , the executive director of the long island regional planning board , said that he was very skeptical of the study s findings because he contends that the difference of five pounds between city dwellers and suburbanites was negligible i know when i weigh myself at home , i'm 169 , but at my internist s it s 177 , he said so to me statistically , five pounds is a dead heat the importance of the study is that obesity is a national problem , and people in new york are n't off the hook they 're just as much at risk as people in the suburbs he has a point obesity has reached epidemic proportions nationally , and federal health officials are saying that it may soon overtake smoking as the nation s biggest health threat a recent national survey found that almost 65 percent of the adult population in the united states was overweight and almost one adult in three was obese state health department figures show that while less than 10 percent of the population was obese in 1985 , the figure had grown to 20 to 24 percent by 2001
nashua , nh , dec 19 a bonerattling december wind was blowing when senator john kerry started talking to the cameras and the notebooks gathered around him on the street in front of his presidential campaign headquarters here wearing a leather bomber jacket bearing the shoulder patches of the units he served with in vietnam , he made the case he nearly always makes i have the experience , mr kerry said i'm ready to lead america earlier in the day , sitting on a high metal stool in a classroom at hopkinton high school , he spelled it out more fully , telling the students seated in a horseshoe around him about the laws he had written flood insurance laws , crucial environmental protection laws i was in rio , in buenos aires , in kyoto , in the hague , he said , fighting the good fight against global warming the night before , at a chili feed at the peterborough historical society s handsome old meeting room , the senator embarked on a similar recital i led the fight on health care , mr kerry said i led the fight for early childhood education and for clean air what he meant , but never quite said , was that his rival howard dean , the former governor of vermont , had written none of those laws , attended none of those conferences , led none of those fights the closest mr kerry came was when he asked his audience at peterborough would you hire a contractor who had never built a house to build one for you \? there is something plaintive , something almost wistful about mr kerry these days , as if he finds it inconceivable that he is having so much trouble convincing his fellow new englanders that he and not dr dean has the experience needed for the presidency like hubert h humphrey in 1968 , mr kerry seems astonished that though he paid his dues , the nomination may go to a man who has not done so , at least in his eyes he hopes that he will prevail in the end , against expectations , as mr humphrey did a democrat elected lieutenant governor of massachusetts in 1982 , then to the senate two years later , mr kerry has been in the public eye for more than 20 years , and for that entire time his face has constantly been on boston television stations , which are heavily watched here in populous southern new hampshire yet he is doing far worse in this state , where the primary is set for jan 27 , than in iowa , where caucuses are scheduled for jan 19 , or so the polls say one recent new hampshire survey has him 25 percentage points behind dr dean , another has him 29 points back and a third has him 30 points down the potentially good news for the kerry camp has been a suggestion that dr dean is starting to turn off some voters mr kerry feels obliged to assure those listening to him that he is in the contest to stay i am a fighter , he said repeatedly i 've been behind before this race is by no means over as the last weeks close , people begin to focus who can be elected \? who can beat george bush \? trying to demonstrate that he means what he says , and to finance a forthcoming advertising push , the senator borrowed 850 , 000 to lend his campaign on thursday , and began seeking another loan , using his house on beacon hill in boston as collateral his strategists hope that he can do well enough in iowa to raise his chances here a kind of slingshot effect , as mary beth cahill , who took over a month ago as his campaign manager , likes to call it there is ample political precedent in 1984 , for example , gary hart unexpectedly finished ahead of john glenn in iowa , at a time when he trailed walter f mondale in the new hampshire polls mr hart got a bounce of at least five or six percentage points and went on to win in new hampshire mr kerry s aides envision his finishing no worse than second in iowa , ahead of either representative richard a gephardt of missouri or dr dean , besting dr dean here and going on to win the nomination of course , mr mondale , not mr hart , won the nomination in 1984 , as did another vice president , al gore , in 2000 , though his opponent , bill bradley , trimmed a 29point margin in iowa to 5 points in new hampshire and momentum is a fickle , sometime thing hoping to improve his chances in iowa and thus new hampshire , his aides say mr kerry plans to spend most of the time up to caucus day in iowa , devoting 11 to 15 days to the state , with no more than 7 here and almost no time at all in the states that vote on feb 3 starting on monday , mr kerry will spend 24 consecutive hours on his bus , the real deal express , crisscrossing iowa to symbolize his commitment to that state , where voters have traditionally rewarded close attention things seem to be moving in our direction there , said a top strategist , noting that mr kerry , though in third place in the latest iowa poll , is 12 points behind mr gephardt there and just 5 behind dr dean the question is , can we get them moving in our direction in new hampshire as well \? two days on the road with mr kerry left unanswered the question of why his campaign here has not taken off he and others blame what they see as negative coverage by the boston globe , as well as early organizational troubles but the candidate himself clearly bears some of the responsibility at hopkinton high school , he found it hard to connect with his youthful audience , the kind of group dr dean charms tall , lean , with a deeply lined face and expressive eyebrows , mr kerry looks the part of a nominee , but often talks too long , running on for more than 23 minutes in some deliveries of his standard speech , and he finds it hard to generate electricity in a room it s not that he s wooden , said former gov jeanne shaheen of new hampshire , an important supporter who visited main street shops with him in nashua he s no al gore he connects well one on one , and he has humor i do n't know though he told a reporter that he thought character , not issues , wins nominations and elections , mr kerry clearly thinks he has several issues that can help him catch up with dr dean and other democratic rivals at the chili feed in peterborough and another in keene on thursday , he was roundly applauded when he took issue with dr dean s assertion that the capture of saddam hussein did not make america safer every person in the room , he said , would agree that the world is safer because of the capture at the last stop of the day in keene , where he arrived almost an hour late because of foggy roads , he demanded of dr dean , how can you possibly say that america is not safer \? if dr dean is nominated , he asked , what quote do you think you 're going to see in the ads the republicans will put on next summer \? mr kerry clearly considers dr dean s comment a major gaffe that cast him as a na ve and inexperienced player in the world of foreign policy , not unlike george romney s remark in the 1968 campaign that he had been brainwashed into supporting the vietnam war dr dean s pledge to entirely roll back the bush administration s tax cut , mr kerry said , showed a similar na vet about domestic policy that would be too hard on the middle class , mr kerry argued , would reinstate an unfair marriage penalty and would do away with the 10 percent bracket he advocated a selective rollback instead but discussions of tax policy and medicare reform , by their nature dry and arcane , lit no bonfires here photo john kerry and howard dean after a debate this month in new hampshire , where mr kerry is trailing dr dean , several polls show \( photo by reuters \)
for the most part , saturday night s championship game for the independent women s football league , held at st john s dasilva stadium , went unnoticed a few hundred spectators , mostly the players' friends and family members , watched the new york sharks fall to the sacramento sirens , 4130 in a national sporting landscape that has created more professional options for women in the past decade , women s football has yet to find a niche but in the eyes of some , that may be changing everybody always asks if we are going to get bigger and be like the wnba , or if the nfl is going to take an interest in us and such , said andra douglas , the owner of the sharks and the team s backup quarterback we 're not there yet right now we are doing this because we enjoy it these women do not play for money none are paid and most have day jobs they are lawyers and teachers and coaches and firefighters but for three hours a week on the field , and for several additional hours at practice , they are athletes training starts in january and the season runs into july the 21team league was founded in 2000 jim coffinberry , whose companion hilary mclaughlin is a halfback for the sirens , travels to all her games , including this week s final coffinberry sat nervously cheering on the sirens , critiquing mclaughlin s play and the referees' calls this is a game that traditionally , growing up , every boy can play , and the girls really do n't have anyone to look up to , coffinberry said but she s tough and she s gifted at football and she loves it you ca n't help but get excited for her ken schroy , a safety with the jets from 1977 to 1984 , participated in the coin toss and stood on the sharks' sideline for most of the game val halesworth , the quarterback for the sharks , was a baby sitter for schroy s children when she was younger , and the two have remained close i think this is great it s an evolving game and someday it could be huge , schroy said carol grubb , a linebacker for the philadelphia liberty belles who came to the game because she had heard great things about the sirens , said that of the 30 players on her team , only 10 had played organized football before joining the iwfl she and her teammates would go on recruiting trips to softball games and flagfootball competitions looking for women who might want to join the team the game itself resembled high school football , in reverse the players were women , and 12 of the 13 volunteer cheerleaders were men but in the end , it was a football game , and a pretty entertaining one the sharks \( 71 \) went into the half with a 1615 lead , but it quickly evaporate in the third quarter the sirens \( 90 \) scored three unanswered touchdowns and led , 3516 , after a 2yard quarterback keeper by leilani limary , who was named the game s most valuable player she ran for two touchdowns and passed for another the sharks scored a couple of late touchdowns , but the outcome was not in doubt this has just been a surreal experience all the way around , said limary , who runs a doctor s office in sacramento and will start medical school at the university of californiadavis in the fall we started talking about this in january and spent a lot of sleepless nights watching film and practicing i'm so proud of my teammates this is a dream come true

technology euphoria was in the air and stock prices were stratospheric the shares of some software and computer services companies jumped a hundredfold in a few years never before has the stock market shown quite so much enthusiasm about an industry , a writer for fortune magazine observed the year was 1968 history may provide no sure guide to the future , but it does offer context and insight for the present and , given the proper twist , history glimmers with a certain knowing humor in his incisive , panoramic book , from airline reservations to sonic the hedgehog a history of the software industry \( mit press , 2995 \) , martin campbellkelly delivers all three context , insight , even occasional humor his treatment of the similarity in the computer mania of the late 1960 s and the internet bubble of the late 1990 s is one many telling observations mr campbellkelly s book is not for everyone he is an instructor in computer science at the university of warwick in england and is a professional historian his is not a book of insider gossip or of recreated scenes of clashing egos and executive tirades the stuff of so many business books instead , it is the product of his reading and distilling of books , professional journals , magazine and newspaper articles and historical archives over the last four decades the result is a sweeping survey of the software business since the early 1950 s , its evolving structure , economics and marketing the product and company names are so numerous that , at times , they seem to race by in a blur cincom , cullinane , panosophic , cytation , famicom , xenix , comshare , syncsort , superwriter , macnealschwendler and hundreds more the book is a ready reference for any misguided soul who wants to create a computer trivia game yet , along the way , mr campbellkelly pauses for longer passages on subjects ranging from the role of the government s sage air defenseandsurveillance system to the decision by ibm in 1969 to unbundle hardware and software sales the unbundling was a turning point , the author says , because it ensured a sizable software industry separate from hardware mr campbellkelly gives the united states government credit for creating a market for programmers in the 1950 s and early 1960 s with sage , a name derived from semiautomatic ground environment about 150 million was spent on its software , and thousands of programmers were trained to work on the project a veritable university for programmers its alumni went off to populate corporate data centers and to start companies elsewhere sage also tackled a host of technical problems in realtime transaction processing that eased the way for ibm s development of the sabre online reservations system , called the kid s sage , for american airlines time and again , the book shows that what seems new in the software industry in fact echoes the past the engineers who used software formed user groups starting in the 1950 s with share , whose members came from companies that used ibm 704 computers the group s name , though capitalized , was not an acronym it was what the group did it shared programs and expertise to help drive down programming costs this was when software was treated as a marketing cost of hardware instead of as a standalone product but , as the author writes , one of the abiding legacies of the user groups was the perception of software as a free good in their attitude and behavior , the user groups were very similar to those engaged in today s opensource software projects like gnu linux , an operating system that is distributed free and is steadily improved and debugged by a network of programmers in the late 1960 s and early 70 s , there was great excitement about and investment in the notion of computing as a utilitylike service that could be delivered to offices and homes to solve all manner of problems the idea flopped because it proved to be too complex a challenge to write the software needed to distribute computing as a service from a central timeshared machine to many users besides , microcomputers , later called personal computers , were about to arrive , putting affordable computing on desktops thanks to the miracle of the microprocessor today , the utility concept is making a comeback this time , the industry is betting that 30 years of advances in software , hardware and networking can deliver utility computing ibm is promoting on demand computing , and hewlettpackard , sun microsystems and others have similar offerings companies like salesforcecom are offering software as a service in an emerging market for socalled application service providers , or asp s because the concept was never fully tested in the 1970 s , mr campbellkelly writes , history has few lessons to offer the asp industry well , the asp startups certainly hope so as software became a product in its own right , marketing became more important in the fledgling personal computer industry , some of the tactics were particularly inventive in 1980 , george tate , a former electronics industry salesman , began marketing a database program he named dbase ii there was no i , but ii suggested a second , improved product this ploy was not uncommon but in 1983 , mr tate took the more imaginative leap , renaming his company ashtontate there was no ashton , the author writes , but it was considered a euphonious and highsounding name mr campbellkelly argues convincingly that microsoft s stature in the software industry as a whole tends to be overstated after all , he notes , microsoft dominates only about 10 percent of the industry , while it has no such sway over large portions of the software business like corporate software , software contractors and consultants if this book serves no other purpose , he writes , i hope it will serve as a corrective to the common misconception that microsoft is the center of the software universe around which all else revolves mr campbellkelly is dismissive of the federal antitrust suit filed in 1998 exactly why the action was brought remains a mystery , he writes he is fastidious with footnotes , but there are none near that sentence it s his opinion , period he may not understand the microsoft antitrust suit , but he lucidly analyzes microsoft s mastery of using software and business acumen to build a lucrative technology platform in microsoft s case , of course , the technology platform is the windows operating system the company encouraged and helped software developers write programs that run on the microsoft platform , increasing the value of windows and prompting even more applications to be written on top of windows economists call this commercial snowball network effects it is nothing new , really ibm , as mr campbellkelly explains , did the same thing with its operating system for the ibm 360 mainframe and followon products and sony , in video game consoles , deftly used software to build its technology platform and a thriving ecosystem of game developers supporting its playstation platform once sony mastered the economics of software , sega s sonic the hedgehog never had a

pushkin a biography by t j binyon illustrated 727 pp new york alfred a knopf 35 in the winter of 1837 , after the bullet , the opium , the sacraments , the convulsions and the coffin lined with crimson velvet , the russian orthodox metropolitan of st petersburg refused to conduct a funeral service for aleksandr pushkin in st isaac s cathedral , on the grounds that a death in a duel was tantamount to suicide it will seem to many readers of t j binyon s magnificent biography that the metropolitan was right that the poet might just as well have shot himself always quick to take offense delusionally jealous of his dim but beautiful young wife forever in debt from gambling , exorbitant household expenses and the care and feeding of a wastrel brother and loathsome inlaws unable in the social whirl to find time to finish any of his longer writing projects harassed and persecuted by the czar s own censors whenever he did jot down something about , say , pugachev , peter the great or boris godunov subject to mood swings that today , says binyon , would cause him to be classed as a manicdepressive russia s first pop icon literary superstar , who by the vivacity of his own example had turned art into a substitute for politics , was a nervous frazzle and a burning fuse he was also , of course , short a small , swarthy , apelike poet , 5foot6 , with pale blue eyes , unsightly side whiskers and clawlike fingernails , sometimes to be seen wearing a black frock coat and silk top hat like bolivar s , sometimes with a fez and turkish pantaloons and a surprising snob , boasting that his father s boyar side of the family went back 600 years \( on his mother s side , notoriously , there was that blackamoor greatgrandfather from cameroon , purchased in constantinople s slave market as a gift for peter the great , who grew up to marry a swede and become a general \) none of which interfered with aleksandr s inordinate fondness for smoked sturgeon , rossini operas and women with small feet in such cases , he confided to a friend , i usually write elegies , as another has wet dreams nor , as we 'd expect from someone given to hissing at actors onstage and accusing strangers of cheating at cards , was his last duel his first during his exile from the capital , he kept himself in fighting trim by shooting off a hundred rounds a day there seem to have been three duels in the early 1820 s , mentioned in nabokov s eccentric translation of eugene onegin , not counting challenges not accepted , or finessed by tactful intermediaries binyon alludes to several more that stopped short of the firing line in the spring of 1836 alone , a period of sullen rage during which pushkin became incapable of rational thought or action , and lashed out indiscriminately at anyone or anything , caring little on the contrary rather hoping that he might , like samson at gaza , bring the whole edifice of his life crashing about him which is not to say that georges d'anth s , the alsatian reprobate who could n't stay away from natalya pushkin , did n't deserve rough justice , maybe even a horsewhip \( binyon characterizes his distasteful behavior toward natalya who may have flirted but was never unfaithful as clear evidence of a classic case of the stalker' syndrome \) yet everyone agrees that after making sure he picked a second who would n't talk him out of the duel , the poet was more relieved than anxious from a state bordering on lunacy , he became almost cheerful free , reported zizi vrevskaya , from those mental sufferings which had so terribly tortured him on his way to his wounding he even stopped for a lemonade , at a cafe where , today , a madame tussaud wax replica with his risible side whiskers keeps a pale blue eye on nevsky prospekt if you are reminded of eugene s duel with lensky in onegin , so is binyon lensky , a reader of goethe rather than rousseau and therefore a much nicer person than eugene , falls victim in the verse epic to fell barrels hand tooled in paris by lepage so , too , did pushkin insist on lepage pistols for his appointment with d'anth s , pawning some table silver to pay for them and as if to salt this open sore , the allknowing and alltelling binyon informs us that the pistol d'anth s used to kill pushkin was borrowed from the french ambassador s son , who would use it four years later to kill mikhail lermontov it is apparently not sufficient that the autocratic russian state tries so hard to crush its poets by sitting on them , as nicholas i sat on pushkin and stalin on pasternak for touring foreigners , they were target practice it s difficult to breathe , i'm suffocating were pushkin s last words and we know exactly how he felt because binyon , a lecturer in russian literature at oxford , a senior research fellow at wadham college and the author of a history of detective fiction as well as mystery novels of his own , invites us in , sits us down and opens the closets and the veins he has practically inhaled all of 19thcentury russian culture , from school curricula to court etiquette to book publishing to adultery thus , though he disavows literary analysis , he is not above pointing at ossian and ariosto , at byron , milton , rob roy and tristram shandy , as well as chateaubriand \( atala \) , stendhal \( the red and the black \) and voltaire \( whose refusal to fight a duel over joan of arc was the subject of one of pushkin s last sketches \) he has read every diary , letter , memoir , report card and dossier , attended every late supper , masked ball and febrile seduction , counted every dead soul serf whom pushkin inherited as property and every free peasant he mortgaged to pay his brother s debts , and exhumed every body of every decembrist the poet might have met at school before they plotted their abortive coup without him \( an unfinished 10th chapter of onegin , binyon tells us , would have explained eugene s involvement with the decembrists pushkin burned it \)
chief executives of large companies , perhaps the most accurate economic forecasters recently , expect the economy to remain weak over the next six months but do not foresee a new recession , according to a survey released yesterday only about one company out of 10 plans to increase employment in the united states in that period , according to the poll of 120 chief executives by the business roundtable , an association of leaders of large companies the rest , some 90 percent of companies , are divided almost evenly between those that plan job cuts and those that expect to hold employment at current levels we 've got a pretty weak economy , said john t dillon , the chairman of the association and chief executive of international paper we all feel great about the war but we 've got to have economic security as well as security for our homeland since the economy began weakening in 2000 , chief executives have consistently made more pessimistic , and more accurate , predictions than federal reserve officials or wall street economists the executives polled estimated that the economy would grow 22 percent this year wall street economists and other private sector forecasters predict growth of 24 percent for 2003 , down from their forecast of 35 percent a year earlier , according to blue chip economic indicators , a newsletter that surveys them each month with oil prices having fallen significantly in recent weeks and american forces having taken control of baghdad , few remain concerned about a new recession only 2 percent of executives said the economy would not grow at all this year , and none forecast a contraction , according to the business roundtable the most recent recession began in march 2001 , and the economy began growing again late in 2001 the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance fell last week to 405 , 000 from 443 , 000 the previous week , the labor department reported yesterday the fourweek moving average of new claims , which many economists consider a more reliable indicator than the weektoweek data , fell to its lowest level in more than a month ian shepherdson , chief domestic economist at high frequency economics in valhalla , ny , called the drop an encouraging sign , noting that jobless claims were often the labor market s signal to change directions but , he added , it is impossible to know at this point if this week s decline is anything more than noise the poll of chief executives was conducted last week , before the iraqi government began collapsing , and about half of the executives called consumer uncertainty about the war the greatest economic challenge facing corporate america still , mr dillon said he did not think that the evidence of military success in iraq would be a turning point for the economy i think there will be a shortterm improvement as inventories are rebuilt , he said inventories have been held at very , very low levels because of all of the uncertainty in the world but frankly , the fundamentals we 're talking about here are largely not war related businesses are using less than 80 percent of their capacity , mr dillon said , and they will not begin investing in new equipment or hiring more workers until demand increases many companies are still suffering through the overhang of the 1990 s boom in the survey , 27 percent of executives said they planned to cut their capital spending over the next six months and 55 percent said they would make no change eighteen percent expected to increase it a sharp decline in capital spending business investment in new factories , equipment and technology has hampered the economy since 2000 slightly more than half of executives forecast an increase in their own sales in the next six months , but as a group the executives seemed less hopeful than when they were polled in december then , 71 percent said they thought that sales would increase over the next year speaking to reporters , mr dillon called on congress to pass president bush s taxcut proposal , saying it would lift consumer demand and stock prices many senators , including some republicans , are worried that the proposal is too costly , and while economists are divided on the longterm benefits of the plan , few consider it likely to help the economy significantly this year about 50 members of the business roundtable , all chief executives , met with mr bush at the white house yesterday afternoon to discuss strategies for helping the economy chart jobless claims weekly number of people who have filed for unemployment benefits for the first time graph shows the 4week moving average \( source bloomberg financial markets \) chart balance of trade the deficit is the excess of imports over exports amounts are rounded , in billions of dollars , seasonally adjusted february 2003 balance 4032 imports 12277 exports 8245 \( source commerce department \)
to the sports editor as a lifelong yankee fan , i feel compelled to comment on the fiasco that george steinbrenner has created by criticizing derek jeter lest anyone forget , the recent yankee resurgence can be tied directly to the suspension of steinbrenner for nefarious activities by fay vincent , then the commissioner of baseball in steinbrenner s absence , gene michael and other knowledgeable baseball experts in the organization carefully rebuilt the team , and the end result was four world series titles these yankee teams have won in spite of steinbrenner and his shenanigans derek jeter has been at the center of the winning until i saw him play , i never really understood what ted williams and others meant when they talked about phil rizzuto and the relative lack of correlation between his numbers and his uncanny ability to help his team win now i do jeter s skills are already famous , but more than that , he is a born leader , with a work ethic second to none he is also possessed of the kind of quiet , unassuming and respectful demeanor that is so sadly lacking in athletes of our time for whatever warped motivational reason , steinbrenner has tried to tarnish the reputation of a man who has more dignity and class in his little finger than the principal owner has in his entire body charles a gruen hackensack , nj
bayonne joseph v doria jr , the senior member of the state assembly and keeper of its institutional memory , shifted in his chair when a visitor mentioned the word tragedy while certainly overstated , it was the word mr doria s friends and allies chose when describing what happened to him this summer i do n't know if it was a tragedy , he said what is meant to be is meant to be push him a little more , however , and mr doria becomes a bit less philosophical i believe , he added , that i got whipsawed and that , his friends argue , was not meant to be for the first time in a generation , the name of joseph v doria will not appear on the ballot in tuesday s state legislative elections a onetime speaker and leader of the assembly democrats during their decade in the minority , mr doria , 57 , lost his reelection bid in a democratic primary in june neither ideology nor issues figured much in his demise he was collateral damage in the bitter and bloody civil war between mayor glenn cunningham of jersey city and representative robert menendez for a control of that celebrated and often notorious institution , the hudson county democratic organization mr doria was part of a threemember slate of regular democrats that lost to mr cunningham s insurgent team in the party primary mr doria lost by about 500 votes first elected to the assembly in 1979 , he will leave office in january , although his career is far from finished he remains the mayor of bayonne , a vibrant city of 62 , 000 that bears few of the scars that have disfigured so much of urban new jersey it was in trenton , however , that joseph doria became a player in new jersey politics while his name never became particularly wellknown outside of his district , mr doria needed no introductions when he walked the state house halls a husky man with a beard and a doctorate from columbia teachers college \( in educational leadership \) , mr doria gained a reputation for his affability as well as his command of issues donald scarinci , a hudson county attorney who was mr doria s counsel in the speaker s office , described his former boss as the sam rayburn of new jersey , referring to the legendary texan who served as house speaker for all but four years from 1940 to 1961 that s the kind of stature he had , mr scarinci added he was a legislator s legislator few politicians get to lead a caucus as long as mr doria led the assembly democrats a dozen years fewer manage to gain the respect and even affection of the opposition but mr doria did nobody ever asked joe doria for an audience and was denied , said one longtime lobbyist , alan marcus it did n't matter whether you were a contributor , or a friend , or not joe wanted to hear all points of view he was the most policyoriented legislator i 've ever seen alan steinberg , a former whitman administration official who was an adviser to mr doria s republican successor as speaker , garabed haytaian , agreed in the new jersey assembly , joe was a person of unquestioned decency and boundless compassion , mr steinberg said for republicans , he was a political adversary without being a personal enemy with his impressive r sum \( a bachelor s degree in history from st peter s college and a master s in american studies from boston college to go along with his doctorate from columbia \) and his passion for history , mr doria gained a reputation as the house intellectual , if you will , of the hudson county democratic organization and while academicians in politics are not always known for the common touch , as gov woodrow wilson demonstrated during his years in trenton , joseph v doria the powerful legislator never stopped being joe doria from bayonne , a man with a cluttered desk , a straightforward manner and an aversion for slick selfpromotion mr doria s legislative accomplishments number in the dozens , from his sponsorship of new jersey s ban on assault weapons to any number of bills related to his main policy interest education in the assembly , he was the goto person on education bills , from prek to postsecondary , said john b wilson , president of the association of independent colleges and universities in new jersey mr marcus , the lobbyist , said he dealt with mr doria on healthcare legislation in the early 1990 s , and the assembly leader was able to bring politicians , lobbyists and insurance executives together to hammer out a compromise that quality , political insiders say , marked mr doria as a throwback to an earlier era in trenton , when access was not so blatantly tied to campaign finance , and when even the inevitable roughandtumble of state politics did not seem so , well , rough joe doria is an example of days gone by when you were expected to be civil and courteous to those with whom you disagreed , said former gov james j florio he is a commendable model of commitment to substance and to civility in public life the absence of civility precludes the ability of people to come together paradoxically , mr florio said , mr doria was brought down last june by politics that do not lend themselves to compromise and conciliation welcome to hudson county , where knuckles are bare , tempers short and memories long
valhalla when the westchester medical center held a voluntary smallpox vaccination clinic here last month , administrators had no idea how many people would attend the event held on march 20 was the first phase of president bush s nationwide program to immunize the health care workers who would respond first in emergencies in the event of a terrorist attack volunteers were expected not only from westchester , but also from rockland , putnam , dutchess , orange and ulster counties but at the end of the day , only 47 people had been inoculated it s not a huge number when you consider that if all the health care workers who were eligible in the initial round chose to get vaccinated it could be 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 people , said dr joshua lipsman , the county health commissioner the medical center was one of eight hospitals statewide to hold the vaccination clinics roughly 500 people have now been vaccinated across the state , said dr lipsman a critic of the program , dr lipsmane declined to be vaccinated , though county executive andrew j spano rolled up his sleeve for the shot at the clinic donna mckenna , a nurse practitioner for infectious diseases at the medical center , was responsible for the vaccination of members of the edical center staff she said 10 staff members were inoculated , including one administrator , one ambulance worker and eight doctors and nurses she also oversaw vaccinations for 12 members of the disaster medical assistance team , a group of doctors , nurses and other medical volunteers sent by the federal government to respond to national disasters one week after the clinic , the new york state health department suspended the vaccination program after the death of a maryland woman who suffered a heart attack after being inoculated the program was resumed april 4 , with new federal guidelines recommending that people with heart disease should not vaccinated the vaccination is composed of a live vaccinia virus it is administered by a twin needle that punctures the skin in the arm until the wound heals completely , the virus can spread none of those vaccinated at the medical center have suffered serious side effects , ms mckenna said several volunteers have lost their scabs from the inoculation others wear a special dressing and have their bandages checked before reporting to work dr lipsman said the next phase of the program would be to find out how many remaining eligible health care workers are interested in being vaccinated when he knows that number , then he will know how many more people will need to be trained to administer the vaccination , and where and when the next clinic will be held there are supposed to be half a million people vaccinated nationally and so far it s only 25 , 000 , dr lipsman said we 've got a long way to go if we 're going to hit the target ultimately , all the people who want to volunteer to be vaccinated will be vaccinated , but phase two is intended to vaccinate 20 times the amount of people in phase one , and there needs to be a critical core mass of people who are able to give the vaccination my hunch is that given the continued absence of an imperative for this action , this campaign will sort of peter out

cathay pacific has one of the best reputations for service and reliability in the airline industry nestl is one of the most familiar household brands beer from heineken is imbibed across the globe all these companies trade in the united states , but none of them are among the 500 foreign stocks listed as american depository receipts on the new york and american stock exchanges and the nasdaq instead , cathay pacific , nestl and heineken have chosen to trade their adr s on the overthe counter market so have companies like rolls royce , the venerable british engine maker soci t g n rale , the french bank and yukos , the russian oil giant most of the 1 , 500 foreign companies with overthecounter adr s are relatively obscure , and some were delisted from nasdaq or the new york stock exchange because their prices fell below minimums or failed to meet other listing requirements some foreign companies , however , prefer the overthecounter approach american depository receipts are certificates issued by an american bank and traded in the united states as dollardenominated versions of foreign shares each adr represents a set number of shares of a foreign security held by the bank some adr s are sold to investors in public offerings in the united states those also trade in lock step with their homemarket shares investors who look into this market may find intriguing opportunities , said stephen saker , senior investment adviser at international assets advisory llc , a brokerdealer in orlando , fla over the past several difficult years , otctraded adr s , because they are less liquid than listed shares , were hit hard as us investors retreated to more familiar homegrown equities , bonds and money markets , mr saker said but as interest in stocks revives , a modest boost in investment flows into these shares may permit them to rally potentially more than the rest of the market for most american investors , buying and selling adr s is much easier than trading foreign shares because there is no need to exchange currencies or to deal with the logistical and legal hurdles and higher costs often involved in trading abroad foreign companies have a major inducement for seeking a listing on an exchange the potential for higher volume and better liquidity but to gain a listing in the united states , companies must meet relatively stringent disclosure and reporting standards these include issuing financial statements quarterly , not just twice a year the norm in europe and much of the rest of the world and restating financial statements in accordance with american accounting rules many companies prefer to sidestep some of these requirements differences in accounting standards , for example , can cause some significant changes in reported earnings in 1993 , when daimlerbenz prepared to meet the requirements for a full listing on the nyse , it had to restate its financial statements according to generally accepted accounting principles , or gaap filtered through gaap , the profit of 615 million marks it reported in germany collapsed into a loss of 184 billion marks the main cause was a restatement of retained earnings , which knocked off more than 42 billion marks from profits companies may also be affected by the sarbanesoxley act , which requires them to provide much more detailed information about their offbalancesheet obligations and to adhere to more stringent governance standards these include chief executives' certification of financial statements since sarbanesoxley , some firms perceive the benefits of listing to be outweighed by the increased risk brought about by the new law , especially given our nation s inherently litigious character , said edward cofrancesco , chief operating officer of intl trading , a nasdaq brokerdealer based in altamonte springs , fla overthecounter trading gives foreign companies a way around these new rules , said julio lugo , vice president of j p morgan chase s division of adr liquidity solutions otctraded adr s are exempt from sarbanesoxley , he said the listed ones at this point are not after the bill s adoption , porsche , the german car maker , said that it would postpone its plans for a listing on the nyse so did the daiwa securities group of japan last october , lvmh mo t hennessy louis vuitton , the french luxurygoods maker , moved from the nasdaq to over the counter because , as the company explained , it was disappointed by its trading volumes trading over the counter is a cheap way for a foreign company to get a foot into american markets it can give a foreign company the ability to compensate local employees with stock and options and overthecounter adr s can provide the currency for future stockbased acquisitions for american investors , buying the shares of the largest , most heavily traded overthecounter adr s can be cheaper than buying shares of the same companies overseas , mr saker said it avoids stamp duty taxes , which still exist in major markets , surcharges most brokers add on for such transactions , custodial expenses paid to the foreign bank actually holding the shares , and the cost of currency exchange necessary to execute the purchase , he said all this , times two , when such shares are subsequently sold over all , these charges could add up to several hundred dollars a

since 1995 , when governor pataki committed the state to developing biotechnology on long island , the state has poured 95 million into turning the route 110 area into a hot spot for the life sciences industry one beneficiary has been a drug development company called osi pharmaceuticals , the anchor tenant of an incubator , a 53 , 000squarefoot building built by the state in 2000 on the campus of farmingdale state university osi , which has a cancer drug now in the final stage of clinical testing , is often cited as a brimmingwithpotential biotech company that represents the region s future the starting date of that future , however , is uncertain like most biotech companies , osi fared poorly last year the company posted a net loss of 2185 million , more than 10 times its revenues people expect biotech companies to lose money , said colin goddard , the company s chief executive osi s troubles were not unusual for the industry the amex biotechnology index , a group of 17 stocks , dropped 40 percent in 2002 , its second consecutive year of decline local biotech companies got not a single dollar in venturecapital investments in 2002 , down from 3 million in 2001 , according to ernst young most analysts are not expecting this year will be much better despite a 115 billion budget deficit , the pataki administration continues to spend to develop a biotech sector on long island a few weeks ago , administrators at farmingdale state received notice from albany that work would soon begin on a second 20 million incubator building in the fledgling biotechnology park a third and smaller incubator , as yet unbudgeted , is planned for the farmingdale campus when built , it will complete what is envisioned as a huge petri dish on the suffolknassau border , nurturing as many as 35 biotech startups scientists have a herding instinct , and you see biotech companies clustering together , said bruce stillman , the director of cold spring harbor laboratory , which maintains close ties with the farmingdale incubator until you have a few of them in the cluster , you do n't see any instead of coming to long island , they go to new jersey but could the state have put all its eggs in the wrong basket \? local business leaders and government officials say that regardless of current circumstances , the industry will one day generate thousands of new , highpaying jobs thomas r suozzi , nassau s county executive , has cited biotech as central to the county s future , and on tuesday he will deliver his state of the county address from cold spring harbor lab it can take 10 years or more , and more than 100 million , to get a new drug approved and on the market , said james a hayward , the chief executive of the collaborative group , a biotech concern in stony brook , and former chairman of the governor s task force on long island incubators but when the drug hits the market , the payoffs can be truly enormous dr stillman said that the state s investment in infrastructure in farmingdale had kept companies like osi on long island and had also prompted other companies , including forest labs of manhattan and icon laboratories of farmingdale , to lease over 100 , 000 square feet of vacant retail space within walking distance of the incubator and convert it to laboratory use in general , incubators provide lowercost laboratory and office space , specialized support services like water filtration and disposal of contaminated sewage , easy access to the resources of the surrounding campus , even a social calendar industry leaders say incubators also contribute to the impression that a region supports biotech development when you see the incubators go up , and you hear the governor talk about biotechnology when he gives a speech on television , you feel the region is serious about attracting biotech companies , said ron cohen , president of the new york biotechnology association and a biotech entrepreneur in hawthorne , ny incubators are especially prized in biotechnology because many startups struggle along for years without products to sell , burning investor dollars we are in desperate need of that second incubator , said greg blyskal , the manager of the broad hollow biosciences park , which houses the incubator on the farmingdale state campus we have been approached by half a dozen biotech companies looking for space if we do n't have space for them on long island , we run the risk that they 'll move somewhere else osi pays about 23 a square foot for space in the incubator and provides some maintenance services immunorx and helicon therapeutics , its much smaller cotenants , pay about 17 a square foot mr blyskal estimated that such space would cost 40 to 50 a square foot on the commercial market , and it is in short supply while tenants clearly benefit from subsidized space and convenient services , the host university benefits as well , advocates say when an incubator opens , it attracts entrepreneurial tenants and integrates them into campus life the tenants can enrich the overall academic environment by teaching courses , hiring faculty members for their special projects or longterm consulting arrangements and employing students as entrylevel lab technicians
trenton , june 10 state health officials said today that they were investigating a suspected case of monkeypox in an 11yearold boy who moved last week to north jersey from indiana the suspected case is the first outside the midwest , where 49 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported in indiana , illinois and wisconsin television news reports of that outbreak apparently prompted the child , whom the authorities did not identify , to diagnose his own case , officials said he told his mother he thought his symptoms resembled those of monkeypox she , in turn , told their doctor , who notified the state in late may , while still living in indiana , the boy came into contact there with several prairie dogs , the animal believed to transmit the disease , said clifton r lacy , new jersey s commissioner of health and senior services the boy has shown symptoms associated with the disease , including a high fever and lesions over most of his body , dr lacy said the disease , never detected in the western hemisphere until the recent outbreak , is related to smallpox but is not usually fatal to humans so far , none of the cases reported in this country appear to have been spread from one person to another , state health officials said that they had sent blood and lesion samples from the child to the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta , and that results were expected within days dr lacy said the boy had told officials that he was nipped by two prairie dogs at a friend s house in indiana within days he became sick with a high fever , and was treated with antibiotics while the boy s family was driving to new jersey last week , those symptoms returned lesions appeared on his face and scalp and he began to show appetite loss and lethargy , said dr lacy on sunday , the child was watching a tv news report about monkeypox and alerted his mother that he had similar symptoms , said dr eddy bresnitz , the state epidemiologist his mother quickly called a doctor , who evaluated the child , prescribed antiviral medication and contacted state health officials , dr bresnitz said we believe there has been very minimal contact with this child to other individuals , and it s unlikely that it will be transmitted to other individuals , dr bresnitz said state health officials said they examined the child today he had lesions on his face , scalp , torso and extremities , and was being quarantined in his bedroom , the officials said dr bresnitz said the child s family and doctor had not shown signs of the disease , but would be monitored for the next three weeks none of the prairie dogs the boy came in contact with have shown any symptoms , he said
albany , feb 28 after weeks of opposition by state lawmakers and local officials , gov george e pataki today retreated from his proposal to bill local governments for half the costs of property tax breaks offered to businesses in state economic development zones mr pataki , a republican , made the proposal in his executive budget last month , saying that it would save the state about 4 million annually currently , the state pays 250 million every year to local governments to cover the cost of a variety of tax breaks in 72 specially designated empire zones across the state but the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , a democrat , and the senate majority leader , joseph l bruno , a republican , opposed the change this week , mr bruno proposed expanding the program by adding 18 more zones , mostly in counties that have none many state and local government officials also lobbied against mr pataki s plan , saying it would not only cost local governments money but would also discourage them from participating in one of the state s most successful economic development programs mr pataki withdrew his proposal today as part of a series of mostly technical amendments to his 908 billion budget for the 20032004 fiscal year , which begins april 1 under the state constitution , today was the last day he had to submit his amendments to the legislature kevin c quinn , a spokesman for the state division of the budget , said the governor s decision resulted from his understanding that while the state is facing a severe fiscal crisis , so are the local governments we 're going to continue working with them and the legislature to make sure the empire zone program continues to be implemented in the most costeffective manner possible assemblyman robin schimminger , a democrat and chairman of the assembly s economic development committee , said the governor s proposal had been illconceived it would have gutted the program because local governments would have been reluctant to pick up half the costs , he said in other changes , the governor reduced his revenue projections by about 200 million this year he also factored in another 5 million for extra antiterrorism measures state budget officials said that personal income tax receipts were lower than estimated , and a new computer system that was expected to generate more money through tax audits had not been installed as quickly as planned at the same time , state officials said that they expected to pay about 25 million less to local governments for school aid claims this year , partially offsetting the decrease in revenue the governor also proposed adding a surcharge to the registration fee for boats the governor s amendments also projected an additional 213 million in savings for next year , largely as a result of revised spending and revenue estimates these savings included lower welfare costs , spending reductions at various agencies , and an influx of federal money for medicaid payments
st elizabeth , jamaica tranquility bay is a troubled paradise a tightly guarded compound in a lovely caribbean hamlet , it is the oldest foreign outpost in a booming network of behaviormodification programs for american teenagers tranquility bay has a reputation as the harshest of them all many who have been there describe a life of pain and fear they say they spent 13 hours a day , for weeks or months on end , lying on their stomachs in an isolation room , their arms repeatedly twisted to the breaking point others say the program took them off a road to hell and saved their lives tranquility bay s methods have spawned fierce supporters and critics , none more passionate than the children who have been through the program and the parents who sent them there the children say their parents have no idea what goes on behind the walls the parents say program directors tell them to ignore all accusations of abuse they tell your parents , 'your son may say he s been beaten , but he s lying , ' and that , to me , is the greatest manipulation they pull , said andrew emmett , 16 , of washington , pa enrollment at tranquility bay , founded in 1996 , has grown in the past two years from 140 to 300 youths , most of them 12 to 19 years old it is becoming a battleground for the warring camps of parents and children , a growing number of whom oppose the program that fight may shape the future of tranquility bay s parent organization , the utahbased world wide association of specialty programs and schools , known as wwasps , one of the biggest and most lucrative businesses of its kind in a statement sent to parents last month , ken kay , wwasps' president , wrote the accusations are from students the parents may believe them , but the parents were n't there he continued the teens making the allegations generally have a long history of lying , exaggerating and dishonesty by telephone , he said that he did not welcome new requests for comment , as wwasps had signed a television contract to tell its story in its own words mr kay s son , jay kay , director of tranquility bay , said in an email message declining a facetoface interview that criticisms come from onetenth of one percent of past clients a few people with axes to grind there is little question that wwasps programs including two in mexico and at least eight in the united states , with a total of roughly 2 , 300 children fill a crying need for parents unable to cope with their children many parents who strongly support tranquility bay , which costs more than 33 , 000 a year , see it as a nearmiraculous crucible for changing defiant and delinquent teenagers but others who sent their children say the program damaged their sons and daughters a striking number of youths say that , while the program s goals may be noble , its methods are not in all , 32 children and parents spoke by telephone for this article , 23 others communicated by email , and five facetoface interviews took place in jamaica i got some good out of it , said colin johnstone , 15 , of louisville , ky , who came to tranquility bay at 13 but it is kind of like torture it did me more damage than good he was not drinking or taking drugs , said his mother , lisa todd he was just immature she said colin had two teeth knocked loose by a staff member s fist and spent at least eight months in the isolation room they are very physically severe in jamaica , she said for sure , they did things they could n't do in america but , she added , i do think the program helps a lot of families that are desperate and do n't know where to turn oliver bucolo , 18 , of st petersburg , fla , spent more than two years at tranquility bay you ca n't go there and not be changed , he said the program s intentions are good they do help some people but , he added the staff has no training they know how to restrain kids restraint , as practiced at tranquility bay , can be punishing many children , mostly boys , say staff members twist their arms behind their backs until their hands touch their heads , inflicting intense pain without bruises you could hear kids screaming when they were getting restrained , mr bucolo said it was horrible they would do it behind closed doors and say the kids were lying if they complained jill himmelfarb , 18 , of coral springs , fla , spent two years at tranquility bay at christmas , she graduated , as have one in every five enrollees she grew to love the program the place saved my life , she said but soon after leaving , she said , she was taking heroin and trying to kill herself with pills deborah stilwell , 49 , of lake forest park , wash , one of the parents who supports the program , said it was nothing short of miraculous it was the best thing we 've ever done , said mrs stilwell , whose 16yearold daughter is at tranquility bay , on prozac , but off drink and other drugs tranquility bay is not cushy , she said it s harsh but it saved her life kristin smith , 46 , of bradenton , fla , said her son zack , 18 , had benefited greatly from tranquility bay she said the program was not suitable for children with emotional or psychological problems although many youths with such problems are there but for those who had abused drugs and alcohol , like her son did it was the hardest thing we ever did , she said it s tough it s hard and that s what he needed absolute strict rules
washington robert frank does n't give interviews at the recent opening of robert frank london wales at the corcoran gallery of art here , a journalist told mr frank he had come all the way from paris for a chance to speak to him the star of the evening seemed annoyed , the journalist said staying mum , mr frank opened his shirt to reveal a black tshirt emblazoned with the word silenzio and then he courteously introduced the journalist to several people he thought could talk better about his work than he could , including his printer , his wife , philip brookman \( senior curator of photography and media arts at the corcoran \) and a museum guard the pictures at the corcoran approximately 90 photographs of london bankers and welsh miners taken from 1951 to 1953 , some never shown before are at least as quiet as their maker , suffused with the silences of fog and solitude and concentration on work yet they do speak , sometimes sighing or keening , sometimes murmuring softly so that one catches only the drift there s a mournful , sympathetic , elusive story on the museum s walls , quietly elegiac in the midst of life , about people going here and there , about getting through life one day after another , and about time in london mr frank was an outsider on the street , following bankers who still wore top hats and long coats he confronted no one , looked no one in the eye in wales , he made friends with a miner named ben james and photographed him extensively at work and at home so this is a tale of two classes , there is one picture of a london man with a furled umbrella and a bowler , studiously unaware of a workman with a hole in his trousers struggling to lift a heavy load mr frank , who was born in 1924 in switzerland , came out of the tradition of european street photography , which was generally more class conscious than the american equivalent the british , with their demarcated wardrobes , made that easy where mr frank photographed in london , men were always on their way to somewhere , almost always alone on deserted streets , even on occupied sidewalks only children gathered in small groups , and once , in the distance , three mothers with prams advanced toward a bombedout lot where a bedspring , a mirror , a couple of chairs and a table forlornly set for low tea stood amid the trash london , mashed down by war , was now swallowed by fog and smog , a lot of it created by coal in these pictures the city dissolved as men in bespoke suits traversed it , their coats and waiting automobiles far more solid than the dwindling buildings and trees for mr frank , the fog was one more occasion to repudiate the sharp focus and meticulous description of his swiss instructors , of photojournalists generally and of art photographers like albert rengerpatzsch in germany and ansel adams in america for most of its history , photography had dwelled on surfaces because , though incapable of getting inside or beneath appearances , it was superbly equipped to portray the way things looked mr frank , fully in command of technique , began to flout convention in pursuit of something more intangible londoners might emerge momentarily from fog , but coal miners became what they worked with they lived in a land the color of slag , and their faces and clothes absorbed coal dust as if it were oxygen mr frank s gray london palette turned to black in wales , as night seemed to descend on the daytime world glints of light appeared where matches flared or the whites of eyes \( and sometimes lips \) shone out , or bleached faces and hands stood out against a coaldark wall none of this lit up anything , but only burned small openings in the dark mr frank looked directly at ben james and his friends and they returned his gaze some of the faces are heartbreaking , but the imagery is not strictly about sorrow or being downtrodden a lot of it is about simple perseverance , about keeping on as the world relentlessly turns there are two instances of joy one while waiting in line on payday , and one , appropriately , when a miner is looking at photographs mr frank emigrated to the united states in 1947 , worked as a fashion and featuremagazine photographer and traveled during the next several years in latin america and europe in pursuit of the art that would define him in the late 1940 s and the 1950 s he was photographing some for life magazine but hated the life story with its requisite beginning , middle and end in sequencing his pictures along intuitive lines that eddied back and forth between past and present , he found a way to make photography , despite its inherent limitations , into a realm of allusion , indirection and suggestion in 1951 he said , when people look at my pictures i want them to feel the way they do when they want to read a line of a poem twice the london wales photographs were evidently the proving ground for mr frank s landmark book , the americans \( 1958 \) , which , both in style and sequencing , was one of a handful of major innovations in 20thcentury photography london wales , on view here through july 14 , is now a book , too \( scalo \) on its pages as on the walls , mr frank s innovative , elliptical narrative mode makes it plain why he would soon decide it was impossible to make a single , definitive photograph one photographic frame could not encompass time or tell his kind of story it is not surprising that soon after the americans he began making moving pictures if the photographs are not yet quite as daring , rebellious and trenchant as those in the americans , they are already poetry worth reading twice and , in series , create a tangential narrative the book begins with a picture of a girl running away from an open hearse , and both book and show end with the same pictures there is a welsh graveyard , then that same hearse seen , so to speak , dead on , then a boy who poses rakishly , a serious little girl , a woman selling flowers last is a schoolgirl on a train platform , setting out for school or home whichever way she is going , she is beginning a journey the upper classes and the lower , neither of them heroic , go to work and back over and over again , remain anonymous much of the time , and whether diminished by fog or hostage to coal dust , are journeying toward death in the graveyard is a statue of an angel with its finger raised to its lips , the gesture for silenzio mr frank wrote about this cemetery the men working in the coal mines above the earth and below ben james leaving home and coming home the business of bankers in the city of london children free and curious play in the streets and the angel of silence has flown over their heads \( he put no period on a thought that has no end \) photos from the exhibit robert

nacogdoches , tex , feb 3 there was no need to go to school today history was waiting alongside the road at least that is what danny harper , an oil equipment salesman , told his daughter this morning as they set off on a tour of space shuttle debris , picking their way along leafscattered highways from minishrine to minishrine they saw people crying and praying they saw blackened objects splayed on the cement and outlined in chalk like homicide victims they saw dozens of little red flags marking things and blankfaced police officers guarding them and rising piles of flowers , candles and cards it s hot up there , mr harper told his daughter as they stared at a chunk of roasted metal delaney harper , 12 , nodded sad , she said as residents across eastern texas paid their respects to thousands of pieces of scattered wreckage , authorities rushed to pick them up it is an overwhelming task the debris field from the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia is thought to have widened , as far west as dallas much of it is toxic and highly unstable , including explosive bolts that are part of the normal design of the shuttle s cabin that may have fallen to earth intact tonight , searchers said they had found the front of the shuttle s nose cone deep in the ground near hemphill , by the louisiana border the authorities also found fuel cells that may contain highly flammable rocket fuel several schools closed in the area to protect children from the debris , though some parents , like mr harper , extracted their children from classes so they could see history , not read it , he said an encouraging discovery came this morning , after a phonedin tip from a resident search crews in nacogdoches county , a woodsy area 150 miles southeast of dallas , located a sixfootlong section of the cabin , along with circuitry and electronic components that may help investigators determine why the shuttle disintegrated 40 miles above texas , killing all seven astronauts on board today , the nacogdoches county sheriff , thomas kerss , said that at least 15 debris sites within the county have been found to contain human remains officials from the federal bureau of investigation and local ambulance crews are collecting the remains and bringing them to barksdale air force base in bossier city , la , another 120 miles east two coffins arrived sunday and were met by an air force color guard in dress uniform that displayed american and israeli flags the flags were not actually draped over the coffins because there was no way to tell the nationality of the astronauts whose remains were recovered , the authorities said we had an ally on board , an israeli , said lt col larry hahn , a barksdale spokesman , speaking of ilan ramon , the israeli air force colonel who was part of the crew all remains will be shipped to the air force mortuary in dover , del , to be identified authorities said recovering the body parts was the first priority , followed by the search for important electronics components and as much of the cabin as they can find search teams are also focusing on schools at least 20 schools in central and eastern texas are spotted with debris , according to state officials most of the shuttle pieces are blackened hunks of metal and fiber , burned beyond recognition like a crescentshaped piece of metal lying alongside highway 21 between nacogdoches and douglass it looked more like a piece of retread tire than part of a spaceship 'what is it \? ' is the most common question i get , said a texas state trooper , who has been stationed in front of the debris for 12 hours a day most of the onlookers are respectful they take their pictures and move on , the trooper said but down the road , one resident , bambi kerr , said she shooed away several people who have tried to lift a tangle of debris from in front of her house already , someone has cut a piece off it s a desecration , ms kerr said it s antiamerica like the police , ms kerr said she was guarding the patch , from her front porch , 247 the authorities said the field of debris was far wider than they initially believed we find there are more things farther west than we anticipated , maj gen michael c kostelnik , nasa s deputy associate administrator for the space shuttle and international space station programs general kostelnik said because so much additional debris has been found in central texas , nasa had established a second collection site at a military base in fort worth , in addition to the collection site at barksdale air force base at barksdale , home of the nation s largest b52 fleet , the shuttle debris is being stored in a hangar designed for the giant bombers , although officials said they did not anticipate that it would be kept there long or reconstructed here it s largely a cataloging kind of operation at this point , a nasa spokesman said much of the debris recovery and crash investigation continues to be run out of the civic center in lufkin , tex , where more than 300 officials from 30 federal , state and local agencies have gathered at least eight teams of specially trained recovery crews have fanned out across east texas and western louisiana all are accompanied by explosives experts who examine the bits of wreckage before marking it and carting it away some of the cabin bolts are so volatile that if they were tossed across the air and you reached out and caught it in your hand , the pressure of that could actually activate it , said mr kerss , the local sheriff the bolts , none of which have been found , are designed to explode in certain emergencies mr kerss also spoke of a highly volatile sealant designed to blast the doors off the shuttle cabin in an emergency he said some of that may have fallen to the ground , too all of those dangers , though , did not keep residents away any piece of debris remotely close to a main road suddenly became an attraction especially because so much of the debris has already been collected some people drove from hours away with family members and disposable cameras others brought notes one , signed by the williams family , said you lived our dreams thank you many people in nacogdoches , a town of 29 , 000 , spoke of feeling connected to something big i 've never seen so many people in my life , said bonnie kerr , who lives down the road from her daughter s house where the debris landed in the yard nothing happens here in the span of an hour , more than 50 people pulled over alongside highway 21 to pay their respects to that piece of space shuttle , a snarl of yellow fabric and bits of metal to marti norton , an eighthgrade science teacher from alto , a few miles away , it was real i mean , sept 11 seemed so far away , ms norton said but the sky fell right here she reached into her pocket and took out a little american flag , which she poked into the spongy ground next to the debris just then a puff of wind stirred the trees and sent leaves flying up , toward where all the strange pieces came from photos pieces of a puzzle passersby stopped yesterday to study pieces of debris from the space shuttle columbia scattered along route 21 near nacogdoches , tex the twisted hunks of metal were marked with little red flags and police tape some were turned into memorials to the seven astronauts killed when the shuttle broke up on saturday on its way home from a mission to the international space station \( photographs by librado romero the new york times \) embedded in tree a broken ceramic tile near hemphill , tex , several hundred yards from the shuttle s nose \( houston chronicle \) chart map the search widens officials continued to confirm reports of debris from the space shuttle in counties and parishes from eastern texas to southeastern louisiana map of united states highlighting selected states in the midwest where shuttle debris was reported \( sources state officials news reports county police offices \)

nearly 14 years after a jogger was raped in central park , police officials yesterday proposed a new version of the events a stilltroubling but diluted narrative of the infamous crime spree offered to the world in 1989 it was the fourth official , or semiofficial , version of the gang attack on the jogger with each telling , the account becomes more remote from the graphic , videotaped confessions that once fell in nauseating detail upon the city the first version of events , based on the videotaped confessions , was released within three days of the attack and quickly became notorious around the world , but never made it into court the boys' confessions turned out to be wrong about when , where and how the rape took place a year later , during the trials , the lead prosecutor offered a new account , dismissing what were by then plainly wrong details in the confessions but arguing that the statements still proved that the teenagers had gangraped the jogger last month , though , a report from manhattan prosecutors the third version implicitly exonerated the teenagers , saying that the combination of flaws in the confessions and evidence that another man had raped the jogger required that the convictions be overturned the first three versions were used to answer the basic question did the teenagers accused of the crime actually gangrape the woman and nearly beat her to death \? now , in the fourth and latest account , it is the actions of detectives that were primarily at issue in the process of clearing them of any wrongdoing , a special police panel argued that the teenagers were justifiably accused of taking part in the attack the panel , appointed by police commissioner raymond w kelly , presented its findings yesterday but at times seemed to step back from them , saying that it believed the five teenagers were involved but could not say so with the certainty that they were not completely innocent doubts over the case swelled last year after a convicted murder and serial rapist , matias reyes , stepped forward to say that he was the only person involved in the attack on the jogger dna evidence later proved his involvement , and new tests were unable to prove any links between the five young men originally accused one of the private lawyers appointed to the panel , michael armstrong , said yesterday that trying to reach the bottom of the case had been difficult the obvious currents are that you have people who feel strongly that these kids have been wronged , and on the other hand , you have police who have an institutional feeling of protection for their comrades who they think did a good job , mr armstrong said commissioner kelly appointed the panel to explore whether the police procedures had been proper since all the defendants had been convicted on the basis of confessions , the legitimacy of those admissions became a central focus of the inquiry , mr armstrong said the confessions were weak , inaccurate on many points , and two juries struggled for 10 and 11 days before finding the 5 defendants guilty this case was never a slam dunk , he said what mr armstrong and the rest of the panel now say occurred is a faint version of the crimes described in the confessions they suggest that the teenagers waylaid the woman , conducted an assault with sexual overtones that did not amount to the rapes described in those original confessions , and then ran off in the panel s telling , none of the boys was involved in the beatings that nearly killed the woman , even though several of them described the assaults in their confessions according to the panel , the teenagers either left the woman before she was assaulted by mr reyes , the one person connected to the crime through physical evidence , or he joined them near the end of their attack the new account is speculative , officials acknowledge , and amounts to a conglomeration of the old confessions and the new evidence from mr reyes the panel attacked mr reyes s credibility at length but did not subject the original confessions to similar scrutiny the panel s report veers from other factual records on several points , in one place misquotes evidence in the public transcript , and overlooks other evidence that contradicts the panel s theory about how the crimes could have taken place in the time allotted stephen l hammerman , a member of the panel and the deputy police commissioner for legal matters , said the police had recently found a significant new piece of evidence a sheet of notes from an unrecorded interview with kharey wise , one of the original five defendants in the notes , mr wise is quoted saying that a person named rudy molested the jogger and took her walkman female had pouch for walkman on her belt , the note said mr hammerman said this was important proof that the police had not fed a story to the defendants , and that mr wise was speaking from firsthand knowledge we did n't know until now that one of the defendants mentioned a walkman in a pouch , mr hammerman said in fact , prosecutors have long said that the victim was not wearing a pouch , belt or the kind of walkman that would be carried at the waist the victim had been wearing a radio headset that slipped over the head and did not attach to anything else , according to a court filing by the district attorney in addition , no one named rudy was ever identified as taking part in any of the crimes in the park mr hammerman did not return a phone call yesterday to discuss those and other discrepancies mr wise whose lawyer said he had a verbal iq of 62 and had had significant hearing loss since his youth gave multiple interviews during the investigation at times , mr wise described a number of events that never took place , including an attack on a police undercover van and multiple stabbings of the jogger at the news conference , mr hammerman suggested that efforts to make a timeline of the various crimes were futile even so , he speculated that the attack on the jogger could have taken place sometime after 9 45 pm , as the police first theorized at trial , prosecutors placed the attack a halfhour earlier , based on the accounts of several witnesses , including a friend of the jogger and a neighbor , who discussed her movements other testimony presents problems for the new theory two of the defendants were outside the park after 9 45 , breaking light bulbs at a construction site

jc , a 36yearold harry potter fan in kansas city , mo , decided he was too old to go chasing after the fifth book in the popular series when it came out last month instead , he downloaded the book , harry potter and the order of the phoenix from the internet , conveniently avoiding both bookstore crowds and the 2999 cover price i thought it was a little slow until the second half , then it got much better , said jc , who insisted on being identified only by the online nickname because he thinks that what he did was illegal he said he still intended to buy the book to read to his 8yearold son so far , authors and publishers have mainly stood on the sidelines of the internet fileswapping frenzy that has shaken the music industry and aroused fear among makers of motion pictures but the publishing phenomenon around the young wizard appears to be forging a new chapter in the digital copyright wars harry potter and the internet pirates a growing number of potter devotees around the world seem to be embracing the prospect of reading the voluminous new book \( 766 pages in the british edition 870 in the american version \) on the screen and at least some of them are assisting in the cumbersome process of scanning , typing in or translating the book , which its author , j k rowling , has not authorized for publication in any of the existing commercial ebook formats last week , enthusiastic readers put unofficially translated portions of order of the phoenix on the web in german and czech , only to remove them after the publishers that own the rights in their respective countries threatened legal action englishlanguage copies of the book along with fanwritten stories masquerading as the real thing are available on all the major filesharing networks in a variety of file formats the choices include adobe s ubiquitous pdf and text files that can be opened in a wordprocessing program there is also microsoft s fancier lit format which requires use of its free ebook reader software and opens in a narrow window that looks a lot like a book , although with hyperlinks to each chapter and the ability to search for terms like quidditch what is unusual for us as people who deal with piracy of books is that these are people who are not directly making money for having put them on the internet , said ian taylor , international director of the publishers association in britain that is obviously what s been happening with peertopeer music , but it s not something we 've had to deal with before neil blair , business manager at christopher little , ms rowling s literary agency , said the firm was aware of several unauthorized copies of the book on the web and was contacting internet service providers to ask that they be removed ebook rights are reserved to j k rowling , mr blair said so any harry potter novels on the net are unauthorized we also have an obligation to protect the children who might believe they are reading the official work mr blair said he did not expect the illicit ebooks to have an impact on sales of the printed book more than 200 million copies of the first four books have been sold in 55 languages and the fifth book , released at midnight on june 20 and published in britain by bloomsbury and in this country by scholastic , is ranked no 1 on children s books bestseller lists a spokeswoman for scholastic said no one was available to comment a spokeswoman at bloomsbury did not return calls last week some publishing industry officials say the electronic potter piracy may be a perverse sign that the public is finally acquiring a taste for ebooks i used to joke in my speeches that ebooks had not arrived because none of the pirate sites were dedicated to books , said michael hart , founder of project gutenberg , which began putting books whose copyrights had expired online 32 years ago and has made nearly 9 , 000 books freely available it is obvious that the infrastructure to make legal ebooks is now so strongly entrenched that people feel empowered to make their own , even when the publishing industry refuses that is partly because fast scanners that cost hundreds of dollars a few years ago now come free with many new personal computers and free software tools distributed by commercial ebook publishers like microsoft and adobe also make it easy to format and correct errors if the heightened interest in ebooks proves more enduring than the potter phenomenon , it may also reflect that people are increasingly accustomed to thinking of the internet as a vast library project gutenberg s free books are available from hundreds of web sites roughly seven copies a minute are downloaded from the 1 , 600 ebooks available free on the university of virginia s electronic text center , with alice s adventures in wonderland the leading title but ultimately , filesharing software may be the most powerful force in shaping the online distribution of books , as it has for other media technical books and science fiction have long been available on newsgroups like altbinariesebooks , but many internet providers refuse to carry such forums filesharing software like kazaa which allows individual users to make any kind of file available on their computers for others to copy has trained a generation of media consumers to turn to the internet for movies , music and games
a few weeks ago , a knicks official scoffed at the popular notion that the knicks had a string of games against teams they absolutely , positively ought to beat , sub500 teams like chicago , atlanta and miami look at our record , the official said those teams are saying the same thing about us he was right while every upset of a playoffbound team creates the illusion that the knicks can seize the eastern conference s eighth and final playoff spot , losses like the one wednesday night at miami drive home the point that the knicks are closer in class to atlanta and chicago than they are to orlando , philadelphia , new orleans , milwaukee and washington , all of which have more legitimate chances of playing in the postseason the knicks' record , 1925 , is not what creates the hope of making the playoffs , even though they are only three games behind eighthplace milwaukee in the eastern conference hope bubbles up during those games when it all comes together , when allan houston , latrell sprewell and kurt thomas look like bigtime players and the knicks beat a bigtime team the knicks have defeated detroit , indiana , san antonio , sacramento , phoenix , new orleans , houston , philadelphia and the nets but those victories may have had more to do with a superior opponent s taking the knicks lightly than superior play by the knicks in an 82game regular season , the league s lesser clubs often catch the better teams sleepwalking atlanta \( 1729 \) has beaten the defending champion los angeles lakers and eight playoffbound teams , including sacramento , san antonio , utah and houston chicago \( 1727 \) has beaten nine such teams , including boston twice even memphis \( 1331 \) , which is playing host to the knicks tonight , has its share of victories over upperechelon teams , having defeated san antonio , houston , phoenix and three others that appear headed to the playoffs what separates the knicks from the lowerlevel playoff teams is their performance on the road none of these teams are great on the road , but philadelphia \( 1012 \) , orlando \( 1014 \) and milwaukee \( 1112 \) are respectable meanwhile , miami \( 617 \) , atlanta \( 418 \) , chicago \( 220 \) and the knicks \( 513 \) are hapless away from home the knicks' inability to win on the road may be the biggest reason a real playoff run is unlikely they have played the fewest road games in the nba , meaning they will not see madison square garden often over the second half of the season after the break for the allstar game , 21 of their 34 games are on the road , including 10 of the first 14 the knicks' playoff hopes could be blown to bits before february ends , as they begin a sixgame , 10day trip at phoenix on feb 14 the other stops are los angeles \( the lakers \) , portland , seattle , golden state and sacramento over the past month or so , the knicks seemed to have overcome their penchant for blowing lategame leads but only at home on the road , they continue to struggle down the stretch in addition to giving away a 6point lead to miami with 74 seconds remaining wednesday , the knicks lost at orlando after leading by 14 points in the third quarter and at milwaukee after leading by 4 points with 2 minutes 5 seconds left one thing the knicks have over teams like atlanta and chicago is a stretch of solid play to look back on since sprewell returned after missing the first eight games of the season with a broken right hand , the knicks have gone 1818 but the knicks have yet to show they can play well enough to overcome their 17 start so even if they go 500 the rest of the season an accomplishment considering they are 310 on the road even with sprewell it will not be enough to secure a playoff spot the knicks seem oblivious to all these facts they know that there are plenty of games to be played and that , as weak as the east is , they will not soon lose a mathematical chance of advancing to the postseason we have n't even reached the break yet , sprewell said after the miami loss we 're a little bit more than halfway through the season , but we 've got a whole half a season to play and to improve , if they want to make a serious run at the playoffs
last fall , i accidentally discovered that new york yankees fans are not actually happy i derived little glee in unearthing this awful truth , for if yankees fans are not happy , what hope is there for the rest of us \? reared in blighted cow towns like chicago , boston and philadelphia , the average fan drags out his pathetic three score and ten dreaming of a life in a parallel universe where his baseball club wins championships by the fistful , never having to endure a drought of more than a few seasons longingly , he casts his eyes toward the bronx and imagines what it would be like to support a team that has won 26 world series and 38 league pennants in the past 82 years and the answer , judging from the way yankees fans comport themselves is awful \( by the way , at the allstar game break last week , the 5736 yankees were in first place in the american league east , a mere two games ahead of the archrival boston red sox \) like lab rats that will stimulate themselves to death on the pleasure bar , yankee fans are so addicted to the thrill of winning that they derive no joy from the glory of our national pastime incapable of understanding that capturing 30 percent of the total championships available is a statistical anomaly stemming largely , though not entirely , from access to an enormous hoard of cash , they view any defeat as an unmitigated horror , as a blight on mankind , as an unparalleled tragedy that is simply not fair worse , the yankees' absurd success ratio makes it difficult for their fans to enjoy the exploits of the other new york teams , which win at a more statistically plausible pace the football giants , never dynastic , occasionally win the knicks have not won in recent memory the jets never win \( well , once \) and the rangers only win every 54 years , which seems longer than never for obvious reasons , not the least of which is the bafflingly chipper franchise mascot , mr met , the mets , despite winning the 1969 and 1986 world series , have become a hopelessly downscale franchise that does not fit into this , or any other , discussion emotionally handicapped by supporting a team that almost never loses , but then turning around and rooting for teams that almost never win , the average new york sports fan finds himself marooned in a microcosm that nobody else in the country understands or even cares about , because nobody else has ever been in that position new york fans whining about their sporting disappointments to the vast american public poor don mattingly never got to play in a world series \( boohoo \) is like romans whining to the gauls just because they once lost a battle to hannibal no , it s like julia roberts complaining that her teeth are too big no , it s like a billionaire complaining about his eczema sorry about the scales , mr big stuff , but you 've still got all that money i first realized that there was something emotionally impoverished about yankees fans during last year s world series when the san francisco giants squared off against the traditionally pitiful california angels the west coast giants had never won the fall classic \( their last victory was in 1954 in the polo grounds \) , and the angels had never even appeared in a world series the last time the angels got close to the series , an otherwise stellar relief pitcher named donnie moore threw a home run pitch that allowed the red sox to erase a threerun deficit and win the 1986 american league pennant three years later , moore killed himself the '86 angels were managed by the doomed gene mauch , the captain ahab whose 1964 phillies team blew a sixandahalfgame lead with 12 games to play , breaking the city of brotherly love s heart forever mine with it thus , all the mythological configurations were in place for a truly magical world series it was a riproaring setto , filled with thrills and spills , including a truly homeric moment when the giants' skipper , dusty baker , spitting in the eye of the furies , handed pitcher russ ortiz the ball as a memento when he left the mound with a 50 lead in the seventh inning of game 6 alas , the plucky angels came back to win that game , and obliterated the giants in game 7 , putting the accursed souvenir in the same category as the ball that squirted through bosox first sacker bill buckner s legs in 1986 it was the kind of series that pitted titans \( barry bonds , jeff kent \) against mere mortals \( the angels \) , the kind of series you could tell your grandchildren about but you had to watch it to tell them about it sadly , many yankees fans i know decided to sit this one out , not even deigning to turn on the television miffed that their team would not have a chance to win its fifth world series in seven seasons , devastated that an epochal span of 23 months had gone by without a tickertape parade , these malingerers went off and pouted this confirmed what i had long suspected these sorest of losers loved only the yankees , not the sport yet it is the sport itself that unites us as a people the harking back to our sandlot youth , our first hot dog in the cheap seats , the awesome majesty of the lateafternoon shadows as they steal across the facades of our green cathedrals i know all this to be true , because i saw the ken burns series
robert wechsler , who lives in north haven , may be better known in prague than he is in his home state that is entirely because of his oneman mission some might say obsession to bring czech literature in english translation to american readers mr wechsler s vehicle is catbird press , which he founded in 1987 and runs out of his home on a birchlined back street in addition to works by the nobelwinning poet jaroslav seifert \( 19011986 \) , mr wechsler has published major contemporary czech novelists like jachym topol , vladimir paral and alexander kliment though all of these writers are celebrated in their homeland , none have achieved the acclaim in the west that has been accorded to czech writers like milan kundera and vaclav havel , who was a playwright before becoming the president of czechoslovakia in 1989 the czechs have a rich literary heritage , said mr wechsler , 48 , who gave up a law career in boston to pursue his quixotic dream kundera and havel have been mined incredibly , but they are only a sliver of what s out there it s amazing the number and the quality of the writers who are still unknown alexander kliment , for example his 'living parallel' was the first translation i 've ever done i ended up writing another book about literary translation , just because there was nothing out there like it no czech writer holds a more elevated position in prague , or at catbird central in north haven , than karel capek \( 18901938 \) capek \( pronounced chopek \) is arguably mr wechsler s singular obsession , just as he was the main reason for starting catbird press catbird has just published cross roads , its seventh translation of work by capek in czechoslovakia , you could n't not know capek , mr wechsler said he was the major writer in every field no figure even comes close he only had a 20year career but wrote 23 volumes worth of material even though much had been translated in english adequately , his major work had not catbird has redressed that over the years , most notably by publishing what is now regarded as capek s masterpiece a trilogy of novels called horubal , meteor and an ordinary life capek was one of the most influential writers of the last century kurt vonnegut has cited him as a model and is best known in america for having coined the term robot in his play rur \( 1923 \) he is also known for his dystopian science fiction classic war with the newts \( 1937 \) , which catbird has published in a modern translation catbird also published a capek anthology , toward the radical center \( with a foreword by arthur miller \) and a biographical study of capek by the contemporary czech writer ivan klima mr wechsler came by czech literature innocently enough on his honeymoon in 1983 , he traveled to czechoslavakia , hungary and bulgaria i fell in love with czech history , he said the czechs led the first reformation , before luther they also had a long heritage of despising aristocracy and were as close to democratically minded as a people could be in that time and place the capek fixation extends to mr wechsler s constant companion , an affectionate 7yearold tibetan terrier named kc , for karel capek capek did n't like communists or capitalists , which is why his work disappeared after world war ii , mr wechsler said he had nothing to say about the cold war that is , he had everything to say but no one wanted to hear it george orwell is a similar figure he got boiled down to two books in the cold war , but his best writing was in his essays and criticism he s getting a major revival now because his centennial is 2003 mr wechsler is somewhat frustrated that capek has not enjoyed a similar revival i thought his centennial , in 1990 , would turn the tide , he said that date was one of the impetus for starting catbird in 1987 , and the first three titles i published were capek peter kussi , a retired czech professor at columbia university , is an admirer of catbird he edited the capek anthology and translated a novel for catbird by the jewish writer karel polacek , of czecholslovakia i'm very fond of rob and i think he s a wonderful editor , mr kussi said he also has a certain amount of courage to put out books that pay little attention to the commercial instinct mr kussi also admires the fact that mr wechsler learned czech in order to get closer to the literature czech is not an easy language , the polar opposite of english , said mr kussi , who taught a survey of czech literature as well as his own writers of prague course this shows a basic seriousness of intent on rob s part as for capek , mr kussi said he was an enormously versatile writer if you talk to older czechs who remember his work when it was first published , they will each cite some different aspect , like his science fiction , his political essays , his stories , novels , and plays as their favorite that was , in a way , his problem he was so good at so many things and so prolific that it was hard to see any one thing as his overriding talent he was a great humanist that transcended all the genres catbird wears another hat besides czech literature , one mr wechsler calls humor for grownups he takes his cue from one of his favorite adult humorists , james thurber one of my goals was to try to create more interest in adult humor of the sort thurber and eb white and sj perelman used to write for the new yorker , he said nobody does parody anymore it has died as an art form , and my odd mission is to resurrect it that sounds funny but i take very seriously among the contemporary humorists he publishes are randall beth platt , floyd kemske and jeffrey shaffer anyone who publishes with me is odd , mr wechsler said they write what they want to write after having been told elsewhere 'you 're not allowed to do that' none of my authors sound like anyone else they cross genres and they do n't fit any expectations there is nothing worse than not living up to expectations a lot of great works of literature failed that test despite what he said was a recent wave of good fortune , mr wechsler still operates on the fringe in addition to the capek collection , he has also published coast to coast , a comic novel by frederic raphael , now being made into a movie by the director paul mazursky , starring richard dreyfuss and judy davis he is also putting the finishing touches on four more books , which are due this spring and summer two titles by argentenian writer saul yurkievich a novel by david r slavitt and a wry sequel to catbird s biggest seller , the handbook of law firm mismanagement by arnold b kanter but , in the dogeatdog publishing world , none of this makes it any easier to run a small independent forprofit press like catbird it s a tough business and getting tougher , mr wechsler said since i started , half of the publishers in the us have folded of my best customers 15 years ago , half are out of business , including yale coop the uconn coop is now the only major independent store in the state that will carry small press material yes , but there is always prague you ca n't go into a bookshop in prague without seeing a shelf full of catbird press books , mr wechsler said even my translators get written up over there one confession the name of his business was not inspired by anything czech it comes from thurber s story the catbird seat the expression sitting in the catbird seat' is what an independent publisher is not , he said but it makes a nice logo photos robert wechsler , who gave up a law career to start catbird press 13 years ago , at home with his dog kc , as in the czech writer karel capek above , from the 1930 s photograph of karel capek , arguably mr wechsler s singular obsession and the main reason he started catbird press , which has just published cross roads , its seventh translation of work by the writer left , a collection of just a few of the books mr wechsler has published through the years \( photographs by chris maynard for the new york times \)
baghdad , iraq , march 23 for hours today , thousands of excited iraqis gathered on an embankment along the tigris river in the heart of baghdad , and on a bridge above , to cheer on soldiers the iraqi troops were hunting , or so the word went , for an american or british pilot said to have parachuted from his stricken plane high above the city and dropped into the river s murky waters for the crowds , the hunt was something to distract from the tension of waiting for more bombs and missiles to fall , or for american troops to arrive at the gates of baghdad whether there ever was a stricken plane , or any fugitive pilot , was unresolved well into the night , when soldiers with rifles were still firing into the riverbank bulrushes and setting them afire , and powerboats with frogmen were still cruising the river , searchlights scanning for the pilot by then , some iraqis had concluded that it might all be a case of hyperactive imaginations , or perhaps a mild form of the hysteria sometimes brought on by war at an evening news conference , the defense minister , gen sultan hashim , evaded questions about other official claims that as many as five coalition aircraft had been shot down , and stayed silent , too , on the question of the hunt along the river when we have any information to give you , we will tell you , he said in a way , though , the tough calculations hardly mattered , at least not to the iraqis out by the river today it appeared far from certain that most of the spectators wanted the pilot caught , and certain that almost none of them wished him dead walking among the crowds on sinica bridge , there were dozens of people eager to say hello , and to ask the nationality of the two englishspeaking foreigners told that they were american and british , respectively , there were broad smiles and handshakes there were palms cupped and upraised in the muslim fashion , suggesting a prayer for the pilot s survival there were many hopes for the war s quick end one man in his 30 s , a deaf mute , acted out a mime for the visitors that suggested some wider undercurrents about the war first , he pictured the pilot floating down in his harness , then hitting the water , then being seized by the iraqi soldiers , then getting punched on the nose but a while later , after watching other iraqis hanging about the foreigners , talking easily , with no sign of any lurking secret police agent of the kind so often present here , he offered another version this time , the pilot came down , hit the water , surfaced briefly for a gulp of air , dived again , swam rapidly downstream , then surfaced , looked about , scrambled up the riverbank and raced away what made this version all the more astonishing was that it came just as a plane , perhaps a b52 , was passing high overhead after dropping bombs that had exploded with a shattering impact on an invisible target a few miles away to the southwest the hunt on the riverbank was concentrated between the sinica and jumhuriya bridges across the tigris , a stretch of about 1 , 200 yards clearly visible on the same western riverbank , was the sprawling presidential compound that was ground zero for the heavy american air attacks that began on friday night the wrecked and burned ruins of four major government buildings , one of them saddam hussein s presidential office , were also in plain view in the face of the air attacks that crumpled so many symbols of the iraqi leader s power , westerners might have expected real hostility moving about baghdad , and there was some , from senior officials who predicted bitterly that america would get its comeuppance once fighting moves to the streets of baghdad but otherwise , there was silence , or the accustomed amiability for americans and britons , perhaps moved up a notch beside the river , there was a sense of a sunday afternoon entertainment , with fathers hoisting small sons on their shoulders , shoeshine boys of seven and eight hawking their services , and men with handcarts offering soft drinks and cigarettes just by lingering on the bridge , for hours in many cases , the onlookers demonstrated a confidence that the air attacks will not , this time , be aimed at bridges or , ordinary iraqis hope , at power plants , the water supply and telephone system bright sunlight poked through a pall of heavy black smoke from a ring of oil trenches that were set afire around the city on saturday , and still burning today , apparently to try and blind attacking aircraft and missiles but there was little that was magnanimous about the soldiers who fired into the water with kalashnikov rifles when they spotted a floating reed , or the senior army officers in dark green uniforms , with pistols at their hips , who boarded the speedboats that cruised the river , offering rugged handshakes to the boatmen their grim demeanor offered another kind of tableau , of what may await american troops when or , as

there is little apparent logic in selling , through payperview , the type of event that barely registered on nielsen meters on broadcast and cable television but hector figueroa believes he can market 12 men s basketball games in the americas olympic qualifying tournament in puerto rico \( at least eight starring the united states team \) at 995 each or 5995 for the full package the tournament starts aug 20 , and is a chance for team usa to redeem itself after a sixthplace finish in last year s world championships the gold , silver and bronze medalists receive automatic berths in next year s summer games in athens i hope we 'll get numbers that will change the history of payperview , figueroa said yesterday from puerto rico , where he is the chief executive of hf sports figueroa acquired the rights to the tournament for about 2 million last january from a company that bought them from fiba , basketball s international governing body the condition of getting the rights was that it was time to go payperview , he said fiba was looking at this to see if it made sense to do mainstream events in payperview at good prices , without commercials figueroa kept the eight united states games and the semifinals and the bronze and gold medal games for payperview , and he is willing to sell two dozen nonteam usa games to american networks none has chosen to bid the national basketball association had no input into the arrangement espn craved the united states rights and approached figueroa soon after he made his deal he did n't offer us anything , said mark shapiro , executive vice president of espn the united states team s failure at the world championships last year did not reduce espn s desire for the olympic event because of the renewed focus on winning and fielding a stronger team we believed the tournament would be a ratings winner on espn , shapiro said had those rights been available , we 'd have pounced payperview is , by its nature , exclusionary it limits distribution only to those who can or will pay viewers are resistant to paying for something they previously received free , although the modest pricing for the olympic qualifying tournament is more affordable than a boxing card or wrestlemania the american people are looking for special events , figueroa said this dream team is special , but there are dream teams in canada and argentina those teams are tough still , dream team fascination has diminished since its first incarnation in 1992 , and even the presence of allen iverson , tim duncan and jason kidd may not rouse viewers to pay for games had it been sold to cable or broadcast television , the tournament might do better than the world championships did the united states' roster in puerto rico is of a higher caliber than its world championship team but how much interest is there for a preseason tournament starring some of the best players in a league with floundering ratings \? a year ago , a combined eight games in the world championships on tnt , espn2 and nbc generated meager viewership , peaking at 13 million households for the semifinals on nbc espn2 s games averaged a meager 474 , 000 homes figueroa is marketing the payperview games by reminding potential buyers , in print advertisements and a tv commercial , of team usa s debacle last year the slogan the nation s pride is on the line ! there is no formula to predict how many people will purchase games out of 52 million cable and satellite homes with payperview dan york , senior vice president for programming at in demand , which is distributing the olympic tournament to cable systems , said , on a payperview basis , a small fraction of the viewers that watched the worlds on cable would qualify this event as a success figueroa is making no promises , other than to say , i hope that we get ratings that will change the history of payperview cstv goes olympic college sports tv , a cable network that started in april , is already stretching the confines of its name yesterday it announced a deal with the united states olympic committee that will guarantee a weekly primetime slot to competitions that lead to the olympics for the 39 national governing bodies brian bedol , the chief executive of cstv , said during a conference call that the program would be flexible , sometimes one hour , sometimes two or three , and it could feature one event , or several he said the decision to make the deal was made because we 've been overwhelmed by the response to what is called olympic sports he added , as we spent more time with the usoc and learned about the unbelievable history of studentathletes in the olympics , we realized this is a natural partnership can the arrangement satisfy all 39 national governing bodies , who are hungry for attention , especially the smaller ones that get little attention \?

washington , feb 5 representative sherwood boehlert is consumed with voting his conscience , once bringing a pillow to a committee hearing and asking colleagues if their votes on waterquality legislation would pass the pillow test that is , whether they would sleep well at night a republican , he is willing to buck his party s leaders , waiting until the very last minute to announce his vote to impeach president bill clinton , then immediately pressing for censure a lesser sanction after casting it he is blunt , once calling president bush s budget plan for some federal science agencies anemic now this plainspoken 65yearold lawmaker from the 23rd congressional district in upstate new york will lead the house investigation into the breakup of the space shuttle columbia , a prospect that makes some republican loyalists in washington nervous everything is fair game , mr boehlert , the chairman of the house science committee , declared in an interview this morning he promised an inquiry that would examine not only whether costcutting may have endangered astronauts' lives , but also whether decisions by his own friends including sean o'keefe , the nasa administrator , and members of congress who control the agency s budget contributed to the disaster where evidence leads me to conclude he or she made the wrong decision , that s going to be uncomfortable , mr boehlert said but we have to deal with the facts for every national crisis , there is a congressional investigation and often , a lawmaker who becomes its public face watergate , most famously , had sam j ervin jr organized crime had estes kefauver the irancontra scandal had george j mitchell the columbia disaster is about to have sherry boehlert he is not one to seek out the limelight , those who know him say , though he does not shy from it he s this odd combination of friendliness and persistence , said chet lunner , a department of transportation spokesman who knows mr boehlert well you do n't leave a room not knowing where sherry stands balding and bespectacled , with an easy manner that has won many friends on capitol hill , mr boehlert is perhaps best known as an ardent environmentalist and leader of the green republicans he takes the helm of the house investigation by dint of his lead role at the science committee , a job he was given partly because of his intelligence partly because he is a wellliked veteran of 20 years in congress and partly because the science panel is a relative backwater , where the conservative republican leaders of the house figured he would not cause much trouble now mr boehlert could do just that he said today that while he would keep house leaders informed , he considered the investigation an obligation and a special assignment and did not expect to take any direction from them i was n't elected to go to washington to turn in my voting card to the leadership , he said mr boehlert will be joined in his inquiry by senator john mccain , the arizona republican who is chairman of the commerce committee the two will lead a joint hearing next wednesday , with mr o'keefe of nasa as the sole witness after that , the house and senate committees plan to proceed independently history suggests that the house inquiry will take the lead mr boehlert acknowledged as much today , noting that his committee has had an explicit mandate to oversee the space agency ever since it was established in 1958 when the space shuttle challenger exploded in 1986 , the house science committee presented the main congressional report on saturday , even as the nation was absorbing the loss of the columbia , mr boehlert s staff began to review records of the challenger explosion and analyze nasa s budget one area he will focus on , mr boehlert said today , is the agency s relationship with the outside contractors that worked on the shuttle he does n't follow the crowd , said vernon j ehlers , a michigan republican and physicist whom mr boehlert frequently consults on scientific issues he s a free spirit that quality can lead to political trouble mr boehlert had a tough reelection battle this year in the district , which covers a swath of the mohawk valley centering on utica and rome and not everyone in washington appreciates his views he has been highly opinionated and somewhat out of the mainstream , said scott segal , who as director of the electric reliability coordinating council , an industry group , has tangled with mr boehlert on environmental issues mr segal added , the amount of influence he has with the house leadership is an open question mr boehlert has worked in washington , one way or another , for nearly 40 years he arrived in 1964 after persuading representative alexander pirnie , a predecessor , to hire him the two met when mr boehlert was working his way through college as a waiter in a utica restaurant after working for mr pirnie , then his successor , and then as oneida county s chief executive , mr boehlert was elected in 1982 he hoped , as many freshmen do , for an assignment to the powerful appropriations committee , but got the science committee instead when named the committee chairman in 2001 , he promised to run the panel in a way that would make einstein smile a diehard yankee fan , he has developed a deep affinity for the space program on one cabinet door in his office are the signatures of baseball hall of famers mr boehlert s district includes cooperstown , ny who have visited on another are those of astronauts a sign of how mr boehlert might run the columbia inquiry could be gleaned from his actions following sept 11 prodded by families who lost relatives in the world trade center attacks , the hearings he held explored whether engineering failures led to the collapse of the towers mr boehlert s persistent questioning helped establish that while three federal agencies were investigating the structural collapse , none had the authority to really take charge those of us who testified found ourselves a little bit uneasy that we had n't gotten on the scene quicker , that we did n't get the evidence as quickly as we probably should have , said dr arden bement , director of the national institute of standards and technology of mr boehlert , he said , he does n't take no for an answer following the hearings , mr boehlert pushed through legislation , signed last year by president bush , that gave dr bement s agency the authority to investigate building collapses the bill grants the institute subpoena power , a move dr bement said his scientists first resisted , but one that mr boehlert and victims' families insisted was crucial the bill earned mr boehlert the admiration of sally regenhard , who lost her son in the towers' collapse and later founded the skyscraper safety campaign , a nonprofit group for us , ms regenhard said , he was the quiet watchdog mr boehlert said he thought of people like ms regenhard when he considered his task , and would like the families of the seven dead astronauts to have that same pride as he spoke , tuesday s memorial service in houston was fresh on his mind i looked over and saw the families , he said i'm not embarrassed to say the tears flowed photo representative sherwood boehlert , republican of new york , will lead an inquiry into the columbia disaster everything is fair game , he said \( doug mills the new york times \)
washington , sept 14 the bush administration dispatched senior civilian and military officials to blanket the sunday morning talk programs today and defend its iraq policy , in particular to deflect charges that it was overly optimistic in planning troop levels and money required to win the peace vice president dick cheney , appearing on the nbc news program meet the press , made the case for the administration s request for an additional 87 billion , the bulk to go to stabilizing and rebuilding iraq , with some for afghanistan as well it s all that we think we 'll need for the foreseeable future , for this year , mr cheney said he did not rule out the possibility of subsequent requests for more funds throughout the morning , mr cheney , defense secretary donald h rumsfeld and gen richard b myers , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , were quizzed about whether the administration underestimated the number of troops required to halt the violence against allied forces and the emerging iraqi government , and how much it would eventually cost they were also pressed on whether the threat of iraq s unconventional weapons programs , and of saddam hussein s ties to terrorist groups , had been oversold to garner public support before the war there s no question but what we 've encountered resistance , mr cheney said but i do n't think anybody expected the time we were there to be absolutely troublefree he said the administration had anticipated holdover elements from the regime that would fight us and struggle , and had planned for violence from noniraqi terrorist cells that would aim attacks at american forces and united states interests in iraq mr cheney conceded that he had misspoken when , during a television interview last spring , he said iraq had reconstituted nuclear weapons , but he expressed confidence that evidence that mr hussein had a program for unconventional weapons would be uncovered he also said he had played no role in obtaining contracts for the halliburton company , which he once led , for projects in postwar iraq appearing on the cbs news program face the nation , mr rumsfeld said critics of pentagon policy were rushing to judgment we 've been there four and a half months since the end of major military combat , mr rumsfeld said four and a half months is not bogged down , in my view and there have been truly impressive accomplishments mr cheney stood by his previous comments that the people of iraq would greet the americanled forces as liberators , and not as enemies and occupiers , saying , i think the majority of iraqis are thankful for the fact that the united states is there , that we came and we took down the saddam hussein government mr cheney also echoed president bush s recent language casting success in iraq in its broadest terms , as important not only for the iraqi people but for peace throughout the middle east and for american national security and whatever the cost is , in terms of casualties or financial resources , it s a whale of a lot less than trying to recover from the next attack in the united states , mr cheney said so what we do on the ground in iraq , our capabilities here are being tested in no small measure , but this is the place where we want to take on the terrorists , mr cheney said this is the place where we want to take on those elements that have come against the united states , and it s far more appropriate for us to do it there and far better for us to do it there than it is here at home mr rumsfeld , in his appearance , rejected a characterization that he was stubborn in refusing to send additional american troops to iraq to help halt the violence , saying he was acting on the best military judgment of commanders on the ground but he held out little optimism that another united nations resolution would inspire wavering nations to contribute significant numbers of additional peacekeepers for iraq although a number of foreign capitals have said they would not send troops to iraq without united nations blessing for the mission , mr rumsfeld said that even with another resolution , my guess is the most we could hope to get for by way of additional international troops would be something between zero or 10 , 000 and 15 , 000 one division senior democrats , including those seeking their party s nomination for president , were also interviewed today , and harshly criticized the bush administration for its handling of postwar iraq what is a miserable failure is the president s inability or unwillingness to get the help we need in iraq , said rep richard a gephardt of missouri , during an appearance on fox news sunday senator john kerry of massachusetts said on face the nation that the 87 billion is the price tag for their arrogance and their miscalculation and i believe that is continuing general myers , the nation s top military officer , was questioned during an appearance on the abc news program this week about the accuracy of prewar planning for iraq was the planning perfect \? no , he said did the planning do a lot of good things in terms of oil well fires and internally displaced people and humanitarian crisis you know , medical crisis \? none of that happened and i think the planning we did averted a lot of that but often , as you get into these situations , you 're confronted with other things that you do n't anticipate photo vice president dick cheney on a tv news program yesterday \( photo by meet the press , via reuters \)
the commissariat of enlightenment by ken kalfus 295 pp new york ecco harpercollins publishers 2495 it is 1910 leo tolstoy lies dying in the stationmaster s house at the railway station of astapovo , a remote village in provincial russia journalists from all over the world have gathered at this unlikely place , along with a motley crowd of eccentrics and opportunists , all hoping to derive some personal advantage from the celebrated novelist s last hours among this waiting throng are gribshin , a young cinematographer with path fr res , who intends to get some shots of the count on his deathbed , and so perpetuate him on celluloid , and the ghoulish vorobev , who wants to perpetuate him in the flesh by injecting him with embalming fluids vorobev was later to use his skills on lenin , but he was not actually present at astapovo , nor was lenin himself , nor stalin , both of whom , however , make brief appearances it does n't matter , in the impeccable logic of the novel , whether they were actually there or not they were there in spirit , both masters in the burgeoning 20thcentury art of refashioning history through the manipulation of images the action at astapovo occupies the first half of the book from here , in shorter sections , we move through later phases in the bleak tragicomedy of postrevolutionary russia , ending in 1924 with the death of lenin , whose embalming , in a scene combining the macabre and the burlesque , begins while he is still alive this is a novel about images of one sort or another religious , political , erotic and about the power they exercise over our lives and the light , both physical and psychological , in which we see them some of the strongest and most effective scenes involve the ambiguous nature of light , at once deceiving and revealing , benign and destructive the theme makes its appearance early when the train containing gribshin and vorobev and the british journalist khaitover comes through the darkness and approaches astapovo station , gribshin sees a radiance in the sky , much whiter than sunlight something happens inside the coach first he felt the heat the coach s walls burned white pocks on the face of an adjacent passenger seemed to be deepened by the shadows cast by the conflagration until the light became so intense that the man s face dissolved , leaving only his eyebrows and the idea of the man when they alight on the platform , they find it blindingly illuminated by powerful cinematic lights mounted on tall tripods the same effects are achieved in the striking scene in which gribshin , who has gone through a sort of identity change and now calls himself astapov and is a bolshevik official in the commissariat of enlightenment , is struggling to gain the soul of the russian peasant and free him from centuries of ignorance and superstition gribshin astapov sets up lights of the same powerful sort in a village church in the ageold dimness of the interior there is a sudden explosion of light the watching peasants are at first blinded then they see every corner of the church mercilessly lighted up , stripped of mystery the radiance was a viscid element , oozing into every corner and space of the church , into chinks , crevices , pitted surfaces , and human pores heat from the lamps starts to melt the surface of the icons the pictures assumed unfamiliar hues , none of them natural as the paint burned , the ghosts behind the icons emerged the figures of the saints simplified until they resembled newspaper cartoons or caricatures the commissar s plan backfires , but he has a final resource that illustrates one of the most terrible lessons of our time if the images cannot be controlled , destroy them , obliterate the traces , leave only the evidence of power it is principally gribshin astapov who carries the burden of human consciousness through this novel , being the only character whose experience runs all the way through it , and the only one who has anything approaching an inner life and it is here that there are some difficulties in appreciation , because this inner life of his , as presented to the reader , is of the sketchiest sort indeed , he can hardly be said to exist as a moral being at all , if the characteristic of a moral being is to question one s motives it is quite a while since i read a novel , of the kind we call serious or literary , whose protagonist shows so little capacity for communing with himself or with others , for that matter whenever an occasion for this occurs , the author seems deliberately to avoid exploiting it to take one example among many , a formative experience in the young gribshin s life is an encounter with a mysterious stranger , referred to as the caucasian \( he turns out to be stalin \) the caucasian makes some observations about history and society and the importance of the cinema gribshin says almost nothing but as they are about to part and only then it is revealed to the reader that the young man has been deeply affected they understood each other the caucasian was privy to thoughts and ambitions that gribshin had yet to articulate 'what you say is the truth , ' gribshin whispered , his lips parched like a bolt from the blue , like something that might happen on the road to damascus but saul s conversion , as given to us in the acts of the apostles , has memorable life and force , whereas here there is no attempt whatever to dramatize the encounter , to register anything taking place in the minds of either man why on earth should we believe it \? why should a traveled and intelligent young man take a step toward fanaticism at this point \? why does n't he see the duplicity in the other s words \? or is the duplicity itself the revelation \? the novel provides no answer to such questions because there is no one in the novel to ask them but in fiction , as in life , a lack is not necessarily a defect it is not moral complexity or clashes of opinion that interest ken kalfus , but the driving force of single ideas , the power of images to reconstitute what we call history the absence of wavering , of selfquestioning , gives a relentless impetus to the narrative that makes this novel compelling to read some scenes of action and description are realized so vividly that they almost have the force of hallucination there is a recurrent vein of dark humor , and a grim sense of the lethal absurdities of totalitarian politics no one in this book looks at anyone else s face or listens to anyone else s voice , except out of fear or coercion people s lives are shaped by images religious icon , propaganda poster , film so they become in the end not much distinguishable from images themselves , manipulated elements in the dynamic of history , looking forward to our own time and the welter of mindsoftening images in which we live the commissariat of enlightenment is a chilling novel , but the imaginative energy that runs through it gives it a rare quality of distinction drawing \( randall enos \)
midjune , and legions of new york city students are starting to shudder at the prospect of summer school a sweaty month of math , reading and writing drills that many view as a tedious waste of time could they be right \? three years ago , the city had its hopes pinned on a vastly expanded summer school program as the latest most promising cure for its woebegone public schools it was mayor rudolph w giuliani who pressured the board of education into ending social promotion the longstanding practice of promoting students despite failing grades and organizing the nation s largest summer school program it began in july 2000 and , in theory , the fiveweek summer sessions should by now have given a few hundred thousand students the extra push they needed to pass standardized tests and earn promotion to the next grade but as another school year ends and another mayor staggers under the burden of fixing the system , the idea of summer schoolaspanacea seems to have fallen flat problems have plagued the program from the getgo , despite expensive attempts to solve them absenteeism has hobbled the program each year , even though educators have tried everything from hunting down truants to rewarding students who show up , with pizza parties and movie tickets without a state law making summer school compulsory for failing students which legislators have not pursued because of the potentially astronomical expense and the risk of angering parents who vote a significant percentage of those who desperately need extra academic help will not take advantage of the program even more troubling are the results of the 2000 , 2001 and 2002 summer programs , which are decidedly mixed in all three years , fewer than half of failing students who showed up for summer school passed the endofsummer reading and math exams , according to reports by metis associates , a private consulting firm for eighth graders , summer school has in fact seemed to do more harm than good the report found that in 2000 and 2002 , they scored much lower on the endofsummer tests than they had on spring exams it never made sense to me to take our same notsogreat school system and make kids spend more time in it during the summer , said eva s moskowitz , chairwoman of the city council s education committee if you told me the very best teachers and the most skilled administrators were in charge of summer school and the kids were getting incredible quality , it would clearly be worthwhile but the results have been anemic and while the chief goal of expanding summer school was to end social promotion , which mr giuliani characterized as the school system s greatest recurring tragedy , the practice has quietly continued the metis report for summer 2002 which chancellor joel i klein did not publicly release when it was published in december said that the percentage of students who are promoted after attending summer school has risen steadily since 2000 , even though most fail the endofsummer tests in the most egregious example , 782 percent of eighth graders who attended in 2002 were promoted to ninth grade , even though none of the 1 , 865 who took the endofsummer reading test scored at proficient or advanced levels in reading , and only a few did so in math over all , 702 percent of the 56 , 518 students in third through eighth grades who were told to attend summer school and did so last year were promoted , even though fewer than half passed the endofsummer tests harold o levy , the chancellor from january 2000 to august 2002 , excused this phenomenon for three years straight because under the new promotion policy that the board of education adopted in 1999 , promotion decisions may be based not just on test scores but on attendance and class work so a student who failed the endofsummer tests but came to class regularly might be promoted chancellor klein said early in his tenure last fall that he would review and perhaps change the policy but he has not mentioned it publicly since then some officials say his plans to reorganize the school system s administrative structure and introduce a citywide curriculum have taken precedence in fact , mr klein s focus as the school year ends is on organizing a summer school program of sorts for teachers and principals , who need to be trained in the new curriculum by september he hopes that several thousand teachers will sign up for voluntary summer training , which his staff is still putting together as many as 2 , 000 new reading and math coaches , hired to work with teachers as they begin to use the curriculum , will also attend training sessions this summer , as will 100 new instructional supervisors meanwhile , mr klein is also hustling to open a training academy in july for 90 new principals with so many new projects consuming him , some educators say , mr klein is just going through the motions with this year s summer program asked if someone on mr klein s staff could discuss his views on summer school , jerry russo , his press secretary , released a statement from deputy chancellor diana lam we are working to determine early on which students are struggling and in which areas they are experiencing difficulties , the statement said , so that we may intervene and provide the appropriate support before the school year ends because of budget cuts , the number of students recommended for summer school dropped sharply in 2002 and is expected to drop again this year , though mr klein has not yet released projected enrollment figures mayor michael r bloomberg has cut 21 million from the summer school budget , so that only students with rockbottom grades can attend , meaning that many of the b and c students who came in past years will have to stay home while he is cutting the summer school budget , mr bloomberg is pouring millions of dollars into the new curriculum and his school improvement plans veterans of the system , who have seen plenty of chancellors do away with their predecessors' programs in their eagerness to create their own legacy , say they are not surprised that summer school is not in the limelight summer school is a big help to kids who are falling behind , but it s gotten short shrift because it s not theirs , said randi weingarten , president of the city teacher s union , referring to mr bloomberg and mr klein others say that summer school was destined to fail because there has never been a thoughtful effort to train teachers or match up skills with assignments one teacher in brooklyn had to teach math last year , for example , even though she was an english teacher who had never taught a math class in her life another problem is that each of the city s 32 local school districts selects its own summer schedules and curriculums , and there has been no careful analysis of what works in middle school alone , there were 20 math programs in use last summer , suggesting that the program has lacked the kind of systemwide coherency that mr klein has deemed crucial and is seeking with the new citywide curriculum ms moskowitz said that given summer school s mixed record , the focus should perhaps change to

new haven , may 10 clutching highend prince and wilson rackets , the two teams of studentathletes , one from boston , the other from new york city , filtered into the glasswalled squash court inside yale university s athletic complex for the formal introductions this was not , however , the latest crop of ivy leaguers preparing to defend the formidable squash legacies of harvard and yale none of these players yet have a high school diploma , and few are likely to make their way to the elite east coast colleges where squash is sacred but then , that was not the point of this match between squashbusters , a bostonbased program aimed at improving the lives of poor and minority youths through sport and study , and its friendly rival in new york city , streetsquash and it became immediately obvious that this tournament , while competitive and crisply organized , was not going to follow all the rules of a regular collegiate match dispensing with the sport s typical reserve , streetsquash players burst into cacophonous applause each time one of their players was announced raymond flowers , 16 , the fifthseeded player , who is built like a defensive lineman , pumped his fist and highfived his teammates lonnie gibbs , also 16 , the team s no 2 seed , wore mirrored court goggles and a large imitation diamond earring arkam napoli , 17 , a willowy junior from cambridge , mass , who is the secondranked player on the squashbusters side , had zigzag cornrows and highriding green boxers under his baggy athletic shorts i love this sport , arkam , who is in his fourth year with squashbusters , said shortly before playing lonnie whenever i get on the court , something burns inside few testimonials could better illustrate why greg zaff , squashbusters' founder and executive director , a former professional squash player who became disillusioned with the sport s elitist overtones , began the program with 24 promising but wayward middleschool students in 1996 next year , squashbusters plans to expand to 150 students , and next month they will begin using a new 57 million gym on northeastern university s campus in boston mr zaff s formula of combining daily squash training and supervised study time with monthly community service projects has inspired similar programs in new york , philadelphia and , most recently , hartford streetsquash , for instance , which started in 1999 , now includes 120 boys and girls from west harlem , said george polsky , the program s founder who graduated from harvard and played on its nationally ranked squash team foremost among each program s goals is instilling students with a sense of accountability and respect , for themselves as well as teammates and opponents we 're talking about very disorganized , dysfunctional , undisciplined children , said mr polsky , 34 , who grew up playing squash at the harvard club , one of two sites where streetsquash students practice hitting a walnutsize rubber ball with a 150 racket may not be the surest way to appeal to students more familiar with playground basketball and parkinglot football , but that , too , seems part of the programs' core strategy i was like , 'what s streetsquash \?

washington , dec 18 the federal judge who granted john w hinckley jr unsupervised visits with his parents outside of the psychiatric hospital here where he has lived for 21 years was persuaded by testimony from five doctors who saw clinically significant improvement in mr hinckley since he shot president ronald reagan in 1981 the doctors two for the federal government and three called by mr hinckley s lawyer agreed that mr hinckley would pose no danger to himself or others on such trips and that his mental illnesses , including depression and narcissistic personality disorder , were greatly reduced as a result , judge paul l friedman of the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a 50page ruling on wednesday , granting mr hinckley six daylong trips and , if they were completed without incident , two overnight visits to a hotel , all in the washington area he denied mr hinckley s request for a third phase of travel , unsupervised overnight trips to his parents' home in williamsburg , va , saying the court remained unconvinced that such rapid progression to overnight visits outside the washington , dc , area is appropriate over the last four years , mr hinckley , who is 48 , has made hundreds of short trips from st elizabeths hospital accompanied by hospital personnel the doctors' testimony , based on years of psychiatric evaluations of mr hinckley , outweighed objections from mr reagan s wife , nancy , and convinced judge friedman that mr hinckley was stable enough for trips supervised only by his parents two doctors who treated mr hinckley and appeared in court on his behalf said mr hinckley had shown no evidence of psychosis , delusion or depression for more than 10 years the doctors cited those symptoms as causes for behavior that led to mr hinckley s obsession with the actress jodie foster and , as a way to impress her , his 1981 attempt on mr reagan s life three other people were wounded in the attack mr hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity a third doctor who testified for mr hinckley but did not treat him concurred with their views the two doctors testifying for the government told the court they did not object to greater freedom with proper safeguards , like posttrip evaluations by hospital officials and they agreed that mr hinckley s mental state had improved over the years , in part because of a daily 1milligram dose of risperdal , a common medication for psychosis but the government witnesses , dr robert phillips , a former director of forensic services for the connecticut department of mental health , and dr raymond f patterson , a former medical director of st elizabeths , raised concerns that led the court to impose added restrictions on mr hinckley s unsupervised trips , including prohibitions against any contact with reporters and with his former girlfriend , leslie deveau while noting mr hinckley s improved condition , the two government witnesses nonetheless expressed doubts that the symptoms leading to his violent behavior two decades ago had altogether disappeared as the judge wrote , they both said mr hinckley continued to have a sense of grandiosity and selfimportance and dr patterson told the court that mr hinckley felt he would always be a celebrity , without understanding the distinction between famous and infamous dr phillips also said he was troubled by supervised visits mr hinckley made to four bookstores in 1999 according to a letter to the hospital from the secret service , whose agents routinely trailed mr hinckley on his excursions , he examined such books as assassins a place called waco a survivor s story , dutch memoirs of ronald reagan , live by the sword the secret war against castro and the death of jfk and two books about gen george a custer the letter also said mr hinckley looked at a compact disc by the group called the dead kennedys and laughed dr phillips told the court that even if the books were not inappropriate , mr hinckley s examination of them indicated a lack of judgment , particularly since he was under such close scrutiny during his initial visits off hospital grounds such a lack of judgment may be indicative of narcissistic behavior , dr phillips said dr phillips , who examined mr hinckley in 2000 , said he was also troubled by mr hinckley s failure to mention in the examination a book about ms foster that ms deveau had given him or that he had been reading books in the hospital about hitler while the doctors who testified for mr hinckley said they did not believe his reading tastes were clinically significant , the government doctors said his willingness to withhold information suggested a lack of forthrightness , especially in the case of the book about ms foster judge friedman said dr patterson believed that the jodie foster obsession remains clinically significant and must be kept in mind because it was an obsession with a fiction rather than a real relationship and was directly related to mr hinckley s psychosis and the assassination attempt dr patterson also told the court that he disagreed with dr robert keisling , one of mr hinckley s witnesses and a former official at st elizabeths , that it would be apparent if mr hinckley fell into delusional thinking again he described a 1995 incident when he said mr hinckley stalked jeanette wick , then the chief pharmacist at st elizabeths , and compared it to behavior mr hinckley exhibited toward ms foster before the assassination attempt judge friedman said dr patterson found no overt signs of delusion or psychosis at the time of the assassination attempt and none in mr hinckley s behavior toward ms wick but it was on its way , he told the court even with their concerns , however , the government doctors agreed that mr hinckley deserved a chance at greater freedom , finding , as judge friedman wrote , nothing that would preclude the advancement of privileges to include limited conditional release in the custody of his parents the justice department said thursday that it was reviewing the decision and had not decided whether it would appeal
los angeles , may 10 robert horry does not always embrace the role of locker room sage , mostly because a locker room sage can often be an nba euphemism for an aging bench warmer but horry , a veteran forward for the los angeles lakers , could not help himself wednesday night his team had just fallen behind , two games to none , in the western conference semifinals against san antonio , and kobe bryant asked horry for reassurance we talked a little bit after game 2 about our mindset in houston , horry said i told him to be positive , stay focused that s what we did back then back then , 1994 and 1995 , were the last two seasons a reeling nba team rallied from a 20 deficit to win a sevengame series the houston rockets of hakeem olajuwon , with solid complementary players like horry , accomplished the feat in backtoback seasons the rockets won consecutive championships , the last one leading their coach , rudy tomjanovich , to proclaim , never underestimate the heart of a champion these lakers have a long way to go before they become the eighth team in league history to come back from a 20 deficit still , behind a reinvigorated horry , a suddenly mobile devean george and a determined and accurate derek fisher , bryant and shaquille o'neal may have enough help to survive their current peril the lakers head into game 4 sunday afternoon with an opportunity to tie the series because they overwhelmed the spurs , 11095 , on friday night if game 3 was supposed to be a measure of how much they had left , the lakers put some fears to rest it s just about the guys going out and playing , horry said san antonio is the best team in the league , and they did what they were supposed to do on their home court , so we just have to go out and protect our home court george , on crutches only two days before game 3 , surprised his teammates by starting friday night he was not making vicious dunks , but he came out firing , scoring 9 points in the first quarter his teammates kidded him afterward , saying he looked as if he were willis reed hobbling out to the madison square garden court for game 7 of the 1970 nba finals most of the lakers admitted it was a stretch , but they also thought george s pain threshold illustrated what kind of resolve remains after 14 playoff series , 3 title runs , 2 grueling game 7 s and dozens of possessions that meant the difference between becoming a champion and an offseason of selfdoubt in a series where the lakers' role players were almost nonexistent before game 3 , horry , fisher and george combined for 40 points to provide a complement for the efforts of o'neal and bryant they finally moved without the ball and found seams against a rotating spurs defense i do n't know if it s adversity , or if it s just getting to know a team , maybe it s a combination of both , bryant said after scoring 39 points in 43 minutes in game 3 but with a playoff sevengame series , you get the opportunity to know your opponent a little bit you get to make adjustments on friday night , everybody in the building made them take the actor jack nicholson , who usually sits barely animated in his courtside seat , staring through his black sunglasses and occasionally getting up to applaud the lakers at one point in the first half friday night after a call against o'neal , nicholson rose from his seat and started chastising the official who made the call waving his arms and yelling , he kept going until fans at the staples center began to rise from their seats and join him bruce bowen , the spurs guard assigned to bother bryant as much as he can with his quick feet and flailing arms , went up to nicholson and started jawing at him after the game , bowen said that nicholson had treated the official like a child , and he asked why the official did not take action bowen mentioned that when he played for miami , the singer jimmy buffett was ejected from a heatknicks game for protesting calls too vehemently as the lakers finally showed signs of resilience , that old nba clich the one about a playoff series not beginning until the home team loses a game did not fit the plot line the spurs had success in games 1 and 2 by not doubling too often on bryant and o'neal , and by making the role players beat them when the triangle offense becomes twosided and bryant and o'neal take too much of the offensive burden san antonio s plan works in game 3 , o'neal and bryant combined for a mere 39 shots and began to trust in their teammates again horry reminded bryant the other night that the rockets actually went down by 20 at home in their series against phoenix in 1994 by the time they had left town for game 3 , horry said much of houston had figured the rockets' season was about to end we all just put it behind us , horry said that s what i told kobe the other night our motto back then was , 'forget about it , relax and let s play'
boris eifman , unusually well behaved in his new ballet , who s who , remains one of the most creative personalities in russia unlike that country s major operahouse ballet companies , which lumber on without resident choreographers , the eifman ballet of st petersburg is full of risk opening its sixth consecutive season at city center on friday night , the troupe was introduced onstage by sergei lavrov , the russian ambassador to the united nations , and it offered its usual challenge to viewers remain hidebound and judge mr eifman on what he is not , or view him on his own terms who s who , a new york premiere that runs through april 17 \( replaced by pinocchio on april 19 and 20 \) , has none of the brutal torment of past eifman ballets drawn from history and literature , usually russian it is , instead , a serious tale with a light touch , a direct but resonant story of two russian ballet dancers fleeing the russian revolution in search of the american myth who s who is itself a collection of myths , sometimes viewed through the wrong end of the telescope on friday the performance fell flat but wondrously , another cast of leads , more direct in their interaction , put the pieces together to perfection on saturday afternoon ever since serge diaghilev s ballets russes produced parade in 1917 with its tom mix cowboy images , european choreographers have tended to see the united states through films here the nod in the plotline is to billy wilder s some like it hot alex and max , the ballet dancers , crossdress as showgirls to escape the mob mr eifman also has a way with gorgeous production numbers in his hollywood and supperclub scenes , all the more fascinating because he does not copy authentic idioms , but filters them through his energetic angular style the music is mostly jazz , largely duke ellington as an outsider looking in , mr eifman does not avoid clich s , but what he loses in translation is a plus and explains the ballet s originality in a way mr eifman is his own worst enemy , pouring out a torrent of ideas and details with such superfast theatricality that too much slips by to allow for depth and development it is this cinematic structure of cuts from scene to scene that differentiates his choreography from the sustained continuity usually seen elsewhere within these short scenes , focused performances are absolutely required on saturday , yuri smekalov was alex , the russian who falls in love with lynn , whom natalia povorozniuk depicted with strongly internalized emotions as an abused showgirl alex , of course , is in drag constantin matulevsky , a stunning newcomer , offered a remarkable performance puppydog eager at one point , totally sustained in his comic persona as a redwigged dancer in drag , he carried off the impossible in a nearwedding to a film director , portrayed by alexander melkaev when max , disheartened , leaves to go back to russia , the scene is credible alex , on the other hand , remains to establish a ballet company , whose dancers form a tableau that recalls a photograph of george balanchine s new york city ballet like most people , mr eifman makes no distinction between migr s and immigrants balanchine and stravinsky were the former , and if they were strapped for cash when they left europe , they were not exactly part of the huddled masses , with whom mr eifman opens who s who salava okunev s ingenious industrial set suggests glass and steel , in two mobile pillars with a horizontal bar , and surfaces that evoke everything from the brooklyn bridge to an art deco nightclub the swaying immigrants burst ashore with eifman energy , elbows shooting up as they spring forward as usual , there is total commitment and amazing stamina from fabulous dancers whose skill at innovative acrobatic partnering should not go unnoticed kol simcha , a klezmer band from switzerland , is heard on tape in the immigrant scenes alex and max , however , wear elegant overcoats and then tights when they audition with other entertainers , including a trumpeter in blackface the dancing for the principals has less to do with a gloss on popular styles it is rather in mr eifman s expressive mix of modern dance and ballet , and here one should praise the technique of the first cast alexey turko , forceful as alex igor siadzko as max vera arbuzova , mesmerizing in her longlegged lament as lynn yuri ananyan as johnny , a cartoon gangster \( mr melkaev on saturday \) and albert galichanin , wonderfully characterized as bill , the jewish film director who tries to marry max in a jewish wedding scene \( oleg markov on saturday \) these are more experienced performers and they were better as dancers than the second cast , but they gave isolated performances while the other cast jelled neither set , however , was funny in the chase scenes with the heroes in drag the comedy has to be built into the movement , not dependent on dancers placed into positions by contrast , the detail in all the showgirl numbers is brilliant , especially when a plumed chorus line mimes playing musical instruments when the gangsters follow the heroes to a movie set , the silver screen is evoked in silver lounge chairs and palm trees for a bathingbeauty ballet in two vision scenes , set to samuel barber and rachmaninoff , alex recalls czarist russia here too , the characters are in silver or white but when he raises the curtain on his own american ballet company , the colors worn by his dancers are symbolically bright in the end , mr eifman s imagination triumphs photos alexey

in a era when divorce and remarriage are commonplace , it might not be surprising for a city clerk to see some of the same names pop up on applications for marriage licenses from time to time but it did strike the city clerk s office as highly unusual when it learned this year that one manhattan woman had applied for 27 marriage licenses from 1984 to 2002 and that at least a dozen others had seemingly married in numbers that were highly suspicious these career brides , as one city official called them , were not marrying for love , according to the manhattan district attorney s office , which announced yesterday that four women had been arrested and two more were being sought on felony charges punishable by up to four years in prison the authorities said they believed that the women had offered to marry illegal immigrants for a fee , usually about 1 , 000 officials said the women who had applied for the licenses sometimes actually went through with marriage ceremonies , but sometimes they did not a marriage would entitle the men to green cards and other benefits , including social security and unemployment insurance , prosecutors said the men involved in the scheme came from various countries , including pakistan , india , peru , ecuador , nigeria and the dominican republic , according to court papers robert m morgenthau , the manhattan district attorney , began his investigation after the city clerk s office raised suspicions he said he planned to give the information to the fbinypd joint terrorist task force , the bureau of citizenship and immigration services and various united states attorneys officials said the possibilities for abuse are obvious and seemingly endless , given that municipal and county databases on marriage in new york state are not linked , nor are computerized records connected state to state this opens the door to a lot of other fraud and expense for the us taxpayer , mr morgenthau said at a news conference victor l robles , the city clerk who reported the multiple marriages to mr morgenthau in january , still seemed stunned by his findings i wanted to know how that s possible in the city of new york , he said yesterday in a telephone interview in order to marry in new york city , prospective brides and grooms must complete an affidavit that requires information about previous marriages the application is then filed with the city clerk s office only once did any of the women arrested yesterday acknowledge a previous marriage on the application mr robles , a former city councilman who took over the city clerk s office in 2001 , said he was surprised when he heard about a woman who had filed for numerous marriage licenses within a short period of time he then learned that his office was doing only oneyear computer searches on applicants somebody who got married this year could go to the bronx next year and get married again , and not be detected , he said mr robles also learned that records were not immediately shared among boroughs or counties i said , 'from now on , every time we catch somebody , we 'll forward it to the district attorney s office in the respective counties , ' he said since taking office , mr robles , who has 54 deputies in the five boroughs , has instituted a records search that goes back 10 years , and he is lobbying for all the state s marital records to be connected i hope that this whole scandal will force the city and the state to link systems so that i can punch in a name and know if someone already applied for a license , he said this question remains at what point does one who often says i do become suspicious \? after three weddings \? five \? ten \? we have to look very closely , mr robles said , adding that he had hired a lawyer whose role it is to crosscheck information on people with multiple marriages the office also demands to see divorce decrees before issuing new marriage licenses , he said the women who were charged yesterday dezerrie cortes , 40 , who had applied for 27 licenses maria davis , 26 monique figueroa , 26 and chera larkins , 32 worked independently of each other , officials said , and had applied for licenses to marry a total of 43 men the charges included perjury and offering false documents to officials there was no pattern to the schemes or identifiable ringleader , prosecutors said none of the four women could be reached for comment yesterday ms cortes is being held at rikers island in 25 , 000 bail ms davis was released on her own recognizance , and ms figueroa was expected in manhattan criminal court for arraignment last night officials said ms larkins had been arrested , but they did not know her whereabouts ms davis and ms cortes live in the same lexington avenue apartment building , a highrise near east 121st street she goes to work and takes her son to school every day mother kinds of things , a neighbor , karen williams , 29 , said of ms cortes in explaining how the prospective grooms found their brides , dan castleman , the chief of investigations in the manhattan district attorney s office , said oftentimes it was word of mouth in the neighborhood some of the women made it known they were available for a price others used gobetweens to arrange unions , he said , adding that most who actually married after receiving the licenses never bothered to file for divorce before applying for new licenses in another case , an employee in the city clerk s office is being sought on accusations that he accepted a bribe to change a bride s name in the computer system in that case , prosecutors said , the woman scheduled to appear at the clerk s office for a marriage ceremony did not show up , and the wouldbe groom wanted her name removed from the record so another woman could be substituted and the wedding could go on that day mr morgenthau said an investigation into about a dozen other repeat brides and their grooms was continuing if the government finds that a green card application is based on a fraudulent marriage , the applicant could be immediately deported we wanted to put a stop to this now , mr morgenthau said later , he added , but the investigation still has a ways to go photo victor l robles , the city clerk , is lobbying for boroughs and counties to link their files on marriage licenses \( chang w lee the new york times \) \( pg b7 \)

for the first few days of the war , the story belonged to the gadgeteers and their gadgets , to the hightech tools that now weave the american military into a seamless web of information and destruction the opening forays last week had all the appearance of a pushbutton campaign , a laptop conflict that allowed cruise missiles fired from ships in the persian gulf to take out specific buildings in baghdad when americans began watching the war , as we now do hour by hour , we witnessed a saga of hardware and software but what we 're seeing , especially in the images from nasiriya and basra , is an ageold reminder about the reality of war under the armor there is still only the flesh and blood and sinew of young soldiers it makes no difference whether that armor is the shield of an ancient greek soldier or the electronics jamming of a modern attack aircraft the history of warfare is the history of young men , and now women , too , experiencing the concussion of combat and though this war is being waged in ways that would have seemed futuristic even as recently as the last gulf war , there are still scenes playing out that look , as one television general put it , like okinawa in 1945 the systems that guide artillery fire have changed drastically , but a small cluster of young men gathered around their howitzer still look much as they did even in world war i there is a far more atavistic element playing out in this war as well it s easy to see the exhaustion that wears down these troops as they move , heavily clad , in a hot sandstorm , for instance but the emotions that sweep through the soldiers as they take fire and return it are invisible every one of them has been trained to do the job in as professional a manner as possible part of the purpose of such rigorous training is to keep that internal eye , that memory of who you were before military life and combat , from interfering with the practitioner of warfare of all the technologies that have changed warfare , few have changed it as much as the medical care that soldiers now get in the field we now take it for granted that a soldier wounded in iraq will find himself hospitalized within a day or two in germany we also take it for granted that none but the most grievous wounds are lifethreatening , though in every war before the middle of the 20th century , any wound could lead to death , and disease itself was more likely to kill than enemy fire now , from home , we watch those soldiers being carried to a hospital in germany they look up from their litters , from someplace they have never known before , and you realize that under the body armor there is still the body , something that has not changed at all since men first went to war
from inside a converted tire warehouse in an alley of danbury , marie worroll watched her 15yearold daughter , jennifer , throw herself around the floor , dancing alongside hundreds of other teens this was a good thing in fact , almost weekly ms worroll , 48 , drives jennifer and her friends more than 50 miles from milford to that old warehouse , now the empress ballroom , because the club is one of the last spots in the state offering regular live music for the under18 crowd it keeps them off the streets and out of trouble , said ms worroll , who sat on a sofa in the corner of the club , supervising her daughter and friends at a recent punk show it s a safer environment but allages clubs like the empress , rare to begin with , are just about extinct the tuneinn in new haven closed last year , the hanover house in meriden in 2001 , and planet bean in wallingford closed suddenly in march that leaves the empress and the el 'n' gee in new london , which even its owner admitted is just hanging on this is frustrating both teenagers , who complain there is nothing to do , and their parents , who want to keep their children busy and out of trouble the danbury police said they received few calls about problems at the empress it s very depressing , the kids talk about it all the time , said tina corchard , 39 , of oxford , who accompanies her 18yearold son s band , redefined , to gigs all over the state they 're saying , 'what happened to this place \? what happened to that place \? teenagers are always looking for something to do and finding it is not always easy , especially something their parents will approve of music clubs that do n't serve alcohol are one answer , but one that seems to be fading some towns have teen centers , but in others teenagers have to rely on the old standbys we do n't have a teen center or anything where we can just go for free and hang out , said ryan avery , 15 , of canterbury you go to the movies or go bowling , and there s not much outside of that this general dearth of youth activities in northeast connecticut helped spur the staff at norwich ten pin bowl to adopt teengeared bowling that combines the sport with a nightclub environment disco lights , a deejay and an allyoucanbowl cover charge have turned the bowling alley into a weekend hotspot there s really nothing for kids to do in norwich , said ken mcgory , the alley s assistant manager and now , a lot of the kids do n't even bowl , they just come to hang out with friends in westport , the town created a coffeehouse for its teenagers we no longer have a movie theater in town , our miniature golf course is gone and there s no bowling alley , said elaine daignault , westport s youth services coordinator there are n't a lot of places that welcome teens hanging out in large masses so ms daignault helped open up toquet hall , a townrun coffeehouse that offers live music , comedy , theater and nearly anything else local teens request its board of directors is made up of adults and adolescents , including 16yearold jordan kunkes with the life of a high school student , you need to get away from your family once in a while , mr kunkes said you need a place to just hang out with your friends , and with music there , it s even better i think it s just a safe place for teens to go and just have fun music seems to be a key ingredient for teenagers , which is why the allages clubs were so popular you were seeing bands from all around , said paul belbusti , a 23yearold student at southern connecticut state university who as a teen attended shows that ranged from acoustic to rock to blues at the defunct tuneinn and hanover house clubs the most important music fans , especially for local music , are high school kids , mr belbusti said that s when you 're most interested in being exposed to different types of music and it really means the most to you planet bean was mainly a coffeeshop before a parttime employee , jack zemke , 19 , began organizing live punk shows there on friday nights last summer because he loved the music the owner liked the idea the shows started slowly it was just me and the band , mr zemke said of the early turnouts but quickly grew into gatherings that topped 200 people mr zemke , along with his friend , greg fraulo , had booked up to five bands a night for the friday shows before the club closed they had been starting to expand the club s repertoire from simply punk by hosting folk musicians and bands with jazzlike brass sections after the club closed , it left mr zemke and the crowd he gathered with no local options for music kids were sad , mr zemke said i could see them get so angry , and then die down because there was nothing to fight for daryl gall , who plays in the band , nothingstar , played eight times at planet bean , and he remembered the club as home now , his band is having a hard time finding any gigs in the state , aside from what s known as a doityourself show , where a band will play up to 500 to rent a hall and handle all promotion and setup themselves that s where he was on a recent saturday , before his band played the waterbury vfw hall with four other bands for a free show attended by nearly 100 young people mr gall said the lack of proper allages venues was taking its toll on young people kids and bands alike

pagadian city , the philippines each time somebody entered the bar , hernan dela cruz watched closely , and felt for the 45caliber semiautomatic pistol strapped to his waist with him was another armed man , one of two soldiers assigned to protect him mr dela cruz , 35 , is not a warlordpolitician in this country where politicians usually move around with armed guards he is a journalist , one of the many in the philippines who have armed themselves and hired bodyguards for fear of their lives according to the committee to protect journalists , which is based in new york , the philippines is among the most dangerous countries outside war zones for journalists , along with algeria , pakistan , colombia , cuba and russia since its founding in 1981 , the committee has recorded 61 filipino journalists killed for their work , said kavita menon , its senior program coordinator for asia since president ferdinand e marcos was driven from office in 1986 , 40 journalists have been killed , the committee said none of the cases have been solved impunity is so standard in the philippines , colombia and russia that journalists there are resigned to losing several of their colleagues each year , ann cooper , executive director of the committee , said in its 2002 annual report it is small wonder , then , that journalists like mr dela cruz are arming themselves i cannot take chances , he said , explaining the pistol , which he keeps on his desk whenever he is in the cramped newsroom of the zamboanga scribe , the weekly he owns and edits in this city about 480 miles south of manila , on the island of mindanao erwin tulfo , a reporter for abscbn , the country s largest television network , has been receiving death threats for so long now he cannot recall when he started carrying a gun when he was given a television program called mission impossible , which used hidden cameras to expose the shenanigans of government officials and companies , the threats increased they would call or text me to tell me that they know where i and my family live , mr tulfo said if i do n't arm myself , i am a sitting duck dindo amparo , mr tulfo s colleague at abscbn , has also had his share of death threats he does not usually carry a gun but when he covers the abu sayyaf , the rebels known for their kidnappings in the south , he gets bodyguards from the military , especially since the group threatened to kill him for referring to them as bandits a journalist under threat is obligated to arm himself , especially if he works in an area where warlords rule and especially if the police are in cahoots with these warlords , mr amparo said there s nobody he can turn to but himself most of the journalists killed in the philippines were not victims of such groups as the abu sayyaf , the communist new people s army or the separatist moro islamic liberation front all of which operate on the southern island of mindanao , where most of these murders took place most were killed by gunmen hired by politicians , gambling and drug lords , and , in some instances , killed by the police themselves mr dela cruz was threatened by the same people who killed the zamboanga scribe s managing editor , edgar damalerio , a year ago mr damalerio , 33 , was shot near the police headquarters two witnesses identified a police officer , guillermo wapili , as the killer mr wapili escaped from prison before he could be tried and remains at large before his death , mr damalerio had been been accusing the city s police chief , asuri hawani , of corruption although there is no evidence to indicate that mr hawani ordered the murder , he was fired for covering up the investigation in a country where democracy still has yet to fully flower and where governance particularly in the provinces is often inadequate , journalists frequently feel their mission encompasses more than reporting events often , these journalists are the only ones raising uncomfortable questions about provincial politics and that can be a dangerous occupation , said lin neumann , an american journalist who covered the philippines for many years and now works for the committee to protect journalists meanwhile , the threats and the attacks continue on april 29 , john villanueva , a broadcaster in legaspi city in the northern philippines , was shot and killed that same day , another broadcaster , juan pala jr , was ambushed by unidentified men in davao , a city 600 miles south of manila , but survived it was the second attempt on his life while the philippine press is considered among the freest in asia , with little , if any , government control , it is also often described as raucous , uninhibited , even licentious radio commentators start their day castigating people on the air print journalists have no qualms publishing even the most unfounded of allegations worse , many filipino journalists are on the payroll of politicians , the military and the police , even business interests a recent editorial in the philippine journalism review concluded that some of the killings could also be happening in response to shoddy reporting and reckless commentary a result has been an erosion of the public s trust in the press when the public does not trust you , they are less likely to care if you are under threat , said mr amparo , the television reporter photo hernan dela cruz , the editor of the zamboanga scribe , now carries a semiautomatic pistol and moves about with two armed bodyguards \( carlos h conde for the new york times \)
scientists have decoded the genome of the anthrax bacterium and found that it closely resembles that of a common soil bacterium the finding , published today in the journal nature , is expected to help scientists pinpoint the genetic machinery that makes anthrax so deadly and devise therapies against it the type of anthrax that was decoded is known as the ames strain , a particularly deadly form that has long been studied in biological weapons laboratories and was used in the anthrax mailings the genome was decoded by a team at the institute for genomic research in rockville , md , led by dr timothy d read the institute started to make the genome sequence available on its web site when decoding began in 1999 , and today published its analysis of the full genome and a comparison with a closely related soil bacterium , bacillus cereus the cereus genome was decoded by dr natalia ivanova and colleagues at integrated genomics in chicago the anthrax genome consists of a large , circular chromosome containing 5 , 227 , 293 units of dna these encode the information for 5 , 508 genes , dr read s team reports the bacterium also possesses two much smaller rings of dna , known as plasmids , one of which carries its three toxinmaking genes its cereus cousin has a similar main chromosome , but its plasmids lack the toxin genes that make anthrax so deadly the genetic repertoire of the anthrax and cereus bacteria includes genes that break down proteins but lacks many genes that metabolize sugars , a common source of energy for other bacteria this suggests that anthrax and cereus are specialized for consuming animal and plant proteins in the soil , dr read said the anthrax bacterium spends most of its time in the soil but has moved up the food chain from scavenger to killer by having acquired its plasmid with the three toxins though the plasmid seems to have been acquired recently , in evolutionary terms , it is not yet clear where it came from the ames strain was used in the anthrax mailings sent to the senate and news media offices in fall 2001 last year dr read s team analyzed an anthrax sample taken from robert stevens , a photo editor who died after contracting anthrax from a letter sent to the american media building in boca raton , fla the aim was to help the federal bureau of investigation determine which of several laboratories known to hold stocks of the ames strain was the source of the material though a few minor differences were found between the original ames strain and that used in the letter , it was not clear how helpful that discovery was in identifying the source stock but dr claire m fraser , the president of the institute for genomic research , said the institute was still working on the problem none of the parties involved believe that we are at a dead end , dr fraser said editors of several journals agreed this february to withhold publications that might give help to bioterrorists dr fraser said that she had held nothing back in publishing the anthrax genome and that no one had asked her to dr ronald atlas , president of the american society of microbiology and a leading advocate of the restraint policy , said his concern was with cookbook descriptions of how to make biological weapons and he had no wish to curb publication of fundamental knowledge like the sequence of the anthrax genome
a winter weather advisory was in effect , with sleet , snow and 50mileanhour winds forecast a sunday morning custommade for sitting at home with a book and a cup of hot chocolate but under a veil of falling snow , darkboughed honeylocusts beckoned , fairy talelike , down a path that led away from the roads and the cars and toward the brooklyn heights promenade a onethirdmilelong terrace laced with graceful mansions and town houses , the promenade is , on most days , a perch from which to contemplate the city the statue of liberty , ellis island and the staten island ferry provide a dramatic backdrop for joggers , walkers and people who like to eat lunch on benches sometimes , more eclectic scenes play out in summer , kayakers paddle by , as small as water striders , striking out for points in the harbor in late afternoon after a rain , sunlight washes the boats and buildings in an orange glow on the rare occasions when new york dips into an extended deep freeze , the promenade is a good place to watch ice floes glide by none of that existed this snowy day the walkway , coated white , was almost untouched by footprints there was no manhattan to gaze at , and passing ships were shrouded in mist the only view was of the piers and their buildings , the peaked roofs blanketed in snow , their blue paint offering subtle daubs of color , like highlights in a tinted photograph hundewetter is a german word to describe terrible weather , or dog s weather , and there must be some german speakers in brooklyn heights , because the dogs were out in force benny , a yellow labrador retriever , strained on his leash , pulling along a tall young man named peter schmidtnowara mr schmidtnowara and benny moved to brooklyn heights from new mexico two years ago , and both love the promenade in the snow , though perhaps for different reasons what i like about it is it s one of those places where it feels like you 're by yourself in the city , mr schmidtnowara said , gazing at the cocoonlike scene it s just amazing nearby , a westie , which its owner introduced as raul of brooklyn heights , cavorted almost the same color as the snow , he was exhilarated , leashless , his pointed ears quivering he s a coldweather dog , said his owner , terrie herrera , who has lived in the neighborhood for 15 years when it comes to the promenade , ms herrera is a coldweather creature , too it s quieter now , which is really nice , she said it s really a madhouse here when it s warm but that day , the only touch of madness was a woman in a robin seggblue parka , speedwalking with her hands bouncing up and down and her tongue stretched out to catch falling snowflakes she grinned at a passerby , then hurried off into the whiteness photo when the temperature drops below freezing , the brooklyn heights promenade attracts coldweather dogs and their owners \( photo by joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
arlington , va , may 26 president bush observed the nation s first memorial day since the battle for baghdad with a remembrance this morning at arlington national cemetery , where soldiers who died in iraq lay in freshly dug graves under gray skies , with a full military color guard in attendance , mr bush laid a wreath on the tomb of the unknowns on a hill overlooking the capital and then delivered a 12minute address at the memorial amphitheater to veterans in wheelchairs , families of the dead and a smattering of politicians beyond the tomb of the unknowns , in section 60 of arlington cemetery , mr bush said , we have laid to rest americans who fell in the battle of iraq one funeral was for second lt frederick pokorney jr of the marines , from jacksonville , nc his wife , carolyn , received a folded flag , and his 2yearold daughter , taylor , knelt beside her mother at the coffin to say a final goodbye this nation does not forget , mr bush said today , we honor the men and women who have worn the nation s uniform and were last seen on duty defense secretary donald h rumsfeld , who introduced mr bush , made it clear that the campaign against terrorism was far from over today , we face new threats to our freedom , mr rumsfeld said they will be met with the same courage , the same commitment , and like the foes of times past , they , too , will be defeated gen richard b myers of the air force , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said , as i view this landscape covered by memorials on this day of remembrance , i know that each is etched with far too few words to fairly record the life of the man or woman resting there on good morning america on abctv , general myers said it was just a matter of time before weapons of mass destruction would be found in iraq the weapons were a stated reason that the united states invaded iraq none have been found general myers said he knew that it would be very , very , very tough to find them , but that the united states was still gathering information from the leaders of the old government we just need a little patience , he said
on sunday pbs is scheduled to begin its weeklong documentary series the blues , with martin scorsese as executive producer in the episodes , directed by clint eastwood , wim wenders , mike figgis and others , the past , present and future of the blues are honored , explored and explained but some record labels and music publishers say there is one old blues tradition being honored by pbs that would be better off left in the past underpaying the artist randall wixen , president of wixen music publishing , says pbs offered a bluesman he represents , robert wolfman belfour , 500 for the use of a song on television , on dvd s and in promotions worldwide in perpetuity that falls far short of the 8 , 000 to 12 , 000 that he said was the standard industry fee just for using a song in a dvd in an email message sent last month to a producer of the pbs show , mr wixen rejected pbs s musiclicensing offer if your true purpose is to honor the blues and those who make it , he wrote , why devalue it so by continuing to treat its creators as if they were worthless \? producers who worked on the series said in interviews that what they called a favored nation system was devised to pay for music the same nonnegotiable amount was paid for every performance and song , whether popular or obscure clarifying mr wixen s figure , they said that mr belfour s music was intended only for use on the dvd box set , for which he would have received 500 in compensation for the first 200 , 000 sets sold artists whose music was also selected for the television broadcast were to receive an additional fee the producers said every important artist who performed was paid 500 for his time , whether the film clip was used or not \( a song s writer or copyright holder and the performing artist are not always the same person \) i think the musicians deserve much more than we paid , said one executive who worked on the series , speaking on condition of anonymity on the other hand , he added , the series could not have been completed if the fees had been higher alex gibney , the series producer , said the budget presented a challenge some involved with the series said 450 , 000 was allotted for each episode , but mr gibney said the actual budget was higher there are over 500 songs in the series , he said , and the only way to make it work was to come up with a fee that was the same for everyone and low enough to allow us to do the series in the first place at the same time we wanted to make sure that if these artists appeared on a cd , or if the films themselves ever made a profit , as unlikely as that may be , then there would be additional compensation for these artists mr wixen said he understood the constraints the show was under but then you 're shifting the cost from the show to the people who make the music , he said so it s just telling the musicians , stand in line , ' again and it did n't feel right robert kenner , who produced the episode mr belfour would have been in , said i think it s really sad not just for the movie , but it would have been really helpful to him here s a guy who is talented and wants to be heard mr wixen said the decision not to participate was made after consultation with mr balfour s publisher , mockingbird blues reaction to the compensation among record labels and managers ranged from pleased to disappointed , though most said they were happy for the chance to be included the larger debate is over the advantages of compensation versus promotion artists are often persuaded to waive or lower fees to appear in television , film and commercial endeavors because they provide good exposure though most who worked on the blues said they wished the musicians had been paid more , they also said that those who appeared would have the advantage of increased cd and concertticket sales in the early days of blues and rb , musicians were typically unaware that they were being taken advantage of by managers and record labels most artists today are more savvy now we know that black guys did n't get paid and made no money , said bobby rush , a blues singer and innovator who is featured in the road to memphis segment , which is scheduled for tuesday skip james cut 28 songs and made 45 i can show you another skip james every time i look in the mirror , i see a guy who did n't get paid for what he did \( skip james was one of the most influential delta bluesmen of the 20 s and 30 s , though mr rush s figures could not be confirmed \) nowadays , he continued , things are n't necessarily much better we know that record companies today are like they were yesterday , he said they may pay a little more , but they 're still not paying what they should so you get what you can thus he knew exactly what he was doing when he agreed to appear in the pbs blues series i'm doing it not for the cash money upfront , he said , but for the clout it brings me because the more people know of me , the more value i have he explained that he was n't necessarily talking about cash value , but the power to speak to a greater range of people through his music as for regrets , he said he had none i think it s the best thing that ever happened to bobby rush in his career , he said of his inclusion in the series , because it gave me a chance to display what i do , and nobody told me what to do and how to do it mr gibney said that in addition to the pbs programs , the producers of the series put on a benefit concert at radio city music hall in february that was filmed for a forthcoming documentary all the proceeds from the concert and film , he said , will be donated to the blues music foundation , a charity benefiting music education and blues musicians who have fallen on hard times matthew johnson , founder of the mississippi blues label fat possum , expressed the mixed feelings some had about the project i'm glad they 're honoring the blues , he said we just do that in a different way photo bobby rush , one of the artists seen in the series the blues \( photo courtesy of bobby rush pbs \)
eyeball it , sniff it , give it the heave if taming the postblackout refrigerator was a nasty chore , new yorkers have at least been able to savor the sight of store shelves freshly stocked with food but what about all that milk , cheese , meat and ice cream \? how is a shopper to know exactly where it sat while the lights were out \? was it kept at the proper temperature , and is it now safe to eat \? perishable foods like these rarely go directly from the producer to the store there is invariably a distributor , with a warehouse , in between that might seem a potential threat to freshness , as it stretches the distribution time and distance but in a power failure , it may actually be a benefit , because the huge warehouses usually have their own generators , or may be outside the blackedout area officials at several supermarket chains , including d'agostino , king kullen and ap , which owns food emporium and waldbaum s stores , said yesterday that they had systems designed to cope with blackouts perishables were removed from open cases and put into refrigerators or freezers bolstered with extra ice or dry ice some items were kept in refrigerated trucks and trucks that were making deliveries to stores when the power went out were turned back to the refrigerated warehouses there are still no guarantees of food safety , but consumers received some encouraging news yesterday new york city s health commissioner , thomas r frieden , said an unexplained spike in the number of reported cases of diarrheal disease appeared to have subsided he said there was a slight but statistically significant increase on saturday , when more than 100 cases were reported , several dozen more than the 50 to 80 cases reported on an average day but the numbers returned to normal on sunday in addition , he said , health department officials inspected more than 500 restaurants during the weekend food markets were supposed to conduct the same sniffandtoss operations and while there is no way to know whether they all did the job or did it properly the state department of agriculture and markets , which monitors 28 , 000 retail food establishments , said it had inspected nearly 900 since friday morning 700 of them in new york city and cited only 30 for violations stores have been doing a terrific job of properly disposing of any unfit products , said jessica chittenden , a spokeswoman for the agency she said shoppers can perform the tests they do at home you can usually tell by the color or condition of the package whether a food is damaged or spoiled , she said mr frieden said city health officials were particularly concerned about milk , yogurt , soft cheese and meats , and cooked rice and potatoes that could be breeding ground for bacteria any food that was at more than 40 degrees fahrenheit for more than two hours may be risky , he said mary moore , the spokeswoman for d'agostino , said the chain s blackedout stores had discarded all ice cream , prepared foods and seafood but she said most of its perishables came from a warehouse in harrisburg , pa , that did not lose power king kullen , a long island chain , is supplied mostly by bozzuto s , a connecticut company that was unaffected by the blackout ap has warehouses in the bronx and in islip , ny , with generators , so none of the food there was lost bob carson , the ap spokesman , said that inspectors from the federal department of agriculture had checked the bronx warehouse on friday jeff lichtenstein , the president of gourmet guru , which imports and distributes products like total yogurt and applegate farms meats , said he was surprised to see no inspectors he said he had lost about onequarter of his inventory he said he had recorded the temperatures at which all his products were kept and had required that his vendors provide the same assurances to him and , if requested , to his customers but i wo n't eat anything but vegetables for the next week , he said at fresh direct , in long island city , queens , joe fedele , the president , said there were backup generators to keep the refrigeration going no orders were processed and delivered until on sunday , mainly because workers could not get to their jobs of all the items in a supermarket , fish is the one that usually comes from the most direct , local sources at lockwood winant , one of the largest wholesalers in the fulton fish market , all the fish was buried in ice , with relatively little loss there are no backup generators in the fulton fish market , but ice evidently saved the day , just as it might have 50 years or so ago they were not as lucky at blue ridge farms in brooklyn , one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of deli salads in the region anything that was being processed when the power went out we could n't save , said sanjay kalra , the company s quality assurance manager he added that there was a federal agriculture department inspector in the plant every day while that is reassuring on the wholesale level , it may not comfort the nervous consumer about the chicken salad at the local supermarket or deli once it leaves our facility , it s out of our control , mr kalra said caveat emptor , especially in summer , and after a blackout photos at a gristede s store in chelsea , the frozen foods manager , rodney mitchell , disposed of ice cream that had not survived the blackout \( photo by associated press \) fresh food was en route to the shelves yesterday at a western beef market , left , and spoiled meat was headed out of gourmet guru \(

bedford village , ny acting is a very strange job , says lena olin , who as the child of actors , and as an actor who has herself been in more or less constant demand since graduating from drama school some two and a half decades ago should know to be a good actor , you have to be very smart but to be a great actor , you also have to have a streak of , 'i'm an idiot , a complete lunatic' sometimes i think , 'wow , why did n't i grow up the way other people do \? why do i have this idiotic side to me \? ' because even the wish to do what actors do is somewhat idiotic 'ok , i'm really sad and i have to show you how sad i am' i mean , who would want to do that \? idiot is probably not the first word that springs to mind for those who have been watching her this past season on the tv spy show alias , playing what she calls the very cool part of irina derevko , crafty secretagent mom to jennifer garner s highly conflicted secretagent heroine , sydney bristow on alias , ms olin gets to display for a large television audience the qualities that impressed moviegoers in the late 80 s , when she made her englishlanguage screen debut as the sexy czech artist sabina the one with the mirrors , the black underwear and the bowler hat in philip kaufman s glorious film version of milan kundera s unbearable lightness of being \( 1988 \) and then followed up that hardtofollow act with an oscarnominated performance as a volatile \( and sexy \) holocaust survivor in paul mazursky s enemies , a love story \( 1989 \) although the characters are n't similar , in both those pictures ms olin stirs up an uncanny mixture of gravity and sensuality , and that s what she s been doing on alias this season , too all you have to do is watch the reactions of sydney s secretagent dad , jack \( victor garber \) , to his wily exwife he knows exactly how dangerous irina is , yet she still has the power to cloud his mind ms olin , dressed down in jeans and a zippered sweater worn over a garment that looks suspiciously like a pajama top , arrives at a tiny , noisy , crowded restaurant near her home in northern westchester county looking nothing like a femme fatale and carrying none of the doyouknowwhoiam airs of a star but she also appears , without seeming to mean to , unmistakably different from the other suburban mothers in the room this is partly , of course , the consequence of the unfair advantage of physical endowment she s tall and athleticlooking , and she has the sort of features that , well , command attention especially the eyes , which are huge , deep brown and startlingly alert as we wait for a table i notice that a few patrons are casting furtive glances in her direction , maybe because they recognize her \( i get a lot of 'why do you look so familiar \? ' she says \) maybe just because she s the kind of person other people feel compelled to stare at beauty , i suddenly realize , is a wonderful tool for an actor you do n't have to work as hard to capture the audience s interest , which means you can save your energy for the more important , and rewarding , job of exploring the nuances of character and that s the job ms olin signed up for when , encouraged by ingmar bergman , she enrolled in the national drama school of her native sweden a rigorous fouryear course that led , in turn , to an eightyear stint in the repertory company of stockholm s royal national theater there , according to her , you play and you rehearse , you play and you rehearse there s nothing else i loved it , she says , but if you 're an actor a lot of directors want to use , which i was lucky to be , you have absolutely no life there s a nurse at the theater , and a doctor but no dentist that s the only time you get out and see a little bit of the world the world , however , eventually took notice of lena olin mr kaufman , who had seen her in the 1983 bergman tv film after the rehearsal , cast her in unbearable lightness and then mr mazursky had to have her for his dream project , enemies in his autobiography , mr mazursky provides a characteristically pithy , outthere description of her appeal lena olin was a great actress with an equally great body ! more than enough , you 'd think , to make her a major international movie star but , as she admits , i do n't think i 've had a role since that matches either 'unbearable' or 'enemies' her next film , sydney pollack s casablancalike havana \( 1990 \) , in which she played ingrid bergman to robert redford s neobogey , and which represented her strongest bid for majorinternationalmoviestardom was an expensive and extremely conspicuous flop ms olin claims not to be bothered by the relatively low visibility that descended on her in the posthavana years it strikes me every time i do an interview , she says , that i do n't really sit around thinking about my goals and my life and my career i do what i love doing and i get a lot of feedback i'm free as a bird , you know \? if i do something good , it s , 'wow , that was brilliant , ' and if i do something bad it just goes away if tom cruise does a movie that does n't work , the whole world shakes , at least in the hollywood hills that s a lot of pressure , and i think it s really hard to stay a good actor and remain true to why you wanted to do this , which was an urge to tell the truth , no matter what
