london social networks stand accused of being enemies of productivity according to one popular \( if questionable \) circulating online , the use of facebook , twitter and other such sites at work costs the american economy 650 billion each year our attention spans are atrophying , our test scores declining , all because of these weapons of mass distraction yet such worries have arisen before in england in the late 1600s , very similar concerns were expressed about another new mediasharing environment , the allure of which seemed to be undermining young people s ability to concentrate on their studies or their work the coffeehouse it was the socialnetworking site of its day like coffee itself , coffeehouses were an import from the arab world england s first coffeehouse opened in oxford in the early 1650s , and hundreds of similar establishments sprang up in london and other cities in the following years people went to coffeehouses not just to drink coffee , but to read and discuss the latest pamphlets and newssheets and to catch up on rumor and gossip coffeehouses were also used as post offices patrons would visit their favorite coffeehouses several times a day to check for new mail , catch up on the news and talk to other coffee drinkers , both friends and strangers some coffeehouses specialized in discussion of particular topics , like science , politics , literature or shipping as customers moved from one to the other , information circulated with them the diary of samuel pepys , a government official , is punctuated by variations of the phrase thence to the coffeehouse his entries give a sense of the wideranging conversations he found there the ones for november 1663 alone include references to a long and most passionate discourse between two doctors , discussions of roman history , how to store beer , a new type of nautical weapon and an approaching legal trial one reason these conversations were so lively was that social distinctions were not recognized within the coffeehouse walls patrons were not merely permitted but encouraged to strike up conversations with strangers from entirely different walks of life as the poet samuel butler put it , gentleman , mechanic , lord , and scoundrel mix , and are all of a piece not everyone approved as well as complaining that christians had abandoned their traditional beer in favor of a foreign drink , critics worried that coffeehouses were keeping people from productive work among the first to sound the alarm , in 1677 , was anthony wood , an oxford academic why doth solid and serious learning decline , and few or none follow it now in the university \? he asked answer because of coffea houses , where they spend all their time meanwhile , roger north , a lawyer , bemoaned , in cambridge , the vast loss of time grown out of a pure novelty for who can apply close to a subject with his head full of the din of a coffeehouse \? these places were the ruin of many serious and hopeful young gentlemen and tradesmen , according to a pamphlet , the grand concern of england explained , published in 1673 all of which brings to mind the dire warnings issued by many modern commentators a common cause for concern , both then and now , is that new mediasharing platforms pose a particular danger to the young but what was the actual impact of coffeehouses on productivity , education and innovation \? rather than enemies of industry , coffeehouses were in fact crucibles of creativity , because of the way in which they facilitated the mixing of both people and ideas members of the royal society , england s pioneering scientific society , frequently retired to coffeehouses to extend their discussions scientists often conducted experiments and gave lectures in coffeehouses , and because admission cost just a penny \( the price of a single cup \) , coffeehouses were sometimes referred to as penny universities it was a coffeehouse argument among several fellow scientists that spurred isaac newton to write his principia mathematica , one of the foundational works of modern science coffeehouses were platforms for innovation in the world of business , too merchants used coffeehouses as meeting rooms , which gave rise to new companies and new business models a london coffeehouse called jonathan s , where merchants kept particular tables at which they would transact their business , turned into the london stock exchange edward lloyd s coffeehouse , a popular meeting place for ship captains , shipowners and traders , became the famous insurance market lloyd s and the economist adam smith wrote much of his masterpiece the wealth of nations in the british coffee house , a popular meeting place for scottish intellectuals , among whom he circulated early drafts of his book for discussion no doubt there was some timewasting going on in coffeehouses but their merits far outweighed their drawbacks they provided a lively social and intellectual environment , which gave rise to a stream of innovations that shaped the modern world it is no coincidence that coffee remains the traditional drink of collaboration and networking today now the spirit of the coffeehouse has been reborn in our socialmedia platforms they , too , are open to all comers , and allow people from different walks of life to meet , debate , and share information with friends and strangers alike , forging new connections and sparking new ideas such conversations may be entirely virtual , but they have enormous potential to bring about change in the real world although some bosses deride the use of social media in the workplace as social notworking , more farsighted companies are embracing enterprise social networks , essentially corporate versions of facebook , to encourage collaboration , discover hidden talents and knowledge among their employees , and reduce the use of email a , the consulting firm , found that the use of social networking within companies increased the productivity of knowledge workers by 20 to 25 percent the use of social media in education , meanwhile , is backed by studies showing that students learn more effectively when they interact with other learners , a pioneering computational biology project started from a single tweet , now involves collaborators around the world who meet via google hangouts who knows what other innovations are brewing in the internet s global coffeehouse \? there is always an adjustment period when new technologies appear during this transitional phase , which can take several years , technologies are often criticized for disrupting existing ways of doing things but the lesson of the coffeehouse is that modern fears about the dangers of social networking are overdone this kind of media , in fact , has a long history martin luther s use of pamphlets in the reformation casts new light on the role of social media in the arab spring , for example , and there are parallels between the gossipy poems that circulated in prerevolutionary france and the uses of microblogging in modern china as we grapple with the issues raised by new technologies , there is much we can learn from the past
lots of people have been referencing this democracy corps report on focusgroup meetings with republicans , and with good reason greenberg has basically provided a unified theory of the craziness that has enveloped american politics in the last few years what the report makes clear is that the current republican obsession with attacking programs that benefit americans in need , ranging from food stamps to obamacare , isn t about some philosophical commitment to small government , still less worries about incentive effects and implicit marginal tax rates it s about anxiety over a changing america the multiracial , multicultural society we re becoming and anger that democrats are taking their money and giving it to those people in other words , it s still race after all these years one irony here is that at this point it s the liberals who believe in america , while the conservatives don t i believe in our ability to change while retaining our essential nature i believe that today s immigrants will be incorporated into the fabric of our society , just as italian and jewish immigrants once regarded as fundamentally incompatible with american ways became white by the middle of the 20th century another irony is that the great rightwing fear that social insurance programs will in effect buy minority votes for democrats , leading to further change is becoming a selffulfilling prophecy the gop could have tried to reach out to immigrants , moderate its stances on obamacare , and stake out a position as the restrained , sensible party instead , it s alienating all the people it needs to win over , and quite possibly setting the stage for the very liberal dominance it fears meanwhile , a key takeaway for us wonks is that none of the ostensible debates we re having say , the debate over rising disability rolls can be taken at face value yes , we need to crunch the numbers , but in the end the other side doesn t care about the evidence
8 45 pm updated a federal judge on friday weakened the blow from apple s legal victory in a patent case against samsung , lopping more than 40 percent off the damages a jury awarded apple last year the ruling did not shift the case one of the most closely watched in the hightech industry in samsung s favor while apple has lost other skirmishes against samsung in courts around the world , the jury award in this case has been the biggest victory for either side so far even at a reduced level , these would be among the highest damages in a patent dispute the judge ordered a new trial to recalculate a portion of those damages , leaving open the possibility that some of them could be restored she also indicated that apple was entitled to additional damages for sales of samsung products that have occurred since the jury s decision last summer , which could further swell the amount apple is owed by samsung tech companies around the world are waging legal battles over patents as they compete for supremacy in the lucrative smartphone market apple and samsung are the most prominent combatants in that war the two companies divide most of the profits in the surging mobile phone market samsung has soared to the no 1 spot in the smartphone business in recent years , but apple says that it is , in part , because the company has swiped many of apple s ideas in her review of the jury s decisions , which originally awarded apple more than 1 billion for patent violations by samsung in its mobile products , judge lucy h koh of the united states district court in san jose , calif , knocked those damages down by 450 million , to 599 million the new trial will determine how much of the 450 million , if any , should be restored it will be years before the parties exhaust all of their litigation avenues and options , said alan m fisch , an intellectual property lawyer with fisch hoffman sigler in washington , who is not involved in the case still , some form of patent crosslicense between the two would not be an unsurprising final result none of judge koh s opinion changed the jury s finding that samsung violated a series of apple patents in its smartphone and tablet products but the judge took issue with how the jury calculated the damages apple was entitled to from the samsung devices named in the case , more than two dozen of them in all in her 27page opinion , judge koh said that the jury failed to follow her instructions in calculating damages for a certain class of patents , known as utility patents she also decided in samsung s favor in a dispute between the two parties over when apple notified samsung that it was infringing apple s intellectual property evidence of such notice dates are important because they help determine how hefty the damages are in a court case , once the party being notified is found guilty of infringement judge koh chided apple for using an expert in the case who used an aggressive notice date meaning , an early one to calculate damages the need for a new trial could have been avoided had apple chosen a more circumspect strategy or provided more evidence to allow the jury or the court to determine the appropriate award for a shorter notice period , she said in her ruling steve dowling , a spokesman for apple , declined to comment in a statement , adam yates , a samsung spokesman , said that the company was pleased with the judge s decision and that it intended to seek further review of the remaining award apple and samsung , meanwhile , continue to fight ferociously in the smartphone market , where samsung has steadily worked its way to the no 1 position over the last few years in the fourth quarter , samsung accounted for 29 percent of global smartphone shipments , while apple accounted for 218 percent , according to idc mark a lemley , a professor at stanford law school , called the judge s decision an extremely careful and thorough opinion on a very difficult and interrelated set of issues mr lemley predicted that samsung would eventually win some reduction in the original 1 billion award , but almost certainly less than the 450 million that judge koh reduced it by on friday we ll need a new trial to figure that out , said mr lemley , who has done legal work in the past for google , maker of the android operating system involved in the samsung case and others judge koh has encouraged both sides to appeal first that may clarify some questions , but it is unlikely to prevent a new trial , just delay it some
brad gilbert is not necessarily the chris berman of professional tennis he began experimenting with nicknames on the air seven or eight years ago , but his nicknames tend to be more off the cuff , more freewheeling , than preplanned he does not always have carte blanche in sharing them when he has tried , for instance , to get away with calling rafael nadal ralph during a broadcast , his colleague chris fowler has objected to the americanization chris gets so mad at me for calling him that , gilbert said he banned me from saying that , says i have to call him rafael or rafa out of respect so i need to come up with something better on the other hand , gilbert got away with calling vasek pospisil , a relatively unknown canadian , the popsicle one guy told me that he thought popsicle was idiotic , gilbert said \( for the record , pospisil is pronounced pospuhsil \) then i had other people tell me it was hilarious i 've never had a player tell me they did n't like something none of them are derogatory they 're fun in the beginning , gilbert a former tour player and coach of andre agassi and andy roddick and an author \( winning ugly \) used the nicknames mostly in the studio or in panel discussions because his courtside analysis was not conducive to it but when gilbert went on twitter in 2009 , he found the perfect forum for being playful his more than 57 , 000 followers on have become accustomed to his references to roger federer as fedfan his explanation it s clearly derived from the fact that his fans are the most hardcore on the planet they care so much about anything said about him , done on him , so i joined him and his fans at the hip his favorites include kerber baby , for angelique kerber the genius , for the nowretired marion bartoli , who has said her iq is 175 muzzard , for andy murray , which gilbert can explain only by citing murray s typically disheveled look jerzy boy , for the rising polish player jerzy janowicz agi rad , for janowicz s countrywoman agnieszka radwanska granola bars , for the spaniard marcel granollers sloane ranger , for the american sloane stephens kviddy , for petra kvitova sw , for serena williams \( he noted that sw19 is part of wimbledon s address \) and the missile , for the 22yearold canadian milos raonic , who defeated pospisil in the rogers cup semifinals the moral of gilbert s story when in doubt , go with the missile over a popsicle
paris france confirmed a second case of a new coronavirus belonging to the same family as sars on monday , saying a man who shared a hospital room with the first victim had been infected the announcement came a day after the world health organization announced that the new virus seemed capable of passing between humans , but only after prolonged contact the organization is carefully monitoring the virus , which was first identified in the middle east in september and has killed more than half of the 34 people believed to have been infected on sunday , an assistant directorgeneral at the world health organization , dr keiji fukuda , said there was no evidence so far that the virus was able to sustain generalized transmission in communities , easing fears of a pandemic dr fukuda spoke in saudi arabia , the site of the largest number of infections the different clusters seen in multiple countries , he said , seemed to increasingly support the hypothesis that when there is close contact , this novel coronavirus can transmit from person to person the cases in france are being watched closely because the transmission occurred in a shared hospital room hospital transmissions were a key factor a decade ago in the outbreak of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome which was concentrated in asia and caused hundreds of deaths in canada , officials reported about 440 probable or suspect cases in 2003 , with more than 40 deaths in toronto the second french case was confirmed in a 50yearold patient who shared a room from april 2729 with the first victim , a 65yearold man who had fallen ill after returning from a tour in dubai the first patient s condition was called critical and worrisome but stable , while the second s was said to have worsened sunday , requiring intensive care , said the health minister , marisol touraine both were moved from the hospital in valenciennes , in northern france , to a more specialized hospital in lille , where they are being kept in isolation health professionals are trying to determine how the infection spread dr beno t gu ry , director of the lille hospital s infectious disease unit , said the second case suggested that airborne transmission was possible the transmission chain is becoming clearer , he told bfmtv but tests on a doctor , a nurse and other health workers who treated the first patient in valenciennes have come back negative , as have tests on others who came into contact with him the authorities have contacted or checked the health of 124 people , including 39 french and belgians who traveled with him to the united arab emirates on a tour from april 917 none have indicated any sickness , french officials said tests are also under way for 38 people who were in contact with the second man the french suspect the virus might have jumped to humans from bats , since it is similar to a bat virus , but other animals are being looked at the transmission might have been indirect for instance , fruit could have been contaminated by animal droppings cases have been reported in britain and germany , but most of those with the virus had traveled to saudi arabia , other persian gulf nations , jordan or pakistan saudi arabia has said the country has had 24 confirmed cases since summer , with 15 deaths dr fukuda , of the world health organization , said , the care that is taken in hospitals , in terms of using respirators well , in terms of treating pneumonia , in terms of treating complications , in terms of providing support , these steps can get patients through this very severe illness lessons from the sars outbreak about how to prevent transmission are being used , with medical workers taking better care to protect themselves from any respiratory secretions , officials say pamphlets on the illness listing precautionary measures \( including washing hands frequently and avoiding animals \) will be handed out at french airports , especially to travelers visiting the arabian peninsula , ms touraine , the health minister , said doctors consider that there is no need for excessive worry , but once again we should be vigilant , she said
houston one of the biggest armoredcar companies in this sprawling texas city has a message for wouldbe robbers it is not worth the trouble , or your life in response to a series of armoredtruck robberies this year in the houston region , the company , , has taken the unusual step of talking publicly and talking tough , even for texas , about the lengths to which it will go to protect its cargo , its employees and the public we 're letting the bad guys know we 're going to defend ourselves , said robert hatchett , the senior manager for gardaworld s texas operations they can expect , in one way or another , to pay they 're going to pay for it with physical injury , harm , possible death they 're going to pay for it with prosecution , and they 're going to pay for it with restitution we 're not going to let it go harris county , which includes houston , has had 11 armoredcar robberies since january , roughly a third of the nationwide total this year the fbi had reports of two holdups of armored vehicles in new york city this year and none in the boston , chicago , dallas and los angeles areas all 11 robberies in the houston region occurred outside banks , checkcashing stores and other businesses as the guards were handling thousands of dollars in cash while walking to or from their trucks or servicing atm s the most recent came on friday morning , when a gunman drove off in an armored van on the university of houston campus and later abandoned the vehicle nearby the authorities did not say how much money was taken in years past , robbers would typically point guns at armoredcar crews and order them to drop the money bags this year , the culprits have been more aggressive , seemingly unafraid to pull the trigger some of these guys would pull up in a car or they 'd approach on foot , and they just would immediately start shooting , with no verbal commands to drop the bag' or give me the money' or anything , said special agent mark michalek , the supervisor of the fbi s bank robbery task force in houston you 've got cars going back and forth , people , women and children there s just this indiscriminate immediate firing gardaworld has been targeted four times this year two guards were shot by robbers in january and october , and none were harmed in two other attacks more than 150 , 000 was stolen in one gardaworld heist in july it was a rare score robbers succeeded in escaping with cash in 4 of the 11 robberies this year but the company guards have been shooting back one shot and killed a gunman who tried to enter an armored truck outside a movie multiplex in january another who was shot near a drivethrough atm in october fired several rounds , striking the getaway vehicle , while his partner shot a suspect in the shoulder yet another guard protected a money bag by dropping to the ground and opening fire at a group of armed robbers many gardaworld guards are former marines or police officers i really do n't understand the rationale for approaching a guy that i know is armed , i know is trained and i know will defend himself and shoot back , if not shoot first , said mr hatchett , one of two company executives who have been speaking to the news media even if you get the bag , typically it s a shortlived celebration gardaworld said it had been particularly outspoken about the houston problem because of the frequency and violence of the robberies armoredtruck companies typically refrain from commenting publicly after a robbery , leaving the police to take the lead other companies that were robbed in houston have not granted interviews in addition to issuing the public threat to wouldbe robbers , gardaworld has increased its security , surveillance and tacticalweapons training added a third person to the usual twoperson crews in some trucks and put shotgunwielding guards in socalled chase vehicles to follow the trucks on their routes or monitor their stops the company has also started a public awareness campaign intended to tear down the stereotype of lackluster rentacops and to reassure its clients and the public , who spent nearly 30 years in the industry and now runs a security consulting business in south carolina , was skeptical of the effectiveness of gardaworld s campaign it s unusual that a carrier would have a conversation with the press following a robbery , mr mcguffey said if that is their style , to try to talk to the bad guys if you will , that s not going to be as effective as working in collaboration with law enforcement in a proactive fashion gardaworld said it had been working closely with local and federal authorities , and had gotten a positive response from many in the industry to its campaign , which it said had focused attention on the robberies and helped put a spotlight on a business that is rarely in one the authorities have arrested three men so far , charging them with aggravated robbery after the shooting near the drivethrough atm in october but investigators said they were pursuing other leads and other suspects they said they believed that at least six of the robberies were carried out by a loosely organized group , adding that there was nothing particular about the region s armoredtransport companies or its criminal element that would explain the increase in robberies it s just merely that these particular people reside in houston , said mr michalek of the fbi the group suspected in some of the robberies apparently began to focus on armored cars in an impromptu fashion , picking one out in july while at a parking lot looking for potential robbery victims this was not some wellorganized plan , mr michalek said they made the decision right there on the spot to give it a try armoredcar thieves have a history of impulsiveness , and of overlapping , in houston in 1997 , two gunmen held up a guard inside a building that happened to house a local organizedcrime task force , which played a part in breaking up the heist and a few days after the 150 , 000 was stolen in july , a federal judge in houston struck a note of warning by sentencing , 24 , to nearly 15 years in prison for his role in robbing and attempting to rob two armored trucks in 2009 on a recent afternoon at the mall , mr hatchett allowed a reporter to observe a typical gardaworld stop the company , based in montreal , handles about 5 billion in currency daily in north america mr hatchett stood across the street as the truck pulled up , on alert for anything suspicious i 've noticed there s three people here , four people here , seven people here , he said you cannot take any stop for granted a 27year guard on the passenger side exited slowly , checking the pedestrians around him and twisting the strap of a black bag tightly around his left hand he kept his right hand free in case he needed to pull a gun from the holster on his right hip no shoppers interacted with him as he entered the mall a relief to mr hatchett , who would like to see the public stop holding open doors for guards because of security concerns within minutes , the guard was back in the truck , without incident
guerrilla filmmakers often face crackdowns by the powers that be , and zachary maxwell is no exception his hiddencamera documentary was almost derailed last year when he was caught filming without permission by a fearsome enforcer the lunchroom monitor in his school cafeteria she sent me to my teacher , and my teacher told me to delete everything , said zachary , who is now 11 zachary pretended to delete the day s shots after that lapse in production security , he said , i fired my lookouts what his teacher didn t know , though , was that zachary had six months of footage shot surreptitiously in the cafeteria , forming the spine of his 20minute movie yuck a 4th grader s short documentary about school lunch next month , the film \( watch trailer \) , which has been playing the festival circuit , will be screened at the manhattan film festival  like many things in the life of a fourth grader , zachary s movie started as a dispute with his parents he told them that he wanted to start packing his own lunch , but they were skeptical lunch is free at his school , ps 130 hernando de soto in little italy , and his parents liked the look of the department of education s online menus , which describe delicious meals , full of whole grains and fresh vegetables , some even designed by celebrity chefs i told them that s not what they were actually serving me , zachary said but i don t think they believed me so he smuggled in a camera in his sweatshirt pocket the next day and filmed lunch when i came back home and showed them the footage , they were like , ugh ! he said soon , zachary and his father , a lawyer and video hobbyist , were cutting together the footage he brought home every day \( in the film , zachary goes by the name zachary maxwell , though maxwell is his middle name his family asked that their last name be withheld because of zachary s age \) in the film , zachary , who is not above cheesy costumes and goofy special effects , makes a point that is under the radar of most conversations about the quality of school lunches that despite the education department s efforts to improve nutrition , there is a disconnect between the wholesome meals described on school menus and the soggy , deepfried nuggets frequently dished up in the lunchrooms the film offers no shortage of examples on a day advertising cheesy lasagna rolls with tomato basil sauce , roasted spinach with garlic and herbs , for instance , zachary is handed a plasticwrapped grilled cheese sandwich on an otherwise bare plastic foam tray a pasta party is described as zesty italian meatballs with tomatobasil sauce , whole grain pasta , parmesan cheese and roasted capri vegetables meatballs and pasta show up on the tray , if none too zestylooking , but the vegetables are nowhere to be seen salads devised by the food network chefs rachael ray and ellie krieger are similarly plagued by missing ingredients on the day ms ray s yumo ! marinated tomato salad is listed , zachary is served a slice of pizza accompanied by a wisp of lettuce ms krieger s tricolor salad is a noshow on one day it is promised , and on another , it lacks its cauliflower , broccoli and red peppers the shreds of lettuce and slice of cucumber could still be described as tricolor , zachary points out , if you count green , light green and brown indeed , among the 75 lunches that zachary recorded chosen randomly , he swears he found the menus to be substantially accurate , with two or more of the advertised menu items served , only 51 percent of the time the menus were totally accurate , with all of the advertised items served , only 16 percent of the time and by zachary s count , 28 percent of the lunches he recorded were built around either pizza or cheese sticks a spokeswoman for the education department , marge feinberg , said in an email that vegetables and fruit were served daily and she suggested that zachary must have chosen not to take the vegetables served in his cafeteria it would not be the first time a youngster would find a way to get out of eating vegetables , she wrote zachary responded that he always took every item he was offered until this past september , ms feinberg said , schools did have some freedom to deviate from the systemwide lunch menus new federal regulations for the current school year set stricter guidelines for what elements need to be on each child s plate on monday , zachary thought he was in trouble again when he was sent to the principal s office and found two men in black suits waiting for him they turned out to be representatives from the education department s office of school food , he said , who complimented him on his movie , asked for feedback on some new menu choices , and took him on a tour of the cafeteria kitchen there , zachary met one of his school s cooks , and got some insight into her thinking she wants us to be happy , he reported so she cooks what she thinks the kids will like then he sat down for lunch with the officials the adults ate the cafeteria lunch of chicken nuggets , carrots and salad zachary had pork and vegetable dumplings brought from home this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
dinosaur , go back to your cave ! the british conductor sian edwards said over the phone with a laugh , her eyes audibly rolling i had asked for her response to the bizarrely retrograde comments a few respected male musicians had made recently about female conductors in august , the young russian maestro vasily petrenko that players , presumably men , react better when they have a man in front of them he added , a sweet girl on the podium can make one s thoughts drift toward something else not long after , controversy erupted over comments that bruno mantovani , a composer and the director of the paris conservatory of music and dance sometimes women are discouraged by the very physical aspect , he said conducting , taking a plane , taking another plane , conducting again then the new yorker critic alex ross of an interview that the venerable russian conductor yuri temirkanov , one of mr petrenko s mentors , gave last year the essence of the conductor s profession is strength , he said the essence of a woman is weakness the ridiculousness of this flurry , in 2013 , has rightfully drawn attention to the broader situation faced by women in the field female conductors no longer attract openmouthed attention among music lovers or the news media , yet they remain far from being fairly represented according to the league of american orchestras , of the 103 ensembles with the biggest budgets , 12 have female conductors just one of the toptier 22 is led by a woman last monday , the british conductor jane glover made her metropolitan opera debut , in the hardly enviable assignment of the holiday abridgment over an hour of the score is cut of mozart s the magic flute she is only the third female conductor in the company s 133year history but the met should not take the blame alone women have also been barely present on the podiums of san francisco opera , the lyric opera of chicago , houston grand opera and the other major american houses i wish i could tell you that our record was better , the spokeswoman for santa fe opera wrote me orchestras have perhaps predictably had better numbers there are more of them , and the pool of experienced talent is larger but more than half of the 20 top ones i canvassed had no female guest leaders on their main series this season or last only five hosted women both seasons just two female conductors appear on the schedules of new york s major instrumental concert programs this season , that s absurd the pace is agonizing , but things are improving recent conversations i 've had with conductors at various stages of their careers , as well as administrators , artist managers and teachers , suggest that what s preventing equity is now less overt sexism , though those comments by the russian maestros and mr mantovani have made clear it still exists , than simply time the trickle of a younger , more heterogeneous generation as it permeates the field and incremental societal shifts in attitudes about the face of leadership i'm aware i do n't really look like your standard conductor , said gemma new , 26 , the associate conductor of the new jersey symphony orchestra i look very young many people ask what college i'm in but once they start to talk to me and see my work , i think their ideas are changed in 2007 , marin alsop , probably the most prominent female conductor in the world , became the music director of the baltimore symphony orchestra , the first time a woman had led a major ensemble \( her predecessor was none other than mr temirkanov \) looking back on her career in a phone interview from brazil , where she is also music director of the s o paulo symphony orchestra , she said when i started , i kind of naturally assumed that there would be more and more women entering the field but it was strange because the numbers did n't really change 10 years down the line , 20 years down the line , even 30 the numbers had n't increased in the way i assumed they would in certain ways , we are still living in the old world the enterprising antonia brico was supposed to have made her met debut back in the 1930s but the popular baritone john charles thomas declared that he would never perform under a woman s baton , and that was that the conductor anne manson said , there was one conversation my agent had with one of the opera companies in britain and they said , we could never put a woman in front of this orchestra' i believe the quote was she 'd get eaten alive' another american conductor , laura jackson , said that in the early 1990s , she was told by a female official of an orchestra in new england that we do n't do women conductors here it took until 1976 , decades after brico was denied , for the barrier to be broken at the met by the formidable stage director , impresario and conductor sarah caldwell , and she was tapped only at the insistence of a star singer , beverly sills simone young followed in 1996 the gap after ms glover will be considerably narrower the met recently announced that the finnish conductor susanna malkki will make her debut in the 201617 season , leading the company s premiere of kaija saariaho s l'amour de loin , the second opera by a female composer in the met s history ms malkki , whose career has accelerated in recent years , will make her new york philharmonic debut next season in 2009 , she first led the boston symphony orchestra as a lastminute replacement for who else \? mr temirkanov but peter gelb , the met s general manager , said that no other women had been engaged for the immediate future , including his wife , kerilynn wilson , who was recently named the music director of the national slovenian philharmonic my wife is a wonderful conductor , he said with a laugh , but my marriage has prevented me from engaging her nearly everyone i spoke to said that the problem was that the field of experienced women was not yet deep enough for it really to percolate into the top orchestras and opera companies , making the training grounds for young artists the next battleground while ms manson said that she had not long ago participated in a top summer music program for young musicians and had n't seen a single other female conductor , the numbers in such programs and conservatories are slowly rising hugh wolff , the director of the conducting program at the new england conservatory , said that seven out of 51 applicants to the most recent class at the school were women when he evaluated applications for the american academy of conducting at aspen , a prestigious summer program , in 2011 , he reviewed 46 applicants , and eight were women still far from parity , but an improvement on the current percentages among the toptier orchestras deborah borda , the president of the los angeles philharmonic , said things have really changed radically in the old days , even 10 years ago , you might have one woman who would come for an assistant conductor audition , and now it might be half when ms jackson became music director of the reno philharmonic in nevada in 2009 , there were three women among the five finalists for the position but the industry still needs to do more to encourage women who study conducting to remain with the daunting career a of the magazine mother jones said that the percentage of women among those completing doctoral degrees in conducting still significantly exceeded their presence in the field as practitioners the young lithuanian conductor mirga grazinytetyla , recently a dudamel conducting fellow at the los angeles philharmonic , told me that more of the male students she studied alongside in austria had ended up serious conductors than the women even for those able to make the career work , there have been the complications of how , exactly , to conduct when the physical models have been male when men make forceful gestures , they come off as being masculine and virile , ms alsop said sometimes when women do that , they 're interpreted as being pushy and bossy i 've really worked hard at trying to , sort of , degenderize my gestures it helps that the image of conducting has broadened in recent decades from the imposing , patriarchal model of toscanini and von karajan men like simon rattle have flourished with easiergoing personalities and an emphasis on community building , a landscape that makes the idea of women on the podium seem more natural to audiences , institutions and donors he showed that you could be informal , sian edwards said of mr rattle you did n't have to have this authoritarian , rather grand image that had been peddled by deutsche grammophon in september , ms alsop became the first woman to conduct the bbc s last night of the proms , a littleknown event in america but a widely televised blockbuster in europe the concert s success not least in the adroit way she used to dedicate the evening to progress led to chatter that she might yet be in line for a starrier position than baltimore or s o paulo nobody s yet broken completely through the glass ceiling , but marin s going to do it , ms glover said in an interview at the met she s going to get one of the big orchestras before she stops there s no question of that on which side of the atlantic , i'm not sure ms alsop , insisting that she was not driven by the need to attain any particular level in the field , said , it s not that i would n't want to see in my lifetime someone someone female lead the quote , unquote big five orchestras , referring to the ensembles of boston , new york , cleveland , philadelphia and chicago if it s me , great if it s someone else , fantastic how long will it take to achieve fairness \? decades ago , blind auditions swiftly equalized the gender makeup of orchestra players \( they did much less to address racial inequality \) but you ca n't have blind auditions for conductors ms edwards , who recently became head of conducting at the royal academy of music in england , predicted that evenly divided classes would emerge in conservatories over the next 20 or 30 years when ms alsop received a macarthur grant in 2005 , she gave the money toward the endowment of the for female conductors , which she had founded in 2002 \( this year s winner , karina canellakis , was just named assistant conductor of the dallas symphony orchestra \) ms edwards is participating in at morley college , a popular continuingeducation center in london , aimed at encouraging teenage girls studying music to learn about , and try conducting all we can do , other than wait and hope that certain men keep their mouths shut , is foster opportunities like these for young women and put pressure on orchestras and opera companies to push further toward gender equity musicians , too , should demand the chance to play under women as much as possible and if major donors made a point of the issue in their meetings with administrators , i suspect that the numbers would really start rising the processes are slow , ms edwards said but they are there and they are moving
long before he started filling up manchester united s trophy cases and long before he became a household name in much of the world , if not necessarily the united states , alex ferguson was doing remarkable things as the soccer coach of the modest team st mirren in scotland he took over for that alsoran club in 1974 , and in 1977 he led it to a title in the first division , one rung below the top league not bad in 1978 , he moved to aberdeen , a wellrespected scottish club but hardly the match of celtic and rangers , the perennial powers still , in 1983 he achieved the remarkable , leading aberdeen to a european title the cup winners' cup over the spanish powerhouse real madrid in all , he helped aberdeen to three scottish league titles that alone would make for a distinguished coaching career but what he went on to do in nearly 27 years at the helm of mighty manchester united would seem to make him a candidate for the title of greatest coach , or manager , in history not only in soccer , but in any sport on any continent in the united states , of course , many would point to phil jackson , with his 11 nba titles with the chicago bulls and the los angeles lakers or they might single out joe mccarthy and casey stengel , who each won seven world series as the manager of the yankees or they might even pick connie mack , who amazingly managed the philadelphia athletics for 50 seasons in a jacket and tie , no less many , no doubt , would cite john wooden , who won 10 ncaa men s basketball titles at ucla and presided over an 88game winning streak , or pat summitt , who won eight women s titles at tennessee hockey advocates have scotty bowman , who won nine stanley cups as coach of the montreal canadiens , the pittsburgh penguins and the detroit red wings , and viktor tikhonov , who helped turn the soviet national team into the most dominant group of players in the world then there was the fearsome vince lombardi , who won five nfl titles , including the sport s first two super bowls , in a sevenyear stretch with the packers of little green bay , wis but there is a reasonable argument to be made that ferguson outdid them all , and did so in the world s most popular sport at manchester united , ferguson inherited a team with a fine history but one that had not won a title in two decades he proceeded to produce 13 league championships the most recent coming this spring along with five fa cups , an english soccer tournament that is more than 140 years old he also won two titles in the champions league , a tournament for the best in all of europe in 1999 , manchester united became the first english team to capture all three of those prestigious titles in the same year the same year , ferguson was knighted for his contributions to soccer the champions league final that year was the stuff of dreams in itself the secondhalf substitutes teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer scored in the final minutes to erase bayern munich s 10 lead brilliant , grouchy , dictatorial and blunt , ferguson , who on wednesday announced his retirement , could nourish genius in a teenager and coax greatness from a graying veteran he was not perceived to be an innovator when it came to soccer strategy , but he was brilliant at adapting to the game s changing trends , including the rise in players' salaries and the influx of talent in england from elsewhere in europe he made superstars out of players like david beckham , and when the time came , he sent them on their way to another team , usually at just the right time he tolerated no voice but his own , as players quickly learned , and referees , opposing coaches and reporters were well aware of the force of his personality and his ability to intimidate ferguson used it all , combined with a love of soccer , an insatiable desire for victory and great staying power maybe , in some sport , there was someone better , but that seems unlikely then again , you can explore this notion all day , all night , all year , or in the comments below the names that emerge might surprise you as the following list makes clear , there are no rigid guidelines when it comes to judging who might be the best coach ever it does n't have to be someone who presided over a major team as alex ferguson did or even someone who always followed the rules it does n't , in fact , even have to be someone who actually existed the greatest coach of the 20th century performed his job so well , he made himself obsolete jack grout , the first and only instructor of jack nicklaus , believed that selfreliance was the key to golfers' reaching their fullest potential it worked for nicklaus , who won 18 major championships and is widely considered the greatest golfer in history unlike today s instructors , grout never showed up on the practice range with a video camera bag slung over his shoulder he would have shuddered at the thought of becoming a reality television personality grout s face never graced a practice range nicklaus said he never set foot on the practice tee when they got together for practice , grout taught nicklaus how to finetune his game , and when the tournaments rolled around , he stepped back into the shadows far from trading on nicklaus s fame , grout hardly acknowledged his part in it unlike today s coaches , he never would have earned his own endorsement deals , unless it was for witeout in the galaxy of coaches , grout was the pistol star , the brightest star in the milky way but totally obscured by dust clouds he is selftaught in his chosen sport he guided two athletes from obscurity to total domination who has had more sheer influence as a coach than richard williams , father of serena and venus \? williams took two africanamerican girls from compton , calif , and trained them to rule the mostly white sport of tennis \( he is , like all great coaches , a master planner he is said to have decided his girls would be tennis champions before venus was born \) williams did n't know anything about tennis , but he drilled serena and venus in the art of being rough and tough enough to beat all the kids who learned how to play on fancy courts at the beverly hills country club he helped mold two athletes with not only dazzling skill , but incredible longevity venus turned pro at 14 and is now 32 , and serena , at 31 , is ranked no 1 in the world and let s not forget his crowning achievement training two athletes who have made their sport more fun and more watchable those muscles those outfits ! than anyone else at age 25 , bob ladouceur took over as the coach of the de la salle high school football team in concord , calif de la salle , a small catholic school in the bay area suburbs , had never had a winning season , and ladouceur had never been a head coach from 1979 to 2012 , ladouceur rarely lost his spartans teams went 399253 , including a record winning streak of 151 games a typical de la salle victory would be running up a sixtouchdown lead in the first half and then cruising in the second half the dominance was credited to his superb coaching , rather than superior personnel , with maurice jonesdrew , one of the few nfl stars the school produced , often singing his former coach s praises that ladouceur accomplished the turnaround at all was impressive , but he seemed unwilling to rest until his school was considered a heavyweight like the more established teams in texas and louisiana from 2000 to 2003 , ladouceur achieved just that , with de la salle being declared the usa today national champion in four consecutive seasons he retired in january at 58 , never having coached another team before alex ferguson is awarded the title of greatest coach in sports history , it should be noted he was not even the best coach to retire wednesday that distinction belongs to larry kehres , the almost comically successful football coach at division iii mount union in ohio , who is leaving after 27 seasons and only 24 losses under kehres , the purple raiders won 332 games and 11 national championships and went undefeated in the regular season 21 times , including the last seven years his 929 winning percentage is the best ever , far outdistancing legendary figures like knute rockne and bear bryant yet even kehres must bow down before the career of john gagliardi , the unconventional former coach at division iii st john s in minnesota before retiring last year , gagliardi won more games \( 489 \) and coached more seasons \( 64 \) than anyone else in college football , capturing two ncaa national championships along the way and he did it all by winning with nos no tackling in practice , no practices longer than 90 minutes and no calling him coach to his players , he was simply john are you paying attention , mike rice \? we do n't have no mission statements , no big philosophy , gagliardi told the new york times in 2009 we just do it and gagliardi did it better than anyone else nowhere in the rules of this exercise does it say that the coach has to be a real person eric taylor of dillon , tex , the high school football coach played by kyle chandler on the tv show friday night lights , descended from a real person gary gaines , the coach at permian high in odessa , tex , was a main character in the buzz bissinger book that spawned a movie and the tv series but coach taylor was a madefortv character through and through a stalwart husband and a befuddled father of two girls a moral man , an inspiring halftime speaker , a tough but compassionate father figure to many players who needed one an expert at turning a cow pasture into a football field able to express frustration through glares or tousled hair taylor was a winner , too known for developing quarterbacks , taylor reached the state final twice at dillon , winning once after he took over the downtrodden football program at east dillon high , he led it to a state title within two years but taylor was at his best when his players were at their lowest when street was paralyzed when saracen spun out of control when smash blew out his knee when vince got distracted by college recruiting when riggins was , well , riggins none of those sentences will mean anything to you if you were n't a fan of the show but if you were , clear eyes , full hearts , ca n't lose is code for eric taylor being television s greatest coach lots of coaches can motivate players lots can develop strategies and outthink opponents but which can orchestrate a doping program to perfection and help keep it secret for more than a decade \? nobody , antidoping officials say , but johan bruyneel , the sharp and masterfully sneaky manager for lance armstrong s cycling squads before teaming up with armstrong , bruyneel s most memorable accomplishment in cycling was falling off the side of a mountain in the 1996 tour de france \( he also won a tour stage in 1993 , but it was n't nearly as dramatic \) bruyneel convinced armstrong that he could win the tour , even though armstrong had never finished better than 36th in the race he then became the brains of armstrong s teams , ensuring that its tour riders doped so they could help armstrong win the tour a record seven times , antidoping officials say armstrong is serving a lifetime ban from olympic sports for doping , and bruyneel also faces a lifelong ban but the bold plan was brilliant while it lasted in the late 50s i got to observe two great college coaches at hofstra both were paradoxes the taciturn produced flamboyant football and lacrosse offenses , while the boisterous exerted tight control over his basketball offense and both won at a who failed courses i was a student publicist and saw them up close myers was \( some injured \) in 1956 but won 7 of 10 games , and in 1959 hofstra was 90 in a time of limited substitution , he used wide receivers and surprise plays , and there were rumors his diagrams were used by pro coaches in the spring , myers mixed lacrosse players and athletes out of gym class , and competed with top10 schools van breda kolff was a former knick who drew technical fouls but benched anybody who deviated from the game plan in 195960 hofstra was 231 , losing on later , van breda kolff coached bill bradley and wilt chamberlain i 've admired many coaches and managers but would match howdy and butch against anybody scotty bowman , winner of five stanley cups with montreal , one with pittsburgh and three with detroit nine in all as a coach , a record and the winner of more regularseason and playoff games than anyone else in the history of the nhl , is quite possibly the greatest coach in any sport his teams reached the championship round 13 times in his 30year nhl career , and now , at 79 and in semiretirement , he consults for the chicago blackhawks , another team that won a stanley cup while associated with him oh sure , i know about alex ferguson my parents were born in scotland , bowman said over the phone on thursday , and he ticked off ferguson s accomplishments with scotland , aberdeen and manchester united like ferguson , bowman went out on top , winning the cup with the red wings in 2002 all of a sudden it hits you it s time to move on , bowman said of his last year behind the bench any advice for ferguson \? do the things that you like spend more time with your family and stay involved with the game
when barack and michelle obamawere married in chicago two decades ago , santita jackson , a daughter of the revjesse l jackson , sang at their wedding when mr obama ran for his first national office , he made sure he was not stepping on the ambitions of her brother , jesse l jackson jr , who later became a cochairman of his 2008 presidential campaign now the younger mr jackson , 47 , who served 17 years as a congressman representing his hometown , is most likely headed to prison for , trailed by a string of problems from an extramarital affair to mental illness although the fates of mr jackson and mr obama could not be more different , their stories , and those of their families , are bound together the rise of the current leading black political family in the united states is inextricable from the unraveling of an older one , with the two tangled in shifting alliances , sudden reversals of fortune and splits decades ago in chicago , mr jackson was seen as a far more promising figure than his friend mr obama one the heir to a legend , the other an outsider seeking to surpass the father he barely knew if mr jackson had decided to run for the united states senate in 2004 , mr obama most likely would not be president that year and again in 2008 , mr obama , seeking to bolster his credibility with africanamericans , enlisted the younger mr jackson for crucial help but along the way , the jackson father and son helped define what the future president did not want to become a black politician mired in the old urbanethnic mold a leader tainted by personal transgressions or a dysfunctional family mr obama , who saw the jacksons' problems up close , increasingly kept his distance from both men now , the obama administration s department of justice is poised to send the younger mr jackson who came under investigation after he pursued but failed to obtain mr obama s old senate seat to prison the beginning of jackson s star being tarnished was the beginning of obama s star rising , eric adelstein , a chicago political consultant , said in an interview you can plot it on a chart as obama ascends , jackson descends decades before mrs obama worked on her husband s presidential campaigns , she saw the process through the races of the elder mr jackson her father , fraser robinson , was a city water worker and precinct captain , but ms jackson , the oldest daughter of the most important black politician in the country , was one of her closest friends michelle used to come to the house all the time , mr jackson recalled in an interview \( the white house declined to comment for this article \) the man she eventually married was a stranger to chicago , who had to pound the sidewalks of the south side to collect signatures to run for a lowly state senate seat in 1996 mr obama would regularly attend weekly meetings of mr jackson s rainbow push organization , and the jacksons tried to be helpful with advice and opportunities for example , giving him chances to get his speaking legs , said hermene d hartman , publisher of an africanamerican newspaper , n 'digo i do n't think the jacksons were threatened particularly , said don rose , a longtime political consultant they had no reason to be jesse jackson jr was already a sensation at just 30 , he had defeated more established politicians for a congressional seat his father proudly raised money and campaigned on his behalf , at one point distributing buttons that read a new generation some in chicago saw strengths in mr jackson that they had not seen in his father crossover appeal to white voters , expertise in both politics and policy , an ability to move between the civil rights movement and elite institutions like st albans , his prestigious washington school soon , people magazine named him sexiest politician if i wanted to be an elected official , that s not enough , mr jackson told , speaking of the expectations he faced the jobs he talked about pursuing were mayor of chicago or speaker of the house , but his father and others went even further , mr jackson noted one day , son , you may be president it is not clear why he did not run in 2004 for a senate seat that some thought could be his and gave mr obama the goahead instead some say mr jackson had set his sights on other offices others say he did not think mr obama , who had been trounced in a 2000 congressional race , had a chance of winning he gave mr obama a muchneeded endorsement in the democratic primary jesse had him on 100 billboards , said the elder mr jackson , when mr obama s name was hardly known santita jackson was godmother to young malia obama still , mr obama was wary of being identified with the older generation of chicago politics , particularly the elder mr jackson , whose fiery civil rights rhetoric often alienated whites and whose reputation was sullied by a messy personal life , including fathering a child out of wedlock campaign aides wanted the obamas alone on stage the night he won the primary , two of them said later , without other local politicians especially the elder mr jackson , who had a habit of making a beeline for the victor at the moment cameras clicked a few months later , when the stillobscure candidate became the toast of the democratic party after a soaring speech at the presidential nominating convention for senatorjohn kerry , several people noticed that both jackson men seemed disoriented by the turn of events they were the biggest thing in africanamerican politics , said jim cauley , mr obama s campaign manager in the senate race , and in one night , they got eclipsed the younger mr jackson felt that mr obama was sort of elevated to his status without having to pay his dues or do grunt work , saidalexi giannoulias , a former state treasurer which was simply untrue he worked incredibly hard as a candidate and he did so all across the state , which is something junior never had to do but i think in his mind , somewhere deep down , junior felt that way after that , the younger mr jackson appeared to grow even more determined he transformed himself with weight loss surgery and considered a run against mayorrichard m daleyin 2007 in the 2008 presidential race , both jackson men endorsed mr obama but though the congressman served as a cochairman of his campaign , his father openly seethed at mr obama , criticizing him at turns for acting like he s white , not appearing at a civil rights anniversary and talking down to black people he made a crass anatomical remark about mr obama , unaware that he was speaking on a live microphone his son issued a rebuke he should keep hope alive , he said , and any personal attacks and insults to himself the elder mr jackson s influence was already on the wane , but the hostility he showed toward mr obama , who was winning the devotion of black voters , sealed his loss of prestige mr obama s attitude toward the older man was i'm bigger than this , so i'm just going to ignore you , said one fundraiser as the race progressed , the outbursts from mr jackson drew the candidate closer to the reval sharpton , the civil rights activist he ended up fighting the people he helped make way for , mr sharpton said of the senior mr jackson mr obama s presidential election victory seemed to create the opportunity the younger mr jackson had been seeking he lobbied hard for mr obama s senate seat , petitioning govrod r blagojevich , who would make the appointment seeking letters of support from opinion makers publicizing a poll his camp had commissioned instead , his life fell apart mr blagojevich was arrested , charged with trying to solicit money or a job in exchange for the seat , and a friend of mr jackson s was accused of offering large campaign contributions if mr jackson was picked mr jackson denied knowing about the offer , but a house ethics committee investigation was opened in 2010 , revelations emerged of an extramarital relationship by 2011 , few even seemed to think of him as a contender for the job of mayor of chicago after mr daley announced plans to retire and by june 2012 , he disappeared from congress , his office eventually announcing that he was being treated for bipolar disorder , and to a felony fraud count for spending campaign funds on living expenses and collectibles through a spokesman , mr jackson declined to be interviewed for this article , but issued a statement apologizing to those he let down since becoming president , mr obama has had dwindling contact with the jacksons the son was under investigation and the father was persona non grata , absent from civil rights meetings mr obama has held , according to participants , despite the role mr jackson played in the movement and in helping to clear the way for a black man to become president by the time he came along , he was going across a bridge that came from the rocks of the walls that we knocked down , mr jackson said in the interview he had just returned from washington , where he appeared in court with his son , and he sounded weary but he discussed the president with none of his old acrimony mr obama , he said , was a rare genius he seemed to savor one rare moment he has shared with mr obama in recent years , a quick staged photograph after the dedication of the memorial to the rev drmartin luther king jrin 2011 the jacksons waited with other civil rights leaders for their shot with the obamas , but mr jackson described the encounter as a reunion for the two families , who spent a few minutes exchanging pleasantries and memories he said he spends little time worrying about his standing at the white house or invitations there , adding , i give him room to govern

philadelphia a pennsylvania judge on tuesday threw out three of seven murder charges against a philadelphia doctor charged with killing viable fetuses while performing abortions the judge , jeffrey p minehart of common pleas court here , granted motions for acquittal on the charges against the physician , dr kermit gosnell , who ran the women s medical center , a west philadelphia abortion clinic judge minehart also granted a motion for acquittal in five charges of abuse of corpse against dr gosnell , who according to prosecutors killed fetuses that were alive after they were aborted by plunging scissors into their necks dr gosnell , 72 , was also acquitted on one charge of infanticide the judge gave no reason for his decision , which came on the fifth week of and preceded the start of defense arguments , which had been scheduled to begin on tuesday afternoon but are now expected to start wednesday the trial has become a cause c l bre for some antiabortion activists , a few of whom were seated in the courtroom on tuesday before the judge announced his decision , an officer of the court instructed those present to remain silent , youth outreach director for priests for life , an antiabortion group , said he was obviously frustrated with the judge s decision mr kemper , who traveled from ohio to attend the trial , said he was convinced that dr gosnell had deliberately killed live fetuses it makes no sense to me that he could snip the back of the neck of a baby that was not alive , mr kemper said during a break in the hearing dr gosnell still faces four charges of firstdegree murder and one of thirddegree murder in connection with the death of a patient at the women s medical center if found guilty on the remaining charges , he could face the death penalty eight workers at dr gosnell s clinic have pleaded guilty in the case , including three to thirddegree murder dr gosnell s lawyer , jack j mcmahon , argued that none of the seven fetuses his client is accused of killing were alive when they were removed from their mothers because they had been given a drug that killed them in utero therefore , there was no validity to the charges of murder , infanticide or abuse of corpse , he said there is not one piece of real scientific evidence that any one was born alive , mr mcmahon told the judge , who heard the acquittal motions without a jury present mr mcmahon dismissed prosecutors' arguments that an arm movement by one of the fetuses , known as baby c , indicated that it was alive he said that the movement was one spasm but that the fetus was not breathing baby c had been one of the three fetuses for which the judge dismissed the murder charge but on wednesday morning the judge said the dismissal of the charge related to baby c was done mistakenly , as a result of a clerical error that charge was reinstated , and the charge related to baby f was dismissed in addition , the judge acquitted dr gosnell of killing baby b , which mr mcmahon said was not breathing when it was removed from its mother , and of the death of baby g , whose age and viability were both unknown , according to the lawyer but edward cameron , an assistant district attorney , said that baby c responded and pulled back when touched by medical staff that s voluntary movement , and that s all the law requires , mr cameron said that baby was alive mr cameron also opposed the motion to acquit dr gosnell on the abuse of corpse count , which stemmed from the jars of the severed feet of fetuses that were discovered in the clinic when it was raided by law enforcement officers in february 2011 aborted fetuses should be treated as human beings , mr cameron argued when you have got jars of feet that this man was keeping on the shelves of his office , that would offend anybody , he said when the fetuses leave the mother , they are due the respect of any human being mr cameron also highlighted the case of baby d , which he said was 10 to 15 inches long and had a head as big as a pancake it was moving when it was delivered into a toilet , mr cameron said
london the sudden announcement on wednesday that alex ferguson will retire in two weeks' time after almost 27 years as manager of manchester united has shaken its shares on the new york stock exchange , to say nothing of its effect around the sporting world the club s share price fell as much as 35 percent in early trading in new york within hours of the statement from britain though it recovered some and was down 144 percent in afternoon trading the decline reflects how much of a business sports has become , and how much ferguson has meant to united s dominant position in the global game 'it is the right time , '' he said wednesday in manchester at 71 , he faces a hip operation in the coming weeks , and he has served his time with a club where he has built , and ruthlessly rebuilt , the playing squad five times to sustain its leading position atop the english premier league and remain competitive in europe but it is beyond the playing field where the club has grown forbes magazine rates united and the spanish giant real madrid as the two clubs whose 3 billion valuation makes them by far the greatest sporting franchises in the world follow the market in new york , stop off in macao where the manchester united sports store fills acres , witness the popularity of the team in shanghai or singapore , and you get some idea of the economic power larger than some nations' entire gross domestic products of this gargantuan enterprise 'manchester united has been transformed as a football club under the management of sir alex ferguson , '' dan jones , a partner in the sports business group at deloitte , said wednesday 'financially , the last 26 years have coincided with a wider revolution in english football with massive investment in the game and the growth of the premier league , particularly driven by domestic and international broadcast deals'' the reality is that soccer is more than any business its power , which crosses borders and cultures , derives from its essence on the field , and that is where , undoubtedly , ferguson has been monstrously successful among his peers ferguson , however , did not make manchester united great he revived it he gave it back what matt busby , another scot also from working class roots , achieved between 1945 and 1971 when busby s irrepressible spirit rebuilt a club out of the ruins of war , and then rebuilt his team after an airplane crash in munich in 1958 decimated the best squad he ever built that catastrophe , and united s reemergence from it , built the legend and the worldwide fame of the club but toward the end of the busby years it faded , and no man could turn the club around and reestablish it until ferguson was appointed the team manager and coach in november 1986 there are players on his team today who were not born the day that ferguson , with his fiery temperament , his winning mentality , and his aggressive , attacking style began that revival certainly , the business , now owned by the glazer family in florida is global surely , one man is not the whole reason for its global popularity but without ferguson , the club s future resembles the situation in the postbusby years hence the immediate reaction on the stock market hence the statement from the owners when the club first was floated on the exchange last august 'any successor to our current manager , '' it warned , ' may not be as successful as our current manager'' it is unlikely anyone will ever surpass the length of time ferguson has managed at one club but names of possible successors quickly popped up one man touted to be the possible next united manager has been jos mourinho , the simmering portuguese coach who is expected to leave the helm of real madrid soon coincidentally , madrid knocked united out of the champions league this season mourinho has been viewed as negotiating his way back to chelsea , his former club but he made what was widely seen as an audition to be ferguson s successor when they met in the champions league , though questions about mourinho s behavior might prevent him from getting the united job bobby charlton , the former great player of united who remains one of its directors , questioned whether a man who once stuck his finger in the eye of a fellow coach in a sideline argument at barcelona had the dignity required to be the figurehead of a manchester united if not mourinho , the speculation points toward david moyes as another possible successor he is a fellow scot , drawn from the same city , glasgow , where ferguson learned his values and his work ethic as the son of a trade union official in the govan shipyard six decades ago moyes shares that tough upbringing , and has shown his ability to manage players in a 10year tenure at the everton football club what moyes lacks , however , is european experience he has built a competitive team on a strained budget , but it is a team without a trophy during his reign ferguson has seldom missed a day on the training field , much less a night in the competitive arena , whereas a coach his teams accumulated 49 trophies including 13 seasons as england s champion but only two , in 1999 and 2008 , as the champions league winner ferguson s reign makes him the most successful manager and coach rolled into one that the sport has ever seen it is difficult to think of any comparable tenure in sports , politics or business during his time at united 'the biggest challenge \? '' he once said 'managing change'' a man of volatile temperament sometimes a bully , often a father figure he built and ruthlessly rebuilt five squads of players over more than a quarter of a century one player , ryan giggs , grew up from a 14yearold apprentice to a winger who is still running on ferguson s first team , through all the triumphs and the rebuilding giggs is almost 40 now , and still under ferguson s wing ferguson s style was defined by his giving youth its chance and clinging to experienced players while they still gave him value but above all , he is a manager driven by a single goal to win ferguson , knighted in the british custom for outstanding service to his 'industry , faces surgery when this season is done he may not admit it , but he has just steered a team nowhere near the best squads in his reign to the title he vowed to regain the moment the neighbor , manchester city , took it from him on goal difference a year ago his desire to go out on top was insatiable , but the reality this year is that no english team was good enough to even make it to the quarterfinals of the champions league ferguson knows that champions league success is the measuring stick in modern soccer whoever replaces him will have to take that challenge on , because united , owned by the glazers , an american family , is a multibilliondollar franchise that markets itself around the globe as being among the biggest and the best ferguson s career was stamped with success even before he moved south from scotland to manchester on nov 6 , 1986 he had galvanized aberdeen , in the very north of scotland , to break the celtic vs rangers monopoly of scottish soccer , and it was the vigor of that team , the attacking style of it , that brought 'fiery fergie'' to the attention of united the question manchester had then , and may have about moyes now , was whether he could manage the egos of some of the world s highestpaid athletes could he persuade players who became millionaires in their teenage years to play as a team , to train as a team , and to go through whatever pain or glory the manager demanded of them as a team \? ferguson almost failed at the start he was given something that his successor may not get time to build and nurture a squad that stands the test of time that is so rare in european club soccer that no one today even comes close to the length of ferguson s 27year stay as a top manager the german bundesliga at the moment is regarded as the pillar of stability in an impatient global scene jupp heynckes will coach bayern munich against borussia dortmund at wembley stadium in london in the allgerman champions league final on may 25 heynckes , who is four years younger than ferguson and has completed 50 years in the professional game , has had 13 top jobs in his coaching career in germany , spain and portugal in the same period of time in which ferguson has moved just once , from aberdeen to the institution of united 'it is important to leave an organization in the strongest possible shape , '' ferguson said wednesday , 'and i believe i have done that'' he talked about the balance of youth and experience in the squad , about the training facilities that are secondtonone in the world , about the systems in place for his successor what he did not address was the steel required of the next man in his seat many years ago , before ferguson came south to the job , busby who had built up united from the end of world war ii to the most renowned force in club soccer remained on the board of directors it was always said that busby s presence around old trafford stadium he started managing united in 1945 , and finished in 1971 was an intimidating factor to the managers who tried and failed to pick up his baton ferguson s successor will have to live with him on the board , and no matter how wellintentioned or how paternal the outgoing giant of his trade will conduct himself in his new role , the new manager will need nerves of steel not to wilt in the shadow the bar is set terrifyingly or inspirationally high
the paper by blanchard , griffiths , and gruss is here \( pdf \) some bemusement among the noninternationalmacro types about why a long session devoted to a country roughly the same size as either nebraska or brooklyn , take your pick but a good discussion all the same my take what to make of latvia \? paul krugman blanchard , griffith , and gruss have given us a terrific paper on latvia , welcome for its tone as well as its content latvia has become a symbol in the fiscal policy wars , with austerity advocates elevating it to iconic status the temptation must have been strong either to validate that elevation , or turn the paper into an exercise in debunkery instead , the authors give us a detailed , balanced account one that highlights , in particular , just how odd , how inconsistent with orthodoxies of either side , the latvian experience seems to be so let me dive right in to the two big issues the paper raises the puzzle of latvia s output gap , and the puzzle of its internal devaluation here s what we know for sure latvia suffered a huge , depressionlevel economic contraction after 2007 , followed eventually by a fast but as yet incomplete bounceback which the latest data suggest may be slowing that has left unemployment much higher than it was precrisis actually , latvia s numbers from 2007 to 2013 look fairly similar to those for the united states from 1929 to 1935 today , everyone considers america 1935 to have been still in the depths of the great depression , so that if we look at latvia through the same lens it doesn t look very good better than , say , greece , but not good however , the latvian authorities tell a very different story , and bgg basically agree they argue that 2007 is a misleading base that the latvian economy on the eve of crisis was wildly overheated , with a positive output gap of something like 12 percent and they correspondingly conclude that latvia has in large part already recovered more or less fully bgg don t arrive at this conclusion lightly but i do think we want to ask how plausible it is first of all , on a conceptual level , how does an economy get to operate far above capacity \? we understand operating below capacity producers may fail to produce as much as they want to if there isn t enough demand for their products but how does excess demand induce producers to produce more than they want to \? ok , new keynesian models actually have a sort of answer the economy is monopolistically competitive , so that producers in general charge prices above marginal cost and are hence willing to produce more given the demand but there has to be some limit to this margin is 12 percent really plausible \? second , how often do we see the kind of huge positive gap posited for latvia \? or to ask a question we can actually answer , how often does the imf estimate output gaps that big \? i ve gone through the imf s world economic outlook database , looking at all advanced countries since 1980 , to identify doubledigit positive output gaps here s the full list estonia 2007 greece 2007 italy 1980 luxembourg 1991 i have no idea what was going on in italy 1980 or luxembourg 1991 i doubt that anyone believes that greece was operating 10 percent above capacity in 2007 surely what we re seeing is the problem with the methods the fund uses to estimate potential output , which basically use a weighted average of actual output over time these methods automatically interpret any sustained decline in actual output as a decline in potential , and they cause that reestimate to propagate backward through time so the catastrophe in greece ends up producing the basically silly conclusion of a hugely overheated economy before the crisis oh , whatever is going on in estonia presumably bears some relationship to what s going on in latvia the point is that if latvia really was as hugely over capacity as they claim and to be fair they don t use the filtering method , they use careful assessment of unemployment and inflation it represents a more or less unique case and arguing that latvia was vastly over capacity in 2007 has another , perhaps surprising implication it makes much of the debate over both austerity and internal devaluation moot on austerity if we were really looking at an economy with a doubledigit inflationary output gap , even the most ultrakeynesian keynesian would call for fiscal austerity grant the output gap interpretation , and the fiscal policy debate evaporates so , to an important degree , does the internal versus external devaluation debate here s a plot of latvian growth , at an annual rate , versus the oneyear change in the current account balance as a percentage of gdp there was a strong relationship both before and after the crisis , but if anything stronger before the crisis one way to say this is that that given the slump in latvian output after 2007 , you should have expected a huge external adjustment from that fact alone maybe latvia didn t need a devaluation of any kind , external or internal maybe it wasn t overvalued , just overheated that said , bgg also provide evidence of a substantial internal devaluation , at least as measured by unit labor costs oddly , however , almost none of this comes via lower wages wages in manufacturing have been every bit as flat as those of us who warned about downward nominal wage rigidity would have predicted instead , what we see is a rapid rise in productivity , which they suggest is the result of eliminating xinefficiency there is , however , an alternative interpretation latvia is a relatively poor european country playing catchup , and it had rapid productivity growth before the crisis here s aggregate labor productivity from eurostat maybe latvia just had an impressive productivity trend , owing to its particular position in the european system , and simply returned to that trend after a brief setback how does this bear on the internal devaluation debate \? well , if latvia had very high productivity growth for whatever reason , the big thing advocates of currency flexibility worry about the downward rigidity of nominal wages just wasn t a binding constraint so , suppose we go with this story latvia was a hugely , perhaps uniquely overheated economy that even a keynesian would agree needed a lot of fiscal austerity , with very high rates of productivity growth making wage stickiness irrelevant i m not sure i believe this story , but if you do , what lessons does latvia hold for other countries , and the euro in general \? and the answer , in brief , is none latvia s story as i ve just told it looks nothing like anything we ve seen in the past , and probably not like anything we re likely to see in the future including , by the way , latvia s future so i m a little puzzled by the authors sanguine view about a latvian entry into the euro the next time there s a euro crisis and there will be another one , someday there s no reason to believe that anyone will be able to adjust in the way that latvia , maybe , has
it is only fitting that the announcement of a medal created for the digital age spawned its own internet memes as soon as defense secretary leon e panetta announced the creation of the new distinguished warfare medal immediately dubbed the drone medal images such as the one below began appearing on blog after blog in tweet after retweet the medal , mr panetta explained , is intended to provide recognition for the extraordinary achievements that directly impact on combat operations , but that do not involve acts of valor or physical risk that combat entails , such as those piloting predator or reaper drones from a remote trailer the medal has sparked much photoshopped humor and heated online debate , much of it focusing on the pentagon s decision to rank it above the purple heart and the bronze star , both given to troops in combat as the distinguished warfare medal heads toward production , more than 13 , 000 people have signed an online petition demanding that the status of the medal be revised bronze stars are commonly awarded with a valor device in recognition of a soldier s service in the heat of combat while on the ground in the theater of operation , the petition states under no circumstance should a medal that is designed to honor a pilot , that is controlling a drone via remote control , thousands of miles away from the theater of operation , rank above a medal that involves a soldier being in the line of fire on the ground this was a sentiment echoed by many on twitter drone medal is appropriate but not above bronze star purple heart ! http tco jcfcbt5bf6  doug brower \( mushbrower \) 22 feb 13 higher medal for drone operators \? us soldiers fighting on ground demoralized http tco s6qjwd8jvp  unity media news \( unitymedianews1 \) 22 feb 13 similar commentary could be found in opinion pieces on news sites , such as the business insider , which called it the most ridiculous thing the pentagon could do and in longer anecdotes of protest on the comments section of the united states air force announcement 2 21 2013 12 28 33 am et i don t like this at all my father was in ground combat from 1944 to 1945 in france germany and czechoslovakia his highest medal was the bronze star i have a copy of the award hanging in my living room i can t even imagine what he went through now some guy sitting in an air conditioned building in nevada is going to get a medal rated higher than the bronze star and the purple heart i don t care how many terrorists he killed or how many hours he sat in front of that screen how motivated he is or how well he does his job it is inconcievable to me that he or she can possibly earn a medal rated this high giving them a medal is ok but lets not degrade the honor of others who have risked their lives and in some cases actually been wounded in combat serving our country  michael sharkey , trier germany according to the defense department , there is no controversy about the medal among military leaders each branch is in the process of drawing up their own specific guidelines and within two for four months , the first distinguished warfare medals will be awarded this is not a medal that will be awarded with the frequency of these other ones , lt cmdr nate christensen , a defense department spokesman , told at war , when asked why the medal should be above the bronze star although there were some forms of recognition for drone operators and cyber operators before , none recognized truly exceptional acts of service , he said this medal is visionary because it fills a void that existed before , he said although few people other than pentagon officials came to the defense of the medal , some did circulate a piece by maj david blair in the air and space power journal outlining the case for medals for drone operators for instance , consider a scenario in which predator crews track a critical high value target to a safe house where he is then kinetically struck by a dynami cally retasked f 16 in this case , both platforms crews perform their du ties with excellence and professionalism perhaps that excellence merits decorations , or perhaps doing your job shouldn t merit decoration ei ther way , giving the f 16 pilot an award for heroism while excluding the predator crews from consideration for the same sends a very clear message about what the institution believes is worth recognizing this message ripples back into commissioning sources and light training pipelines , perpetuating perceptions and relative performance discrepan cies through selection bias published in july 2012 , months before the announcement of the news medal , major blair s piece did not address the flipside what happens when a member of the predator crew receives a medal deemed more prestigious than the one awarded to the the f16 pilot \?
montreal hugo ch vez s death , following a battle with cancer , has left venezuela teetering on the edge the relentlessly divisive leader left power in the hand of a dauphin , nicol s maduro , who is also wedded to the kind of aggressive rhetoric that was the cornerstone of his mentor s government just hours before announcing ch vez s death , maduro gave a bracing , combative speech , blaming ch vez s illness on his historic enemies  you might expect that , at a time like this , with their beloved leader on his deathbed , ch vez s closest followers would try to create space for quiet reflection , dignified grief and national reconciliation but no in the speech , which brimmed with insults and accusations , maduro expelled two us diplomats for plotting to destabilize the country and called on the president s supporters to close ranks ahead of an imagined , imminent us invasion and various other unspecified plots the paranoia and incitement were deeply unsettling to witness in a country where civil peace , more often than not , feels like it hangs by a thread  you see , hugo ch vez s 14 years in power were marked by a basic contradiction in his public addresses and his party s propaganda , ch vez adopted the kind of extremist discourse that , in other times and places , tends to precede largescale human rights abuses a streak of contempt ran through his public pronouncements on the enemies of the revolution the imagery of annihilation came back again and again yet for all the bark , there was remarkably little bite there are no gulags in venezuela no mass political killings political prisoners are numbered in the dozens , not the hundreds or the thousands north korea it ain t for years now , this gap between outright totalitarianism in discourse and mere heavyhandedness in political action has felt unsustainable to me either the aggressiveness of the discourse would need to be dialed down , i ve thought , or the violence on the streets would need to be dialed up maduro s seething speech on tuesday , dripping with anger at enemies real and imagined , made one thing clear in the postch vez era , rhetorical violence won t be toned down does that mean actual violence will be ratcheted up \? venezuelan dissidents are only too well aware that the cult of personality around ch vez has reached extremes we realize the comandante s followers idolized their leader with a mystical fervor that , deep down , wasn t political at all chavismo , by now , is well on its way to becoming venezuela s state religion and now , ch vez s handpicked successor is telling the man s grieving followers that we those who disagree with him are responsible for the illness that took his life within hours of the president s death being announced , gangs of motorcycleriding ch vez supporters burned down an encampment where oppositionminded students had been demanding that the government tell the truth about his condition rumors of riots circulated feverishly on twitter throughout tuesday evening , still unverified it s a deeply frightening time to be an independentminded venezuelan none of the old trump cards that allowed ch vez to maintain his grip on power without resorting to massscale violence seems to be available to his successor without ch vez s charisma , his personal authority or his magnetic hold over the mass s imagination , all that maduro brings to the table is eliminationist rhetoric ch vez has left venezuela peering down into a precipice
atlanta the last 10 minutes of a college basketball game will never be described as crisp between television stoppages and a neverending procession of coaches' timeouts , the average fan watching an ncaa tournament game often sees an abundance of commercials , countless team huddles and the odd spurt of game action , which typically has all the rhythm of rushhour traffic lately , though , there seems to be yet another factor grinding down basketball s endgame in addition to tv timeouts , 30second timeouts , full timeouts and injury timeouts , the breakout star of this year s tournament could be what davidson coach bob mckillop has labeled the monitor timeout the monitor timeout sometimes referred to by announcers as taking another look or going to the table is that unexpected stoppage when the officials converge near midcourt to look at a video replay of a disputed or potentially disputed sequence unlike the nfl procedure , the college basketball review does not involve anyone ducking under a hood , but the motivation is the same trying to get a call right not surprisingly , the apparent proliferation of these stoppages has prompted much discussion at this weekend s final four while exact data on monitor timeouts is difficult to compile , several coaches and players said that it felt as if officials were using replay more often this season by rule , referees can use replay to doublecheck clock questions and whether a shot was a 2 or 3pointer , as well as conduct related to flagrant fouls on the surface , those conditions seem reasonable enough but when officials stop play to check , say , whether there should 379 or 377 seconds on the clock after a basket , one of the unintended consequences is that it grants both teams an extra timeout , which can be a critical gift mckillop knows in the round of 64 , mckillop watched his team build with about 40 seconds remaining after marquette cut the lead to 1 with about 11 seconds left , davidson turned the ball over on a pass out of bounds with none of its allotted timeouts remaining , marquette should have had to try to win the game without drawing up a play the officials , though , took a monitor timeout to check the clock that allowed marquette coach buzz williams a chance to tell his players exactly what he wanted , and vander blue , a wily guard , came out of the timeout and hit a gamewinning shot mckillop was left feeling that davidson had been eliminated , at least in part , because of what he said was an unfair advantage so much of what was done by us in the last few moments of that game was dictated by the fact that they had no timeouts , mckillop said in an interview by the letter , everything was done right the officials did the right thing and made the right call but marquette got an advantage , and it s something that i'm sure will be looked at one potential remedy would be requiring players to stay on the court during any review \( instead of allowing teams to congregate in the bench area \) , but the strategic ramifications of the monitor review go hand in hand with two larger issues connected to the proliferation of pauses in college basketball the rules surrounding replay use and the coaches' desire to manage as much of the endgame as possible several game officials have complained privately this year about the replay restrictions and directives in an effort to reduce dangerous contact near players' faces , officials are instructed to use replay to judge potential flagrant fouls that instruction has led to frequent stoppages , as referees will generally call a regular foul and then go to the monitor to see if a flagrant is warranted we are not allowed to downgrade from a flagrant if we see there was n't contact , said one game official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss policies publicly so there s almost no choice call the regular foul and then stop the game and go take a look with wichita state s tight defensive style there are always more elbows because we 're up so close , the junior forward cleanthony early said it seems almost inevitable there will be a monitor review of some kind on saturday during the shockers' national semifinal against louisville and that is in addition to any instances in which the referees stop to adjust the clock those stoppages , as well as those in which officials confirm whether a shot was made from behind the 3point line , have become an area for coaches to employ gamesmanship mckillop said many coaches would already do whatever they could to extend timeouts a few extra seconds he mentioned that some teams even had a coach spill water on the court intentionally , causing a delay the game official said coaches often shouted that officials should check the monitor even if the referee is nearly certain a shot was a 2pointer , the official said , it is difficult not to stop the action and take a look all of that , combined with the standard everyfourminute television timeouts and all the allotted team timeouts , can make for a herkyjerky pace to the game that is either intense or infuriating , depending on one s inclinations it s hard to tire a team out , louisville s wayne blackshear joked the michigan freshman glenn robinson iii said it is really different than in high school it takes a little bit to get used to it because there s just so many more huddles a few extra seconds might seem like a short amount of time , but for coaches , as williams and marquette reminded everyone against davidson , that is sometimes all it takes you ca n't plan for those stoppages , said wyking jones , an assistant coach for louisville but that does n't mean you ca n't take advantage of them
no quarterback has led the league in passing yards and won the super bowl in the same season if there were a most valuable player at midseason , peyton manning would be the clear winner , but the real goal is his second super bowl title manning leads the league in passer rating , his broncos are 71 , and he runs the offense that just set the record for points scored through eight games he not only has the most passing yards and passing touchdowns in the nfl , but he is also on a pace to break the singleseason record in both categories manning is the only player to win the associated press most valuable player trophy four times , and all signs point to his picking up a fifth trophy in a few months manning has a chance to become the first player since kurt warner in 1999 to win the mvp and the super bowl in the same season here are a look at other midseason standouts , kansas city chiefs honorable mention lesean mccoy , jimmy graham , calvin johnson no offense is as dependent on one player as the chiefs are on charles he leads the league in and has produced a higher percentage of his team s offensive yards than anybody else he has scored eight of the chiefs' 16 offensive touchdowns and gained at least 100 yards from scrimmage and scored a touchdown in each of his first seven games , making him the second nfl player to do so \( o j simpson , 1975 \) in week 8 , he did not score , but picked up 120 yards in a victory over cleveland , houston texans honorable mention richard sherman , robert mathis , justin houston watt had one of the nfl s best defensive seasons in 2012 he has been nearly as productive this year despite not capturing headlines according to football outsiders , he has eight tackles for loss on running plays in seven games \( and five more tackles for no yards \) this time last year he had nine tackles for loss and four more on runs for zero yards his sack totals are down this year although 45 is respectable for a 34 defensive end but football outsiders credits him with 12 hits on quarterbacks \( not including sacks \) , compared with six at this point in 2012 , san diego chargers honorable mention adam gase , jay gruden coach and the offensive coordinator whisenhunt have revived the career of quarterback philip rivers before the team s week 8 bye , san diego ranked second in points per drive and trailed only denver in first downs per game rivers has completed a leagueleading 739 percent of his passes more impressive is that the san diego offense has endured key injuries and succeeded with castoffs running back \( a former jet and patriot \) has 40 receptions , and the former broncos receiver has six touchdowns , easing the loss of the starting wide receivers danario alexander and malcom floyd bob sutton , chiefs honorable mention rob ryan , dan quinn the chiefs \( 80 \) lead the league in points allowed \( 122 per game \) , thirddown conversion rate \( 25 percent \) and sacks \( 36 \) they are the first team since the 1977 falcons to hold each of their first eight opponents to 17 or fewer points this is sutton s first year in kansas city after more than a decade with the jets in 2012 , without sutton , the chiefs finished 25th in points allowed and last in passer rating allowed , chiefs honorable mention , bill belichick from 1970 to 2011 , 42 teams were 214 or worse in a season the next year , those teams averaged 25 wins in their first eight games the best mark of any of those teams was 53 , accomplished by the '12 colts , the '01 chargers , the '97 jets and the '80 lions the chiefs' turnaround , from 214 to 80 , is remarkable , and more so because the no 1 overall pick has struggled as a rookie reid did not have a ca n'tmiss prospect like , but he has found the right pieces in on offense and bob sutton on defense , oakland raiders honorable mention jordan cameron , alshon jeffery , robert quinn , dontari poe in april , pryor looked like an afterthought in oakland , the last mistake of the al davis era the month began with oakland trading for the veteran and ended with the drafting of arkansas s to be the quarterback of the future both have been released as pryor has emerged as the team s best player he is 33 as a starter , with the three losses on the road , at denver , indianapolis and kansas city he is tied with running backs and for the league lead with six runs of 20 or more yards this year against pittsburgh on sunday , he took the opening snap 93 yards for a touchdown , the longest run by a quarterback and the longest run by any player in raiders history to be determined nfl fans have been spoiled in recent years , with robert griffin iii , andrew luck , russell wilson and cam newton having transcendent rookie years none of the rookie quarterbacks in 2013 have come anywhere near the levels set by those players at running back , cincinnati s and green bay s have played well in spurts washington tight end has 21 receptions for 282 yards in the last three weeks but was quiet in the first month of the season lions tight end has five touchdowns but just three other receptions at wide receiver , keenan allen caught 23 passes for 369 yards and 2 touchdowns in his last four games but has just 399 yards in all houston s deandre hopkins has 416 yards and a couple of touchdowns but just 10 receptions in his last four games there are a lot of good performances , but no great ones yet tie sheldon richardson , jets kiko alonso honorable mention tyrann mathieu , star lotulelei the afc east is home to the two top defensive rookies richardson has been outstanding against the run , teaming with muhammad wilkerson and damon harrison to give the jets one of the strongest defensive lines in football he has one of the quickest first steps of any defensive lineman , and he is agile enough to line up at linebacker speaking of linebackers , the bills' alonso is tied for second in the nfl with 81 tackles and is tied for the league lead with four interceptions alonso forced the stevan ridley fumble on opening day against the patriots that was returned for a touchdown sean lee , dallas cowboys honorable mention darrelle revis , aqib talib lee is tied with kiko alonso for the league lead in interceptions and for second in tackles \( vontaze burfict of the bengals leads the nfl in tackles , with 85 \) on sunday against the lions , lee intercepted two passes , returning one 74 yards a dislocated toe cost lee the final 10 games of 2012 , but he has been one of the best inside linebackers in 2013 he has fit perfectly in the system of the new defensive coordinator , monte kiffin , because he is strong against the run , excels in coverage and can rush the passer if the cowboys win the nfc east , lee s play will be a big reason
william p clark , who as one of president s most trusted advisers successfully nudged him toward more hardline positions on military spending , arms control and involvement in central america , died on saturday at his ranch near shandon , calif he was 81 the cause was complications of parkinson s disease , his son paul said during reagan s first term , mr clark who served as deputy secretary of state , national security adviser and secretary of the interior was understood to be preeminent among presidential aides time magazine called him the second most powerful man in the white house some of his influence came from his deep knowledge of reagan over the years he realized that the president responded to visual aids , particularly films , more than written reports so he showed him defense department films about the soviet threat , the middle east and other international issues in the white house theater , lou cannon reported in president reagan the role of a lifetime \( 1991 \) reagan and mr clark a slowtalking , slowwalking california rancher who wore cowboy boots and a stetson rode horses together at camp david jeane j kirkpatrick , the united states representative to the united nations , noted in a 1983 interview with the new york times that while people said reagan regarded his employees as sons , he regards bill as a brother mr clark joined reagan in his first campaign for governor of california in 1966 and served as his chief of staff in sacramento , with the formal titles of cabinet secretary and executive secretary he recruited edwin meese iii and michael k deaver , who would later play major roles in the reagan presidency in 1966 , governor reagan appointed him to a state judgeship , then to a higher court and finally to the state supreme court he preferred to be called judge as national security adviser from january 1982 to october 1983 , mr clark was among the administration s most forceful advocates for accelerating united states military involvement in central america , warning that countries in that region could fall to communism like dominoes without american assistance he urged the administration to make no concessions to moscow on arms control , and later attributed the fall of european communism to this tough stance his belief in peace through strength prompted him to advocate higher military spending in 1982 , in a speech at georgetown university , mr clark said the united states must be prepared to respond vigorously to opportunities as they arise and to create opportunities where none existed before tass , the soviet news service , denounced the speech as warmongering mr clark moved from the no 2 job in the state department to the national security post after his predecessor , richard allen , resigned in january 1982 when reagan announced his appointment , he promised the job would be upgraded with a direct reporting relationship to the president the times said mr clark used this access to become the administration s most influential foreign policy official newsweek said he had returned the role of security adviser to the lofty status it had under henry a kissinger in the nixon administration after interior secretary james g watt was forced to resign after a joke that simultaneously managed to offend blacks , women and the disabled , mr clark volunteered to take the job starting in november 1983 , he was credited with polishing the agency s tattered image he stayed in the post for the rest of reagan s first term william patrick clark jr was born in oxnard , calif , on oct 23 , 1931 , a fifthgeneration

oxnard in a 1993 interview with edmund morris for the book mr clark compared his relationship with his father to the one he had with reagan the younger mr clark said his father never thanked him for any favor did n't have to , he said in his laconic manner i knew he was grateful ronald reagan was the same whenever he came into the room , as governor or president , he did n't need to say anything i could tell what he wanted just like when my dad brought stock into the corral i never had to ask him which gate i should open william clark , who attended roman catholic schools , went to stanford , but left to study for the priesthood at the augustine novitiate in new hamburg , ny only two hours of speech were permitted each day after a year , he briefly returned to stanford , then moved on to the university of santa clara , but did not graduate he then attended loyola law school in los angeles , but was drafted into the army in 1953 and spent two years as a counterintelligence agent in

when bruce arians was hired by the arizona cardinals on thursday , the nfl s coaching carousel stopped spinning and a specific reality became clear none of the eight head coach openings this offseason was filled by a minority candidate when the jets hire a general manager they are the last team left with a frontoffice opening minority candidates are likely to be shut out of the top football executive jobs , too on friday , the nfl said it was working on changes to the league s rooney rule which requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate for head coaching and general manager jobs that it hoped would spur more minority hiring last year , with seven head coaching jobs open , one minority coach romeo crennel in kansas city was hired and crennel had already been the chiefs interim head coach crennel was fired this year , after the chiefs won just two games while there has been full compliance with the interview requirements of the rooney rule and we wish the new head coaches and general managers much success , the hiring results this year have been unexpected and reflect a disappointing lack of diversity , the statement , by the nfl s executive vice president of human resources robert gulliver , said the rooney rule has been a valuable tool in expanding diversity and inclusion in hiring practices , but there is more work to do , especially around increasing and strengthening the pipeline of diverse candidates for head coach and senior football executive positions
st louis the boston red sox are one win away from a world series championship while hitting 205 the st louis cardinals are one game from elimination while hitting 218 no team has allowed more than four earned runs in a game this happens a lot in the postseason , when pitching dominates , and perhaps there was no way the cardinals could beat jon lester in game 5 on monday at busch stadium they could hardly touch him in game 1 , either , and went quietly this time in a 31 defeat but the cardinals' curious roster construction hurt their cause manager mike matheny carries two pitchers , shelby miller and edward mujica , in whom he has seemingly lost all confidence both had strong seasons but grew fatigued near the end , and they have combined for three innings this postseason , none in the world series yet they remain on the roster , which limited matheny s bench options with one out in the eighth inning , after david freese doubled matheny let pete kozma , the worst hitter in the majors among everyday players , bat for himself , and kozma predictably hit a lazy fly to left he is 0 for 10 in the world series and 5 for 35 in the postseason with a lefthander on the mound , we only have our backup catcher as a righthanded bat , unless we throw another lefty in there , matheny said pete also , even though it s been a tough offensive season for him , he s been able to get some big hits for us at times we needed him to come up big for us kozma hit 217 this season , with a 275 onbase percentage and a 273 slugging percentage his 548 onbase plus slugging was the lowest in the national league in 21 years for a player who appeared in at least 140 games it is hard to imagine worse options as the tying run in the eighth inning of a world series game the cardinals do not have many appealing bench options they deactivated the littleused outfielder adron chambers to get allen craig on the roster for the world series rob johnson was 6 for 35 this season and is off the roster , like brock peterson , who was 2 for 26 but matheny is effectively operating with a 23man roster , which hurt him monday when he needed better options he defended the inclusion of the forgotten miller and mujica on his roster there s always hindsight , and hindsight is usually always right , matheny said right now we like the way our bench is being lined up we had to stack it righthanded with our starters , so we did n't have a whole lot of options on our bench i did n't feel we 've been that short but we have extra guys down in the pen just in case we get in situations that we do n't predict we 've been covered in most situations over all kozma was the last player to face lester , who gave way to closer koji uehara for the last out of the eighth uehara struck out pinchhitter matt adams and worked a 123 ninth to send the teams back to fenway for game 6 on wednesday the teams finished the regular season with identical 9765 records , and both finished their championship series in six games they split their first four games together , making this only the second world series in the last 10 to be even through game 4 but it was a wild right to get there the cardinals made three errors , and at least two more misplays , in losing game 1 in each of the next two games , the red sox allowed the goahead run to score on a wild throw from the home plate area to third base the second of those , game 3 , was the first world series game to end with an obstruction call then came sunday , when the red sox won the first world series game ever to end with a pickoff blunders , of course , are part of world series lore babe ruth was caught stealing with bob meusel batting and lou gehrig on deck to end game 7 in 1926 bill buckner , tony fernandez and mariano rivera made crucial errors in potential or definite world series clinchers base runners \( lonnie smith \) , umpires \( don denkinger \) and even bad hops in game 7 \( 1924 and 1960 \) all helped turn crucial games the obstruction call that ended game 3 , when allen craig tumbled over the legs of third baseman will middlebrooks as he tried to score the winning run , stupefied one 79yearold observer just when you think you 've seen everything , which i like to convince myself that i have and everything on and off the field no , i never saw this before , commissioner bud selig said never saw anything close to it now we will see something that has not happened in baseball since 1975 the final game of the world series on yawkey way the sixth game of that series has been rightly celebrated as one of the most spellbinding in baseball history that is a high standard for any world series to meet , but this one has been captivating in its own , fractured way this is what the postseason is all about , the cardinals' matt carpenter said baseball is a game that something you 've never seen before can happen every day
since 2007 , the year the san antonio spurs won their last nba championship , no team has won more regularseason games than they have the spurs have reached three conference finals in that stretch , as many as any other team , without a single allnba first team player their coach , gregg popovich , is widely believed to be the best coach in the nba and tim duncan , though on the downslope of his career , will be remembered as one of the great players the spurs play as if perfection were not only possible but well within reach in short , the spurs have set the gold standard for sustained excellence and because they have not reached the nba finals since 2007 , they have also been , to many , a disappointment in their previous five trips to the playoffs , the spurs were eliminated by a lowerseeded team three times the most memorable upset came in 2011 , when the topseeded spurs fell ingloriously to the memphis grizzlies , their current opponent in the western conference finals , in six games but after , which gave the spurs a series lead of two games to none , they appear ready to reverse their recent postseason failings besides a bit of luck in the form of an injury to russell westbrook of the topseeded oklahoma city thunder , a key has been a harmonious mixture of savvy veterans and athletic young players after struggling for years to compete physically with quicker , more powerful teams , the spurs have found the proper balance of grizzled experience and youthful energy entering the series , the spurs were expected to be physically overmatched by the grizzlies' snarling secondranked defense , as they were in 2011 instead , the spurs have implemented their offense flawlessly , assisting on an outstanding 75 percent of their made buckets point guard tony parker s incisive drives into the guts of the defense have yielded a bounty of open 3pointers , something the grizzlies specialize in preventing parker has been phenomenal , but those great shots are not simply the result of individual brilliance the spurs , more than any other team , generate a tremendous amount of motion and misdirection on offense often the player who begins by setting a seemingly innocuous screen on one side of the court ends up being the player who , after a dizzying series of passes and cuts , winds up wide open for the shot a series of plays called hammer exemplifies this precision and misdirection the play begins simply enough with a ball screen on one side of the court for parker or manu ginobili most defenses are trained to force the ball to the baseline on these plays , and the spurs' guards oblige by driving hard in that direction but as is so often the case , the real action is on the other side of the court , where a shooter floats down to the corner and a big man hammers the shooter s defender with a back screen the defender never sees coming the timing must be exquisite for it all to work parker s drive captivates the defensive players , and just when they think he is cornered along the baseline , he leaps out of bounds , creating an angle to zip a pass to that suddenly open shooter in the corner the spurs run plays like this almost every time down the court , and they do it at a high speed parker will often initiate the motion at a gallop so the spurs have ample time to run through their intricate motions before the shot clock expires it is akin to a football team running the nohuddle , except the spurs do it all game they operate with a perfectionist s meticulousness , yet never take their foot off the pedal so far in the western conference finals , the grizzlies have not been able to keep up the spurs have exploited the tendency of celebrated defenders like tony allen to gamble and forced the grizzlies' weakest defender , zach randolph , to stop the spurs at the point of attack the spurs have used a similar approach to handcuff the grizzlies' offense the secondyear wing kawhi leonard has simply abandoned allen , who missed seven shots within five feet of the basket in game 2 , to doubleteam randolph , the grizzlies' leading scorer , before he even gets the ball as a result , randolph is shooting under 27 percent for the series , and the grizzlies as a team are shooting just 38 percent leonard and the shooting guard danny green have infused the defense with dearly needed tenacity and athleticism after two years in the spurs' system , both have earned popovich s trust by adopting the detailoriented approach of veterans like duncan and parker thus far , they are more than redeeming their shy , unsure play in last season s conference finals loss to the thunder after dominating the first seven quarters of the series , the spurs finally lost focus and the grizzlies clawed back to tie game 2 in regulation the key was replacing allen and tayshaun prince with better shooters who could punish the spurs for swarming randolph if memphis coach lionel hollins sticks with this adjustment , it should make for a much closer series the spurs know no lead is safe they also held a 20 advantage against the thunder in last year s western conference finals before losing four straight games but this is a nastier , tougher spurs team should they escape memphis , they will be a difficult matchup for whoever comes out of the east the spurs are worthy of grand expectations but if they get back to the top of the mountain , it will be a result of their exceptional diligence on the smallest details
one week after the revelation that an oregon farmer had found genetically engineered wheat growing in his fields , scientists remain mystified over how the strain apparently the remains of a test crop shut down a dozen years ago got there but few are surprised even with extensive precautions , genealtered plants turn up in unwanted places regularly enough that farmers have come to consider a few of them weeds , and even a threat to their livelihood and while none of them yet poses any known public health hazard , experts say the boom in socalled transgenic crops should prompt even more careful evaluation of future varieties with an eye to the prospect that they , too , could eventually appear elsewhere in the case of the wheat found in oregon , most experts say , all those prospects are remote the experimental wheat was created and tested by the monsanto company to be resistant to its bestselling roundup herbicide , and similarly roundupresistant varieties of corn , soybeans and other crops are widely grown with no known health effects in a telephone news briefing on wednesday , monsanto officials called the appearance of the altered wheat a random isolated occurrence and said there was no evidence that the wheat had moved beyond the single farm or that its seeds were in the seed stocks that the farmer used to plant his fields nor is the monsanto wheat likely to spread elsewhere , most experts say the plants found in oregon , which the company said covered less than 1 percent of the farmer s 125 acres , are the only ones found anywhere since monsanto abandoned plans to sell modified seeds in 2004 as with most transgenic plants , the wheat could have transferred its engineered trait to ordinary wheat via its pollen , which contains the single gene for herbicide resistance that gene is dominant , meaning plants fertilized by the monsanto wheat s pollen would likely pass the rounduptolerant trait to future generations but while plants like corn fertilize each other , spreading their pollen far and wide by winds , butterflies or bees , wheat plants generally fertilize only themselves moreover , wheat pollen rapidly loses its potency once it leaves the plant a transgene that comes up in corn could be a much different situation , kendall lamkey , the chairman of iowa state university s agronomy department , said in an interview corn pollen can travel , under the right conditions , a great distance , he said but with wheat , he said , the gene s unlikely to be moving to other varieties in any significant way when a gene does move to other varieties , however , the potential for mischief can be considerable consider the benchmark example in 1998 , aventis cropscience , a swiss company now known as bayer cropscience , won federal approval to sell a strain of corn called starlink altered to produce a pesticide that kills insect larvae after scientists found a moderate possibility that the strain could trigger allergic reactions in some people , the government registered the corn for use only in animal feed and , and imposed safeguards to keep it out of the food processing chain at its peak , starlink corn was grown on less than half of a percent of all the corn acreage in the united states yet by september 2000 , it was discovered in corn taco shells , triggering a huge recall , tests on more than four billion bushels of corn and the cancellation of starlink s federal registration such dire consequences are rare , but not unheard of a group representing more than a thousand organic farmers in saskatchewan complained in 2002 that gene transfers from canola that had been genetically engineered to tolerate herbicides had contaminated their fields that made it impossible to certify their canola as wholly natural , costing the farmers 10 million , the group stated nature is hardly the only culprit in genetic transfers farmers can accidentally mix bags of natural and modified seed combines that harvest a genealtered crop can pick up its seeds , then drop them while harvesting a field of natural plants both farmers and manufacturers alike employ measures like putting buffer zones around fields , to limit the risk that genetic material will cross from altered crops to natural ones but many experts say that the myriad ways that seed and genes can be spread make that possibility substantial the real question , they say , is how much that matters absent any proven health threat , the most common fear is economic that organic farmers will lose crops , or that food exports to countries that ban imports of genealtered products will suffer the oregon incident instantly raised fears that the united states' 8 billion annual wheat trade would be hard hit , although the strain of winter wheat at issue makes up only a fraction of those exports but a 2010 report on by the national research council noted that genes can pass not only from an altered plant to its natural brother , but to less close relatives in the wild such hybridization is common in plants generally and is a key process for the evolution of new plant species , the report stated concerns about transfers to the wild already had stalled approvals of genetically altered crops like sunflowers and rice during tests in oregon of a pesticidetolerant bentgrass in 2003 , introgression of the transgene into weedy populations was detected at a considerable distance from the test sites , the report stated that is also a potential problem with genetically modified wheat , said the chairman of the group that prepared the report , david e ervin , an environmental management professor at portland state university in oregon there has always been a worry with wheat , being in the grass family , he said he added that if there were a transfer of the gene into grasses , there s going to be difficulty in controlling those grasses , and you might have to resort to stronger herbicide treatments , some of which have more environmental consequences that underscores the need for caution in approving new varieties of altered plants , he said , adding all bets are off when you start introducing new kinds of crops that we have n't had any serious events to this point does n't mean we wo n't have significant risk of them occurring in the future
a common cognitive bias in political analysis is what daniel kahneman calls the availability heuristic the tendency to focus on recent or familiar examples as opposed to the broader course of history and the richer volume of precedents there is some risk of this in massachusetts , where the democrat martha coakley lost a special united states senate election in january 2010 to the republican scott brown the state is holding another special senate election in june , in which the republican candidate , gabriel gomez , is drawing comparisons to mr brown , and republicans are hopeful that they can win again the problem with using the 2010 race as a precedent is that it may have been an outlier republicans won a net of 63 seats in the house of representatives that november , but none came in places as blue as massachusetts \( the one comparable gop victory was in a senate race in illinois , where the republican mark kirk defeated the democrat alexi giannoulias \) mr brown himself was defeated in 2012 by a democrat , elizabeth warren , whose margin of victory , 75 percentage points , was reasonably large for a nonincumbent candidate a number of unusual factors may have come together to allow mr brown to win in 2010 my purpose here is not to dismiss mr gomez s chances the most recent poll shows a fairly close race in massachusetts , with mr gomez trailing the democratic candidate , representative edward j markey , by just four percentage points but i want to examine mr gomez and this special election in a broader context the 2010 senate race in massachusetts is one point of comparison but so are the 2012 elections , and so is the evidence from the dozens and dozens of senate races across the country in recent years our model for forecasting senate races looks at a number of fundamental factors along with the polls as the election date draws closer and the volume of polling increases , the model puts more weight on the polls , even if they are in defiance of the fundamentals early in a race , however , when the campaign has not begun in earnest , the polls may not be very reliable the fundamentals calculation is based on an analysis of all november senate elections from 1990 to 2010 it includes seven factors , although two are specific to elected incumbent candidates and do not apply to the massachusetts race another factor reflects a coattail effect from presidential voting in the state , which is also not applicable in a midterm or special election , when there is no presidential race a fourth factor is the national political environment , as measured by the generic congressional ballot however , this environment appears to be roughly neutral right now neither party has had a consistent lead on the generic ballot that leaves three factors to consider the candidates ideological positioning relative to the voters in their state , their fundraising totals and their history of being elected to public office the bad news for mr gomez is that these factors suggest he is a significant underdog in the race in fact , the fundamentals calculation would project him to lose the special election by about 15 percentage points considerably larger than his current deficit in the polls the good news for mr gomez , in addition to the fact that the fundamentals calculation gets its share of close races wrong , is that this is a preliminary estimate two of the three factors are malleable to some degree he has time to raise more money and build a better infrastructure , and he may have more room than most candidates to calibrate his ideological positions his lack of experience running for elected office is a problem , but it s possible that mr gomez has other strengths that might outweigh it let s examine each of these factors in more detail fundraising of the 15point lead that the fundamentals model assigns to mr markey , eight points are attributable to his edge in public fundraising mr gomez reported raising about 600 , 000 in individual contributions before the special primary by contrast , mr markey reported raising 42 million in individual contributions as of april 10 mr gomez , a successful private equity investor , loaned about 600 , 000 to his campaign in addition to his public fundraising our models for forecasting congressional results , however , focus on public contributions only , as opposed to selffinancing , independent expenditures or transfers from other candidates or party committees the reason for this is that , in addition to enabling candidates to spend more money on their races , fundraising totals are a useful indicator of their overall strength as a candidate robust individual contribution totals are a measure of grassroots support in a way that selffunding is not candidates who rely heavily on selffunding have a poor electoral track record in addition , raising large amounts of money from individuals usually requires a professional campaign infrastructure , so these public funding figures can serve as an indicator of a campaign s organizational strength this is not to say that mr gomez s ability to contribute money from his own pocket will be of no help to him but if there is one thing to watch in the next couple of weeks , it will be how much financial support he receives from rankandfile republicans in 2010 , mr brown s fundraising was spectacular after he became the republican nominee he had raised about 15 million in individual contributions by the special election date , roughly double ms coakley s 73 million that was a sign that something special was going on electoral experience our analysis of senate races suggests that electoral experience has some predictive power , even after controlling for other factors like fundraising specifically , the model rates candidates on a fourpoint scale based on the highest office they have been elected to in the past the highest tier is for candidates who have been senators or governors the second highest tier is for united states representatives like mr markey and for holders of elected statewide offices other than governor , like secretaries of state and attorneys general the lowest rank is for candidates like mr gomez who have never won elected office \( indeed , mr gomez has never run before \) in the fundamentals model , the experience gap is worth roughly five percentage points for mr markey republicans can hope that mr gomez is a quick study but his inexperience increases the risk of gaffes and missteps , and he will be under more pressure now that the race is attracting more scrutiny there are some attractive components to mr gomez s biography in addition to his business experience , he is a former navy seal still , there have been plenty of candidates with impressive military credentials \( like retired gen wesley k clark \) or business credentials \( like the former ebay chief executive meg whitman \) who fell flat on the campaign trail mr gomez s favorability ratings are good so far in part because of his biography , no doubt but he might not maintain them if he struggles through interviews , stump speeches or debates ideological positioning isn t all of this focus on mr gomez s fundraising and experience obscuring a more basic problem that he is a republican seeking election in massachusetts \? certainly , mr gomez would have little chance of winning if he were running on a conventional republican platform however , he has quite explicitly positioned himself as a moderate he has endorsed samesex marriage , for instance , and taken views to the left of much of his party on gun control and immigration reform by contrast , mr markey is a fairly conventional massachusetts democrat , which means that he is quite liberal the way we evaluate a candidate s ideological position is by comparison to the voters in his state in each state , we calculate an ideal point where a candidate would position himself on the leftright spectrum if he wanted to maximize his chances of winning the general election , other factors being equal \( the ideal point can also be thought of as an estimate of where the median voter is in the state \) the further a candidate is from this point , the more harm he does himself in massachusetts , the ideal point is quite a bit to the left of the rest of the country still , it is slightly to the right of mr markey and most other democrats in more precise terms , we estimate it to be 0277 on the scale used by the statistical system dwnominate , where a score of negative one represents an extremely liberal candidate and positive one an extremely conservative candidate our method of calculating mr markey s ideology , which reflects a combination of dwnominate and two other systems , puts him at 0458 this isn t especially far from the median voter in massachusetts , but representative stephen f lynch the more conservative democrat , with a score of 0349 , whom mr markey defeated in the primary would have been somewhat closer to it what about mr gomez \? only one of the three systems that we use to evaluate ideology , his public statements as evaluated by the web site ontheissuesorg , is available in his case , and it puts him in the exact middle of the ideological spectrum mr markey is slightly closer to the massachusetts ideal point , but the difference is minor , and translates into only a twopercentagepoint advantage for mr markey , other factors being equal we need to acknowledge , however , that mr gomez s ideology is hard to pinpoint as i mentioned , only one of the three statistical systems is available in his case , and that score is based on a relatively thin record of public statements in some ways , this makes mr gomez s task easier than mr brown s was last year , and more like mr brown s in 2010 mr gomez does not have a congressional record to defend in a state where almost any history of republican partyline voting could harm him so how can mr gomez win \? first , he needs to continue to run toward the center , or even the centerleft , of the ideological spectrum next , he must overcome his inexperience and avoid gaffes on the campaign trail finally , it would be a positive indicator if he had at least some of the fundraising surge that mr brown had in 2010 mr gomez is very unlikely to match mr brown s 15 million , but if he were able to bring in onehalf or onethird of that amount , it would be a sign that he was tapping into some of the same enthusiasm as mr brown it would also help him achieve more parity in advertising and , perhaps , build more of a voter targeting and turnout operation this is not an easy set of tasks for mr gomez among other problems , positioning himself more toward the centerleft could make it harder for him to win financial support from republican activists but what mr brown s victory in 2010 shows is that republicans can win congressional elections in blue states if just about everything goes right that mr brown s election also came in massachusetts , or that it also came in a special senate election , is not especially relevant the same principle would apply to a november senate election in illinois or to a house race in a democratic district in california however , these instances are rare mr gomez is capable of winning , but his roughly fivepoint deficit to mr markey in the polls now could also prove to be a highwater mark
congress embraced a destructive policy when it decreed in 1996 that people convicted of drug felonies would henceforth be banned for life from receiving food stamps or cash assistance unless they lived in a state that expressly opted out of the ban the bans affected the country s most vulnerable families , including women with children and by denying welfare benefits to former drug addicts , the government makes it much harder for them to get access to residential treatment , which is sometimes required as a condition of release and is often paid for with welfare benefits a majority of states have either opted out of the bans or softened them in some way but about a dozen states have adopted the welfare ban without modification , while others have preserved obstacles to cash assistance and food stamps , with unfortunate consequences a new study involving researchers at the yale university school of medicine suggests that , by forcing former offenders and their families to go hungry , the ban on food stamps could well be pushing desperate young mothers to prostitution this , in turn , increases the risk of exposure to hiv the study , to be published in the marchapril issue of the journal aids education and prevention , reinforces earlier research establishing a link between hunger , risky sexual behavior and exposure to the virus the study was carried out in a collaboration between the yale researchers and all of us or none , a california advocacy group for the rights of inmates and former prisoners it covered 110 newly released inmates , 37 percent of whom were living on the streets and 30 percent of whom had minor children at home the subjects came from three states texas , which completely bans food stamps for drug felons california , which has a partial ban and connecticut , where people remain eligible for food stamps as long as they comply with the terms of their sentences alarmingly , more than 90 percent of those studied had experienced varying degrees of uncertainty about how they were going to feed themselves and their families people who lived in texas , which has a full ban , or in california , which has a partial ban , were more likely to go hungry and hungry people in general were more prone to risky behaviors like exchanging sex for money but even in connecticut , which has no ban , far too many former offenders and their families were getting too little help the researchers call for further study but it is already clear that the bans are counterproductive and that it is time for states that have not completely lifted them to do so people who have served their time face the hard task of establishing new lives in the world beyond prison they need all the help they can get feeding and clothing their families and themselves
during the federal government shutdown , senator of florida has appeared guided by one goal sticking as close as possible to senator of texas eager to regain favor with conservatives as he considers running for president , mr rubio has fully embraced mr cruz s effort to block financing for the new , standing with him at news conferences and through procedural maneuvers that led to the shutdown even more tellingly , on the evening of sept 24 , mr rubio joined mr cruz for his marathon speech against the health care law and was late to a previous commitment an elegant capitol hill fundraiser for gov terry e branstad of iowa , attended by republican establishment figures like the lobbyist ron kaufman , former gov haley barbour of mississippi and the former white house counsel c boyden gray i want to thank the senator for his efforts here today , and in the weeks that have led us here , mr rubio said as mr cruz yielded the floor at 6 the next morning , mr rubio returned to the senate floor and rejoined mr cruz mr rubio is not the only republican using the shutdown to position himself for a presidential candidacy these republicans' actions , as the crisis drags on , offer an early glimpse of the contours of the 2016 primary some in the emerging field are desperate to avoid being seen as standing to the left of mr cruz and his fervent supporters , while others are charting a different course cruz is trying to start a wave of salem witch trials in the on the shutdown and obamacare , and that fear is impacting some people s calculations on 2016 , said the republican strategist mike murphy the budget crisis , of course , is not only dominating the national news cycles it is also being carefully watched by those in the republican party who will help determine the next nominee for mr rubio , who has fallen out of favor with the party s base after supporting efforts to overhaul immigration , the need to reestablish conservative credentials is especially urgent gov bobby jindal of louisiana seems equally worried about upsetting the party s base he suffered blowback from republican activists after delivering a stinging critique of his party in the wake of the 2012 presidential defeat , saying republicans must avoid being seen as protecting the rich and should stop being the stupid party now he is more measured he declined in august to join a bipartisan group from the national governors association that warned congress not to shut down the federal government , and last week he told reporters he would not micromanage what s going on on the hill or secondguess tactics gov of new jersey is seizing on the moment to distance himself from republicans in washington and its dysfunction the governor , who is up for reelection next month , fires off near daily twitter posts about his bipartisan achievements in his home state with the antiwashington hashtag of deardc his aides sent reporters a link to a in which he announces , i hope in washington what they figure out is that what we pay them to do when we send them down there is to run the government , not to shut it down gov scott walker of wisconsin has been more restrained , avoiding a hashtag war , but has sounded similar notes , while former gov jeb bush of florida appears to be assuming the role of the adult in the room , warning his party not to overreach , because of what he called the dicey politics it s embarrassing to see this play out as it has , mr bush said and i respect , there s deep deeply held views on this but you 've got to pay your debts it all tells you what their political instincts are , charles r black jr , a republican lobbyist who has worked on presidential campaigns for over 35 years , said of the maneuvering perhaps the most revealing repositioning is being undertaken by senator of kentucky mr paul is a libertarianleaning firstterm senator who was catapulted into office by passionate tea party enthusiasts , the constituency most supportive of the republicans' hardline stance on the shutdown but as he looks at the 2016 contest , he is seeking to broaden his appeal beyond his tea party base , distancing himself from some inflammatory views held by his father , former representative ron paul of texas , as he grows closer with the senate minority leader , mitch mcconnell of kentucky , and courts more mainline republican donors without turning off his diehard ideological followers , mr paul wants to send a message to the republican establishment that he would run to win the nomination and not simply to carry the libertarian banner even while voting with mr cruz and denouncing the health care law in television interviews , mr paul has pitched ideas to defuse tension in congress and bring about negotiations last week , he invited the entire house and senate to join him for coffee on the steps of the capitol republicans and democrats do n't sit down and have a discussion enough , mr paul wrote in the invitation to his colleagues maybe by chatting over coffee together we can just talk and see if we can get along as far as attendance goes , the kaffeeklatsch was a bust only seven lawmakers showed up , including one democrat who seemed to spoof the whole idea by shouting kumbaya ! but more than two dozen reporters showed up and duly recorded mr paul s effort at crossparty comity , which was the point what exasperates some pragmatic republicans is that even wouldbe candidates like mr paul who seek mainstream acceptance cannot bring themselves to completely detach from mr cruz when the votes are called except for representative peter t king , republican of new york , who has floated himself as a potential presidential candidate , none of the likely contenders have yet been willing to directly take

beijing when 39 tons of the toxic chemical aniline spilled from a factory in changzhi in china s shanxi province at the end of december , polluting drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people downstream along the zhuozhang river and dangerously fouling the environment , it seemed a grave enough disaster and it was so it s hard to believe , perhaps , but in midjanuary , just days after local officials belatedly revealed the spill to the public , a rapid response team sent by greenpeace china to investigate found something even worse than the spill , the blogger zhou wei wrote in chinadialogue , an online magazine about china s environment greenpeace found that the fast pace of water consumption by coal and chemical industries in the area is drying up all water resources further downstream in fact , by 2015 , water consumption by coal and chemical industry in china s dry , western areas is set to use up a whopping quarter of the water flowing annually in the nearby yellow river , which forms much of the border of shanxi province and is popularly known as china s mother river , wrote chinadialogue as chinadialogue wrote , citing greenpeace , even more worrying than the chemical leak is the high water consumption of the coal and chemical industries in the area the blog post , which chinadialogue says hasn t been translated into english yet , cited tong zhongyu of greenpeace s east asia office as saying that the situation was growing more severe by the day none of this may be news to hardened followers of china s crumpling environment , but the scale of the water consumption in the waterscarce area is nonetheless shocking the tianji coal chemical industry group , which caused the spill , consumes water equivalent to the consumption of about 300 , 000 people per year , chinadialogue wrote , citing the greenpeace investigation the coal and chemical industry is simply a major watereater , the post said water is a key challenge for the country as the racing economy guzzles it faster and faster in the last 40 years , 13 percent of china s lakes have disappeared , half its coastal wetlands have been lost to reclamation and 50 percent of cities left without drinking water that meets acceptable hygienic standards , the world wildlife fund said , according to another article in chinadialogue the united nations has singled china out as one of 13 countries with extreme water shortages by any measure , the situation is bleak , chinadialogue said for now , the government is split between smallscale , practical solutions to the problem and huge engineering projects , such as the southnorth water diversion scheme , which aims to transfer water from the rainy south to the dry north but has been widely criticized by environmentalists as too big , inefficient and ultimately unworkable my heart is really out for the leadership trying to come up with solutions because china s just so maddeningly complex , michael bennett , an environmental economist , was quoted as saying as evidence of serious efforts to solve the problem , mr bennett pointed to widespread , smallscale , governmentapproved water conservation programs taking place around the country will china solve its really serious water problems \? the trend is in the right direction , the question is whether it s going to be fast enough , mr bennett said
today , underwear hangs to dry between peeling oxbloodred columns and weathered stone slabs poke unevenly from courtyards of pounded earth vermilion walls tower over narrow lanes , grass grows on graytiled roofs and plywood boards mask delicate stone friezes everywhere , beauty blends with the profane , the charmingly ruined and the merely garbagestrewn yet the real threat to the temple dozens of historically and religiously significant buildings begun in 1581 , the ninth year of the reign of the wanli emperor , and given its present name in 1734 during the qing dynasty isn t decay , say residents and conservationists it s redevelopment after the communist revolution of 1949 , nianhua si lost its religious status , as did many other temples its main hall was knocked down and a boxy factory built for a printing press for the new people s university workers moved in now , with marketoriented economic changes in their fourth decade and religion making a comeback , the dangers are greed and bad taste , conservationists say razing traditional woodandstone structures and substituting concrete simulacra has already blighted other historic districts of beijing , such as qianmen , south of tiananmen square , they say that imperils the very future of chinese creativity by robbing it of its historical roots , said the belgian artist jehanne de biolley , who has lived in part of the temple for 13 years with her chinese partner , the actor liu harrison linian , and their two children in 500 years , if someone arrives here from the moon , how will they know china had 5 , 000 years of culture \? where will they see it \? it s all just concrete , ms de biolley said , gesturing at the road outside the government plans to raze , then raise again , much of the drum tower area , constructing plazas where there were none and erecting traditionalstyle gray brick houses together with mr liu and a devoted band of conservationists and some ordinary residents , ms de biolley wants to save the authentic substance of nianhua si , to celebrate it , as she says , for culture , for memory , for the next generation she is organizing art exhibitions and seminars on conservation , spreading the word it s the magic of the place , ms de biolley said the beauty the aesthetics once it s put into concrete everything will change the proportions will change the echo the history the huge wooden beams , who brought them here \? how did they get here \? this all can trigger reflection and inspiration she added the fundamental issue is how to trigger in the art and design community a connection to chinese culture , a really deep thinking process , to trigger creativity hundreds of residents , including the liude biolleys , must go by the end of december , and the temple rebuilt to prevent fire or collapse , the beijing cultural relics bureau says the danger is in the rebuilding , said hu xinyu , an adviser to the beijing cultural heritage protection center , an organization that has led efforts to protect the city s historic fabric it may be that they want to do everything up new nianhua si , in dashiqiao hutong , or big stone bridge alley , is a temple where , in the precommunist era , families often brought the bodies of their relatives for monks to pray over before being taken for burial outside the city it is as important as the nearby , far better known , lama temple , said mr hu it should be a nationallevel treasure it now stands under the protection of the city s cultural relics bureau , though its use has been handed over to the buddhist association as with so many historic sites on valuable land , ownership is murky historians believe that beijing once had about 1 , 200 temples today , dozens remain , but few serve a religious function more broadly , only a fraction of the old hutongs , or alleyways with traditional courtyards , are intact , the victims of economic growth and underthetable deals between the government and developers after 1949 , old houses and temples were basically not maintained at all , said mr hu what was done was cheap and practical there wasn t the slightest sense of doing things in the traditional way that was considered feudal and superstitious he compared the temple to a person if you don t wash your face for a day or two , that s ok but if you don t wash for years , you re a wild man nianhua si is like that renovations are undertaken with little regard to authenticity , said mr liu , a burly man from the northeastern province of heilongjiang most siheyuan , or courtyard homes , in beijing these days are fakes , he said wealthy residents tear them down and build again with swimming pools , underground garages , dens i wish that here they d preserve the artistic value and not just chase the money chinese people don t respect real culture it s all about business and financial profit it s ridiculous , and it s the cultural tragedy of china , said mr liu , sporting a long beard for his next role as a 1920s warlord ms de biolley cited as an example of restoration the neues museum in berlin , where the british architect david chipperfield integrated the wardamaged remains of the original neoclassical building by friedrich august st ler into a coherent whole nianhua si has that potential , but it could lose everything , mr liu and ms de biolley said i wish they would do it more seriously , he said although the buddhist association confirmed by telephone that it was taking over the management of the temple , it declined to comment on its plans we are not open to the outside world , said a person who answered the telephone but would not give her name , referring queries to the beijing religious affairs bureau a person answering the telephone at the city s cultural relics bureau , who declined to give his name , said , we ve been talking about nianhua si for more than 10 years , and , honestly , i can t answer your questions about what the plans are because there are too many government departments involved state cultural relics bureau beijing cultural relics bureau beijing development and reform commission buddhist association more but in principle , the buddhist association is not allowed to knock anything down the damage to the complex is already severe some years ago a fauxbaroque apartment complex appeared in the northeastern corner about six months ago the beijing weldingmachine factory knocked down an original hall north of ms de biolley s and mr liu s art gallery , in the temple s old library to erect a concrete building steel beams dug into the fragile wood of the library eaves in october , ms de biolley and mr liu invited the british artist celia lyttelton to draw the temple to record its faded beauty for posterity i also feel pretty sad and angry that they re all being evicted , to be replaced by what \? ms lyttelton said a sort of theme park \? it just throws up whole questions of heritage mr hu said people care , but far too few i don t think beijing has lost its soul , but it s not as easy to find as before the patient is breathing , but heavily
in the , perhaps more than any sport , how tall and how heavy , or light , a player is matters football may require size at certain positions , baseball may value height in pitchers , but at every position in basketball , a player s height and weight become a continual topic of discussion in this year s , which will be held thursday at barclays center in brooklyn , height and weight could be the determining factor in who becomes the first pick in the draft but in contrast to other years , when height was a main issue being discussed , this week s draft has as much talk about weight , specifically that of nerlens noel , the kentucky center considered by many to be the top prospect of this draft class at the nba scouting combine in may , noel was measured at 6 feet 10 inches in his stocking feet , but he weighed only 206 pounds a defensive specialist , noel would seemingly need to put on quite a bit of weight to be expected to bang bodies nightly with players like roy hibbert \( 280 pounds \) , dwight howard \( 265 pounds \) and marc gasol \( 265 pounds \) noel , 19 , can hardly be blamed for weighing in on the slim side , as he has spent the last few months working his way back from a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee but when a team is looking to spend the no 1 overall pick on a player , especially one with a leg injury , adding another negative to the mix complicates things for the cleveland cavaliers , who have the first pick , a streak is in jeopardy should they decide to go with noel , who is considered a bit of a project the cavaliers have had the top pick four other times , each time having selected a player who became a firstteam allrookie selection all four players \( austin carr , brad daugherty , lebron james and kyrie irving \) made at least one allstar appearance as a cavalier as well unfortunately for cleveland fans , none of the four , not even james , were able to lead the team to its first championship before he injured his knee in a game against florida in february , noel was leading the nation in blocked shots a game and was living up to the hype that had surrounded him coming out of high school at the time , his weight was estimated at 220 to 225 pounds while still not the bigbodied center of yesteryear , at that weight he would at least be in the same range that joakim noah of the chicago bulls and larry sanders of the milwaukee bucks were in when they entered the league two of the finest defensive players in the league , noah and sanders have filled out since being drafted , but they are still slender serge ibaka , a power forward for the oklahoma city thunder , would seem to be a reasonable comparison for noel as a raw offensive player and shotblocking specialist , and he was listed at 220 pounds before being drafted in 2008 john calipari , noel s coach at kentucky , made it clear that he did not consider noel s weight a longterm problem we know he s going to gain 40 pounds , calipari told the cleveland plain dealer , saying the cavaliers had tracked noel s progress closely we know the trajectory they know where he was at the beginning of the year and they know how much he improved because they were here adding to noel s chances of being taken with the top pick , regardless of concerns about weight or injury , is that few of the other prospects are considered to have nearly as much potential noel is a natural shotblocker with tremendous leaping ability his main drawback is how raw he is on offense , something that would be largely helped if he were teamed with irving , one of league s most deft passers among the other players expected to go early in the draft are alex len , a center from maryland ben mclemore , a shooting guard from kansas otto porter , a small forward from georgetown and victor oladipo , a shooting guard from indiana each is expected to contribute at the nba level , but none have a ceiling to rival noel the most intriguing pick in the draft may be oladipo s teammate at indiana , cody zeller a 7footer with a chance to be a sweetshooting power forward , zeller was considered somewhat disappointing during his sophomore season things turned around when he tested as the most athletic big man in the draft at the nba s draft combine now teams just have to figure out which is the real zeller the underwhelming player at indiana or the superstar from the combine
the morgan library , with its gospels , missals and reliquaries , is just the right place for the first survey of graphic work by the most medievalizing of american contemporary artists encased in thick , pale , greasylooking plastic frames , mr barney s drawings of the past two decades have the look of precious pages from sacred books his images , with their reduction of the body to smears and stains , and emphasis on redemption through fleshly mortification , suggest sources in penitential religion , filtered through duchamp , sade and extreme sports mr barney , who was born in 1967 , first came to the art world s attention with a new york solo show in 1991 he was just two years out of yale , but as an undergraduate had already developed a version of the bodycentered , performancebased work that would bring him fame in a 1988 piece called drawing restraint ii , he had suspended himself in a moving harness to produce graphite images on his studio walls the idea of physical handicapping as a spur to creativity has remained a basic tenet of his art at the same time , he tempered the aura of machismo that athleticism evokes by playing around with androgyny , exchanging jockstraps for evening gowns and heels and all of these moves were couched within an explanatory discourse patched together from biology , psychology , myth and popular culture as elaborate and knotty as any theological system proposed by 13thcentury scholasticism all together , it was a sexy package much was made of mr barney s background as a college jock and former male model his genderblending could be construed as an acceptable version of identity politics by a segment of the art world that otherwise disdained the trend he was credited with bringing narrative fantasy back into art , particularly in his series of , which began to appear in 1994 only a few people pointed out that feminist art of an earlier generation had anticipated almost all his moves his drawing restraint performance was prefigured by carolee schneemann s 197376 in which she drew on walls while suspended from a sling androgyny had been explored by eleanor antin , adrian piper , martha wilson and other female artists as for fantasy narrative , and were at the head of a long line in the 1970s even mr barney s plastic frames seem to owe a debt , this one to eva hesse what he had going for him was an expansively hermetic sensibility his actions and stories were deeply abstruse , but epic , apocalyptic and this sense of the idiosyncratic promoted to the realm of myth is the strength of this drawings show that opens on friday , organized by isabelle dervaux of the morgan and the art historian klaus kertess in collaboration with the artist there s a lot of work to see , none of it simple the show extends over two galleries technically , it s a survey of drawings from 1988 to the present , but it s presented in chronologically mixed groupings , rather than year by year almost all the drawings are in some way related to the artist s films or performances , either as preliminary studies or spinoffs there are also several vitrines holding what mr barney calls storyboards collagelike arrangements of sketches , photographs , books , magazines and internet clips that serve as sources for specific projects finally , the show includes a new installation consisting of the traces of the latest version the 20th of a drawing restraint performance a few days before the opening , the artist , alone in a gallery , executed a wall drawing while hefting an olympicgrade weight bar and using it as a graphic tool the drawing remains , as do related props the weight bar , a towel and containers of graphite powder , chalk and petroleum jelly , a lubricant , voluptuous and creepy , that mr barney long ago adopted as a signature medium the storyboards give a sense of how mr barney operates as a fabulist sequential logic is not necessarily the dominant mode most of his films are based on networks of connectthedots symbols spun around central characters , often historical personalities , in whom mr barney finds examples of people who , against various forms of resistance , have to an unusual degree controlled their fates in a somewhat esoteric pantheon we find , for example , the murderer , who vehemently insisted on being executed , by firing squad , for his crimes the football player , who never missed a game even when he had to be fitted with artificial knees the escape artist , who made a career of courting death and the pugilistnovelist , who took repeated critical pummelings late in life but kept coming back with more books one of those books , the 1983 was a kitschy tale , part history , part philosophy , part soft pornography , set in and it serves as a foundational text for mr barney s most recent project , the sevenpart opera called which transfers the egyptian drama of rebirth , as described in the book of the dead , to los angeles , detroit and new york it s all there in impressionistic form in related storyboards that include toy models of ford cars photos of dead ibises and images of the isis and osiris copies of mailer s book annotated and ornamented by mr barney and papyrus fragments from the morgan collection and these boards only begin to suggest the range of references tapped elsewhere to mormonism , masonic ritual , celtic mythology , the whaling industry , 1930s architecture , sex , death , richard serra , reproduction , ernest hemingway , leaves of grass and ecstatic religions mr barney s recurrent themes are death and resurrection , or transformation , and they 're the abiding subjects of his drawings early ones tend to be abstract and diagrammatic , soiled joseph beuysianlooking little things dealing with biological dynamics of pressure and release as time goes on , the images become more figurative and illustrational characters appear , halfhuman , halfbeast fullbodied or in the process of decomposing skeletons recur , dressed and animated mr barney has spoken of north european renaissance artists like albrecht altdorfer and hans baldung grien as influences , though he seems also to have paid close attention to that great modern master of the comedic macabre , james ensor and the drawings are funny , or can be , though with their dense allover weaves of lighttouch , hairfine lines and stippling , they 're hard to see the images in the artist s film are bold his drawings crabbed and recessive , retreating into their frames as if trying to hide a formal tentativeness or awkwardness and they can be awkward he s not good at drawing figures unless he gussies them up with ornamental effects but a lot of artists are n't , and there s nothing wrong with that the problems i have with the work are more fundamental i find almost nothing about mr barney s tightly programmed content deeply engaging his heroes , or antiheroes , are not mine i feel no connection to the iron johnish ideal of selfpunishment as transcendence that seems to underlie his thinking about gender , including androgyny he obviously wants to shoot for big themes heaven and hell but selfconscious obscurantism produces a tight , cluttered , closed system and yet a serious and yet that system works as a total experience because it is so thoroughly imagined and so of a piece the films are most effective in this way , but the drawings can be too they 're easy to skim over but once you delve into them , and immerse yourself in their fanatically detailed , alchemical dark ages world , it s hard to get back out
these are the best of times for soccer in puerto rico , and the worst on an island better known for baseball or boxing , soccer has steadily gained participants at the youth level and made a splash on the international scene by staging and winning matches now , its under20 men s national team is participating in the concacaf qualifying tournament in mexico , looking to qualify for its first world cup appearance , this summer in turkey but the booming participation and interest in the sport are tempered by financial and political uncertainty that threaten to undermine its advances puerto rico s u20 team performed poorly and was beaten by jamaica , 41 , in its first match of the tournament the four semifinalists will advance to turkey puerto rico , which has never participated in a world cup at any level , faces panama on thursday in the professional game , however , the puerto rico islanders , who have played in the second division in north america \( the nasl \) and built an international pedigree and following , are in danger of disappearing earlier this month the club announced it would skip the entire 2013 season last august , spain , the reigning world champion and backtoback winners of the european championship \( 2008 and 2012 \) , made an unlikely excursion to face puerto rico , which did not qualify for the 2011 or the 2013 concacaf gold cup and was 134th in the fifa rankings \( spain won , 21 \) it was a highwater mark and an affirmation that soccer is booming , taking root and challenging the traditional sports like basketball and baseball \( not to mention a prodigious payday for the spanish federation \) it is crazy , but we had spain here , and i think it s a hit , said gabriel mota , who plays for puerto rico s u17 team my family is poor , and this feeds my dreams to play pro the new puerto rican generation likes soccer the puerto ricospain match was an attention getter the political connections of the federation president , eric labrador , and the match promoter eased the payments of 900 , 000 from the sports ministry and 500 , 000 from puerto rico tourism ministry to invite la roja , which charges about 3 million \( for the game and amenities \) for friendlies there are also shifts in resources at the grass roots of puerto rican sport henry neumann , the former head of the sports ministry , known as the drd , said that under a program called cancha abierta \( open field \) the agency provided soccer fields in 300 of 326 of the island s public housing projects , in many cases converting basketball courts to fiveaside soccer fields in those public programs , more than 70 , 000 youngsters are participating , he added , and the drd receives more requests for coaches and facilities than for any other sport basketball is still king , but soccer has moved into the second place in participation in the last three years , neumann said baseball has been in a nose dive carlos delgado , a former major league baseball player said there are a lot of kids playing soccer i wish more were playing baseball , but the important thing is that they get exercise for puerto rico to qualify for turkey , it must recover from the loss to jamaica and beat panama thursday in puebla , then wait for the result of the last match in the threeteam group , between jamaica and panama the university of indianapolis forward reid strain , who scored the only goal for puerto rico , had his nose broken against jamaica we didn t have a good start , midfielder emmanuel d andrea said this is a different level we made juvenile errors , but we re motivated and hope to have a different result against panama in bayam n , a workingclass suburb of san juan , youngsters outfitted in real madrid and other jerseys of european clubs wait to play at a new , threefield soccer complex built by the city also in bayam n , the juan ram n loubriel stadium , a former baseball park and the home of the islanders , was refurbished at a cost of 3 million to host the match against spain and adapted into the largest soccer stadium in the caribbean normally , the islanders play in the loubriel , but the club s fortunes are tied to puerto rico s political currents , as the team s management and owners are closely identified with the prostatehood pnp party , which was ousted in last november s elections without subsidies , the sponsorship of the island s tourism bureau , or a commitment from the new government , the islanders were financially adrift it s lamentable , labrado , the federation president , said the islanders have uplifted the sport in puerto rico , but there s more to soccer here than the islanders some may see parallels to the blossoming of soccer in the us in the 1980s and 1990s , when explosive growth at the youth level , even without a pro league , in part led to major league soccer time will tell if soccer displaces the traditional sports of the boricuas next march , hiram bithorn stadium in san juan will stage pool c of the world baseball classic , which includes host puerto rico , venezuela , spain and dominican republic in january , a delegation of marketing representatives from fifa , the sport s world governing body , was dispatched to help puerto rico develop sponsorship and commercial potential the island , a us territory , is the geographic gateway to the caribbean , with almost four million inhabitants , and many more puerto ricans living on the us mainland there s a lot of possibilities , gregory engelbrecht , fifa s development manager , said if they do it right , there can be a lot of progress the local federation receives about 250 , 000 a year from fifa compared to the rest of the caribbean , puerto rico has much better facilities there s a lot of interest in soccer from different groups , but there s a lot of criticism of how things are done on a highly politicized island , which was discovered by christopher columbus in 1493 and became a us territory in 1898 , criticism is a constant so are organizational hiccups the islanders organization received flak for favoring united states or caribbean imports over local players , thus limiting talent development and slowly eroding their fan base the semipro puerto rico soccer league has been inactive since 2010 , and the baseball winter league took a oneyear sabbatical in 20078 before returning jackie marrero , one of two players currently under contract with the islanders , is with the u20 squad in mexico despite the progress at the popular level , the island could be left without of highlevel soccer i think the islanders will disappear they just don t want to say it yet , said eduardo cantore , who was born in argentina and writes for a web site about puerto rican soccer the time is right to relaunch the pro league of just local teams of the players on the under 20 squad , none of the guys playing in a university will now return to puerto rico to become pros playing for the islanders was a dream job for them keyvan antonio heydari is a soccer journalist and broadcaster follow him on
dakar , senegal two veteran politicians will face each other in a runoff this month in the second round of s presidential election , the country s interim government announced friday it was another sign that mali , a troubled west african nation , could be returning to normalcy after more than a year of armed turmoil ibrahim boubacar keita , a former prime minister , foreign minister and lawmaker known for his profrench sympathies but also favored by some in mali s muslim establishment , and soumaila ciss , a former finance minister who once worked for ibm , came out on top after a first round of voting last sunday political analysts said that the high turnout over 51 percent , surpassing previous elections was a sign that mali s strifeweary citizens were eager for stability , as well as an indication of the potency of islamic organizations in getting out the vote in what is an overwhelmingly muslim country results trickled in all week , but the official tally was not announced until friday mali , which is nearly twice the size of texas , has limited roads , and the election was hastily organized because neither of the top candidates gained more than 50 percent of the vote , a runoff will be held aug 11 but mr keita , who has ties to france s socialists and is considered the favorite of france , mali s former colonial ruler , was well ahead , with 39 percent to mr ciss s 19 percent mr keita is from the fertile , agricultural south and did well in the south s population centers mr ciss , originally from the desert north , scored well in other regions it was a northsouth split that helped tear the country apart as longstanding members of mali s political elite , both men are associated with one of the most spectacular collapses to have befallen any west african nation in recent years in 12 months mali went through two rebellions \( the second , by islamists , resulted in the loss of half its territory to al qaeda allies \) , the fall of its government and army , a coup d' tat , several mutinies and a military intervention by france that saved the country from a possible islamist takeover none of the country s institutions or the men associated with them were able to forestall these calamities now , seven months after french troops pushed the militants back into the desert in mali s north , the country remains on foreign lifesupport , sustained by more than 3 , 000 french troops , a promised united nations force of at least 10 , 000 and the prospect of billions of dollars in aid from western countries mr keita is the clear favorite in the runoff as prime minister in the 1990s , he dealt severely with student protests he incarnates this figure of authority , said gilles holder , a mali expert at the national center for scientific research in paris a twotime loser in presidential elections in the past decade , mr keita also opposed mali s last elected president , amadou toumani tour , who is now in exile and widely held responsible for the country s collapse through a combination of corruption and passivity malians feel humiliated , mr holder said , so the vote for ibk , as mr keita is known in mali , is a patriotic vote he added that mr keita had invoked the image of general de gaulle but so has the leader of the group who overthrew mr tour in a military coup in march 2012 , capt amadou sanogo he once compared himself to charles de gaulle in an opinion article for the french newspaper le monde mr keita s relationship with the junta is ambiguous he was one of the only leading political figures not disturbed by the military last year mr ciss was beaten and imprisoned by coup supporters , and his house was ransacked mr keita has been accused of being too close to those involved with the coup , a charge he denies but this week , a minister in the interim government with close ties to the military junta announced to reporters that mr keita was way ahead in the ballot counting and was likely to avoid a runoff an erroneous claim , as it turned out
malawi is a country of rolling hills and marshy flatlands , where 85 percent of the population live in the countryside , most subsisting on less than 2 per person per day , typically from corn and tobacco farming it is also a country with extremely high maternal mortality in the us , 1 in 2 , 400 women are at risk of dying while giving birth over the course of their lives in malawi , it is 1 out of 36 if the country s new president , joyce banda , has her way , that will soon change banda has created a bold plan to improve maternal care nationwide the vast majority of births in malawi still happen under the care of traditional birth attendants , who are often unequipped to deal with potentially lethal complications but a national ban on giving birth at home with attendants , established in 2007 , didn t make the dent that banda s predecessors hoped it would most malawians ignored it in favor of the customs that have governed their lives for as long as anyone can remember the problem is not something that can be solved solely through legislation a massive cultural shift is needed the question is how can a government lead such a change \? if banda is to succeed \( and she is up for reelection in 2014 \) , it will depend , in part , on her government s ability to harness the country s true power brokers , malawi s 20 , 000 village chiefs and sensitize them to the dangers of women giving birth with attendants , while still respecting tribal traditions one of these power brokers is chief kwataine , who oversees an area called ntcheu , in central malawi , home to some 500 , 000 people a former english and history teacher , kwataine dresses in traditional royal blue robes when he s on official business his village is a glimpse of what a solution to this problem may look like wherever you look , residents have painted slogans about safe motherhood on their homes but more important , kwataine s villages are undergoing an organizational and attitudinal transformation it now has 48 safe motherhood committees each comprised of 10 community members who have distinct roles to support health among the villages mothers and young children family planning counselors , for example , spread the word about modern contraception methods growth monitors make sure small children are getting the health care they need in the first five years of life one role on the committee is especially innovative socalled secret mothers , usually elderly women , serve as liaisons between the expecting mother and the professional health workforce from the time of conception until 42 days after delivery in malawian culture , it is inappropriate to share news of one s pregnancy with anyone aside from one s own mother , a tradition that has led young women to forego prenatal care and give birth with unskilled attendants , as most of their mothers and grandmothers have done now , when a woman becomes pregnant , she is required to report her pregnancy to the local secret mother , who is responsible for monitoring the expecting woman s health and ensuring that she accesses prenatal care , delivers the baby in a health facility , and receives postnatal followup secret mothers disrupt the dangerous part of the tradition giving birth with unequipped attendants , far from modern medical care while preserving the value of secrecy and intergenerational bonding in other words , they serve as a lifesaving connective tissue between progress and tradition there is no simple blueprint for leading this kind of attitudinal change at a national level , but the safe motherhood committees are a savvy dissemination tool at the tribal level they serve as safe , familiar conduits for potentially disruptive , new health information a similar initiative to reduce maternal mortality in malawi in the late 1980s failed , in part because it enacted legislation without any attention paid to the customs governing birth or a robust engagement with tribal chiefs chief kwataine is personally motivated to see this cultural change take root several years ago , he directly responded , along with other villagers , to an early morning emergency with a woman giving birth he placed her onto a stretcher and headed to a health facility , but she died along the way at the time kwataine and others accepted a common explanation the woman had died because her motherinlaw had bewitched her later he met a doctor and learned that the woman s symptoms suggested that she had died as a result of a breech presentation \( 1 in 25 births , where a baby is positioned feet and or butt first it is not considered life threatening in proximity of adequate medical care \) chief kwataine has stepped up to influence other chiefs , as well , charging them with spreading the word about safer alternatives as chair of the chiefs committee for the national initiative , he recently hosted 60 neighboring chiefs to discuss maternal mortality and outline his own system of safe motherhood committees he has a way to go so far he has only worked directly with eight of 350 malawi s senior chiefs but he also hosts a daily radio show , where he attempts to speak directly to men about historically femaleonly issues like delaying marriage and birth , having fewer children at longer intervals and getting to the waiting homes near clinics scattered through out the country \( this is another key part of banda s initiative there is currently one waiting home operating and seven under construction \) the effort to empower chiefs to become evangelizers of modern maternity is not without complications on a recent visit to a clinic in a rural area of central malawi , called dowa , i learned that women who were giving birth with attendants or along side the road en route to a clinic , were being fined often a goat or a pig such fines are common and chief kwataine believes that they are effective \( he instituted his own fine in 2007 5 , 000 kwacha about 13 by today s exchange rates plus a goat \) but experiences elsewhere indicate that inducements work better for example , rwanda , which has made significant improvements in public health over the last decade provides bonus pay to encourage community health workers to get women to clinics between 2000 and 2010 , women s lifetime risk of maternal mortality in rwanda dropped from 1 in 24 to 1 in 54 still , malawi is important to watch in 2007 , there were 40 maternal deaths in ntcheu , according to chief kwataine now with 48 safe motherhood committees operating , there hasn t been a single maternal death in the area for more than three years president banda , the second female head of state in africa , has 16 months left in office and thousands more chiefs to bring along \( not to mention 1000 midwives , which she also aims to train through the initiative \) one of the world s leaders in this kind of cultural change is molly melching , the founder and director of tostan , an organization based on senegal that is credited with the large scale movement to end female genital cutting in the country genital cutting is a deeply entrenched cultural practice that also evaded a legislative intervention tostan raised awareness about the health and human rights implications of cutting in grassroots discussion groups , slowly building consensus against the practice that led to public pledges when i called melching to inquire about her experiences engaging male influencers to catalyze cultural shifts , she had just come from a training for new parents in senegal when it comes to changing human behavior , melching said that the force of law or even the threat of spirits still pales in comparison to the power of information she related how tostan is now sharing the latest information about brain development with senegalese parents , the kind of neuroscience that americans and europeans are used to hearing the first 15 days of a baby s life are critical for brain development , and speaking aloud to them goes a long way in language comprehension and formation later on melching said she and her colleagues spent hours getting new fathers , many of them respected leaders in the community , used to these practices she laughed aloud recounting the image of these men , babies in their arms , awkwardly greeting their children um , hello baby cultural change is awkward it can t be forced , but it can grow organically tostan uses a theory of organized diffusion creating community settings in which people feel comfortable receiving and discussing accurate information about health and human rights and , of course , it is essential to make sure that the influencers of any community often the men are engaged both intellectually and emotionally none of us , rich or poor , likes to be told what to do , says melching that s why we steer clear of messaging the truth is that when anyone , men included , get good scientific information and a chance to discuss it with members of their communities , they are very interested in changing additional research for this column was provided by kaylyn koberna david bornstein is off this week join and follow

baltimore standing in the outfield before a may game in anaheim , calif , manager buck showalter did not like what he saw in zach clark , but it had little to do with clark s mechanics or repertory showalter noticed that clark had gnawed his fingernails , hardly ideal for an aspiring knuckleballer you may want to stop doing that , clark recalled showalter telling him clark eventually had acrylic nails applied to the middle three fingers of his right hand , so he could dig into the ball and release it as if it were a balloon trying to explain it was weird , clark said of his visit to a maryland salon although the orioles did not put a manicurist on the payroll , they did sign a consultant for 2013 , phil niekro , who won 318 games in a 24year career , riding the knuckleball from the moment the milwaukee braves signed him in 1958 niekro s assignment is to help the orioles transform three pitchers into fulltime knuckleballers clark , 30 , now with class a frederick , md zach staniewicz , 27 , in the rookie gulf coast league and eddie gamboa , 28 , of class aaa norfolk , va baltimore s approach may be unconventional , but leaders in the organization are well aware of how effective the knuckleball can be while managing the texas rangers in 2005 , showalter , r a dickey , to take up the knuckleball last year , dickey won 20 games for the mets and earned the national league s cy young award dan duquette , the orioles' executive vice president for baseball operations , also has experience with a successful knuckleballer when he ran the red sox , duquette after the pittsburgh pirates released him in 1995 wakefield pitched for 17 seasons with boston the orioles' strategy is a lifeline to pitchers trying to salvage their careers , and a lowrisk , highreward proposition for the organization it involves identifying prospects who are likely to remain in the minor leagues or to reach the majors only briefly but duquette , showalter and the orioles' pitching coach , rick adair , said that even middling candidates for conversion must fit basic criteria a player must sublimate his ego to embrace an unorthodox pitch stick with it despite inevitable poundings when the knuckleball refuses to dip , dart and flutter and be athletic enough to field squib hits when a batter makes contact he must also limit base stealers , using a quick delivery from the stretch to offset the pitch s slower journey to the plate above all , showalter said , you have to have failed at a very high level the orioles' approach , if it works , could prompt a reassessment of pitchers' development in the short and long terms throwing knuckleballs puts far less strain on the shoulder and arm than throwing conventional pitches , possibly extending innings pitched and careers you forget everything you learned about pitching when you throw a knuckleball , niekro said in a telephone interview but it is hard to trust a pitch whose speed is not the object and whose destination is unpredictable with the knuckleball , you have to make the commitment , niekro said you 've got to throw it in all situations making that adjustment is not so simple charlie haeger , a pitcher in the red sox organization who estimated that he throws the knuckler about 85 percent of the time , said , as a kid , you do n't think of becoming a knuckleball pitcher sitting in his office at oriole park at camden yards , duquette made a case for developing more knuckleballers i'm not sure why there are n't more out there , because every time you throw the pitch , you have a chance to get an out , he said look at the money the industry spends on conventional pitchers , and most of them end up on the disabled list , not even working you 're not putting as much stress on your shoulder because you 're trying to get the ball to float , not throw it past the backstop he added about half our players are pitchers on a given team why not knuckleballers why not \? our goal is to have them pitch until they collect , or at least their major league pension to tutor wakefield , duquette once hired niekro and his brother joe , another knuckleballer wakefield consulted with charlie hough , who had recently retired , and tom candiotti , who was also learning the pitch and when dickey began to focus on the knuckleball , first with texas and then with the seattle mariners and the minnesota twins , he sought out wakefield wakefield , who retired with 200 wins , now works as a red sox broadcaster while advising haeger , 29 , and another knuckleballer , steven wright , 28 haeger and wright adopted the pitch on their own , as members of other organizations despite duquette s and showalter s pivotal roles in developing the major leagues' two most recent successful knuckleballers wakefield and dickey , who now pitches for the toronto blue jays coincidence rather than design underlies the orioles' approach in june 2012 , staniewicz , then an inspector of cargo planes at pope field near fayetteville , nc , visited camden yards to be honored as a member of a military allstar team at the batting cage before the orioles played , staniewicz told duquette that he had developed a knuckleball duquette urged him to work on it in january , at the baseball writers' association of america dinner in new york , niekro told duquette that staniewicz had visited him phil said to me , the guy s got enough of a knuckleball that you should sign and train him , ' duquette said duquette went further , signing staniewicz and niekro to oneyear contracts at spring training in sarasota , fla , niekro was working with staniewicz when he glimpsed gamboa throwing and added him as a pupil , too when niekro observed gamboa at class aa bowie , md , clark s pregame tossing of knuckleballs caught his eye clark then climbed aboard the niekro bandwagon phil s the pied piper , duquette said the players , like the pitch itself , have had ups and downs in consecutive starts for bowie in june , gamboa allowed one hit in seven and a third innings and threw seven nohit innings but he is 13 with a 587 earned run average since being promoted to norfolk in july this season , clark has been rocked for a 213 record and an 871 era while pitching for four minor league teams and in one game with the orioles haeger , who took up the knuckleball in 2004 , has pitched in parts of five seasons for three major league teams , most recently with the los angeles dodgers in 2010 he missed last season while recovering from tommy john surgery after being signed by the red sox , he has posted a 67 record with a 470 era for class aa portland , me , and class aaa pawtucket , ri then there is wright , who has shuttled between pawtucket and boston this year he gave up five runs and six hits in three and twothirds innings of relief in his major league debut , but he was solid in his next outing , allowing no runs and three hits in five and twothirds innings last tuesday , facing houston in his first major league start , wright lasted one inning he allowed three runs and one hit , walked two , hit a batter and threw a wild pitch , and his knuckler had much to do with catcher ryan lavarnway s four passed balls wright was sent back to pawtucket two days later none of that concerns niekro i remember when i was with richmond , my stats were n't great , but they brought me up and it changed my life completely , said niekro , who checks in occasionally with his prot g s the difficulties in controlling the knuckleball , let alone mastering it , are hardly lost on duquette we knew this was n't a shortterm project , he said , adding , we were willing to invest some time in them if they were willing to spend some time on the knuckleball these orioles and red sox players are dedicated to mastering the pitch , although clark acknowledged that he was not comfortable with relying on his knuckleball he throws it about half the time , he said , and feels he has to protect it with my conventional stuff a sinker , a twoseam fastball and a curveball as the pitchers develop , it becomes more likely that knuckleballers will once again face each other in the major leagues a knuckleball matchup could materialize in baltimore or boston , with postseason implications but it would be tough to match the atlanta braves' unusual achievement on sept 30 , 1969 , when they defeated the cincinnati reds , 32 , on a combined sevenhitter by the knuckleballers niekro and hoyt wilhelm the win clinched the first national league west crown , and niekro and wilhelm were eventually voted into the hall of fame for now , the prospects would probably be happy just to earn an extended stay in the majors , even if they had to hang on by their fingertips
everyblock , a pioneering web site for hyperlocal datadriven journalism , was shut down on thursday by its owner , nbcnewscom , disappointing longtime fans of the site hundreds of its users posted comments bemoaning the closure and wondering why it had happened without warning nbc characterized the decision as hard but necessary , reflective of the challenges the owners of other community web sites have faced in recent years we did not take this decision lightly , vivian schiller , the chief digital officer for nbc news , said in an email asked whether nbc had considered a merger or a sale of everyblock , she said , we looked at various options , both internal and external , but none of them were viable this is tough business to make work everyblock , which was founded in 2007 and initially financed with a 11 million grant from the knight foundation , tried to pull together neighborhoodlevel information for users in cities like chicago , philadelphia and san francisco it was acquired by msnbccom , a joint venture of nbc and microsoft , in 2009 , nurtured by the owners and allowed to remain relatively independent when nbc and microsoft parted ways last year , nbc became the sole owner of everyblock the premise of everyblock was to offer you a custom site devoted to news in your neighborhood , wrote adrian holovaty , the site s founder , in a blog post on thursday we showed you nearby public records \( crimes , building permits , restaurant inspections \) , pointed you to automatically indexed articles \( newspapers , blogs , forums \) and provided a sort of geoforum that let you talk with people who lived near you the site was one of the first to collect big sets of data from local governments and make the information accessible to citizens , something now known as the opendata movement but the web site s losses were considerable , and nbc evidently saw no way to change that ms schiller said in a memorandum to nbc news digital staff members that we didn t see a strategic fit for everyblock within the portfolio that portfolio includes nbcnewscom \( formerly known as msnbccom \) , todaycom , the grio , and breakingnewscom in the spring , msnbccom will restart as a standalone web site for the msnbc cable channel we will continue to support and expand in strategic areas , whether it s a flagship like nbcnewscom , a new venture like msnbccom , a nimble startup like breaking news , or other businesses with big ideas , ms schiller wrote as we move forward , i want us to be thoughtful about how we invest , taking a hard look at where we can and should win , and how we deploy the resources to make it happen mr holovaty , who left everyblock last year , said he had learned of nbc s decision as its users did , through a blog post on thursday morning we re sorry to report that everyblock has closed its doors , read the post , which replaced all the content on the site it s no secret that the news industry is in the midst of a massive change within the world of neighborhood news there s an exciting pace of innovation yet increasing challenges to building a profitable business though everyblock has been able to build an engaged community over the years , we re faced with the decision to wrap things up complaints piled up on the blog post , with one calling the sudden shutdown unneighborly this is going to leave a major void in my desire for local news and neighborhood happenings , another wrote implicit in many of the comments was a deeper anxiety about the ability of neighborhood news sites to prosper when advertising trends are not in their favor some users suggested an alternative site , nextdoorcom others posted links to facebook pages for particular neighborhoods , hoping to reconvene in new corners of the web
wimbledon s original no 2 court , called the graveyard court because it was the site of so many upsets , is gone but as we saw last year when lukas rosol , an obscure czech player ranked 100th , sent rafael nadal packing , the first week at wimbledon can still be an adventure for the game s top seeds nearly every great champion has crashed out of wimbledon prematurely at least once doohan masur bastl flach rosol carlsen each had his 15 minutes of fame who will be this year s cinderella story \?

in 1944 , when americans were fighting for the pacific island of saipan , a feisty young mexicanamerican marine named guy gabaldon ventured on his own behind japanese lines , defying the orders of his commander with a few phrases of japanese he had learned as a boy in los angeles , mr gabaldon coaxed enemy soldiers from caves where they were hiding , making them believe a regiment was close behind in one day , mr gabaldon singlehandedly captured more than 800 japanese fighters , an american military record yet when hollywood made a movie about his exploits after the war , mr gabaldon , who is short with dark hair , was played by a tall , blond actor his latino identity was never mentioned that omission , and many others in which hispanic people have been casually excluded or purposefully expunged from the record of american history , has begun to be addressed in , a series of six onehour documentaries that pbs will broadcast on three tuesday nights starting this week its producers took on no small task they set out to weave into one story line the saga of spanishspeaking people on the american continent from their arrival to the present , starting with the spanish admiral who laid claim to st augustine , fla , in 1565 more than four decades before the english at jamestown , va the documentaries bring together for the first time for national television the disparate experiences of latinos with different national origins , from the mexicanamericans whose ancestors inhabited the southwest before the united states were united to the puerto ricans , dominicans and cubans who flocked to the east coast during the past century to the central and south americans who spread across the country in recent decades for pbs the series also repairs a historical record of its own latinos were outraged that none of their veterans were included in the 14hour series about world war ii made in 2007 by the documentarian ken burns hispanic groups successfully pressured mr burns to reedit some episodes to add several latinos they also demanded more shows by and about latinos on pbs stations enter latino americans it aspires to do for hispanics something like what pbs did for africanamericans with its documentary series eyes on the prize , first broadcast in 1987 , a chronicle of the civil rights era that earned a permanent place in the black historical canon the new series has similarly large ambitions in a civil rights spirit , it portrays people of hispanic heritage who , despite strong roots in the united states , have continually faced dispossession and discrimination and struggled for recognition it is a retelling of history that factually corrects the record and rightly puts latino culture squarely in the middle of the american experience , said benjamin bratt , the actor latino through his peruvian mother who brought star appeal to the project as the gravely sober narrator early reactions from latino organizations suggest they are ready to forgive pbs is redeeming itself , said lisa navarrete , a top leader at nclr , also known as the national council of la raza , one of the groups that led the criticism of mr burns s series there is an idea out there that we are all recent arrivals these documentaries go a long way to showing people that we are not new we have a lot of history in this country jeff bieber , an executive producer of the series , said he was watching the acrimonious debate over illegal immigration that was gathering fervor when he first conceived the series five years ago mr bieber , a vice president at weta , the pbs flagship station in washington , said he wanted to provide context about latinos that would change the national conversation around immigration a delicate decision for mr bieber was the selection of a series producer initially some advocates worried that his choice , adriana bosch , a filmmaker born in cuba , might not comprehend the experience of mexicanamericans as it turned out , ms bosch had never been wedded to one latino region she grew up in new jersey and california and worked for decades as a filmmaker in boston she brought in more hispanic producers , from a different national origins the project they undertook was vast we wanted to tell the whole story , ms bosch said but it was a very tall order , constructing one narrative that captured the different threads there are many groups , they have parallel histories , and some intersect and some do n't after the recession hit in 2008 , a series originally planned for eight hours was reduced by tight funds to six the result is a panorama , which can sometimes be dizzying , as the action sprints from san francisco to san antonio to santo domingo there is the story of juan segu n , a mexican who fought with the hapless defenders of the alamo in 1836 and went on to become mayor of san antonio but settlers from the east were pushing mexicans off their texas land , and mr segu n became one of them , forced to live out his life on the run as a foreigner in my native land mindful of the controversy with mr burns , the producers of the latino series devote a full hour to , including the heroics of mr gabaldon but also the painful aftermath for latino veterans , whose experiences braving combat together with other soldiers raised their expectations for equal treatment once they returned home an infantryman named macario garc a , who received a medal of honor for his daring , was denied service two weeks later in a whitesonly restaurant near his hometown in texas one episode shows the cultural moment when a puerto rican performer , rita moreno , won an oscar for her role as the defiant anita in west side story for years ms moreno had been relegated to what she called , in an interview , her dusky maiden roles buxom , submissive girls in dark makeup anita was her chance to play a hispanic woman with character it marked the first time i would be actually playing a person of dignity and strength , said ms moreno , who is now 81 the broadcast of the new series has turned out to be timely latinos , the country s largest minority , are closer than ever to having a shared national identity different groups have been unified in their rejection of the caustic rhetoric of some politicians in the immigration debate last year , latinos demonstrated new electoral clout when their votes helped reelect president obama pbs hopes to tap in to that dynamic since january , advance screenings of latino americans have been held with panel discussions and fiestas , primarily with hispanic organizations the series s web site has invited hispanic viewers , in both english and spanish , to submit their own videos recalling family traditions and lore ray suarez , a senior correspondent for the nightly pbs newshour , has written a companion book and a school curriculum was developed vme , the spanishlanguage public television network , will broadcast the series on six fridays starting on friday yet , when it comes to dealing with contemporary immigration issues , the producers walk on tiptoe they show faces of latino immigrants hit with deportation , but avoid any position that might raise partisan hackles what s going on today is so raw and current , they are shying away from taking a stand , ms navarrete of nclr said that will be for another documentary

each time we gather to inaugurate a president , we bear witness to the enduring strength of our constitution we affirm the promise of our democracy we recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names what makes us exceptional what makes us american is our allegiance to an idea , articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago we hold these truths to be selfevident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness today we continue a neverending journey , to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time but we have always understood that when times change , so must we that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action my fellow americans , we are made for this moment , and we will seize it so long as we seize it together for we , the people , understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it we understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time we so we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government , revamp our tax code , reform our schools , and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder , learn more , and reach higher we , the people , still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit but we reject the belief that america must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future we do not believe that in this country , freedom is reserved for the lucky , or happiness for the few we recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives , any one of us , at any time , may face a job loss , or a sudden illness , or a home swept away in a terrible storm the commitments we make to each other through medicare , and medicaid , and social security , these things do not sap our initiative , they strengthen us they do not make us a nation of takers they free us to take the risks that make this country great we , the people , still believe that our obligations as americans are not just to ourselves , but to all posterity we will respond to the threat of climate change , knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science , but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires , and crippling drought , and more powerful storms we , the people , declare today that the most evident of truths that all of us are created equal is the star that guides us still just as it guided our forebears through seneca falls , and selma , and stonewall just as it guided all those men and women , sung and unsung , who left footprints along this great mall , to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone to hear a king proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on earth it is now our generation s task to carry on what those pioneers began for our journey is not complete until our wives , our mothers , and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving , hopeful immigrants who still see america as a land of opportunity , y until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country our journey is not complete until all our children , from the streets of detroit to the hills of appalachia to the quiet lanes of newtown , know that they are cared for , and cherished , and always safe from harm that is our generation s task to make these words , these rights , these values of llife , and lliberty , and the ppursuit of hhappiness real for every american being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life i it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way , or follow the same precise path to happiness progress does not compel us to settle centurieslong debates about the role of government for all time , but it does require us to act in our time for now decisions are upon us , and we cannot afford delay we cannot mistake absolutism for principle , or substitute spectacle for politics , or treat namecalling as reasoned debate we must act , knowing that our work will be imperfect

politicians , and only a minority of mostly leftofcenter opinion in britain , have been ready to deviate from the unyielding stance that mrs thatcher adopted she sent a british naval task force to recapture the islands after the argentine military dictatorship of leopoldo galtieri dispatched troops to overrun the meager british garrison there to many on the british left , there is little to be served by rehashing the old arguments that were set off when president of argentina wrote to prime minister of britain on thursday it was published as an advertisement in the guardian and another leftofcenter british daily , the independent the letter appeared on the 180th anniversary of jan 3 , 1833 , when an armed clash between the two nations took place on the islands the episode has been settled on by argentina as a watershed moment in a convoluted colonial story that goes back to the 16th century and involves competing claims to sovereignty by britain , france , portugal and spain , which was the colonial power in argentina until the country gained independence in 1816 in the statement that ran in the british papers , mrs kirchner asserted that argentina was forcibly stripped of the malvinas islands argentina s name for the territory in the murky 1833 episode the clash involved a british sloop , an outgunned argentine vessel and an argentine commander s submission to a british demand that he remove the remnants of a mutinous argentine garrison from the islands britain has always rebutted argentine claims that the people who were expelled included argentine civilians , and it contends that british sovereignty was established by a much earlier settlement , dating to the mid18th century the guardian , in its editorial , dismissed this as political window dressing , ultimately irrelevant to the present dispute mrs kirchner s letter , it said , had more to do with a populist bid to revive her slumping popularity in argentina than anything a british brigsloop did 180 years ago the newspaper added , any objective reader of the history of these islands would more likely conclude that this history is mixed , to say the least , and that the rival sovereignty claims are finely balanced the editorial urged the two countries to grapple with the issue diplomatically and to aim , initially , for an agreement on sharing in the bounty of fisheries and in recently discovered offshore oil reserves that some economists believe could turn into a 21stcentury bonanza for the islands mr cameron , though , is having none of it within hours of mrs kirchner s statement , he went before television cameras , saying that the future of the islands would be determined by the falkland islanders and that they would make their feelings known in a referendum to be held in march on the islands' political status that was the expedient britain adopted last year when mrs kirchner campaigned in argentina , and in new york , for a reopening of the sovereignty issue on the 30th anniversary of the 1982 war as long as they choose to stay with the united kingdom , they have my 100 percent backing , mr cameron said for the british leader , it is a safe bet about 70 percent of the islanders are of british descent , and visitors there say there is no more than a scattering of support for an argentine takeover tying the falklands' future to the islanders' choice leaves britain essentially where it was under mrs thatcher she remains a revered figure for mr cameron , not only for her conservative stewardship at 10 downing street but also for her success in turning the falklands issue into her second generalelection victory , in 1983 it is a precedent unlikely to be lost on the current prime minister as he contemplates the general election he must face in 2015 if there is a worry for mr cameron , it lies in the possibility that argentina , with popular passions heightened by mrs kirchner , may make another attempt to seize the islands by force british military commanders say they consider that highly unlikely , since argentina s armed forces have been barely modernized since the military junta there collapsed in the wake of the 1982 conflict , and they lack the power they had then to project air and naval power british forces on the islands have been expensively upgraded , with 800 troops , a new military airfield equipped to take heavy transport jets , a squadron of typhoon fighterbombers and , at times of tension , a nuclear attack submarine prowling the south atlantic but britain miscalculated before , in 1982 , when mrs thatcher s government brushed aside diplomatic warnings of an invasion i never , never expected the argentines to invade the falklands headon , she told an inquiry after the war , according to secret cabinet papers from the period that were released in late december it was such a stupid thing to do , as events happened , such a stupid thing even to contemplate doing the papers included another kind of warning little noticed among the newly published documents was to argentina when the falklands invasion took place the envoy , anthony williams , who was never assigned as an ambassador again , argued eloquently that britain had been wrong to regard the argentine invasion as a simple act of brigandage he said that although the country had its share of vandals , hooligans and roughs , it also had a case that the ambassador suggested could be compared to the from its british and french owners in 1956 by president gamal abdel nasser of egypt if our rightness is not so absolute as it now seems to us , no more is argentine wrongness , he said
jurgen klinsmann will name his roster monday for the united states next two world cup qualifiers the games against costa rica on friday in commerce city , colo , and against mexico next tuesday in mexico city won t decide whether the americans play in the 2014 world cup , but they could make getting there a lot easier , or infinitely more difficult in a twitter q a last week , klinsmann said that he would wait to make sure his players emerged injuryfree from this weekend s games before naming his roster so far , so good \( mostly \) he also said that he was comfortable with brad guzan stepping in for the injured tim howard in goal , and that he expected clint dempsey and fabian johnson who have each missed time recently with injuries to be in camp friends of the goal blog john godfrey and brian sciaretta have breakdowns of a possible united states roster here and here , and steve davis points out that mexico may be feeling just as much heat as the americans by the time the teams collide at the azteca but first things first after losing at honduras , the united states could use a win in at least one of these games \( or not , depending whom you listen to \) since picking up victories in mexico has been , shall we say , problematic over the years , it s in klinsmann s best interest to get three points in the bag before his team arrives there that could lead him to be more aggressive in colorado , in the hopes that he can put the costa ricans on their heels and keep them there but what might that look like \? klinsmann s us teams have never been known for their goal production , but he suddenly seems to have some inform scoring options just when he needs them jozy altidore has been in blistering form in the netherlands all season , breaking dempsey s record for an american in europe \( he scored again sunday against ajax \) herculez gomez is scoring consistently in mexico , and eddie johnson is doing the same in seattle and then there s always dempsey , who returned to the field for spurs on sunday would klinsmann try a 433 instead of the 442 that has been his mainstay , to press the attack \? it s bold , but unlikely service to the forwards , whether it s two , or three , or just one , has always been the problem anyway then again , it s probably good for klinsmann to have a few choices up front behind them , he has mostly questions michael bradley is a lock to start in midfield when he s healthy , and jermaine jones probably is , too klinsmann said as much recently when he discussed how he d like to see bradley and jones form an understanding in the middle that would allow him to dispense with the idea of playing a holding midfielder behind them it s very crucial , the partnership between michael bradley and jermaine jones it s really important that they over time develop a real finetuned understanding that when one goes forward and is attacking , the other has to secure him and stay back here and there they both end up in the opponent s penalty area and you leave kind of a hole behind those are things we would love to work on in the near future , when we play both next to each other and maybe we play without a no 6 that secures them it only works if one stays and the other goes , and this is very important hopefully now we have the time and more training sessions before a game to work on that , and i think in time if we develop that finetuned understanding between these two guys , then we have a big plus the question is how to supplement that partnership is it with wide players like brek shea and damarcus beasley , even if they ve been away from the team for a while , or mls players like graham zusi and eddie johnson , who played well in honduras and scored twice this week for the sounders \? or should klinsmann go with creative types like jose torres and sacha kljestan , who might do a better job in possession \? or sturdier , safer types like danny williams and maurice edu , who could allow both bradley and jones to venture forward \? only klinsmann can weigh those risks and rewards but none of those solutions deal with the americans most glaring problem an inexperienced and underwhelming central defense geoff cameron and omar gonzalez started in the middle in honduras , a bit of a surprise since carlos bocanegra had been a fixture there for years and might have helped ease in one of the two by playing alongside them but throwing players into the deep end is another way to go , and klinsmann did it and it didn t work but remember klinsmann is looking to next summer , and beyond , and while sliding the experienced bocanegra back in for the next two games might be an easy fix , he will be 34 in may and rarely plays these days in spain s second division choosing a new tandem to put between timothy chandler and fabian johnson in a younger back line would be tantamount to admitting that cameron and gonzalez aren t up to the job that s probably not the message klinsmann wants to send right now , to them or to the rest of his team but until that puzzle is solved , he may have to play it safe us soccer announced thursday that the national team would host belgium for the first time , on may 29 in cleveland \( 8 pm , espn2 \) the united states is also expected to face germany in a friendly on june 2 in washington the germans have listed the game on their schedule even though us soccer has not confirmed it as preparation for world cup qualifiers at jamaica \( june 7 \) and home to panama \( june 11 \) the friendlies raise an interesting possibility if he s interested , and if he s is back in form with the los angeles galaxy , and \( especially \) if the national team is in trouble in qualifying , those games could offer landon donovan an opening to rejoin the team in time for this summer s gold cup and the fall qualifiers but that s a lot of ifs the united states women s national team won the algarve cup in portugal on wednesday , beating germany , 20 , to win its ninth title in the event in doing so , the team ran its unbeaten streak to 29 games over all , and its record to 501 under coach tom sermanni alex morgan scored both goals in the final , and one in the 11 tie with sweden that put the americans in the championship game the united states also defeated iceland and china you can see every goal they scored here the sweden game was most likely the strangest experience , since it meant a reunion of the us players and their former coach , pia sundhage morgan said she had difficulty tuning out sundhage , and defender kelley o hara added when she started to yell when i was on her side , i am so used to hearing her voice it was like are you talking to me \? oh , you re talking swedish i m not on your team anymore ! so it was a bit weird the week was also filled with medical news the tournament began with the announcement that goalkeeper hope solo had had surgery for a wrist injury her replacement , jill loyden , broke her left hand in practice before the tournament , and then midfielder carli lloyd broke a bone in her shoulder in the americans opener megan rapinoe missed the final with an undisclosed injury , and amy rodriguez miss the entire tournament and will miss the nwsl season because she s pregnant  lloyd will be out six weeks , and solo will miss three to four months want to know how she s feeling \? go ask her she ll be at an autograph show in new jersey on sunday http tco r2laafipie here s the link for the signing tomorrow ! hope to see you there !  hope solo \( hopesolo \) 16 mar 13 bring cash and say hello to butterbean he ll be there , too

charlotte , nc the surprise is not that is partowner of a kentuckybred thoroughbred that once was considered a potential entrant in the mickelson , who enjoys placing wagers on major sporting events like the super bowl , grew up in san diego , not far from the del mar racetrack the surprise is that the horses never grabbed hold of mickelson s imagination or wallet the real horseman in the family is mickelson s younger brother , tim , the men s golf coach at arizona state i would be surprised if he knows the name of our horse , mickelson s brother wrote in an email under review is the name of the colt , and the verdict is in on mickelson s horse racing acumen he has none i'm trying to get into it , mickelson said friday after taking a twostroke lead at the wells fargo championship at quail hollow he and i are fractional owners in a horse , but i could n't tell you the name of it the horse , a gray son of even the score , won his first race , a 50 , 000 maiden claimer , last august in arlington park and finished second its next time out under review has not raced since being injured in february , but all is not lost mickelson carded a fiveunder 67 for a 36hole total of nineunder 135 , two strokes ahead of scott gardiner \( 67 \) , nick watney \( 70 \) and george mcneill \( 68 \) if he had done that , mickelson said , referring to under review s racing saturday in louisville , i probably would be there , because i 've never been to the derby i hear what a great environment it is , but i'm kind of happy it did n't work out because i like being right here gardiner , a 37yearold tour rookie from australia , made three cuts in his first 12 starts , so he seemed surprised as anybody to be two strokes off the lead after a secondround 67 have you seen my r sum this year \? gardiner joked asked what his expectations were coming into the tournament , gardiner , who lives in arkansas , his wife s home state , laughed and said , agony gardiner , the first player of aboriginal descent to have full status on the pga tour , has not had a threeputt in two rounds , which is more than rory mcilroy , the world no 2 , can say mcilroy , the 2010 champion and the only top10 player in the field , threeputted from 15 feet on his first hole friday en route to a 71 , which left him in a fiveway tie for fifth at six under nobody s game has been more scrutinized than mcilroy s , since he changed equipment at the start of the year asked about his switch from titleist to nike again on friday , he said , i'm comfortable with my game mickelson , a winner in phoenix , struggled toward the end of thursday s round , his first competitive appearance since the masters he drained a 19foot putt on the final hole to avoid a bogeybogey finish i got just a little bit tired , i think , he said mickelson s game friday was at its sharpest down the stretch i know that i 've been hitting it well , even though i have n't shown you the first 28 holes , he said and everything else feels pretty good short game , chipping putting , irons feel pretty good mickelson is the only player who has not missed a putt from inside 10 feet i have to drive it better to be more aggressive to shoot lower this weekend , mickelson said , because i'm getting as much out of the round as i can notes after sergio garc a finished his round of 68 but before he signed his scorecard , he was accompanied by tour rules officials to the television compound they reviewed how he marked his ball on the 17th green after someone watching the golf channel telecast called and questioned it the rules officials accepted garc a s explanation that he marked his ball to the side to avoid stepping on the line of his playing partner , bill haas , but placed the ball as close as possible to the original spot garc a , who is at four under for the tournament , said he would have accepted a penalty without complaint if it turned out he had gained any advantage the way my dad brought me up in golf and everything , he showed me that the game is the biggest thing , garc a said
washington welcomed prime minister of to the white house on wednesday , seeking to bolster his new civilian government and mend perennially frayed ties between the countries but mr sharif said after the meeting that he had asked mr obama to halt american drone strikes in pakistan , broaching an issue that has aggravated tensions the president did not respond publicly , saying only that the two sides needed to find ways to fight terrorism that respect pakistan s sovereignty , that respect the concerns of both countries it s a challenge , it s not easy , mr obama said , with mr sharif seated next to him we committed to working together and making sure that rather than this being a source of tension between our two countries , that it can be a source of strength for us working together in a constructive and respectful way to symbolize a new beginning , the obama administration will release more than 15 billion in aid to pakistan , which had been held up because of tensions over the commando raid that killed osama bin laden in 2011 , as well as the killing of two civilians by a cia contractor in lahore and a wayward american airstrike that killed 24 pakistani soldiers near the afghan border aside from the reference to drones delivered in a tone so soft that reporters in the room strained to hear him mr sharif also sounded conciliatory terrorism , he said , was a shared threat that required serious and sincere efforts without indulging into any blame game by the reckoning of experts , it was the third time since the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , that the united states and pakistan have tried to reset their relationship after the ouster of president pervez musharraf , who resigned in 2008 , the new obama administration began an assiduous courtship of his civilian successor , asif ali zardari but it also ratcheted up its use of drones to target terrorism suspects in pakistan s frontier areas near afghanistan , fanning a wave of antiamerican sentiment across the country a report released this week by amnesty international contradicted the administration s assertions that the drone strikes have become increasingly accurate , killing few civilians the group says at least 19 civilians have been killed in two drone strikes in the pakistani province of north waziristan since january 2012 on wednesday , mr obama pointed to mr sharif s election the first successful completion of a full , civilianled political cycle in pakistan s history as a harbinger of change and he offered american help with energy and publicworks projects to rebuild pakistan s economy but some experts said that mr sharif had yet to show much progress on either the economy or fighting terrorism , and warned that this reset , like others before it , was prone to dashed expectations i'm all for engagement , but it should be engagement without delusions , said husain haqqani , a former pakistani ambassador to the united states none of the fundamentals are going to change as a result of this meeting with the united states' winding down the afghan war , mr obama reminded mr sharif of the importance of a stable , sovereign afghanistan american officials have long been suspicious of links between the pakistani military and militant groups like the haqqani network , which has carried out attacks on westerners in afghanistan for its part , the sharif government has signaled an interest in negotiating with the pakistani taliban , a process that analysts said the united states should encourage if part of our strategy for keeping ourselves out of the talks is not to disrupt it with the use of drones , then i could imagine we could seriously curtail our target list during which time the pakistani government could pursue its talks , said daniel markey , an expert on pakistan at the council on foreign relations , who has published a book on the americanpakistani relationship , no exit from pakistan mr sharif brought with him a delegation that included his finance minister but not the army chief of staff , gen ashfaq parvez kayani , who often accompanied mr zardari on these trips analysts said that was a hopeful sign for the resilience of the civilian leadership mr sharif will soon choose a successor to general kayani , an appointment fraught with meaning , given that his previous stint as prime minister ended in 1999 when mr musharraf engineered a coup while a statement released by the white house after the meeting praised mr sharif for pakistan s work on nuclear security , it omitted any discussion of two of the biggest sticking points in the relationship , both concerning pakistan s nuclear arsenal it made no mention of the administration s concerns that pakistan , which has never signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , is modernizing its nuclear arsenal with small , tactical weapons privately , american officials have expressed fear these weapons , intended to deter india , are easier to steal than pakistan s first generation of arms during an interview in new york last month , mr sharif said the country s nuclear arsenal was safe , and he sidestepped a question on his country s nuclear modernization effort there was also no mention in the white house statement of the fact that pakistan has blocked one of mr obama s key initiatives negotiating the fissile material cutoff treaty , which would block nations from making more fuel that could be used in
the actioncomedy dabangg 2 , starring salman khan , has surpassed the 2 billionrupee \( 409 million \) mark to become the third highestgrossing bollywood production ever but india s professional film critics completely missed the attraction dabangg 2 sees mr khan reprising his role as chulbul pandey , a police officer in uttar pradesh who styles himself after robin hood , robbing from the bad guys to help the needy pandey tangles with a local goon , bachcha bhaiyya , played by the south indian star prakash raj bhaiyya ends up causing pandey s wife to miscarry , driving pandey into a ragefueled quest for revenge although the first dabangg grossed 22 billion rupees within two weeks of its release in september 2010 , film critics had low expectations for the sequel , which they roundly panned it is pointless to analyze dabanng 2 as pure cinema , sudhish kamath said in his review of the film for the hindu newspaper because it s not it s bhai porn for the guys who work overtime at the gym , he said , using the hindi word for brother it s futile to dissect the screenplay because there is none all lines are just variations of i can beat you up don t mess with me sanjukta sharma , features editor at mint , called the movie a disappointment it had nothing to keep me engaged , she said in her review if the success of dabangg 2 has confounded the critics , they can agree on one thing dabangg 2 is salman khan and salman khan is dabangg 2 if the movie has succeeded , they say , it s only because of the actor s sheer star power though the film critic anupama chopra generally trashed the sequel , she called mr khan s character a superhero without a cape her plea can someone please write a terrific plot for this terrific character \? nandini ramnath , a film journalist at mint , said any film in which mr khan stars is bound to be a hit salman khan represents a superheroic unreconstructed indian male the romantic and monogamous , dutybound and dutiful , fearless and brave , oldfashioned yet forwardlooking man , she said mr khan s last five releases have collectively exceeded 1 trillion rupees at the box office , but his popularity didn t explode until the release of dabanng before the movie , mr khan had been largely seen as the actor for the unsophisticated masses , whose target audience and fans would reside in smaller towns and villages , while the other two members of bollywood s khan trio shah rukh khan and aamir khan had fans who flocked to multiplexes in the cities dabangg changed everything , said shohini ghosh , professor of film studies at jamia millia islamia in an article for caravan an actioncomedy set in the rural badlands , dabangg was not only a sensational hit in salman s traditional fan base , but also captured the imagination of the urban middleclasses , who were prone to deride salmanstarrers as lacking class and taste according to ms ramnath , it was the movie s comicbook storytelling style and ironic , selfparodying tone of the film that made it a hit mr khan s stardom first gained momentum during the 1990s as muslim viewers in india , feeling marginalized by the hindu majority , identified with the muslim actor , said professor ghosh the entire decade of the 1990s , and a large part of the next , witnessed a heightened communalization of public spaces as hindu right forces consolidated political power following the demolition of babri masjid , she said muslims were cast as unreliable citizens whose loyalties were perpetually in doubt the anxiety suffered by the ordinary muslim who could be randomly targeted for interrogation , torture and incarceration merely on the basis of suspicion found reflection , as it were , in the unpredictable vicissitudes that beset salman khan mr khan s legal troubles included charges that he hunted protected blackbucks and that he drove recklessly in an accident that killed a sleeping pavement dweller he was never convicted , which may have appealed to underprivileged muslims who felt they were being unfairly targeted by the justice system , said ms ghosh mr khan s later films , like tumko na bhool paayenge and garv , began emphasizing harmony between muslims and hindus , which professor ghosh said broadened mr khan s appeal among indian viewers even though the success of dabangg 2 has cemented mr khan s box office power , critics are still slow to get on the khan bandwagon there won t be a sensible salman khan film , says the film critic rajeev masand he doesn t see merit in a story or the depth in its characters in both dabanggs , at least he has a wholesome character
it hardly seems possible , considering that super bowl week is the nfl s ultimate fantasy circus , where all things nfl are universally hailed as good and american and righteous , but the assembled media might have actually succeeded in scrubbing the sugarcoating off at least one corner of reality because sometime in the middle of questioning ray lewis about his use or nonuse of a banned substance to help him recover from injury , or asking player after player questions about the potential state of his brain with the creeping realization that many of them might not fare so well , or delving into the issue of homophobia in the sport , the fantasy world started looking not so fantastic and what has become painfully clear and you can thank the unfathomableness of the phrase deer antler spray for this is that succeeding in this sport or any other lucrative one has now trumped everything else players are apparently willing to do anything , try anything , risk unknowable consequences , to get to this level of success really , any entrepreneur worth his or her salt should be scraping the next great performance enhancer from bunny toenails selling it to athletes seems to be as simple as hawking a candy bar to a sugar addict it might sell even faster if you tell them it cures concussion effects no , it s not tested or proven and we have no idea what body parts might suffer irreversible damage , but hey , it could shave a week off the recovery time for that leg injury ! how many cases would you like \? you want to win , do n't you \? what are you waiting for \? yes , this appears to be where we have arrived in that little scrubbedbare corner of reality , baltimore s ed reed can be found openly worrying about his brain after years of skullrattling hits , as and the player turned analyst rodney harrison admits that his history of concussions , over a career that included two super bowl wins , about his health and future and 49ers cornerback chris culliver is facing the realworld backlash to yes , he s now walking them back \( by saying yes , , whatever that means \) but also showing how far from acceptance these guys really are ,  but if reality has been an unusually tough competitor in this super bowl week , it still often ends up being buried in a pile of nonsense the fantasy world prevails eventually you needed only to drop in on lewis holding court after that reported he used the deer antler spray to be spun back into the world where none of this will puncture the lewis myth , , because he and the nfl are still punctureresistant lewis is particularly adept at holding reality at bay , , so much so that reality decides to give up and go grab lunch instead after all , lewis has never tested positive for something they cannot detect in a test yet case closed ! \( if only vijay singh were so charismatic , his would go away quickly , too , but he has help from writers like who believe he should not be punished for using a banned substance because it sounds so silly \) soccer has been far less successful in staying inside a mythical bubble these days , thanks to racist fans who persist in turning some games into hate festivals the latest outbreak came in a dutch league game when den bosch fans on the american player jozy altidore , who plays for az alkmaar altidore gained respect by handling it so well , , but soccer s ruling parties still have to answer to why more has n't been done to curb the ugliness fortunately , the nba s big news was controversial only in a purely sporting sense with the owners of the memphis grizzlies accused of by trading rudy gay while warns that the nba s successful lockout strategy means more teamdismantling is ahead , others like argue it was n't entirely a crazy move , especially if you are n't convinced that gay was the key to a championship ok , at least the grizzlies did not try to afford gay s contract by raffling off assault rifles to raise money no , that tactic is apparently only being used by sports success above all else , remember ! that s the lesson of super bowl week
on the day after the super bowl , i got a call from michael mcadoo , a 22yearold defensive lineman for the winning baltimore ravens i had been expecting his call for several weeks , ever since the north carolina court of appeals against the ncaa and the university of north carolina , where he had played for two years before being declared permanently ineligible though he did n't dress for the big game he s been injured most of his short professional career mcadoo had attended the team s practices and meetings he told me he 'd been too busy to call earlier athletes almost never win lawsuits against the ncaa there is , after all , no constitutional right to play college sports , and because the ncaa is a voluntary organization made up of member institutions , courts are loath to interfere , even when the rules seem unfair in 2008 , in his first semester at north carolina , mcadoo had asked a former tutor to help him write citations for a paper , something he was unsure about with the due date fast approaching , the woman whom he was n't supposed to talk to because she was no longer an official tutor essentially wrote the citations herself several years later , in the middle of , the email exchange between mcadoo and the former tutor was unearthed , and his actions were reported to the ncaa and the school s honor court the honor court ruled that mcadoo should be suspended for a semester never one to show mercy , , barring him from ever playing college football again mcadoo sued to get reinstated , but the case was tossed because his college career ended prematurely , he signed with the ravens for the professional minimum \( which , at 450 , 000 a year , is admittedly none too shabby \) when stories like mcadoo s burst into public view , the athlete is almost always cast as the villain , a cheater gaming the academy but , in this case , mcadoo was the true victim the real scandal is what goes on under the rubric of academic counseling it is not news , of course , that universities accept athletes who read at the fifthgrade level or worse quite often academic counseling is remedial but mcadoo was n't in that category he had been an ok student in high school , and his mother , a schoolteacher , was adamant that he get a college education he told his recruiters he wanted to major in criminal justice once he got on campus , however , he was quickly informed by his academic counselors that north carolina did n't have a criminal justice major according to mcadoo , his counselor picked his major , africanamerican studies , because it would n't interfere with football practice among the first classes he was assigned \( as he phrases it \) was a swahili course , an independent studies class taught by the department chairman , julius nyang'oro there was n't any class , mcadoo recalled you sign up you write the paper you get credit i had never seen anything like it he never once met his professor despite the strange circumstances , he researched and wrote the paper it was that paper that got him in the trouble with the ncaa all the academic counselors as they were called and they all steered athletes to them , says mary willingham , a former academic counselor at the university but when the ncaa went after mcadoo , there was no mention of the phony classes the school certainly never mentioned them , and as for the ncaa , all it cared about was whether mcadoo had committed academic fraud for getting citation help in a class that never met mcadoo s contention that he had no reason to believe he had done anything wrong , because he had simply done what he 'd been told to do fell on deaf ears his college career was sacrificed so that the ncaa could maintain its longstanding pretense that college athletes are supposed to be students first the paper classes were eventually exposed by , after which the university asked former gov james martin of north carolina to conduct an investigation martin , who issued his report a few months ago , 216 courses were problematic , and that as many as 560 grades had been changed he laid all the problems at the feet of nyang'oro \( who had earlier been allowed to retire \) , and one department colleague martin insisted that the scandal was n't strictly an athletic one , because nonathletes also took some of the paper classes well , maybe as for michael mcadoo , the public humiliation still stings i had days when i was so depressed , i could barely get out of bed , he told me he feels that he put his trust in an institution that ultimately betrayed him i would still like to get a college degree someday , he said but not at the university of north carolina they just wasted my time
nairobi , kenya the target of the american commando raid in the horn of africa , a kenyan of somali origin known as ikrimah , is one of the militant group s top planners for attacks beyond its base in , an american official said sunday though mr ikrimah had not been tied directly to the shabab s deadly assault on a shopping mall in nairobi last month , fears of a similar attack against western targets broke a deadlock among officials in washington over whether to conduct the raid specialoperations commanders were in favor , pushing for a more aggressive response to the rising threat from the group in somalia , while administration officials were nervous about incurring american military casualties as it turned out , there were none , according to a united states official but mr ikrimah was not captured , and there is as yet no evidence that he was killed in the firefight that broke out on the somali coast in the early hours of saturday morning mr ikrimah is an associate of two al qaeda operatives who were involved in the 1998 bombing of the american embassy in nairobi and in the 2002 attacks on a hotel and an airline in mombasa seal team 6 , the navy commando unit that killed the al qaeda leader osama bin laden , was dispatched to try to apprehend him the approached the somali coast under cover of darkness for what was supposed to be a stealthy snatchandgrab operation from a seaside villa in the port town of baraawe but instead of slipping away with the senior militant they had come to capture , the seals found themselves under sustained fire the american troops retreated unharmed after inflicting casualties on the shabab defenders , but the militant group has claimed victory in the skirmish on saturday al shabab can lick their wounds and take some satisfaction that , after all , they repulsed the world s most powerful military force , said bruce hoffman , director of the center for security studies at georgetown university on the other hand , for al shabab it sends a pretty disquieting message that the us is willing to intervene and bring the war right to their doorstep many questions about the raid remained unanswered on sunday the villa might have been a residence belonging to ahmed abdi godane , the shabab s leader , according to local residents in baraawe who were reached by phone on sunday the spokesman for the shabab , sheik abdiaziz abu musab , denied that the villa housed anything other than normal fighters , saying it was like any other house it is not that special analysts said it was highly unlikely that the raid had resulted in the death of either mr godane or mr ikrimah if it had , you would think the us would make a major fuss about it , said abdi aynte , director of the heritage institute for policy studies in mogadishu the fact that they do n't know they 've killed someone or not tells us a lot about the fact that the raid was not too successful saturday s operation came after months of simmering tensions inside the american government about whether directassault missions in somalia were worth the potential risks to american troops the evolution of threats has refocused counterterrorism resources and attention on africa and on terrorist groups operating in that region , said valentina soria , a security analyst at ihs jane s in london former officials and somalia experts said that the pentagon s joint special operations command has been collecting more precise intelligence for some time about the whereabouts of senior shabab leaders , and have pushed for permission to carry out captureorkill missions inside the country state department officials wondered whether such raids could accomplish enough to justify the significant risks the american troops would run animating the discussions have been questions about whether al shabab posed a danger to americans compared with groups like al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , which has tried to attack the united states on several occasions the attack on the westgate mall in nairobi last month , which left more than 60 people dead , provides the impetus politically to respond to the changing threat , said bill braniff , executive director of start , a terrorism research center based at the university of maryland the mall attack yielded intelligence leads , as militants actively discussed the dayslong siege in kenya among themselves tracing those discussions made it easier to determine the militants' whereabouts planning for the commando raid began more than a week ago , an official said the opportunity question is about intelligence when do you have enough information to act \? said mr braniff when you do have information , that tends to force your hand the raid in baraawe was the most significant operation by american troops in somalia since commandos killed saleh ali saleh nabhan , a qaeda mastermind , in a raid near the town four years ago ahmed abdulkadir warsame , a militant commander who acted as the group s liaison with al qaeda s branch in yemen , was apprehended in april 2011 by the united states military in the gulf of aden last year , a team of navy seals rescued two hostages held by somali , also without suffering any casualties the shabab spokesman , mr musab , claimed the group had advance word that the raid on saturday was coming , though its nature was unclear there was some information that there was going to be a strike that took place , he said , adding that the group s fighters fired the first shots in the firefight he said the commandos came ashore using small speedboats launched from a larger naval vessel out at sea an american official briefed on the operation said the seals withdrew from the firefight to avoid civilian casualties a local witness said he saw four fresh graves for militants killed by the seals but the losses were unlikely to put a dent in the activities , at home or abroad , of the shabab , a group with thousands of committed fighters even so , analysts said the message sent by the raid might have been more important than the outcome the shabab territories are dwindling , so that means the shabab leaders will be more vulnerable , said stig hansen , a norwegian academic who is writing a book on the resurgence of islamic militancy in africa they wanted to show that it costs the shabab to do international operations
ten years after it began , the still haunts the united states in the nearly 4 , 500 troops who died there the more than 30 , 000 american wounded who have come home the more than 2 trillion spent on combat operations and reconstruction , which inflated the deficit and in the lessons learned about the limits of american leadership and power it haunts iraq too , where the total number of casualties is believed to have surpassed 100 , 000 but has never been officially determined and where one strongman was traded for another , albeit under a more pluralistic system with a democratic veneer the country is increasingly influenced by iran and buffeted by the regional turmoil caused by the arab spring in 2003 , president george w bush and paul wolfowitz , the deputy defense secretary , used the attacks on sept 11 , 2001 , to wage preemptive war against saddam hussein and a nuclear arsenal that did not exist they promised a free and peaceful iraq that would be a model of democracy and stability in the arab world while no one laments saddam s passing and violence is down from peak war levels , the country is fragile , with grave tensions between sunnis and shiites and arabs and kurds that could yet erupt into civil war or tear the state apart a state department travel warning last month described iraq as dangerous , with numerous insurgents , including al qaeda in iraq , still active , and said americans were at risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence on tuesday , in baghdad killed more than 50 people and wounded nearly 200 yet none of the bush administration s war architects have been called to account for their mistakes , and even now , many are invited to speak on policy issues as if they were not responsible for one of the worst strategic blunders in american foreign policy in posted recently by the conservative american enterprise institute , mr wolfowitz said he still believed the war was the right thing to do will he and his partners ever have the humility to admit that it was wrong to prosecute this war \? president obama opposed the iraq war from the start and has been singleminded about ending it , withdrawing the last combat troops in 2011 american influence in iraq has greatly declined since then and mr obama s attention , like that of most americans , has shifted to other priorities iraqis are responsible for their own future but the country is a front line in the conflict between moderate islam and al qaeda , not to mention its role as an oil producer it requires more sustained american involvement than we have recently seen iraq is a reminder of the need for political leaders to ask the right questions before allowing military action and to listen honestly rather than acting on ideological or political impulses mr bush led the war , but democrats as well as republicans in congress endorsed it iraq also shows the limits of america s influence in regions where sectarian enmity remains strong and where democracy has no real history that experience is informing american policy judgments more generally it has affected decisions about syria , where president obama has been right to move cautiously for a long time the syrian opposition was divided , and it was hard to know which group , if any , deserved help it also made sense not to rush into another costly war in another arab country that could fuel new antiamerican animosities and embroil the united states for another decade but with the in its third year , the fighting has already spilled over the borders , destabilizing its neighbors , even as al qaedaaffiliated rebels play a bigger role the reasons for opposing direct american involvement in syria remain strong , but the united states needs to calibrate its policies continually and should not allow the iraq experience to paralyze its response to different circumstances the lessons of iraq , however , seem to fade when it comes to iran many of the conservatives who strongly supported the charge into iraq are fanning calls for united states military action to prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon president obama has also been threatening all options if negotiations to curb iran s ambitions are not successful , and many lawmakers seem ready to take action against iran soon the iraq war was unnecessary , costly and damaging on every level it was based on faulty intelligence manipulated for ideological reasons the terrible human and economic costs over the past 10 years show why that must never happen again
with his 27point , 10rebound , 8assist performance in a 11087 win over the milwaukee bucks sunday night , lebron james served quick notice that his imminent most valuable player award will be mere window dressing on what is looking like yet another march to the nba finals for the heat that james scored his 27 on only 11 shots from the field the fewest he has taken in a playoff game made it all the more impressive a few hours earlier , indiana s paul george was putting the finishing touches on an incendiary performance of his own by way of his first playoff tripledouble \( 23 points , 11 rebounds , and 12 assists \) , george who was presented with this year s most improved player award on tuesday led the thirdseeded pacers to a 10790 win over atlanta in game 1 of their playoff series but where james dazzled with a mix of pinpoint 3pointers and aggressive drives , george made hay by doing something he has traditionally been reluctant to do drawing fouls , and drawing them often with a blend of transition takes and aggressive halfcourt drives , george earned a whopping 18 trips to the freethrow line that s the most a pacer has garnered in a playoff game since jermaine o neal in 2005 , and the secondmost all time behind reggie miller s 19 against the knicks in the 1994 eastern conference finals george made good on his first 17 attempts , tying miller s 1994 mark that george was focused at the line should come as no surprise he shot a careerhigh 81 percent this season , improving for the third year in a row but as accurate as george has been , his inconsistency in earning attempts has long left his team and its fans scratching their heads during the regular season , george averaged a middling 35 free throw attempts per game below isaiah thomas and tyson chandler , and just above the likes of glen big baby davis and carl landry good players all , but none with the physical gifts and offensive abilities of george although george has improved slightly since entering the league in 2010 \( 17 , 28 , and 35 free throw attempts per game in his first three seasons , respectively \) , his attempts per 36 minutes have held steady at 33 for two years running meanwhile , despite a blossoming repertoire on offense where he has become a focal point in the absence of the injured danny granger george has taken a bit of a hit in his fieldgoal acuracy , with his overall percentage \( 42 percent \) , 3point percentage \( 36 percent \) and true shooting percentage \( 53 percent \) all down from a year ago the reasons for george s dearth of free throws may be diffuse , but a look at his shot selection proves somewhat instructive after attempting 34 percent of his shots at the rim a year ago , he took jsut 27 percent of his attempts from within five feet during the regular season not surprisingly , such a dropoff has been meet with slight increases in mirange jump shots \( up from 22 percent of his attempts a year ago to 24 percent this season \) and three pointers \( 36 percent of his attempts a year ago , 40 percent this season \) there are plenty of reasons why george was the runaway winner for most improved player , including his significant uptics this season in defense , rebounding and distributing george has been motivated in part by his performance against the heat in last year s east semifinals my whole summer was dedicated to that series , george said a lot of things that i watched on tape that i could ve done , that i didn t do , all came down to not being confident dribbling the ball so that was something i spent a lot of time doing this summer now i m confident i m a confident player now if the pacers hope to force a rematch with miami they will need more of that paul george
miami in the absence of any transactions , baseball s nonwaiver trade deadline wednesday afternoon became little more than a chance for the to consider their present state and to reiterate their organizational mindset from one perspective , it seemed curious that a team that had made so many moves based on its future outlook would stand idle , declining to deal away players so it could protect the current fourthplace group but this , too , reflected the mets' longheld plan a buildup toward 2014 , which would include a competitive showing as this season came to a close hours after general manager finished explaining as much to reporters in a conference call , to the before an announced crowd of 18 , 714 at marlins park the team he envisions will revolve around young starting pitching , and wednesday s game represented the next audition round for jenrry mejia , the enigmatic 23yearold righthander who made a scintillating season debut last week mejia , a former top prospect sidetracked by injuries , did not match his last outing , when he pitched seven shutout innings against the washington nationals , displaying electric stuff but in the place of that raw quality , he displayed some grittiness he lasted six innings giving up three runs , six hits and one walk , while striking out four and each one seemed a grind as he battled elbow discomfort from lingering bone spurs manager terry collins said he was pleased i liked what i saw , for sure , he said mejia gave up a basesempty home run to jake marisnick in the second inning in the third , he gave up consecutive sacrifice flies to placido polanco and giancarlo stanton , allowing the marlins to take a 30 lead when it was over , mejia seemed slightly less than satisfied that s not a bad job , six innings , three runs , he said but we can get better ike davis s sixthinning double to right drove in the mets' first run in the eighth , eric young jr walked to start the inning , went from first to third on a groundball out and scored on a passed ball , cutting the marlins' lead to 32 david wright reached second base with only one out , but marlon byrd and josh satin each flied out to end the scoring chance during that inning , collins ran out to check on wright , who was gingerly grabbing his right hamstring after stealing second but he stayed in the game and revealed little about the problem afterward you either play through it or you ca n't , he said , and i can play through this over all , it was a disappointing end to a day when staying competitive was the theme there was little fanfare around the mets' clubhouse before the game as the clock ticked to 4 o'clock the players who were present were mostly huddled around a playstation 3 video game system some delivered small quips to byrd , a possible trade candidate , who smiled as he checked the lineup card an extra time or two alderson said the club did have extensive and substantive discussions about potential trades , but deemed it more worthwhile to remain as competitive as possible through season s end if we can create some momentum this season whether that results in a playoff appearance or not that will have a more positive effect on the organization and our fans than acquiring a few additional midlevel prospects , alderson said , repeating a philosophy he had expressed earlier this season teams inquired about byrd who has performed well while playing under a reasonable contract for the mets but none could match the team s asking price alderson said closer bobby parnell , rumored to be sought by some teams , was never a candidate to be moved the mets spent two years looking for a closer like parnell , alderson reasoned , so it made little sense to try to trade him over the last two and a half years , we 've been trying to accrue talent , and i think we are on the threshold of improving performance and record , alderson said he added , some positive things have happened , and we want to let that play out it is a project that will resume thursday when matt harvey pitches and extend into the coming months i'm just hoping next year at this time we 're in the hunt and our names are being mentioned as guys who are trying to get somebody who can help us win , collins said
timbuktu , mali when the moment of danger came , ali imam ben essayouti knew just what to do the delicate , unbound parchment manuscripts in the 14thcentury mosque he leads had already survived hundreds of years in the storied city of timbuktu he was not about to allow its latest invaders , tuareg nationalist rebels and islamic extremists from across the region , to destroy them now so he gingerly bundled the 8 , 000 volumes in sackcloth , carefully stacked them in crates , then quietly moved them to a bunker in an undisclosed location these manuscripts , they are not just for us in timbuktu , mr essayouti said they belong to all of humanity it is our duty to save them the residents of timbuktu suffered grievously under islamic militant rule almost all of life s pleasures , even the seemingly innocent ones like listening to music and dancing , were forbidden with the arrival of french and malian troops here on jan 28 , life is slowly returning to normal but the city s suffered terrible losses timbuktu is known as the city of 333 saints , a reference to the sufi preachers and scholars who are venerated by muslims here the islamic rebels destroyed several earthen tombs of those saints , claiming such shrines were forbidden during their hasty departure from the city last weekend , the fighters struck another parting blow , setting fire to dozens of ancient manuscripts at the ahmed baba institute , the city s biggest and most important library irina bokova , the director general of unesco , accompanied president fran ois hollande of france here on saturday to get a firsthand look at the damage the city s cultural artifacts had sustained she said that plans are already being made to rebuild the tombs of the saints we are going to reconstruct the mausoleums as soon as possible , ms bokova said we have the plans , we have the ability to do it we think this is important for the future of the malian people , their dignity and their pride in modern times has become a synonym for a remote place but the city thrived for centuries at the crossroads of the region s two great highways the caravan route across the sahara passed right by its narrow warren of streets , bringing salt , spices and cloth from the north , and the niger river brought gold and slaves from west africa traders brought books , and the city s scribes earned their living by copying them out by hand these manuscripts cover a vast range of human knowledge islamic philosophy and law , of course , but medicine , botany and astronomy as well you will find all forms of knowledge in these manuscripts , mr essayouti said every topic under the sun beyond their physical presence , timbuktu s artifacts are a priceless reminder that subsaharan africa has a long history of deep intellectual endeavor , and that some of that history is written down , not just transmitted orally down the generations this is the record of the golden ages of the malian empire , ms bokova said if you let this disappear , it would be a crime against all of humanity the cultural artifacts in timbuktu whose population of around 50 , 000 has shrunk with the latest troubles have faced many dangers over the centuries harsh climate , termites and the ravages of time have taken a toll , along with repeated invasions by the songhai emperors , nomadic bandits , moroccan princes and france yet many of the antiquities have endured it is a miracle that these things have survived so long , mr essayouti said their survival is a testament to the habit of timbuktu s families of hiding away their valuable relics whenever danger is near , burying them deep in the desert konat alpha s family has had a collection of about 3 , 000 manuscripts for generations , and when the islamist rebels arrived mr alpha called a family meeting we need to find a way to safeguard these manuscripts , he told his brothers and his father he was intimately familiar with the many nooks and crannies in which the city s residents have long hid their treasured manuscripts while expanding the family s compound a decade ago , he found a trove of manuscripts hidden inside a wall the previous owners had hidden them so well they forgot them , he said with a shrug he took his family s collection and hid it well he declined to say where we hid them , that is all i will say , he said the manuscripts have been at the center of a broad international effort to preserve the fragile history of timbuktu the governments of south africa and france , along with the ford foundation and others , have spent millions to build a new library to house the largest and most important collection of manuscripts at the ahmed baba institute when the tuareg rebels first arrived in timbuktu in april , they looted and burned many government buildings , and the institute s interim director , abdoulaye ciss , worried that the institute s sleek new library building would become a target but when the islamist rebels arrived a few days later , the library s officials explained to them that the library was an islamic institution worthy of their protection one of the islamist leaders gave his mobile phone number to the guard and told him , if anyone bothers you , call me and i will be here , ' he said but library officials began to worry that the islamists would discover that the library received financing from the united states , so in august they decided to move almost the entire collection , mr ciss said we moved them little by little to avoid rousing suspicion , mr ciss said they were sent to mopti , then on to bamako , the capital , for safekeeping it turned out the worries were not unwarranted in the chaotic final days of the islamist occupation , all that changed a group of militants stormed the library as they were fleeing and set fire to whatever they could find fortunately , they got their hands on only a tiny portion of the library s collection they managed to find less than 5 percent , he said thank god they were not able to find anything else none of the city s libraries are in a hurry to return their collections from their hiding places , even though timbuktu is back under government control french forces are now stationed in gao , timbuktu and outside the town of kidal , in the north , and airstrikes continue against the militants near the border with algeria the fighters have

kabul , afghanistan after meeting again with the leader who is at the top of the afghan pyramid , secretary of state paid a visit on tuesday to a group of women who have managed to make their way in maledominated afghan society the event , held in the secured confines of the american embassy compound , was intended to demonstrate the progress that women have made in afghanistan since the days of rule but it also highlighted the women s apprehensions about the course their country will follow after 2014 , when the government in kabul is scheduled to take full responsibility for security in the country , and the americanled international presence will shrink hassina syed , who runs companies involved in trucking , construction and catering , told mr kerry at the meeting that with the transition approaching , there is a lot of negative effect on the business sector the encounter illustrated the tensions between the american vision for afghanistan , which still includes a democratic system that ensures women s rights , and worries that afghanistan s military and civic institutions might not be able to manage the transition mr kerry , who had earlier met for a second consecutive day with afghanistan s president , hamid karzai , displayed the political skill he developed as a senator from massachusetts as he asked the women about how they had built up their businesses , and headed a soccer ball with one of afghanistan s top female players he then spoke to a group of civic leaders preparing for afghanistan s 2014 election you 're engaged in a remarkable effort , and the whole world is watching , he said afterward , the entrepreneurs expanded on their concerns even with american troops still in the country , ms syed has plenty of challenges , she said , estimating that onethird of her budget is spent on security her major worry now , she said , is that many of the new businesses that have opened in afghanistan , particularly those in construction , transportation and hospitality , will wither without a steady infusion of foreign spending , and may not survive most especially , construction and other businesses are shutting down slowly , ms syed said getting orders from the afghan government that might make up for some of the lost international spending will be hard , she said , because those contracts will be steered to companies with friends in high places only a few people who are really connected with the government , they will just take those things , she said the normal businesspeople , they are not going to get benefit out of the government many businesspeople who have been successful in recent years , but who are apprehensive about the future , are already looking to move their money to the united states , britain or the united arab emirates , ms syed said nadima sahar , who sells jewelry , pottery and artwork made by a network of artists and craftsmen , studied in the united states on a scholarship , earning a master s degree from the university of massachusetts as a woman and also as an afghan , i have my concerns , she said , citing the challenges of maintaining security and women s rights i do n't think that my country mates are really ready to take over the transition process and to handle it as effectively as the us troops have been doing so far with the international community s presence , i think they in a way encouraged women to get involved further and further , she added but ms sahar wonders what will happen if afghan officials negotiate a peace accord with the taliban , whose leaders are determined to reinstitute restrictions on the role of women i have family members who are fleeing the country because they have concern that the situation would n't remain that stable , she said roya mallboob , who manages a software company in the western afghan city of herat that makes educational programs available to women , noted that she had some measure of insulation from trouble because much of her work was done online still , she said , i am worried about the security and who will be the next president for all their concerns , though , none of the women who met with mr kerry on tuesday said they planned to rush for the exit each insisted she would to try to make a go of it as afghanistan takes control of its own security and holds national elections next year i will be the last woman who will leave afghanistan , ms syed said
the fall of vicksburg in july 1863 , which gave the union control of the mississippi river , not only cut the confederacy in half , but it cut off the supply of texas cattle from reaching hungry troops to the east \( and federal blockaders patrolling the gulf of mexico prevented delivery by ship \) consequently , the confederacy increasingly looked to a seemingly unlikely source , florida , as a source of beef for its armies florida s cattle were the first in north america since beef livestock were not native to the western hemisphere , it is believed they were brought over as early as 1521 by expeditions of ponce de leon ranching began before the 17th century around st augustine , which is the oldest city in the united states when florida became a territory in 1821 , it was a frontier plentifully stocked with wild cattle by the eve of the civil war , the state was second only to texas in the per capita value of livestock in the south the central and southern parts of the peninsula were open range exports of live cattle to cuba became an important business in the 1850s , but were curtailed during the early part of the civil war by the union blockade and official but sometimes violated confederate export prohibitions indeed , with a semiwild herd approaching 700 , 000 , florida had almost five times as many cattle as people south florida was cow country except for key west and tampa , only about 3 , 500 of the state s 140 , 000 residents lived south of present day disney world by the end of 1863 the region accounted for 75 percent of the beef cattle leaving the state still , getting cattle from florida s peninsula to confederate armies outside the state was impossible without experienced drovers the area was a honeycomb of seacoast and swamp entire herds could wander aimlessly or vanish within an hour in the trackless region even where the ground was firm , abundant saw grass could cut man and beast to ribbons , while the heat and humidity promoted malaria and yellow fever snakes , hurricanes , feral hogs and panthers could decimate a herd the state s few railroads were mostly near its northern border and none connected to lines in georgia south florida cattle drives took about a month to cover the 300 to 400 miles to georgia railheads government plans to remove rails from the florida railroad company s transpeninsula line and use them to lay a connection to the georgia network were legally resisted by its owners \( paradoxically , the company s chief stockholders were northerners among them was the new york shipping magnate marshall roberts and edward dickerson , a patent attorney , inventor and business rival to designer of the monitor , john ericsson \) the florida railroad company was ably represented in the state by minority shareholder and former senator david yulee through various legal challenges he delayed removal of the iron , and a floridatogeorgia rail link was not completed until a month before appomattox clearly , south florida s cattle represented a strategic weak spot for the confederacy during december 1863 union general daniel woodbury , who commanded federal occupation troops on the island of key west , seized fort myers , on florida s western coast , for use as a base to raid rebel cattle drives the fort had been abandoned in the late 1850s when it was the southernmost settlement along the gulf coast of the mainland in addition to hardy pioneers attracted by free ranging cattle , the vast frontier was a haven for rustlers , deserters , runaway slaves , draft evaders and others seeking to avoid the restrictions of an unwanted government general woodbury believed such men might be induced to join the union army he wasn t just speculating before the occupation of fort myers , groups of such loyalists did live in the bush though they were secretly supplied with yankee weapons , the historian robert taylor wrote that some bands became little more than bandits who raided indiscriminately they attacked , looted , and burned local farms with the horrible ease that often comes to men grown callous in war since the federal garrisons at key west and elsewhere would pay for cattle with federal currency instead of less valued confederate scrip , general woodbury envisioned fort myers as a trading and export center to draw herds away from the rebels and toward any paying customers , including cuban buyers to accommodate the necessary ships , the general built a long wharf at fort myers refugees fleeing confederate conscription began to arrive within days of the fort myers occupation militaryaged males coalesced into an irregular force of florida rangers , but were soon incorporated into a new regiment , the second florida \( union \) cavalry it eventually numbered more than 750 men by the early spring of 1864 , union infantry reinforcements landed , including a group of africanamericans during the final year of the war companies affiliated with fort myers participated in numerous cattle raids as well as more formal expeditions one was the temporary occupation of tampa and destruction of its defenses at fort brooke another was an attempt to capture florida s capital at tallahassee , which was turned back at the battle of natural bridge a month before appomattox in march 1864 james mckay , who was in charge of confederate cattle procurement in south florida , wrote the state s top commissary officer to say that he would be unable to secure cattle from his district in the next season unless the confederate army challenged incursions from fort myers a result was the formation of the first battalion , florida special cavalry , a battalion of drovers commonly known as the cow cavalry or cattle guard battalion their job was to renew the cattle drives , defend against union cattle forays and eventually capture or force the abandonment of fort myers maj charles munnerlyn of georgia was given command his political connections obtained earlier as a confederate congressman proved valuable for example , he convinced a personnelstingy gen joe johnston , who commanded one of the biggest rebel armies , to provide a core of volunteers with cowhand experience since cow cavalry members were exempt from the military draft , the major received applicants from all over florida but he was selective , because inexperienced cowboys were worse than useless eventually , the cow cavalry consisted of nine companies totaling 800 men , and was active from fort myers to georgia by patrolling a 300mile stretch of dusty trails and open range , the cow cavalry enabled cattle drives to be renewed by october 1864 the general confederate manpower shortage was so severe that the leadership decided to redeploy the special cavalry battalion to georgia or virginia but commissarygeneral lucius northrop successfully appealed to secretary of war james seddon , writing that nowhere in the confederacy can services of these few detailed men be so valuable as in the present organization by february 1865 the success of the cow cavalry led to rumors that fort myers might soon be abandoned by the union leading about 200 members of selected cow cavalry companies , maj william footman decided to give the approximate 300 yankees remaining in the fort a push although footman originally planned a surprise attack , after capturing five soldiers outside the compound who told him about the presence of women and children inside , he decided to send a surrender demand the demand was refused the resulting , southernmost battle of the civil war east of the mississippi , evolved into a longrange skirmish with small arms and a few light artillery , resulting in few casualties on either side unable to take the fort by force , the rebels retreated into the bush , but federals unilaterally abandoned the place a few weeks later fort myers was not long abandoned the following year permanent settlers used lumber from the vacant structures to build new homes simultaneously , nearby punta rassa became the northern terminus of a telegraph line to havana that facilitated commercial transactions , and the area became a leading export station for cattle less than 20 years later , thomas edison bought waterfront acreage for a winter home henry ford and harvey firestone joined him when the three emerged

advocates of supplemental security income , or ssi , have been steaming at a december column that i wrote from kentucky , arguing that it unfairly maligns a program that is a lifeline to the disabled here s one criticism , here s another , and here are letters we published i ve tweeted some of the criticisms and responded with tweets , but i haven t really engaged in a broader discussion , so that s what i d like to do here first , you ll see below a memo from two attorneys from community legal services in philadelphia to the times s public editor \( they ve agreed to make the memo public \) , and then \( after their footnotes \) a response by me to the points they raise the recent column by nicholas kristof on the supplemental security income \( ssi \) program for children manifests serious problems in journalistic rigor , accuracy and professionalism , problems that warrant independent scrutiny by the times s public editor the ssi program has a history of problematic media coverage that has been exploited by politicians to the great detriment of low income , disabled children and their families the allegation of local eastern kentucky parental behavior that mr kristof assumed to be true and upon which he based a call to congress to defund the national ssi program is extraordinarily similar to unfounded allegations also originating in the poor , rural south , in an earlier round of ssi child disability media frenzy back in the mid 1990s , it was erroneously asserted that parents coached their children to act retarded or dumb to get ssi 1 well over 100 , 000 disabled children were terminated from the ssi program after congress adopted major eligibility restrictions based on these untrue press reports more recently , house republicans passed two budget resolutions for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 , that were not adopted by the senate , that would have cut respectively 15 billion and 35 billion from the ssi childhood program after another media attack that was fully refuted by ssa and others the following are our specific concerns with the column by mr kristof 1 moms and dads fear that if kids learn to read , they are less likely to qualify for a monthly ssi check the kids get taken out of the program because the parents are going to lose the ssi check , said billie oaks , who runs a literacy program in breathitt county ky the breathitt county , kentucky parental behavior that mr kristof assumed to be true , is not based on convincing facts mr kristof , making this allegation the lead and theme of his column , appears not to have talked to any kentucky parent who possessed this fear , nor identified one person who took a child out of a literacy program because of their misperception that doing so would aid in maintaining the child s ssi eligibility mr kristof relies solely on the report of one ms oaks he assumes the accuracy of her assertion , and jumps to sweeping generalizations mr kristof interviewed and quoted three local county school officials , none of whom spoke to this alleged phenomenon they were , ron combs , melanie stevens , and wayne sizemore , the latter director of special education in breathitt county a cowriter of this memo , jonathan stein , spoke via phone with mr sizemore , who confirmed his awareness of his personal knowledge of the ssi program , especially for children in special education , but stated to mr stein that he neither knew nor had ever heard of local parents taking a child out of a literacy program to maintain ssi the ssi program for poor , disabled children has a history of flawed media coverage on multiple occasions , erroneous reports have been exploited by politicians to the great detriment of low income , disabled children and their families did mr kristof ask mr sizemore or any other local school officials whether they were aware of parents taking children out of a literacy program due to misperceptions about ssi eligibility \? we do not understand why mr kristof relied on a second or thirdhand report from a single source ms oaks allegations are unfounded and erroneous it appears upon investigation that breathitt county has just one literacy program , an inschool , volunteer grandparent program of 1 to 1 mentoring it has nothing to do with eligibility for ssi the inhome early intervention program of save the children , also mr kristof s focus , and similar to what are called hands programs in kentucky , are parenting programs , and are not considered literacy programs unrelated to ssi or literacy programs , local sources in kentucky suggested to us cultural reasons that may cause parents in remote , rural areas such as breathitt county , to be reluctant to permit strangers \( such as the social workers from these programs \) in their homes if mr kristof had more fully investigated the oaks allegation , he might have uncovered some understandable parental behaviors having nothing to do with literacy or ssi mr kristof doubly errs here firstly , illiteracy is not now and has never been a basis for qualifying for ssi disability benefits nowhere does mr kristof seek out or cite a social security administration source regarding the role that school academic performance may or may not play in qualifying for ssi child disability benefits , or make reference to any relevant ssi child disability law or policy rather , he relied on a single source , richard burkhauser , to explain ssi eligibility policies for qualifying disabled children who are attending school mr kristof identifies mr burkhauser as a cornell economist who recently wrote a book on disability programs , but omits mention of mr burkhauser s more relevant and biased affiliation as a resident scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute \( aei \) 2 mr burkhauser is hardly an impartial expert he has testified repeatedly as a republican witness at congressional hearings aimed at cutting ssi and other disability programs a myriad of published federal policies show that social security has long required a medically documented mental or physical impairment that results in marked and severe functional limitations , and that ssa takes a whole child approach looking at a wide variety of evidentiary sources , testing assessments , clinical evaluations , and reports from professionals treating or attending to the child 3 although ssa does consider the plethora of formal school evidence \( grades , aptitude and achievement test scores , teacher and school psychologist reports and special education evaluations \) , ssa policy states explicitly that the agency never relies solely on these measures , but looks to other sources , including medical ones , as well as sources outside the school setting , to determine both initial and continuing disability 4 mr kristof s reliance on a singular source with a known bias on this topic , to standin for actual law and policy , along with his unsubstantiated assumption \( discussed above \) regarding a pattern of parental misbehavior , appear to form the basis for his conclusion that the ssi program is a failed one deserving of major cuts notably , though mr kristof spoke at length with a widely respected policy official and ssi expert at the arc of the united states \( formerly assoc of retarded citizens \) , who provided him with information about social security s actual ssi childhood disability policies \( including those referenced here \) that contradicted the statements of mr burkhauser as well as mr kristof s assumptions and conclusion , nowhere in his column does mr kristof acknowledge that there might be another side to the issue as he presents it a journalist particularly one who writes opinion columns owes his readers the duty of factchecking , especially when delving into policy recommendations for a program that serves as a vital lifeline for 13 million lowincome disabled kids 3 but now 55 percent of the disabilities ssi covers are fuzzier intellectual disabilities short of mental retardation , where the diagnosis is less clearcut \( kristof \) this assertion , not attributed to any source and thus adopted by mr kristof as his own , reveals that mr kristof failed to do his own independent and objective research this erroneous assertion parrots the misconception by mr burkhauser and friends that mental impairments are more subjective or indeterminate than mental retardation \( mr , now called intellectual disability or id \) or physical disabilities social security , in numerous published policies , makes clear that these other , nonmr mental disorders that may qualify a child with mental disorders for ssi , if severe enough and verified by the extensive medical documentation of a medical doctor or psychologist , are anything but fuzzier or less clearcut than mental retardation they include organic mental disorders schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders major depressive or bipolar disorders personality disorders autism and other developmental disorders 5 mr kristof implies that there must be something illegitimate about a disability program for children where the majority receiving benefits have mental disorders yet even minimal research would have revealed that the share of children with mental disorders receiving ssi mirrors the picture of childhood disability in the us and worldwide the world health organization , for example , reports that 67 of all young people with disabilities have one or more mental disorders , and that mental disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide 4 a full 8 percent of all lowincome children are now enrolled in ssi as disabled , at an annual cost of more than 9 billion \( kristof \) this is an error of fact the percentage of lowincome children receiving ssi is half that reported by mr kristof , who may have mistakenly divided the number of children on ssi by those children at or below the federal poverty level , rather than the \( much larger \) number of children at or below 200 of the poverty level \( the widely accepted measure of lowincome \) this error is explained in detail by an analyst at the center on economic policy research , in a responsive column 6 the unmistakable implication of mr kristof s use of the above \( inaccurate \) statistic is that this full 8 percent \( in fact , 3 to 4 \) is a somehow illegitimate percentage , wasting considerable federal dollars is it fair and objective , beyond reporting the true percentage of 3 to 4 \( see note 6 below \) , to neglect any mention of the fact that just one in four children with disabilities in the us receives ssi \? and that the eligibility test for ssi children is so severe that nearly two out of three children who apply for ssi get turned down \? 7 5 i m no expert on domestic poverty \( kristof \) i hope that the budget negotiations in washington may offer us a chance to take money from ssi and invest in early childhood initiatives instead \( kristof \) what a tragedy it would be if mr kristof s column , based as it is on erroneous assertions and inadequate reporting , would do great harm to an extraordinarily important and successful child disability income support program and more importantly , the vulnerable children it serves it is not histrionic to conjecture such a result given the misguided mid1990 s media reports described above , which led directly to major changes in the ssi program by congress , causing over 100 , 000 disabled children to be terminated from the program 8 we grant that in journalism , opinion writers like mr kristof , might have a bit more leeway to inject their opinion whatever it might be on matters that they address but even opinion writers , whether they be columnists or editorial page writers , must nevertheless adhere to standards of factbased , and realitybased conclusions opinion writers cannot distort or ignore the facts , or fail to exercise the journalistic rigor for the truth that one expects of any content published in the new york times , the newspaper of record mr kristof s column does not take into account the importance of ssi to the nearly 13 million children and families who receive benefits 9 by his own admission , mr kristof has almost no factual understanding of how the ssi program works he relied upon uncorroborated sources \( as discussed above \) , and leapt to the conclusion that undetermined amounts of the 9 billion annually going to the ssi children s program should be taken from this program mr kristof s sole acknowledgment that the program might have even limited value is restricted to a single , qualified sentence there s no doubt that some families with seriously disabled children receive a lifeline from ssi \( emphasis added \) by his wording , mr kristof suggests that only a small minority of disabled children rely on the program as a lifeline he fails to report or acknowledge that the ssi program helps families keep children at home and not in institutions provides for the basic essential needs like food , clothing and shelter for children with severe disabilities compensates for the lost wages of parents out of the labor force or who work fewer hours to care for a disabled child meets known , additional costs of raising a disabled child and enhances the disabled child s opportunity to lead a more independent and productive life in adulthood 10 facts are critical , even in opinion columns , particularly when the economic security and wellbeing of so many severely disabled children hangs in the balance 11 we thank you for considering these comments 1 the coaching and parental manipulation allegations were debunked in a myriad of investigations from gao , hhs ig , ssa and others , yet the hyped and erroneous media reports had done their damage in major cutbacks in the program in 1996 see c georges , a media crusade gone haywire , forbes media critic \( 1995

kids receive ssi kristof got 8 from a truth seeker affiliated with aei who manufactured it by dividing the number of children receiving ssi \( 128 million in 2011 \) by the number of children living below the federal poverty line \( 161 million in 2011 \) this would be fine if ssi were limited to kids with incomes below the federal poverty line , but it s not in fact , about half or more of the children receiving ssi have incomes above the federal poverty line , mostly between 100200 of the poverty line so , an accurate ssi participation statistic would use the number of lowincome kids below 200 of the poverty line \( 327 million in 2011 \) dividing the 128 million kids receiving ssi by the 327 million kids under 200 percent of poverty gets us 39 not 8 see http www cepr net index php

harold pollack , a respected economist at the university of chicago , who studies social policy and healthcare , available at http theincidentaleconomistcom wordpress profitingfromachildsilliteracynicholaskristofonthechildhoodssiprogram12  so now back to me , nicholas kristof let me go through stein s and vallas s ponts one by one the first objection is that i jumped to conclusions based on one person s false assertion but the suggestion that parents fear that if their kids learn to read they ll lose ssi benefits did not just come from billie oaks this came up at a lunch discussion with a halfdozen local school officials and several instate save the children representatives ron combs , a principal , was the first person to raise it , as i recall , and then that led to a discussion in which one person after another chimed in it was at that point that billie oaks commented in the way that i quoted her later i ran this by the local grassroots person in breathitt county for save the children , who has lived there all her life , and she adamantly confirmed it so did the superintendent of schools when i reached her separately this was not one person , an outlier , but a consensus , and then the scholar i quote later confirmed that is how the incentives work in all , i interviewed something like a dozen people in kentucky , and several more in washington and elsewhere one may disagree with this column , but it was not materialized out of thin air it was thoroughly reported i also reached out to the most prossi experts i could find , at arc , to lay out what i had found and see if i was missing something , and then read reams of prossi material they sent they didn t really challenge my findings but rather emphasized their take that ssi helps a lot of kids who truly are in need i m sure that s true , as my column notes , but it doesn t allay concerns about poor incentives the memo writes that ssi has a history of flawed media coverage another way of describing that is to say that it s a controversial program that has been the subject of frequent critical newspaper coverage , including in the boston globe and new york times the second accusation is that i relied on a single source , and a biased one , to suggest that illiteracy helps in qualifying for ssi on the contrary , this is something that i discussed at length with the prossi advocates and spent a good dealing of time exploring on the ssi websites and indeed , as the memo then states , the ssa does look at school grades and performance so that illiteracy is a factor it s just not the only factor i think we re actually in agreement that an illiterate child is going to be more likely to win ssi than a literate one as for the notion that i quoted a biased source , well , there are biases on all sides i talked to people on all sides of this issue and quoted burkhauser because i found him particularly knowledgeable and persuasive after all , the whole point of a column is not to catalog the range of different views but to make an argument and burkhauser is a distinguished cornell economist who has written a book on ssi and testified before congress one may disagree with him , but he is eminently qualified the third objection is that i say that while ssi originally covered mostly severe physical handicaps or mental retardation , now 55 percent of the disabilities it covers are fuzzier intellectual disabilities short of mental retardation the memo argues that these impairments aren t fuzzy i m sorry , this runs against a long strain of discussion in the social sciences noting that while blindness or amputation is fairly straightforward , a reading disability or autism is not ssi advocates may believe that they should be covered by ssi , but they are fuzzier to diagnose then a broken leg the fourth objection is that the proportion of low income children on ssi is misstated the 8 percent figure appears on page 88 of richard burkhauser and mary daly s book , the declining work and welfare of people with disabilities , figure 61 , and he confirmed to me its accuracy before publication i reached out to him and daly after receiving this letter , and they again confirm \( for somewhat complicated reasons that i won t summarize here \) that they stand behind it the fifth objection is essentially that i should have embraced ssi instead of criticizing it , ie that i reached the wrong opinion i appreciate the fervor of defenders of ssi , and i don t doubt their good will i appreciate their passion on behalf of disabled kids in america but i think they are on the wrong track if they re trying to overcome poverty , and the defense of ssi feels to me an echo of the defense of aid to families with dependent children , or afdc , a generation ago at that time , defenders of afdc insisted that it would be a calamity when president clinton ended it as part of welfare reform in fact , by almost every neutral account , that calamity did not come to pass , and those advocates were wrong likewise , a generation earlier , those same advocates were wrong when they denounced daniel patrick moynihan s work on poverty \( in fairness , i don t think those attacking afdc were proven right either the end of afdc essentially moved low income people from welfare to lowskilled deadend jobs , and they remained trapped in poverty for the most part ending afdc was quite successful in getting people off welfare without causing a disaster , but it was not a success at ending poverty \) the stories i heard in kentucky resonated with me because i m from an area of rural oregon with many of the same problems , and some of my high school buddies have similar issues with disability the focus of that column from kentucky was actually how early childhood interventions can break the cycles of poverty , and the need to invest in children but invest in ways that make a difference to break these cycles and pathologies ssi hasn t done that , and i don t know of any evidence that ssi for children reduces that person s likelihood of living in poverty as an adult on the contrary , either 4 or 8 percent of poor kids are now supported by ssi \( depending on whom you believe \) and twothirds of those children make the transition at age 18 to the adult disabled lists those kids , in other words , are streamlined to become disabled for the rest of their lives , almost guaranteeing them a handtomouth existence wouldn t we be better off limiting ssi to the most extreme and clearcut cases of disability , and then using the savings for early interventions so that those kids learn to read and can thrive in school \? early childhood education has shown enormous benefits in randomized control trials , so why wouldn t we be better off investing in those programs \? struggling children can use a helping hand early in life , in rural oregon or in rural appalachia or almost anywhere inbetween , while sending checks to parents in part based on the children s failing school performance does not seem to me the wisest and most costeffective way to chip away at poverty but , again , my central point is not hostility for ssi , which i acknowledge is a lifeline for some needy families it s that we should transform our antipoverty programs so that they are based on evidencebased initiatives that will actually create social mobility and move people up the escalator of life
please please be seated thank you before before i begin today , let me say to the families of the innocents who were murdered 33 days ago , our heart our heart goes out to you and you show incredible

for the families who are here , time is not measured in days but it s measured in minutes , in seconds since you received that news another minute without your daughter , another minute without your son , another minute without your wife , another minute without your mom i want to personally thank chris and lynn mcdonnell , who lost a beautiful daughter , grace , and the other parents who i had a chance to speak to for their suggestions for again , just for their the courage of all of you to to be here today i i admire i admire the grace and the resolve that you all are showing and i must say i 've been deeply affected by your faith as well , and the president and i are going to do everything to try to match the resolve you 've demonstrated no one can know for certain if this senseless act could have been prevented , but we all know we have a moral obligation a moral obligation to do everything in our power to diminish the prospect that something like this could happen again as the president knows , i 've worked in this field a long time in the united states senate , having chaired a committee that had jurisdiction over these issues of guns and crime , and having drafted the first gun violence legislation the last gun violence legislation , i should say , and i have no illusions about we 're up against what we 're up against or how hard the task is in front of us but i also have never seen a nation s conscience so shaken by what happened at sandy hook the world has changed , and it s demanding action it s in this context that the president asked me to put together , along with cabinet members , a set of recommendations about how we should proceed to meet that moral obligation we have and toward that end , the cabinet members and i sat down with 229 groups , not just individuals , representing groups 229 groups from law enforcement agencies to public health officials to gun officials to gun advocacy groups to sportsmen and hunters and religious leaders and i 've spoken with members of congress on both sides of the aisle , had extensive conversation with mayors and governors and county officials and the recommendations we provided to the president on monday call for executive actions he could sign , legislation he could call for and longterm research that should be undertaken they 're based on the emerging consensus we heard from all the groups with whom we spoke , including some of you who were the victims of this godawful occurrence , ways to keep guns out of the wrong hands as well as ways to take comprehensive action to prevent violence in the first place we should do as much as we can as quickly as we can , and we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good so some of what you will hear from the president will happen immediately some will take some time but we have begun and we are starting here today , and we 're resolved to continue this fight during the meetings that we held , we met with a young man who s here today i think colin goddard is here where are you , colin \? colin was one of the survivors of the the virginia tech massacre he was in the classroom he calls himself one of the lucky seven and and he 'll tell you he was shot four times on that day and he has three bullets that are still inside him and when i asked colin about what he thought we should be doing , he said that he said , i'm not here because of what happened to me i'm here because of what happened to me keeps happening to other people and we have to do something about it colin , we will colin , i promise you we will this is our intention we must do what we can now and there s no person who is more committed to acting on this moral obligation we have than the president of the united states of america ladies and gentlemen , president barack obama \( applause \) thank you thank you thank you so much thank you , everybody please please have a seat good afternoon , everybody let me begin by thanking our vice president , joe biden , for your dedication , joe , to this issue , for bringing so many different voices to the table , because while reducing gun violence is a complicated challenge , protecting our children from harm should n't be a divisive one now , over the month since the tragedy in newtown , we 've heard from so many , and obviously none have affected us more than the families of those gorgeous children and their teachers and guardians who who were lost and so we 're grateful to all of you for taking the time to be here and recognizing that we honor their memories in part by doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again but we also heard from some unexpected people in particular , i started getting a lot of letters from kids four of them are here today grant fritz \( ph \) , julia stokes \( ph \) , hena zeha \( ph \) and teja goode \( ph \) they 're pretty representative of some of the messages that i got these are some pretty smart letters from some pretty smart young people hena \( ph \) , a thirdgrader you can go ahead and wave , hena \( ph \) that s you \( laughter \) hena \( ph \) wrote , i feel terrible for the parents who lost their children i love my country , and i want everybody to be happy and safe and then grant \( sp \) go ahead and wave , grant \( sp \) \( laughter \) grant \( sp \) said , i think there should be some changes we should learn from what happened at sandy hook i feel really bad and then julia \( sp \) said julia \( sp \) , where are you there you go i'm not scared for my safety i'm scared for others i have four brothers and sisters , and i know i would not be able to bear the thought of losing any of them and these are our kids this is what they 're thinking about and so what we should be thinking about is our responsibility to care for them and shield them from harm and give them the tools they need to grow up and do everything that they 're capable of doing , not just to pursue their own dreams but to help build this country this is our first task as a society , keeping our children safe this is how we will be judged and their voices should compel us to change and that s why last month i asked joe to lead an effort , along with members of my cabinet , to come up with some concrete steps we can take right now to keep our children safe , to help prevent mass shootings , to reduce the broader epidemic of gun violence in this country and we ca n't put this off any longer just last thursday , as tv networks were covering one of joe s meetings on this topic , news broke of another school shooting , this one in california in the month since 20 precious children and six brave adults were violently taken from us at sandy hook elementary , more than 900 of our fellow americans have reportedly died at the end of a gun 900 in the past month and every day we wait , that number will keep growing so i'm putting forward a specific set of proposals based on the work of joe s task force and in the days ahead i intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality , because while there is no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely , no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy , every act of evil , if there is even one thing we can do to reduce this violence , if there s even one life that can be saved , then we 've got an obligation to try and i'm going to do my part as soon as i'm finished speaking here , i will sit at that desk and i will sign a directive giving law enforcement , schools , mental health professionals and the public health community some of the tools they need to help reduce gun violence we will make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by strengthening the background check system we will help schools hire more resource officers , if they want them , and develop emergency preparedness plans we will make sure mental health professionals know their options for reporting threats of violence , even as we acknowledge that someone with a mental illness is far more likely to be a victim of violent crime than the perpetrator and while year after year those who oppose even modest gun safety measures have threatened to defund scientific or medical research into the causes of gun violence , i will direct the centers for disease control to go ahead and study the best ways to reduce it and congress should fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young minds we do n't benefit from ignorance we do n't benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence now , these are a few of the 23 executive actions that i'm announcing today , but as important as these steps are , they are in no way a substitute for action from members of congress to make a real and lasting difference , congress too must act , and congress must act soon and i'm calling on congress to pass some very specific proposals right away first , it s time for congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying to buy a gun \( applause \) the law already requires licensed gun dealers to run background checks , and over the last 14 years , that s kept 15 million of the wrong people from getting their hands on a gun but it s hard to enforce that law when as many as 40 percent of all gun purchases are conducted without a background check that s not safe that s not smart that s not fair to responsible gun buyers or sellers if you want to buy a gun , whether it s from a licensed dealer or a private seller , you should at least have to show you are not a felon or somebody legally prohibited from buying one this is common sense and an overwhelming majority of americans agree with us on the need for universal background checks , including more than 70 percent of the national rifle association s members , according to one survey so there s no reason we ca n't do this second , congress should restore a ban on militarystyle assault weapons and a 10round limit for magazines \( applause \) the type of assault rifle used in aurora , for example , when paired with high capacity magazines , has one purpose to pump out as many bullets as possible as quickly as possible , to do as much damage using bullets often designed to inflict maximum damage and that s what allowed the gunman in aurora to shoot 70 people 70 people , killing 12 , in a matter of minutes weapons designed for the theater of war have no place in a movie theater a majority of americans agree with us on this and by the way , so did ronald reagan , one of the staunchest defenders of the second amendment , who wrote to congress in 1994 urging them this is ronald reagan speaking urging them to listen to the american public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of militarystyle assault weapons \( applause \) and finally , congress needs to help rather than hinder law enforcement as it does its job we should get tougher on people who buy guns with the express purpose of turning around and selling them to criminals and we should severely punish anybody who helps them do this since congress has n't confirmed a director of the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms in six years , they should confirm todd jones , who will be who has been acting and i will be nominating for the post \( applause \) and at a time when budget cuts are forcing many communities to reduce their police force , we should put more cops back on the job and back on our streets and let me be absolutely clear like most americans , i believe the second amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms i respect our strong tradition of gun ownership and the rights of hunters and sportsmen there are millions of responsible , lawabiding gun owners in america who cherish their right to bear arms for hunting or sport or protection or collection i also believe most gun owners agree that we can respect the second amendment while keeping an irresponsible , lawbreaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale i believe most of them agree that if america worked harder to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people , there would be fewer atrocities like the one that occurred in newtown that s what these reforms are designed to do they 're common sense measures they have the support of the majority of the american people and yet that does n't mean any of this is going to be easy to enact or implement if it were , we 'd already have universal background checks the ban on assault weapons and highcapacity magazines never would have been allowed to expire more of our fellow americans might still be alive , celebrating birthdays and anniversaries and graduations this will be difficult there will be pundits and politicians and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning of a tyrannical allout assault on liberty , not because that s true but because they want to gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue for themselves and behind the scenes they 'll do everything they can to block any commonsense reform and make sure nothing changes whatsoever the only way we will be able to change is if their audience , their constituents , their membership says , this time must be different , that this time we must do something to protect our communities and our kids i will put everything i 've got into this , and so will joe but i tell you , the only way we can change is if the american people demand it and by the way , that does n't just mean from certain parts of the country we 're going to need voices in those areas , in those congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong to speak up and to say this is important it ca n't just be the usual suspects we have to examine ourselves in our hearts and ask ourselves what is important this will not happen unless the american people demand it if parents and teachers , police officers and pastors , if hunters and sportsmen , if responsible gun owners , if americans of every background stand up and say , enough , we suffered too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this to continue , then change will change will come that s what it s going to take you know , on the letter that julia \( sp \) wrote me , she said , i know that laws have to be passed by congress , but i beg you to try very hard \( laughter \) julia \( sp \) , i will try very hard but she s right the most important changes we can make depend on congressional action they need to bring these proposals up for a vote , and the american people need to make sure that they do get them on record ask your member of congress if they support universal background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands ask them if they support renewing a ban on militarystyle assault weapons and highcapacity magazines and if they say no , ask them why not ask them what s more important , doing whatever it takes to get a a a grade from the gun lobby that funds their campaigns , or giving parents some peace of mind when they drop their child off for first grade \? \( applause \) this is the land of the free , and it always will be as americans , we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights that no man or government can take away from us but we 've also long recognized , as our founders recognized , that with rights come responsibilities along with our freedom to live our lives as we will comes an obligation to allow others to do the same we do n't live in isolation we live in a society , a government of and by and for the people we are responsible for each other you know , the right to worship freely and faithfully , that right was denied to sikhs in oak creek , wisconsin the right to assemble peaceively \( sp \) , that right was denied shoppers in clackamas , oregon and moviegoers in aurora , colorado that most fundamental set of rights to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness fundamental rights that were denied to college students at virginia tech and high school students at columbine and elementary school students in newtown , and kids on street corners in chicago on too frequent a basis to tolerate , and all the families who 've never imagined that they 'd lose a loved one to a bullet , those rights are at stake we 're responsible you know , when i visited newtown last month , i spent some private time with many of the families who lost their children that day , and one was the family of grace mcdonnell grace s parents are here grace was 7 years old when she was struck down , just a gorgeous , caring , joyful little girl i'm told she loved pink she loved the beach she dreamed of becoming a painter and so just before i left , chris , her father , gave me one of her paintings , and i hung it in my private study just off the oval office and every time i look at that painting , i think about grace and i think about the life that she lived and the life that lay ahead of her , and most of all , i think about how when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us , we must act now for grace , for the 25 other innocent children and devoted educators who had so much left to give , for the men and women in big cities and small towns who fall victim to senseless violence each and every day , for all the americans who are counting on us to keep them safe from harm let s do the right thing let s do the right thing for them and for this country that we love so much \( applause \) thank you \( sustained applause \) i'm going to sign these orders \( sustained applause \)
new delhi a rinkydink political parade was winding through the back streets of northwest delhi on sunday afternoon , past narrow alleyways and a clutch of pigs , ferrying along a candidate in heavy makeup and a blue sari one could have looked right past her were it not for a certain bulge to her forehead , a squareness to her jaw or the fact that her campaign slogans , chanted by a group of similarly thickset women , included long live lili the eunuch , and put your stamp on lili the eunuch and you 've tried men , you 've tried women , now it s lili s turn ! it s been a noneoftheabove political season in delhi , whose voters will go to the polls to choose a new state legislative assembly on wednesday rising prices have soured the mood toward the indian national congress , even in poor , lowcaste neighborhoods like this one , where voters have supported the party almost by reflex and yet the main opposition , the bharatiya janata party , is also unloved in many quarters for this reason , this fall s election has opened the door to unorthodox new players , most important , the upstart aam aadmi , or whose attempt to unseat the heavyweights has provided this week s main suspense a similar logic inspired rajkumar gautam , who was hunting for people to represent his indian bahujan samajawadi party , but did not have much money to spend on advertising what candidate could embody none of the above better than the eunuch ramesh kumar lili , part of a mysterious , intricately structured subculture that has been part of delhi history for more than a thousand years \? we hear people saying that this time , they want a change , mr gautam said from the narrow storefront that serves as headquarters for his organization , a littleknown group that splintered off the socialistleaning bahujan samajawadi party this , he said , nodding at ms lili , will be a radical change ! she smiled grandly in acknowledgement , reeling off a list of grievances over water and electricity prices , corruption , education and jobs unlike some of the eunuchs who live in her commune , ms lili was castrated late in life , so her voice is a bit husky , but she can project a stiff , wellcoiffed hauteur , like a scruffy margaret thatcher if people were happy with their government , i would not have a chance , she said matteroffactly morally , eunuchs are better than other people we are like beggars we are like saints we dance we beat on the drums we share people s happiness this is our place eunuchs began to surface as bit players in indian politics more than a decade ago at first , their candidacies seemed like a stunt , a creative way of expressing disdain for both the congress party and the bjp but then , propelled by public anger over uppercaste privilege and corruption , a few of them began to win , taking advantage of seats set aside for women and oppressed castes india s eunuchs are outcasts who typically live apart from their families in hierarchical communes but they are also granted a rare space in public life , as adults who are free of social constraints , like jesters in a king s court when a family is celebrating a wedding or the birth of a child , eunuchs show up to perform dances in exchange for money , and their blessings are believed to confer fertility when displeased , often over the question of payment , they can be vengeful , spewing curses and threatening to strip naked until their target relents each time a eunuch wins an election it makes national headlines , but things have not always gone smoothly after that who won a mayoral election in the city of katni in 2001 , immediately poohpoohed the advice of the businessman who had sponsored her campaign \( we ca n't control her , he said at the time she s completely unpredictable and people are afraid to offend her because she can be abusive \) shewas removed from office two years later after a court ruled that she had illegally won a post reserved for a woman another eunuch mayor was removed from office for the same reason in 2009 shabnam mausi , who in 1998 became the first eunuch to win state office in india , was treated as a celebrity but has since found herself adrift , in a run last year , according to the times of india elavarthi manohar , a rights activist in bangalore , said activists' hopes that ms mausi would advocate for more freedoms for sexual minorities were bitterly disappointed on the contrary , he said , she represented a deeply conservative , hierarchical tradition that dates to the threat of severe punishment , enforcing strict bans on wearing male clothing , eating pork or having sexual intercourse here is this big person in the eunuch hierarchy , whatever , mr manohar said but definitely human rights in her own family group is not her agenda ms lili stood atop a truck rattling through the mangolpuri area of new delhi this week , blaring bollywood anthems through a tinny pa system she ducked occasionally to avoid being whacked by oncoming branches , and people looked up at her with amusement many were skeptical that her candidacy was a serious one , speculating that her backers planned to approach larger parties on the eve of the election , offering to sell whatever votes ms lili commanded \( mr gautam denied this \) but there was no trace of ill will a scattering of people said they might vote for her , mainly to express their frustration with the status quo we have voted for congress , but this time we are angry with them , said santosh , 40 , a trader i will not tell you why i am angry , but i am angry among the campaign s unlikely supporters is sunita kogra , ms lili s wife , who is now raising their three children during an interview , she looked up at a studio portrait , taken when ms lili was still a man named ramesh kumar , sporting pointy white loafers and a luxuriant mustache earlier , she said , this was my life ms kogra was philosophical when asked about her husband s transformation , which she said took place four years ago , and against his will she said he had a job playing drums with a troupe of eunuchs and had been drawn deeper and deeper into internal rivalries until one day he was abducted , underwent surgery and returned as one of them he is basically a simple man , somebody called him and he went , she said now , he is a changed man , because he lives with eunuchs yes , he is a woman ms kogra sighed it was a very shocking incident , she said but what can you do \?
caroline shaw , the winner of the 2013 pulitzer prize in music , isn t quite ready to own up to what she does i don t really call myself a composer , she said , laughing , in an interview in her sunny studio apartment in chelsea that s what s awkward about this whole thing that s not really what i call myself ms shaw would prefer to be known simply as a musician and it was largely as a musician , a busy freelancer in new york , that she was known before monday s announcement that she had , at 30 , become the award s youngest winner , for partita for eight voices , her dazzling , emotionally generous take on a baroque dance suite audiences had heard her as an incisive violinist with the american contemporary music ensemble she also appeared as a purevoiced alto in ensembles like trinity choir and roomful of teeth , the adventurous vocal octet for which she composed partita and which recorded it as part of a sensually stunning debut album for new amsterdam records last year but ms shaw s small , meticulous and searching body of writing including rewritings of old bluegrass and gospel songs and a work for flowerpots , vibes and marimba for the group so percussion flew under the radar even after she started the doctoral program in composition at princeton university in 2010 just last week , she said , someone was like , i didn t know you write music it seems safe to say that few people will make that mistake again on monday she was walking in hudson river park when she began getting emails and calls from friends telling her that she had gotten a pulitzer i briefly thought that i was having a psychotic break , she said she finally called her father , who went on the internet and told her that she had actually won the award citation praised partita as a highly polished and inventive a cappella work uniquely embracing speech , whispers , sighs , murmurs , wordless melodies and novel vocal effects jeremy geffen , the director of artistic planning at carnegie hall and the chairman of this year s pulitzer jury , recalled we kept listening because we were required to but also because none of us could see what was around the next corner she changes gears so quickly and so easily , and every turn is so unexpected and so full of joy and it s in such a convincing and cohesive manner that you could never doubt the sense of architecture and the sense of premeditation ms shaw wrote the work over three successive summers , starting in 2009 , during which roomful of teeth was in residence at the massachusetts museum of contemporary art the new ensemble wanted to explore nontraditional vocal techniques and was focusing on tuvan throat singing , yodeling and belting , all of which found their way into partita the group s founder , brad wells , a member of the voice faculty at williams college , announced the first summer that there was room in the final concert if any member wanted to write something ms shaw volunteered , and the result was passacaglia , which eventually became the fourth and final section of partita we d been trying all these sounds and making these different kinds of music and i d just spent a year playing all this thorny contemporary music , she recalled and i remember thinking , all i want to hear is just one chord so that was the beginning of the piece , how to make that one thing i wanted to hear the finished passacaglia radiates that focus in its quiet beginning and in the rapturous keenings that follow rounded tones abruptly end in swallowed grunts medieval harmonies hover behind the sound of a man reciting the instructions for sol lewitt s conceptual wall drawing 305 , on display at the museum a babble of spoken voices reconstitutes with a great groan into a celebratory wail , then vanishes in a final hush tinged with the metallic twang of throat singing we d rehearse all day , ms shaw said and then i d usually get brad s key and go 10 minutes down the road to williams and just play the piano until 3 or 4 in the morning and write stuff and bring in pages the next day courante , the third section of the suite , emerged the following summer , when the group was working with two inuit throat singers from northern quebec it begins with soft , breathless gasps that break into a gentle version of the hymn the shining shore before building to a delirious , swaying swirl of voices the summer of 2011 brought the grandly vibrating aura of the suite s opener , allemande , and the otherworldly sarabande though the four sections have not yet been performed live as a unit , listening to them in sequence gives a moving sense of old and new coming together , as if gregorian monks and those throatsinging inuits had joined for some baroque dances at a country jamboree
nairobi , kenya seeking to end a siege that has left scores dead and shaken the nation , the kenyan government said sunday night that it was pressing an assault against shabab militant attackers who had been holed up in a nairobi shopping mall for more than a day late sunday , the kenyan military announced that it had retaken most of the westgate mall the attackers had been confined to the third floor since their initial assault on saturday and freed more hostages , though details could not be confirmed helicopters circled the mall building through the night , and occasional explosions and bursts of gunfire were heard above a rainstorm in the area most areas of the building are now in the control of kdf , said col cyrus oguna , referring to the kenya defense forces he told the television station ktn that most of the hostages taken by the militants had been rescued we know the number cannot be more than 10 right now the shabab , a mostly based in neighboring somalia , answered with twitter messages of their own , including warning that kenyan forces who 've just attempted a roof landing must know that they are jeopardizing the lives of all the hostages at  later , officials said that at least four members of the security forces had been wounded but there were no other details about additional casualties on either side the attack on the mall deeply distressed

potential for even greater loss of life seemed tangible addressing the nation , president uhuru kenyatta sounded a note of solidarity in loss , revealing that his nephew and the man s fianc e were among the dead these are young , lovely people i personally knew and loved , mr kenyatta said many of us have lost loved ones let us mourn them all as one nation and keep them always in remembrance and prayer he said security forces had rescued more than 1 , 000 people from the mall since the violence began on saturday , calling the forces' performance remarkable and encouraging , even as he asked for patience from the public as the standoff continued the assault on westgate was the deadliest terrorist attack in kenya since the 1998 qaeda of the american embassy in nairobi that killed more than 200 people president obama called mr kenyatta on sunday to reaffirm the strong and historic partnership between the united states and kenya that relationship has been strained by the election in march of mr kenyatta , who is being prosecuted at the international criminal court on charges of financing death squads during an outbreak of political violence in 2007 mr obama skipped visiting kenya , his father s birthplace , on his trip to africa in late june the shabab have said that they staged the mall attack as retribution for the kenyan military presence in somalia , where kenyan troops have driven shabab fighters out of much of the territory they once controlled a confidential united nations security report described the assault on the mall as twopronged , with groups of gunmen attacking on different floors simultaneously joseph ole lenku , the cabinet secretary for the interior , said sunday afternoon that from 10 to 15 attackers were inside the mall mr kenyatta said he could neither confirm nor deny reports that one or more of the attackers were women the shabab claimed in a twitter post that several of the attackers were americans a senior law enforcement official in the united states said the federal bureau of investigation had yet to establish whether that claim was true , and that it would be difficult to do so until all the attackers were captured or killed the number of bystanders remaining in the building was not as clear , though the , citing the police as its source , said sunday that 49 people were unaccounted for , raising the prospect of a significantly higher death toll before the crisis ends the american official said that the fbi had offered assistance to the kenyan authorities and that fbi agents were at the kenyan command post at the scene there were reports that israelis were supporting the kenyan authorities as well a spokeswoman for the israeli foreign ministry said she could not comment the secretary general of interpol , ronald k noble , said in a statement that his agency had offered to send a response team , including forensic and counterterrorism experts mr kenyatta said that he had received numerous offers of assistance from friendly countries for the time being , however , this remains an operation of the kenyan security agencies among those killed in the mall were three britons , the british foreign office confirmed sunday five americans were among the wounded , but none were known to have been killed news agencies reported that other foreigners were also among the dead as the identities of victims began to emerge on sunday , the public mourning of a national tragedy began one of those killed was ruhila adatiasood , a popular kenyan radio host who was in the parking lot of the mall

the university of ghana hundreds of relatives and friends of people who were in the mall went to hospitals around the city that were treating the wounded , trying to ascertain the fate of their loved ones at the m p shah hospital a few miles away from the mall , distressed relatives milled around a tent erected for them outside the building , as volunteers worked to assist them ruth nyambura , 26 , whose uncle worked at the nakumatt supermarket in westgate at the time of the attack , said she was terrified i have come along with my family just to find out how he s doing , ms nyambura said he was shot in the head , suffered severe wounds on his one of his eyes and his arms he was operated on yesterday , and we 've come to see him again we are being told to wait because the queue is too long kenya s political class , often starkly divided , has demonstrated unity since the attack raila odinga , a former prime minister and a political opponent of mr kenyatta , joined him in an appearance at the state house on sunday this is a trying moment for our country , mr odinga said it is something that has hit at the very heart of our country s unity our people must come together at

back at home in bon temps , la , momentarily safe from attack by vampires hungry for her tasty fairy blood , sookie stackhouse recalls the simple days of white dresses and wellmannered , if fanged , admirers i want to be that girl again , she says , wearily fans of true blood , hearing their heroine speak that line in the show s season 6 premiere on sunday night , can only reply , amen , sister hbo s popular supernatural soap opera , went a long way down a bad road in its fifth season , chasing a labored and unconvincing allegory about religious fundamentalism that incorporated a vampire god and bible and jackbooted vampire storm troopers the increasingly comical proceedings culminated in an episode that played like a parody of the standard cliffhanger finale , with a rambolike raid and shootout , exploding bodies and a bloodsoaked resurrection alan ball , the show s creator , after the season and was replaced as show runner by brian buckner , a true blood writer whose previous experience was primarily in sitcoms \( friends , spin city \) sookie s desire to be the girl in the white dress once more could be taken as a coded message from the new regime stick with us we can get this right right , in this case , meaning as it was at when mr ball surprised us by showing that he could create a light and amusing combination of occult thriller , love story and murder mystery whose message about tolerance of minorities was clear but not obtrusive but as the seasons went on , the storytelling lost some of its steam , and the various subtexts sexual , religious , racial moved into the vacuum , becoming obvious and heavyhanded in the fashion of mr ball s previous hbo series , and his screenplay for american beauty the new season begins midcliffhanger , with sookie \( anna paquin \) and the vampire eric \( alexander skarsgard \) fleeing bill compton \( stephen moyer \) , the third leg of the sookieericbill romantic triangle and a newly risen , seemingly allpowerful vampire god along with their small crew of world savers , including eric s sister \( lucy griffiths \) , sookie s brother \( the hilarious ryan kwanten \) and the bickering vampire couple pam and tara \( kristin bauer van straten and rutina wesley \) , they head back to the show s ruralgothic base in the fictional hamlet of bon temps based on the evidence of the first three episodes , the action will be centered there again , good news after so much of last season was spent at the sterile vampire authority in new orleans as to whether the show will get back on track , the early signals are mixed rutger hauer joins the cast , perhaps playing two diametrically opposed roles , in a plotline involving sookie s family history and her parents' death that s potentially a good thing , as is the continuing story of the halffairy children of the bumbling andy bellefleur \( chris bauer \) , which offers comic relief as well as tension they are , after all , a new source of fairy blood on the down side , the nonetoosubtle messagemongering continues , with the emphasis of the allegory shifting from fundamentalism back to racial and religious discrimination the fine actor arliss howard also joins the show , playing a louisiana governor who exploits the antivampire feelings in the wake of season 5 s events there are references to concentration camps and a repeated motif of vampires being dragged behind trucks in case the liberalprogressive piety is n't obvious enough , mr howard s slick politician encourages his constituents to buy guns , announcing , this is still america , you have a right to defend yourselves and the people you love there s nothing wrong with a little social relevance , but that s never been what made true blood worthwhile if the show is n't fast , funny , scary and sexy , it s nothing you hope the writers will realize that one funny line from mr kwanten like i'm sick of you bloodsuckers brainraping me against my will ! is worth more than all the sturm und fang
my patient was shaking uncontrollably people say such shaking feels unbelievably bad , but rigoring , as the medical profession calls it , is treatable with the narcotic demerol i hurried to the computer to order some from the pharmacy , thinking rigors demerol but the computer listed drugs by their generic names only , and demerol is a brand name in the heat of the moment my mind went blank i couldn t get the medicine my patient needed an embarrassed call to the pharmacy yielded the correct name meperidine and my patient got relief still , it was a reminder of how needlessly dangerous our druglabeling system is in the context of what s at stake in health care , the practice of giving drugs two names , a brand name and a generic name , makes no sense is there any other industry in which thousands of component parts are insistently given two dissimilar names , even though people can suffer , be hurt , possibly even die , if a mistake in names is made \? every drug with two names and that means practically every drug in use is a medication error waiting to happen worldwide , almost all medications have a brand name that remains patent protected for 20 years , meaning the patent holder is the sole manufacturer and distributor that allows the holder to charge more for it when drugs go generic \( for example , tylenol to acetaminophen \) , anyone can make them and the price tends to drop , meaning company profits drop , too but the companies keep the brand names , and insist they be used wherever they can , because they know people tend to trust brand names more , even when there is no difference from the generic others can argue whether drug companies profit margins actually serve the public interest or enrich their shareholders , but that s not my quarrel here the patent protections can stay in place the dualname regime shouldn t to make things even more confusing , we have recently seen a proliferation of lookalike , soundalike meds for example zantac is used to treat heartburn , while xanax is an antianxiety medication a list of these soundalikes fills a full eight pages on the institute of safe medication practices website data on medication errors is not collected systematically in the united states , so it is impossible to say accurately how many errors result from such confusion whatever the number , and the attendant misery the most serious mistakes generate , it seems undeniable that the potential for error is increased by the dual naming of all drugs though we in the health professions learn to be disciplined in a crisis , the human mind , especially in stress , can remember only so much in a 2009 survey a group of australian nurseanesthetists accurately identified only 29 percent of the trade names for common drugs and i am hardly alone among my colleagues in momentarily forgetting a generic s name in the heat of the moment and whether or not a nurse or doctor can flawlessly recall the dual names of every drug ever learned , those two names take up mental space that none of us in health care can spare a hospital is not a place for singletrack minds nurses are interrupted on average every six minutes , and sometimes much more often doctors face constant distraction from pages and cellphones throw the completely unnecessary complication of drugs having two names into the mix and we all move inexorably closer to error fortunately , the solution is obvious and easy all drugs now being sold could use either their brand name or the generic name that name , and the manufacture of that medication , would be patentprotected for 20 years thereafter , any other producer of that drug would append it with a g , indicating that it is a generic formulation acetaminophen sold as a generic would become acetaminopheng , and plavix , a brand name blood thinner , would be sold as plavixg in its generic form combination drugs like the brand name inhaler duoneb might have to use generic names \( albuterol and ipratropium \) to avoid confusion the russian names in tolstoy s war and peace drove my high school debate coach crazy a character s first name , patronymic , family name , diminutive name and shortened patronymic might all be used at different times in the last section of the novel tolstoy introduced some new characters , all with their several names my debate coach , fed up , slammed the book shut and never finished it mentally pulling up drug names in the hospital can make me feel stuck in the pharmaceutical version of a russian novel cyclophosphamide is cytoxan velcade is the brand name for bortezomib percocet is oxycodone and acetaminophen , but vicodin is acetaminophen and hydrocodone multiply that short list of drugs by 500 , and it s clear what nurses and doctors are up against it makes no real difference if a determined reader stops before the end of a great book but a patient s being hurt because we insist on giving drugs two distinct names is a different matter is an oncology nurse and the author of critical care a new nurse faces death , life , and everything in between
just as the christmas season in new york belongs to handel , with messiah , the easter season belongs to bach among other things this year , the current festival of the new york philharmonic you can generally count on hearing the two big passions in some inscrutably shifting balance last year the st john passion predominated this year the st matthew took over , after an early by dennis keene and the voices of ascension on feb 28 mr keene s chorus performed in typically splendid fashion at the church of the ascension the orchestra , less so john scott and the st thomas choir of men and boys opened a run of st matthew performances on march 21 , bach s 328th birthday , at , and julian wachner and the choir of trinity wall street and trinity baroque orchestra added three days later at trinity church regular followers of the new york choral and earlymusic scenes knew what to expect from those excellent ensembles , and it mostly came to pass the wild card was a by the orchestra of st luke s on thursday evening at carnegie hall featuring the musica sacra chorus and conducted by ivan fischer mr fischer , a maestro rightly celebrated for his work in the standard repertory especially with his budapest festival orchestra but also with st luke s , which played beautifully for him here has revealed himself in new york as an inveterate tinkerer and imaginative experimenter his appearances have included a survey of the , some on period instruments , some on modern , in 2010 an acclaimed staged concert presentation of mozart s in 2011 and a in 2012 in which he strewed choristers among the instrumentalists to give the players a more vivid sense of the text in general mr fischer s interventions have sought to heighten the works' inherent drama , whether abstract or concrete and since the trend with the bach passions in recent years has been to bring out their theatrical potential , as in extraordinary staged productions of the st matthew by at the brooklyn academy of music and with the berlin philharmonic , you could imagine that mr fischer would offer ideas of his own along these lines he had ideas , all right , but many of them appeared wrongheaded , even perverse , undercutting rather than supporting the drama the central problem was his seemingly haphazard distribution of voices the key figures in the passion , almost by definition , are the evangelist and jesus , and most performances today strive to create markedly individual and consistent characterizations of those roles this tendency has been enhanced by the emergence of a number of tenors who sing the part of the evangelist high and excitable , long and draining with real beauty and distinction rather than simply as a character role among the most notable of those is , who sang in the st thomas performance a veteran of the jonathan miller staging , mr m ller sings the part of st matthew \( and st john \) from memory actually he does not so much sing the role as inhabit it even when he is not singing he is a participant , closely observing others and offering subtle commentary through facial expressions , registering irony , for example , with a twist of the lip but without mugging seemingly under the weather on this occasion and struggling vocally through the second part , mr m ller nevertheless gave a typically compelling characterization he had a worthy foil in the strong jesus of douglas williams , who also sang from memory the trinity pair , william hite as the evangelist and stephen salters as jesus , were also excellent mr hite , in fine voice , remained content to describe the action rather than live it , a legitimate , timehonored approach like mr williams , mr salters put a premium on power , over the warmth that some bring to jesus the two were made more distinctive by their placement in mr wachner s conception mr hite in the pulpit , mr salters on a thronelike chair atop a platform thrust into the aisle , amid audience members similarly , if more modestly , mr fischer placed his jesus hanno m llerbrachmann on a low platform onstage alongside the evangelist , john tessier , at carnegie hall but whatever symbolism may have been achieved there was smashed when mr m llerbrachmann also sang judas and pilate from the same perch and why was he singing these minor roles , often allotted to chorus members , in the first place \? jesus in dialogue with judas or with pilate in the same person \? it s pretty hard to pick up the dramatic pieces after that , and mr fischer made no attempt to do so although he had tenor , baritone and bass soloists on hand for most of the arias , he enlisted mr tessier for one and mr m llerbrachmann \( now off the platform \) for two others it was a babel of voices none of which should be taken to detract from the terrific performances of mr tessier , who sang vividly in the descriptive mode , or mr m llerbrachmann , who finally brought warmth to jesus but also faded vocally toward the end , partly , perhaps , because of the overwork of the added arias the two church performances , at least , did not disappoint mr wachner and mr scott routinely work wonders with their disparate choruses mr scott s with the soft core of boys' voices , mr wachner s with a solid , vibrant center but there was nothing disparate about the orchestras , both drawn from the growing pool of periodinstrument players in new york , fed lately by the historical performance of the juilliard school almost half the players were common to both orchestras , with more veterans in james richman s concert royal at st thomas , more newcomers in mr wachner s trinity baroque orchestra it was amusing to see the concertmasters of the divided orchestras switch chairs and big solos cynthia roberts , concertmaster of orchestra i at st thomas , orchestra ii at trinity robert mealy , the opposite both performances gave vivid evidence of a newly thriving earlymusic scene in new york at long last
there can be slain no sacrifice to god more acceptable than an unjust and wicked king seneca , hercules furens the brutal civil war in syria and in particular the numerous crimes against humanity committed by president bashar alassad have many people in the united states and elsewhere asking a familiar question are we morally obliged to intervene when a political leader is slaughtering civilians within his own territory \? if we answer in the affirmative , discussion tends quickly to turn to the practical dimensions of humanitarian military intervention , which always carries the prospect of causing more harm than good another alternative , one that we rarely discuss seriously anymore , has been examined often in the philosophical tradition killing the tyrant why shouldn t this be preferable to war \? in the statesman and elsewhere , plato makes clear that tyranny a state of extreme political disorder in which a ruler has absolute power and uses it to only selfish ends , with disregard for law , wisdom , or the welfare of the populace is the opposite of the virtuous kingship of the ideal state following this lead , aristotle in politics deems the killing of a tyrant to be a noble act , emphasizing the right of citizens to seek a public life leading to the good cicero is more emphatic tyrants show the exact opposite of the spirit of fraternity that should govern human interactions , and so , as he puts it in de officiis , that pestilent and abominable race should be exterminated from human society like cicero s , the statement of seneca s hercules that i have quoted as an epigraph arises from stoic principles it is a declaration that has enjoyed wide influence the 16thcentury german reformer phillipp melanchthon enthusiastically endorsed it , hoping that some strong man would kill king henry viii to avenge the death of thomas cromwell john milton quotes the same passage from seneca in his vigorous defense of the execution of king charles i , the tenure of kings and magistrates melanchthon and milton thus join a protestant tradition of approving tyrannicide that includes john knox and george buchanan that tradition finds 20thcentury expression in the thought of dietrich bonhoeffer , the ethicist and lutheran minister who conspired against hitler for bonhoeffer , killing such enemies of humanity is a necessary component of pacifism tyrants must be eliminated for peace to flourish it is entirely possible , of course , that this chorus of worthies has things wrong and an old idea is not necessarily a good one slavery is an old idea so is polygamy in thinking about the ethics of the question , we might consider immanuel kant s reasoning in opposing the execution of rulers for kant , the death penalty could be legitimately applied to a subject but not to a sovereign the principle of jus talionis , or law of retaliation , calling for a punishment to match a crime , is in kant s terms fundamental to legal order , and can be used to justify the capital punishment of murderers this is more than the simple retributive justice of an eye for an eye it is founded instead on the idea that we forfeit any right we are not willing to extend to others the murderer has disregarded another s right to life , and so if acting with honor , as kant describes it , would readily resign his own life for kant the sovereign is different it is the role of the sovereign to secure legal order , rather than to be measured by it in killing the sovereign , we potentially upset the stability of legal order as such this could lead us to two conclusions , one arguing for tyrannicide and the other putting a brake on it the nature of legal order has changed since kant s time as the past halfcentury s trials of heads of state attest , we now do have mechanisms and precedents for applying rule of law to the conduct of rulers , which in and of itself suggests both conceptual and practical sources of justice above sovereignty the legal order of our own time tends to be one of overlapping and multiple jurisdictional claims , rather than a single set of rules secured by the arbitrating presence of the sovereign in our world much more than in kant s , one can take action against the sovereign without committing an assault on law itself but that conclusion may be too easy , which leads to our second one there is no denying that national governments and the institutions they command remain in our world powerful stays against lawlessness to satisfy kant s objection to eliminating the sovereign we must show that such action would actually advance the cause of justice rather than frustrate it further eliminating a tyrant is not virtuous if one is knowingly creating even greater conditions of disorder and destruction legitimate tyrannicide must flow from a goodfaith effort to institute justice to return to the example of syria , when we hear news of extreme violence committed \( or , in recent reports , claims of the use of chemical weapons \) not just by government forces but by opposition forces , too , we must be led to wonder if the latter aim to replace assad s tyranny with one of their own making
just feels good \( stoney creek \) last year s country music association awards ceremony was a year of turnover and upsets , none bigger than thompson square s victory for vocal duo of the year it succeeded sugarland , which had won five years running after wresting the title from the firm grip of brooks dunn , which had won 14 of the previous 15 years that bespeaks a lack of duos in country music , sure , but also a lack of imagination it s also consistent with the rising tide of light , romantic country with male and female vocals evenly split , country s new soft core the blend of pulpy emotion and flattened sound mixing that s a hallmark of little big town and , decreasingly , lady antebellum , has become the genre s new gold standard in that environment , thompson square s anonymity and moderate ambition are assets of a sort thompson square is a married couple , keifer and shawna thompson , and just feels good is its second album of wholesome couplehood that s not to say that their songs are purely warm and affectionate , or that all endings are happy it s more that an air of mutual reassurance underpins even their darkest songs the vocals are doled out in equal helpings , as is the desperation no one person does all the leaving , or all the saving the thompsons catalog the small details of a long relationship on that s so me and you , and hint at domestic naughtiness on everything i shouldn t be thinking about apart from their usual stuff bare feet on sand and singing for tips in pickle jars there s no density to the feelings here , and no song as direct in its angst as glass , from the duo s selftitled 2011 debut album admirably , thompson square only goes the full lady antebellum once , on if i didn t have you , with its fogthick melodrama but less than admirably , they only lighten up and add some chipperness to their vocals once , on testing the water , the only song here written by luke laird , hillary lindsey and shane mcanally , who hail from a looser school of country songcraft in country , holding firm to the center may be the key to longevity , but awards notwithstanding , it s only that
when soviet communism collapsed , the west s declarations of triumph were so full of hubris that it was easy to forget what was right about them the ukrainians protesting in downtown kiev are a reminder that there was actually a lot to glow about but the struggle that seemed to be over in 1989 is still going on , and today s battleground is the square that protesters have renamed the euromaidan , or europlace the people there are again insisting on the choice of a regime , a type of government , that they and their soviet compatriots first tried to make in 1991 they know they want what we have and what we are as our own selfassurance fades , we need to see what they are showing us when the berlin wall fell , francis fukuyama was n't the only one who believed history had ended it was tempting then to imagine that the authoritarian form of government and centrally planned economic system that moscow had championed and inspired in a lot of the world would inevitably give way to capitalist democracy and the greater freedom and prosperity it delivered but the new century brought disappointment the spread of freedom had seemed inexorable in the 1990s as eastern europe was rejoining the rest of the continent , apartheid was being dismantled in south africa , and india and china were becoming full participants in the world economy but in iraq , afghanistan and then even in the countries that made a bid for freedom with the arab spring , the progress of the western idea began to seem a lot less inevitable russia and the former central asian republics developed a new , postcommunist form of authoritarianism china never dropped the original , communist version , though it finally figured out , at least for now , how to combine it with robust economic growth meanwhile , back at home , freemarket capitalism is feeling tired europe is economically sclerotic , politically fragile and flirting with xenophobia the united states is still struggling to recover from the 20079 recession the neoauthoritarians in beijing and moscow are , by contrast , increasingly confident in the developing world , particularly africa , china presents state capitalism as a more effective alternative to paralysisprone democracy russia , too , is reasserting itself , and in ways designed to create maximum western discomfort , ranging from an 11thhour chemical weapons deal in syria to offering edward snowden safe haven state capitalism s latest power play is in ukraine , whose thuggish leadership backed out of signing a trade and association agreement with europe at the last minute it did so under fierce economic and political pressure from the kremlin brussels did not expect moscow s ferocious intervention it should have ukraine has always been russia s first and essential foreign conquest the true surprise and one that should inspire democrats around the world is the spontaneous and spirited resistance of ukrainian civil society to this aboutface for more than a week , ukrainians have been protesting in the euromaidan , and in front of government buildings throughout the capital and across the country they have done so in miserable winter weather and in the face of police brutality what is important about the demonstrators is their certainty that democracy matters , and that it can be made to work that s remarkable , because this is 2013 , not 1991 , or even 2004 , when the ukrainian orange revolution prevailed , and then sputtered democracy and independence are no longer shiny imports ukrainians have enjoyed some version of both for more than two decades nine years ago , starting with protests in the same square , they succeeded in getting the democracy and the independenceminded president they wanted none of that worked out very well the democrats who came to power after the orange revolution were such a disappointment that viktor yanukovich , who tried and failed to seize the presidency in 2004 , was democratically elected in 2010 and is at the center of the current fight if anyone has a right to be cynical about the power of an engaged civil society to make a real difference , it is ukrainians but they are n't the people have taken to the streets in support of political values , rather than nationalist ones , or shortterm economic interests more than 20 years after the soviet union s collapse , the ukrainian economy remains closely connected to russia s , and vladimir putin has made it clear that ukrainians will pay higher prices for energy and face stiffer barriers to russian markets if they choose europe for the protesters , these economic sanctions are direct and personal i spoke to one ukrainian executive whose company exports more than half of its products to russia \( for fear of economic reprisals , he asked that his name not be used \) since ukraine strongly signaled a few months ago that it would sign the european deal , exports are down 10 percent if the agreement goes through , he thinks his sales will fall by 40 percent but he has spent several evenings in the square , joined by many professional colleagues his company s bottom line notwithstanding , he wants ukraine to make what the protesters call the european choice that s because , in some ways , history really did end in 1989 authoritarian societies , even ones that are able to generate strong economic growth , deny their citizens the freedom and the dignity that western market democracies provide over the past two decades , ukrainians have suffered from inept , corrupt and occasionally brutal government but under that ugly skin , a new , welleducated , welltraveled , comprehensively wired generation has matured these young ukrainians know the difference between democratic capitalism and state capitalism and they know which one they want one community on the euromaidan is computer game developers ukraine has a lot of them one of the most successful is andrew prokhorov , head of 4a games he used his facebook page to urge fellow gamers to join him in the square his activism caught the attention of polygon , an american gaming website people want to move toward european values , especially the younger generation , mr prokhorov told polygon the government aims for the quickest way to fill up their wallets there is no place for our corruptionists in europe i come out to say , yes to europe' \? \? from washington to warsaw , democratic capitalism is demoralized our political institutions are n't up to the challenges of the 21st century , and the economy is n't delivering for the middle class in the way it did during the postwar era , when the original version of the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism , the cold war , was at its peak that conflict has become a cool war , and those of us on the democratic side of the barricades are n't so sure we have all the answers or that it is a struggle we are all that interested in engaging russia has no such qualms china , where ukraine s president traveled this week , knows which side it is on , too but as in 1989 the most important fault line in the world today runs through a cold , crowded , euphoric public square in eastern europe the ukrainians there are fighting for themselves , but their battle should also help us to remember where we stand and why it matters
the debate over whether government spending hurts or helps growth has again taken center stage this week because of a new research paper by two professors and a graduate student at the university of massachusetts at amherst their study critiques the methods and conclusions of a 2010 paper by kenneth rogoff and carmen reinhart , both professors at harvard , showing that countries with high debts also have lower growth rates the original paper is important because many republicans as well as european policy makers cited it as evidence that if governments did not dramatically reduce debt they would consign their economies to years or decades of stagnation recall mitt romney s admonition during the presidential debates that the united states was heading towards greece the specific details of the debate have been covered extensively elsewhere , but broadly speaking the amherst team thomas herndon , michael ash and robert pollin focused on whether mr rogoff and ms reinhart overstated the relationship between high government debt and economic growth because of incomplete data and questionable analytic methods mr rogoff and ms reinhart said the average growth rates in countries with debts of more than 90 percent was 01 percent , but the amherst team said it should have been 22 percent while it is important that economists get the numbers right , this debate has not really addressed the larger issue at stake here the sequence of events in other words , does high debt cause slow growth \? or does slow growth cause high debt \? or , to really complicate the discussion , do they both feed on each other depending on the specific circumstances of each country and how its policy makers respond \? let s just look at recent evidence in the united states , the economy started slowing sharply in 2007 and 2008 because of the financial crisis , which let s remember was caused by debts taken on by banks and the private sector , not the government in fact , american government debt in 2008 was just 54 percent of gdp , according to international monetary fund data , comfortably below the 90 percent threshold cited in the rogoffreinhart paper government debt has been climbing since , but most of the increase cannot be blamed on excessive spending the fiscal stimulus package congress approved in early 2009 amounted to less than 1 percent of gdp so what has caused the surge in debt \? the recession , mostly , which reduced government revenue by nearly 17 percent in 2009 for more evidence questioning the idea that government debt causes growth to slow one can turn to britain in that country , prime minister david cameron has been trying to cut spending and raise some taxes in an effort to bring down fiscal debt yet , far from achieving a lower debt , britain s debt as a percent of gdp has been growing , hitting 828 percent in 2012 , up from 729 percent when mr cameron took office why would that happen \? the government s effort to cut spending has served to depress rather than stimulate the economy , making it virtually impossible for the country to reduce its debt none of this is to say that governments can borrow and spend without a care eventually the united states and britain , not to mention the rest of europe , will have to pay down their debts but realworld experience suggest that it s counterproductive to try to reduce debts while the economy is still struggling
thirty years after jackie robinson broke the modern major league color barrier with the , his legacy was honored in classrooms only a home run shot or so away from the housing development where ebbets field once stood marty adler , the assistant principal at , bordering what had been the dodgers' thirdbase stands , organized projects in which the predominantly minority student body learned of robinson s baseball exploits and his pioneering role in the civil rights struggle that anniversary tribute in 1977 inspired mr adler to keep memories of the dodgers alive in brooklyn long after their departure for los angeles and the demolition of ebbets field when he died of a stroke on tuesday in bethpage , ny , at 76 , mr adler was remembered as the founder of the brooklyn dodgers hall of fame it never had a permanent home it was essentially a personal journey down his baseball memory lane but it enabled him to share his passion for the dodgers with his fellow brooklynites mr adler saluted the heroes of his youth by bringing them back to brooklyn for annual induction ceremonies at grand army plaza he donated memorabilia to the and the brooklyn baseball gallery at the minor league ballpark in coney island where the brooklyn cyclones , a mets farm team , play i'm reliving my childhood , mr adler once said the dodgers lived in the neighborhood , he recalled their kids went to the schools their wives shopped in the shopping places they were an integral fabric of the pattern of the whole community , and we loved the guys you could walk down the street and put a radio on a black person or a white person how 're the bums doing \? ' it was one common denominator that tied everybody up together martin norman adler was born in brooklyn on july 11 , 1937 , and grew up in the borough park neighborhood he received a bachelor s degree from brooklyn college and a master s in education from st john s university when jackie robinson died in 1972 , mr adler campaigned to have his school , then known as crown heights intermediate school 320 , named for him the parents wanted it to be named after somebody in the civil rights movement , mr adler told the new york times on the 50th anniversary of robinson s debut with the dodgers , but i reminded them jackie walked with dr martin luther king jackie gave impetus to all the other movements that developed in the 1960s and so the school bore robinson s name and graced its lobby with an oil painting of him mr adler gave annual talks over the school s publicaddress system about robinson , saying , as he recalled it , this is what took place here , this is american history in the late 1970s , mr adler began sending letters to former brooklyn dodger players explaining his idea for a memorial to the team , and as word of his mission got around , memorabilia began to flow in his early collection , stored in his school custodian s office , included seats from , two years after the dodgers departed for los angeles a uniform worn by casey stengel when he managed the dodgers in the 1930s and jars of ebbets field soil used as landfill at holy cross cemetery in brooklyn in june 1984 , mr adler helped create a dodgers exhibit at the central brooklyn public library on grand army plaza and held his first hall of fame induction ceremony outside the building his first three inductees were figures from the 1950s teams that came to be known as the boys of summer pitcher carl erskine , right fielder carl furillo and first baseman gil hodges , who died in 1972 while managing the mets and was represented by his widow , joan none of the three have been inducted into the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown , ny mr adler remained assistant principal at the jackie robinson school until his retirement in 1992 , and he continued his induction ceremonies for a few years after that tommy lasorda , who pitched in a total of eight games for brooklyn in the 1954 and 1955 seasons before bleeding dodger blue as their longtime manager in los angeles , was inducted into mr adler s hall of fame in august 2009 in a special ceremony at the cyclones' ballpark celebrating his 60 years in the dodgers' organization mr adler , whose death was announced by his family , lived in plainview on long island he is survived by his wife , linda his sons , eric and jeff his brothers , richard and stephen and two grandchildren although he rallied brooklynites of a certain age around their heroes of years past , mr adler left one goal unaccomplished he was never able to help propel hodges to the baseball hall of fame he sent bumper stickers to the 5 , 000 subscribers to his quarterly newsletter in 1999 that read , cooperstown needs gil hodges he organized a letterwriting campaign to the hall of fame s committee on veterans calling for hodges s admission it s total disappointment for the brooklyn dodgers community , he said at the time , but we 're never going to give up we 're from brooklyn
on a wednesday afternoon 50 years ago , a month past his 16th birthday , james harris sat in the living room of his family s home in monroe , la , staring into a blackandwhite television his parents and his older sister joined him , all of them quietly attuned to the scene on the screen throngs of people , tiny as squares of confetti , gathered in front of the lincoln memorial in washington for a civil rights rally more than two hours into the rally , after a series of speeches , the rev dr rose to for the first 10 or 12 minutes , he preached with the cadences and metaphors that harris , a minister s son , recognized he had heard all his life about how all god s children , black and white , were equal then king started to repeat one particular phrase about having a dream i have a dream , he said , that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character harris felt jolted , as if king were speaking directly to him , to his deepest , most impossible desire in the coming month , harris would begin his junior year at carroll high school , returning as the starting quarterback for a team that had gone 120 and won a state championship the previous fall his dream was to play professional football the prevailing opinion , however , was that a black man was not intelligent enough to play the position the most promising black prospects , as harris well knew , were routinely switched to receiver or defensive back harris had even been thinking of asking carroll s coach to shift him to defensive back so he would have a better shot at a major college scholarship and ultimately the pros now king s words told him change was coming , not in the hereafter , not in some distant , redeemed era , but imminently i had no chance , i knew that , harris said but then i started listening to that speech inspired by the speech , harris became the first black player to be a regular , fulltime starter at quarterback in the nfl he was also the first to lead a team to a division title , to play in a conference championship , to be chosen for the pro bowl and to lead a conference in passing efficiency heading into this nfl season , there is much hope resting on the shoulders of two young black quarterbacks robert griffin iii of the washington redskins and the seattle seahawks' russell wilson like doug williams , warren moon , steve mcnair , randall cunningham , donovan mcnabb , cam newton and others before them , they owe their opportunity in part to harris and none of it happened by accident harris had grown up hearing conflicting messages from his parents about being black he was supposed to be proud but also to be submissive , to know the rules but also stand his ground , to recognize injustice but turn the other cheek wherever he looked , he could see the face of white supremacy burning crosses outside churches , secondhand books at school , his brother and sister kicked off a city bus for refusing to surrender their seats by the end of his junior year , having gone 241 as a starter while running an offense that averaged nearly 35 points a game , harris began receiving interest from colleges his choice ultimately came down to grambling , where his high school coach had played , and michigan state , one of the top teams in the nation that choice was not so much between universities as it was between mindsets hope or logic , aspiration or pragmatism on harris s visit to michigan state in 1964 , one of the assistants took him onto a practice field as they tossed a ball back and forth , harris caught a few onehanded duffy daugherty , the spartans' coach , ambled over and said to the assistant , what kind of arm does he have \? the assistant said , he has a natural throwing arm , but great hands harris realized he was being sized up to play receiver during that same autumn , eddie robinson went on howard cosell s radio show in new york cosell , always the provocateur , noted that robinson had sent many black players to the nfl but that none of them had been a quarterback robinson flew back to louisiana and drove straight from the airport to the harris home sitting in the living room , the radio exchange still on his mind , robinson grew agitated and finally erupted damn it to hell , he said , he asked me about producing a quarterback ! he paused , gathered himself there s none playing now , he told harris but in four years , a black is going to get a chance to play quarterback in the nfl harris thought about what robinson had said he thought about what king had preached at the march on washington he knew he might be giving up his best shot at the nfl but against doubts , against safety , against history itself , he decided to trust king and robinson at least once a week during the season and almost every afternoon of his college summers , harris sat in robinson s office invariably , there were napkins or paper place mats or folded lunch sacks on the desk , each covered with diagrams of passing plays or notes about concepts , gleaned from robinson s visits to pro camps and from former grambling players now in the nfl this is what you need to know , robinson said sometimes , robinson addressed the challenges of succeeding as a black quarterback by saying it s a position like any position ai n't we playing football \? sometimes he bluntly told harris do n't expect life to be fair just be better robinson surrounded harris with talent that could help him mature as a pocket passer he hired a backfield coach , doug porter , who had designed a prostyle passing offense at mississippi valley state he recruited receivers like essex johnson , frank lewis , robert atkins and charlie joiner who would be future pros harris honed his footwork and ball control for misdirection runs and playaction passes he perfected the sevenstep dropback the tigers used for their handful of deep passing plays he devoted hours of time and thousands of repetitions to mastering pro skills customizing my game , he called it there was one other little thing coach robinson never let harris be timed in the 40yard dash the quarterback could run a 46 , and if any pro scouts found out , they would plan for harris to be switched to receiver or defensive back off the field , collie j nicholson , grambling s sports information director , put harris through a tutorial called interviews 101 playing a skeptical reporter , nicholson asked questions how does it feel being racially heckled \? what makes you think you deserve to play quarterback \? then he critiqued the responses harris had to sound confident without sounding arrogant he had to exude gratitude without groveling do n't ever let them see you angry , nicholson said on the morning of jan 28 , 1969 , harris walked into nicholson s office by nightfall , the first seven rounds of the professional draft had been completed , six quarterbacks had been taken none of them were harris harris knew why he had not been drafted he and robinson had made it clear to anyone who had asked that he was not willing to change position the next morning , the american football league s buffalo bills chose harris in the eighth round , with the 192nd pick the bills already had two veteran quarterbacks , jack kemp and tom flores harris told robinson he was not going to a team where he would have no chance to play the decision is yours , robinson said i just want to say this to you if you choose to go to the nfl , and do n't make it , do n't come back and tell me it was because of you being black and if you choose to go , do n't expect it to be fair you got to be better you got to go out there and prepare yourself better you got to throw more balls every day you ca n't miss a day you got to be the first one to practice and the last one to leave i know you 're good enough to make it on the first sunday of the 1969 regular season , having followed robinson s advice about work ethic and perseverance , harris became the first black pro quarterback to start on opening day \( , a bills receiver , had actually thrown 14 touchdown passes for denver the season before when he became the first black starting quarterback in the afl but was then traded and switched positions \) limelight brought with it a harsh backlash harris received letters with drawings of nooses and watermelons later in his career , he received a credible enough death threat to receive police protection heading into harris s fourth year in 1972 , the bills cut him , and he landed with the los angeles rams several games into the 1974 season , he won seven of the next nine games , leading the nfc in passing efficiency as the rams went to the conference title game in 1975 , with harris a team captain , the rams went 122 , though they lost again in the nfc championship game with harris injured from the time harris entered the league until 1977 , except for six games that joe gilliam started for the pittsburgh steelers in 1974 , harris was the only firststring black quarterback in the nfl , the focus of all the hope , all the pressure , all the hatred the thing that i regret to this day , he said recently , is that i personally know i did n't play my best football in the nfl , because of that thing i was mentally dealing with after he retired in 1981 , harris became a successful frontoffice executive , helping to assemble a super bowl championship team for the baltimore ravens in 2000 and most recently being part of rebuilding the detroit lions one of his roles is evaluating college players , which includes tracking the progress of each new generation of black quarterbacks i just pull for them , harris said because of my experience , i automatically become a fan people say to me sometimes , it was n't possible without you' and i'm appreciative of that but i do n't talk about it during the season , i'm always involved in what i'm doing and most of the players now i'm in football , i scout them do n't even know of my contribution
mr bao remains an astute observer of chinese politics he argues that china must embrace democratic political change , and his views and prominence have led to stretches of house arrest and police surveillance in a telephone interview from his home in beijing , he said the current party leader , xi jinping , appears serious about restructuring the economy , but major political change remains off the table following are edited excerpts from that interview how do you view the announcements that came out last week from the central committee meeting , especially the decision on reforms \? i think this third plenum was very important , very important it was important because it proposed a comprehensive program the current central leadership has offered a comprehensive analysis for decisionmaking a meeting can produce three types of document one type is empty talk , and we have many documents like that a second type focuses on a particular issue this or that issue and there are also many like that but now this document , i think , is not about this or that specific issue it s about the overall situation i think it s not empty talk he does want to act on these things for example , he really does want to strengthen the powers of the central leadership politically , he wants to enhance central powers culturally , i think , he wants to strengthen controls , including control of the internet , ideology , education and public opinion he wants to strengthen party governance of the entire society that is , strengthen the party s governing authority in society i think he s laid it out very clearly in the economy he hopes to create a free , competitive market he hopes to create this free , competitive market under oneparty rule i believe that this is his sincere intention it s not bogus he really wants to do this he really wants a free market , but this market must certainly obey party rule as well , in politics , ideology , culture , information and public opinion all of these areas the party must call the shots that s their kind of free market i think they re serious about acting on this it s not a bluff he really wants to act , and that s where its significance lies he s not hanging out a sheep s head and selling dog meat he s hung out a dog s head and is selling dog meat do you see any parallels between this economic liberalization , political centralization and deng xiaoping s approach in the 1980s \? i think he is very similar to deng xiaoping in economic issues , i think he wants greater liberalization than deng xiaoping but politically , he s demanded centralization , and he s clearer on that than deng xiaoping so in both respects , he s going beyond deng xiaoping is this something like the neoauthoritarian ideas of the 1980s \? it is the neoauthoritarian idea but i m not sure i d say it s taken from the thinking of the 1980s if you said it s taking the deng xiaoping approach , then i d fully agree but do you think this strategy can still work in this era \? china has changed a lot since the 1980s under deng xiaoping i think it s very difficult but i truly believe that the central leadership believes that they must do this i believe , though , that it s extremely difficult it s difficult because centralizing powers is not reform centralizing powers over politics , culture , thought and society is not reform that s the way it already is and has been , and more of it doesn t amount to reform the reforms being talked about are in the economy i believe that their demands and hopes for this economic reform are real , not fake , because they hope to shore up gdp , because they feel that the economy lacks innovation and vitality but the ultimate objective of all this is to stabilize the leading status of the party so politically , culturally , socially , there will be no concessions there won t be reforms , but strengthening strengthening party leadership is the major prerequisite they want economic liberalization under strengthened party rule strengthening party rule is the starting point and the end goal you say that it s very difficult why \? people can argue that china has had central oneparty rule for decades , and also had rapid economic growth for decades under this system yes , there has been economic growth , that s true many countries across the world have had economic growth but the issue for economic growth is not whether it s fast or slow , but whether it s good or bad our economic growth has depended on living off our principal and not just our forefathers principal , but also the principal that should be kept for our future generations we re devouring the resources that were bequeathed to us , and also bequeathed to our children , grandchildren and future generations is that the right economic growth \? that s the economic growth that gave us the three gorges dam on the yangtze river , the southnorth water transfer project , air pollution everywhere do you think that the outcome of the central committee meeting has strengthened xi jinping s personal stature \? if so , what s driving that \? that s my impression but i left zhongnanhai the compound housing the communist party leadership a long time ago , and so i can only offer impressions , not final judgments but i do have that impression he is the party general secretary , the state president , the chairman of the central military commission i d guess and i don t think i d be guessing wrong that he is also the future chairman of the national security commission and future head of the leading small group on comprehensive reform that s my prediction but quite a few people believe that prime minister li keqiang will lead that reform small group you think differently \? the head of the drafting group for the decision on comprehensive reform was general secretary xi jinping my guess is that the leader of the group will be none other than general secretary xi jinping i think the party general secretary , the state president , the chairman of the central military commission , chairman of the national security commission , head of the leading small group on comprehensive reform will all be one man he will be all five so how will it work to have a party leader so directly involved in setting economic policy \? based on your experience , do you see any potential for problems , or lack of coordination , with the prime minister \? i don t think there will be any big upheavals i think prime minister li keqiang will continue to focus on economic issues i think the effective implementer of economic policy will remain prime minister li keqiang but the decisions over the most important economic issues will be concentrated in the leading small group on comprehensive reform  what gives you confidence that the party s central leaders are so committed to reform \? what evidence is there \? i think that proposing comprehensive reforms marks a recognition that there are problems across all of society so xi has proposed comprehensive reforms not limited reforms , or localized reforms i think that shows his recognition of the need for reforms as well , as you just mentioned , it seems that power is now more concentrated than 10 years ago , or 20 years ago this might help him undertake these reforms so , first , there s the recognition that reform is needed , and , second , there s the power to undertake reforms i do think he s serious about reforms but whether these reforms can be pushed through will be up to him , and up to whether things go smoothly for him if he hits setbacks or hardships , then it will be hard to say what happens if he discovers that the reforms produce outcomes that he didn t expect , then that will also make it hard to say what will happen but for now i think he s upbeat and confidently preparing reforms he has his own style you could describe it as mao zedong s style applied to following deng xiaoping s path
wimbledon , england the british have become used to only one men s home hopeful , andy murray , getting past the first round at wimbledon the rest , almost always given wild cards because of their low rankings , make quick exits while murray prepares to play poland s jerzy janowicz and his potent serve in friday s semifinals murray is two wins away from ending a 77year wait for a british men s winner here james ward and kyle edmund lost their openers despite the roughly 30 million \( 45 million \) given to the lawn tennis association annually by wimbledon , progression on the world stage has been lacking after murray , ward is the lone briton inside the top 250 in the rankings , the traditional cutoff for wildcard consideration edmund , who is 18 and ranked 385th , earned his wild card thanks in part to winning the boys doubles title at the french open in june and at last year s united states open but this year at wimbledon and it may be a trend that persists at least the british men had company their counterparts from the united states slumped , too well , relatively while more than one did advance to the second round and eight are in the top 100 , none surfaced in the third round to make for a 101year low it was amid the gloomy backdrop that edmund faced the american stefan kozlov in thursday s quarterfinals of the boys singles edmund prevailed , 46 , 61 , 63 , with kozlov s leg cramp in the third set leading to a less than nailbiting conclusion in this case , glancing at the junior rankings beforehand would not have provided an indication of the intrigue of the matchup on court 3 and the players potential kozlov , at no 21 to head the american boys , was , at 15 , the secondyoungest in the boys singles draw edmund , three years older , sat at 62nd , the result of sparse participation at junior events this week marks his farewell junior tournament both have turned professional edmund shares the same fitness trainers as murray , and like britain s major threat in the women s pro ranks , laura robson , was born outside the united kingdom kozlov was born in macedonia to russian parents and moved to the united states when he was , he said , 1 or 2 his father , andrei , operates the kozlov tennis academy in pembroke pines , fla , and taught his son tennis kozlov upset thirdseed alexander zverev in the third round , aided when zverev retired in the third set with a shoulder injury he hits his forehand and backhand with more oomph than his 5foot10 frame would suggest , moves well and possesses a nifty backhand slice , as edmund discovered his demeanor also impressed kozlov did not fuss when he began to visibly suffer from the cramp in his left leg at 33 in the third i can t let the other guy know i m out of it , he said he was , however , realistically out of it kozlov could not push off properly on his serve and in rallies , and the fifthseeded edmund took advantage edmund claimed 14 of the final 16 points it was really tough to set your mind straight after starting to cramp , kozlov said his start was much better kozlov broke first , at 44 , and fended off three break points to seal the opening set when he broke again to begin the second , kozlov took control but instead of building on his advantage , he was broken immediately still backed by the crowd , even if small american flags could be seen , edmund s forehand his weapon stabilized outgoing and oft criticized lta chief executive roger draper was one of those in the stands great britain , thus , got the better of the united states on the fourth of july barely he s a very good player , said edmund , a winner in doubles later thursday he s definitely one for the future he still has a lot of wimbledons to play i wouldn t be surprised if he starts winning some if edmund captures the junior title , he would become the first british male to achieve the feat at wimbledon in the open era what a lift it would be as he seeks to improve his pro ranking and give murray company in the top 100 in the future , kozlov wants to ease american woes i have to work hard over the next couple of years and hopefully i get some wildcards and win a couple of rounds and get my ranking up there , kozlov said and stay there maybe be the top american , hopefully it s a goal
there is a chinese idiom that might be used to describe the place of idioms in chinese literary tradition jianding buyi \( \) , meaning firm and unchanging the use of such expressions , especially the classical set phrases known as chengyu \( \) , has long been seen as a mark of erudition in china most chengyu consist of only four characters , but they don t follow the grammar and syntax of modern chinese , and as many frustrated mandarin students can tell you , they are often indecipherable without some knowledge of their origins , often in ancient chinese literature that preceded the birth of christ some of the most popular chinese idioms in use today , though , are of a more modern provenance , having been forged in what is currently the hottest space for linguistic innovation in china the internet these sayings retain the fourcharacter format of the classic idioms but are distinguished by their ironic , contemporary and sometimes political themes popular among chinese youth , the new idioms may not be considered highbrow , but they offer a window into the humor , culture and concerns of china s millennial generation among the many new internet idioms now trending , xi da pu ben \( \) is a favorite , conveying exaggerated enthusiasm and excitement , with a dose of political irony the phrase is an amalgamation of four expressions commonly used perhaps overused in communist party language , often to describe public satisfaction with the party s policies none of these phrases would seem out of place on a maoera propaganda poster take the first character of each , string them together in a chinesestyle acronym , and the enthusiasm expressed is magnified to a farcical degree the result is a hyperbolic idiom that might be translated as news so exhilarating that everyone is celebrating and spreading it around the world now , even the smallest cause for celebration is being touted on the internet as xi da pu ben the announcement that train tickets were going to be available for purchase through the ecommerce site taobao , for example , was immediately hailed as xi da pu ben so was news that a history museum in xi an was offering free admission for two days the phrase has even crept into traditional media , with the southern weekend newspaper publishing an article earlier this month about visafree travel between china and phuket , thailand , under the headline , visas not required for ordinary passports xi da pu ben another new expression resonating online is ren jian bu chai \( \) , which is essentially equivalent to the american idiom to cut someone some slack the phrase reflects the pessimism and dissatisfaction with life felt by many young chinese today , and is derived from the lyrics of the mandarin pop ballad fairy tale , released by the taiwanese singer yoga lin in 2009 the original 17character line in the song some lies are better not exposed , as life is already so hard was boiled into four characters to resemble a chengyu , and the condensed version has taken on a new life on the web the new idiom can be deployed in jest , as when a microblogger used it in response to a study reporting that the thicker a person s belly , the more prone he or she may be to dementia oh , ren jian bu chai ! \( oh , cut me some slack ! \) but it can also be used in sympathy after a young man in beijing was sentenced in august to 10 years in prison for trying to rob a bank with a watermelon knife , reportedly so he could make a down payment on a marital home , one newspaper published a commentary titled , ren jian bu chai how the middle class went from white collar to loser \( there is deep frustration with soaring housing prices among many young chinese , especially bachelors under pressure to buy an apartment to improve their prospects for marriage \) usage of such internet idioms has generally been confined to the virtual realm of online youth , but there are signs that these imaginative expressions are beginning to enjoy some popularity offline as well earlier this fall , peking university unveiled a set of four traditional calligraphy paintings in a newly renovated classroom building but instead of classical idioms , each canvas displayed a popular phrase taken from modern chinese internet lingo , including xi da pu ben and tu yang tu senpo \( \) , a mocking , phonetic reference to an outburst by former president jiang zemin during which he used english to accuse hong kong reporters of being too young and too simple according to the beijing evening news , the calligraphy caused a stir and was soon taken down they were probably scared that journalists would start coming , a building management employee told the newspaper , referring to no one in particular it was probably too sensitive
culver city , calif the set here on stage 9 at sony pictures studios was a nearperfect duplicate of a suburban american home of the 1950s , with a vintage refrigerator in the kitchen and a stone fireplace in the living room , where a wife clad in a coat and housedress put down her bag of groceries and placed her arms around her hardworking husband at the end of a long day the couple s embrace became increasingly passionate , their kisses lingering longer as they began to unbutton and remove each other s garments it was that moment on every television series when the camera usually starts to pan away from the action , and suddenly it s the next morning but as this scene turned intimate and nearly prurient , no gazes were averted , and no one was calling cut just yet if this exchange between the actors michael sheen and caitlin fitzgerald , playing the scientist dr william h masters and his first wife , libby , felt to its observers like a strange clinical experiment , perhaps that s how the title characters of would want it on masters of sex , a new showtime drama that will have its premiere on sept 29 , mr sheen and lizzy caplan are cast as masters and virginia e johnson , the pioneering researchers who made sense of the mysteries of intimacy and corrected misconceptions about intercourse for millions of readers in books like their 1966 best seller , adapted from thomas maier s , masters of sex seeks to chronicle the decadeslong collaboration of masters and johnson , who were not only partners in the laboratory and in celebrity but in a marriage that began in 1971 and then after 22 years masters of sex is an experiment of its own , a test to see how much frank \( but not salacious \) depiction of sexuality its viewers might wish to see , even on pay cable and even on a show that declares its primary interest , cheekily but bluntly , in its title whether it succeeds or fails will depend largely on how audiences respond to its two lead actors , mr sheen and ms caplan , who are known in certain circles but are largely untested on television , come from very different trajectories and are about as unalike as the oddly compatible couple they portray they made each other s lives amazing , ms caplan said of the reallife masters and johnson , and they also kind of ruined each other s lives the producers sarah timberman and carl beverly , whose other shows include unforgettable , elementary and justified , encountered mr maier s book when it was published in 2009 , and were surprised by how little they knew about its seemingly legendary subjects there was this strange pygmalion dynamic between them , ms timberman said masters , , hired ms johnson , who , in 1956 to work with him on his studies of sexuality \( which included the observation of people having sex \) , although she was not a college graduate for the publication of human sexual response , masters dropped the md title from his name so that he and ms johnson would have equal billing the release of that book after a decadelong inquiry beautifully coincided with the women s movement and the pill , said the producer michelle ashford , who has written for the pacific and john adams , and wrote the pilot episode of masters of sex you take those three together , and you have an absolute upending of societal norms , she said but before they became household names or frequent guests on the tonight show , masters , a married episcopalian who was a republican and an obstetrician and gynecologist , and ms johnson , a divorced singer and mother of two , were negotiating their own relationship first in sexual couplings intended for their research , and later in more traditional interactions for the producers of masters of sex , this evolving alliance seemed ripe with dramatic potential the mystery in their relationship speaks to the mystery they were trying to unravel , ms timberman said where does sexuality figure into people s lives and what s its meaning , and can you disconnect it from emotion \? the television project moved rapidly at first , recruiting the academy awardnominated director john madden \( shakespeare in love , the best exotic marigold hotel \) to be an executive producer and direct the pilot episode , and hiring ms caplan to play ms johnson ms caplan , a wisecracking actress better known for such modernday comedies as and the class , embraced the unexpected opportunity to play a strong woman from a past era the way i speak and act seems very 2013 and not very 1956 at all , ms caplan said , still wearing the corset and poodle skirt of her character in comedy , i would pad lines and make them more my own , so that it sounded more natural coming out of my mouth , she said there s none of that on this show half the work is done for me just putting on the outfit and reading the lines as is but the series was dealt a setback when the actor paul bettany \( a beautiful mind \) , who originally was to play masters , withdrew for reasons mr madden declined to specify speaking generally about the casting process , mr madden said , it s painful and it s difficult , and you despair , and then you actually , for some reason , come to the formulation that you need in the extra time he had been afforded to reflect on the masters character , mr madden said he came to think of him as a man who takes it upon himself to explain sex to the world , but does n't really understand his own sexual persona he s driven and passionate and visionary , but completely benighted about what s going on in his own heart , loins and soul , mr madden said and that requires an actor of tremendous skill , because he s deflecting so much , so much of the time this thought process led mr madden to mr sheen , the celebrated welsh actor who has played more dynamic historical figures like david frost \( in the stage and film versions of \) and tony blair \( in the deal and the special relationship \) mr sheen , who at the time was playing hamlet at the young vic theater in london , was not familiar with masters and johnson and acknowledged that the role was not an easy fit for me , necessarily but as he contemplated the idea of working in the resurgent field of serialized american television , and the possibility of getting to build a character over several years , mr sheen said he started to take a liking to the bottledup masters he s like an iceberg , he said you just see the tip of it , and there s all this stuff underneath also , he said , it made me think about who grows up to become a gynecologist \? after speaking with other doctors in the field and reading more about masters , who was abused as a child by his father and not protected by his mother , mr sheen said he has a kind of control issue a godlike divinity with the power of life , to be given to people as a fertility expert he grows up with both a desire to help and rescue women , but also to have power and control over them showtime embraced masters of sex as an onlyinpaycable idea , said david nevins , the network s president for entertainment , and not because it bore a superficial resemblance to a certain esteemed cable drama also set in america s tumultuous mid20th century i love mad men , ' mr nevins said , but i was n't so interested in doing another show fetishizing midcentury furniture what distinguished masters of sex and the awakening cultural revolutionaries at its center was that its contemporary relevance was so obvious , and so in the forefront , he said the taboos that they were dealing with are honestly still exactly the same taboos today just as homeland , showtime s emmywinning thriller , caught on by injecting itself into ongoing debates about terrorism and espionage , mr nevins said he hoped masters of sex would similarly be bait for cultural critics and editors , as long as it did not descend into dismissible prurience the trick is to take that license and use it for good , he said , and be smarter and more interesting than people assume you will be with a title like masters of sex' for anyone who appears on camera in masters of sex , that means the likelihood of being seen without clothes , a certain amount of goodnatured discomfort , and the outside chance of being tested with an exploratory device that masters and johnson nicknamed ulysses far from being put off by the potentially delicate material , mr sheen said he was enthusiastic about a series where sexuality was not just front and center but nearly ubiquitous it s not even about being tasteful , he said in most shows or movies , there s usually just that one big sex scene in masters of sex , he said , this is what the show s about awkwardness and all masters and johnson , he said , opened a lid on it and freed so many people it would be a terrible , terrible thing if we put the lid back on by going , here s perfect sex between perfect people , ' he said \( mr sheen seemed more disappointed that he would not have to shave his head to play the balding masters i was hoping i would , he said i thought that was kind of great but everyone decided that was n't a good idea \) after several weeks of work on the first 12episode season of the show , ms caplan said she was gradually getting over the intimidation of working with the accomplished but gentle mr sheen \( recalling an exchange from their introductory dinner , where mr sheen was discussing his immersive , 72hourlong sitespecific theater production , ms caplan said she replied uh , that s great , michael i was in a movie with dane cook' \) but then again , her selfconsciousness was something she had to shed the moment she walked through the door total strangers can come and tape electrodes to their body and masturbate in front of me , and i'm just cool with it , ms caplan said of her work on the show like , i do n't even flinch at this point i was driving home one day , she added , and it dawned on me , like , oh , yeah , i measured a girl s nipple today' and i forgot about it because it just happens now all the time
washington made addressing the most prominent policy vow of , setting in motion what democrats say will be a deliberately paced but aggressive campaign built around the use of his executive powers to sidestep congressional opposition we will respond to the threat of climate change , knowing that failure to do so would betray our children and future generations , mr obama said on monday at the start of eight sentences on the subject , more than he devoted to any other specific area some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science , but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires , and crippling drought , and more powerful storms the central place he gave to the subject seemed to answer the question of whether he considered it a realistic secondterm priority he devoted scant attention to it in the campaign and has delivered a mixed message about its importance since the election mr obama is heading into the effort having extensively studied the lessons from his first term , when he failed to win passage of comprehensive legislation to reduce emissions of the gases that cause global warming this time , the white house plans to avoid such a fight and instead focus on what it can do administratively to reduce emissions from power plants , increase the efficiency of home appliances and have the federal government itself produce less carbon pollution mr obama s path on global warming is a case study in his evolving sense of the limits of his power and his increased willingness to work around intense conservative opposition rather than seek compromise after coming to office four years ago on a pledge to heal the planet and turn back the rise of the seas , he is proceeding cautiously this time , democrats said , intent on making sure his approach is vetted politically , economically and technologically so as not to risk missing what many environmental advocates say could be the last best chance for years to address the problem the centerpiece will be action by the to clamp down further on emissions from burning power plants under regulations still being drafted and likely to draw legal challenges the administration plans to supplement that step by adopting new energy efficiency standards for home appliances and buildings , a seemingly small advance that can have a substantial impact by reducing demand for electricity those standards would echo the sharp increase in fuel economy that the administration required from automakers in the first term the pentagon , one of the country s largest energy users , is also taking strides toward cutting use and converting to renewable fuels mr obama s aides are planning those steps in conjunction with a campaign to build public support and head off political opposition in a way the administration did not the last time around but the white house has cautioned activists not to expect fullscale engagement while congress remains occupied by guns , and the budget the president s emphasis on climate change drew fire from conservatives tim phillips , president of americans for prosperity , a group financed by the koch brothers , who made a fortune in refining and other interests , criticized the speech in a statement his address read like a liberal laundry list with global warming at the top , mr phillips said americans have rejected environmental extremism in the past and they will again still , mr obama has signaled that he intends to expand his own role in making a public case for why action is necessary and why , despite the conservative argument that such changes would cost jobs and leave the united states less competitive with rising powers like china , they could have economic benefits by promoting a cleanenergy industry in addition to the prominent mention on monday , mr obama also used strong language in , referring to the destructive power of a warming planet those remarks stood in contrast to mr obama s comments at his first postelection news conference , when he said he planned to convene a wideranging conversation about climate change and was vague about action he is also expected to highlight his plans in his next month and in his budget plan soon afterward beyond new policies , the administration is seeking to capitalize on the surge of production over the past few years as a cheaper and cleaner alternative to coal , natural gas gives it a chance to argue that coal is less economically attractive after the defeat in 2010 of legislation that would have capped carbon emissions and issued tradable permits for emissions , mr obama turned to regulation and financing for alternative energy despite the lack of comprehensive legislation , emissions have declined roughly 10 percent since he took office , a result both of the economic slowdown and of energy efficiency moves by government and industry the administration is discussing with congressional democrats , some of whom are leery of the issue because their states are home to coal businesses , how to head off a republican counterattack on the new regulations democrats are paying particular attention to the likelihood of republicans employing a littleused procedure to block new regulations with a simple majority vote senate democrats are also girding for a battle when mr obama nominates a new head of the epa the agency , excoriated by republicans as a jobkilling bureaucracy , would take the lead in setting the new regulations the approach is a turnabout from the first term , when mr obama s guiding principle in trying to pass the bill was that a negotiated legislative solution was likely to be more politically palatable than regulation by executive fiat now there is a broad expectation that he will follow up his first big use of the epa s powers to rein in emissions proposed rules last year for new power plants with a plan to crack down on emissions from existing power plants according to estimates from the , emissions from current coalfired plants could be reduced by more than 25 percent by 2020 , yielding large health and environmental benefits at relatively low cost such an approach would allow mr obama to fulfill his 2009 pledge to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by about 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 , the group says there s a really big opportunity , perhaps bigger than most people realize , said dan lashof , director of the defense council s climate and clean air program the regulatory push will be particularly important because mr obama has little prospect of winning as much money for clean energy as he did in his first term , with republicans now in control of the house despite the renewed attention to climate change following and recordhigh temperatures in the continental united states last year , there is little sign that the politics of the issue will get any easier for mr obama
istanbul when flight attendants first rode aboard in the late 1940s they wore cotton blouses under blue suits tailored to accentuate the contours of the body , as a fashion history of the airline puts it in the '60s and '70s the trend continued with fashions straight off the paris runway , designed to show s european flair on its flagship airline now , the country s shifting mores are reflected in a proposed long dresses , skirts below the knee and ottomanstyle fez caps this being turkey , where seemingly trifling matters can become bitter contests over identity , mockups leaked to the news media have caused quite a stir , eliciting passionate reactions from the secular and the pious , and from those who support the traditions of modern turkey and others who are nostalgic for the days of the ottoman empire on twitter , some turks mocked the new uniforms as reminiscent of the costumes worn in magnificent century , a popular about the decadent reign of sultan suleiman the magnificent in the 16th century the dispute was only heightened after the airline said it was banning alcohol on some domestic and international flights others slammed the new look as too conservative , a transparent effort to please the islamistrooted justice and development party headed by prime minister recep tayyip erdogan the party s decadelong run in power has wrought changes in the traditionally secular culture , like the acceptance of islamic head scarves in public and on college campuses and restrictions on alcohol in certain places it is a reaction against imposing a certain lifestyle to all institutions in turkey , said ayse saktanber , a sociologist at the middle east technical university in ankara turkey is a pragmatic society which does n't like to fall behind the world these new costumes came with the alcohol ban on planes she added , even my students with head scarves find these ridiculous in a statement to the local news media , turkish airlines tried to mute the uproar , saying that the design was leaked prematurely and that it is just one option among many being considered among those that reinterpret traditional turkish designs , there are also others that stick out with their modernist approach that turkish airlines has now become a locus of the country s culture wars is perhaps not surprising , given that the airline is considered something of a national treasure by many turks this is particularly true of secularists , who see it as presenting the face of turkey to the world they recall that it was founded under mustafa kemal ataturk , the father of modern turkey who instituted secularism with an iron hand and banned the fez , among other symbols of ottoman times with turkey s rise as an economic and political power over the past decade , tourism has soared feeding some of the backlash against the new uniforms is the fear that tourists , many of whom form their first impressions of turkey on a turkish airlines flight , will get the wrong impression and for all the talk of turkey pivoting from the west and becoming a new leader of the muslim world , the flight schedules tell a different narrative in january nearly four times as many passengers flew to europe as to the middle east some feel that turkish airlines , nearly 50percentowned by the government , is simply trying to please mr erdogan , who , when he is not being accused by his opponents of being a strict islamist , is referred to as a latterday sultan for his accrual of power turkish airlines is leaning toward a more conservative line , said serdar tasci , a sociologist who also works as a consultant to the main secular political party , the republican people s party , or chp on the one hand it is trying to be a global brand , and on the other it is allying with the neoconservative policies of the political power in a written statement , the chairman of turkish airlines' board of directors did not deny that the airline was doing the government s bidding in fact , he adamantly confirmed it the turkish airlines vision matches with our government s vision , said the chairman , hamdi topcu there is no difference between them and us it is the government that appointed us he added , the turkish republic s government , which came to power with democratic elections and gained the confidence of its people , represents this country s values in a sense , mr tasci said , the stir caused by the uniform designs is just a new twist in a perpetual conflict here there has been a cultural clash here for the last 200 years , mr tasci said but now they are bringing back the old as something new , and that is increasing the conflict kemal kilicdaroglu , the chairman of the chp , said in an interview that it s just not possible for them to go ahead with the designs that were leaked to the papers this airline represents turkey s image the uproar has cast a spotlight on the turkish designer dilek hanif , who was commissioned by the airline to redesign the uniforms ms hanif seems to encapsulate the divides and diversity of turkey s culture a favorite of the paris haute couture scene , her clothes are often inspired by ottoman fashions , and she is said to be a favorite of turkey s headscarfwearing first lady , hayrunnisa gul in an interview , ms hanif said the uniform designs that appeared online were not final she attributed the negative reaction especially from those who found no deeper cultural meaning and simply called the designs ugly to the callousness of the fashion industry , apparently as fierce in istanbul as it is in new york , paris and milan contrary to the photos that were leaked , she said , we are also working on a range of modern designs yildirim mayruk , another turkish designer , was quoted in the turkish news media as saying , even if they are not finalized i think it is a disgrace to design them evoking the legacy of ataturk s secularist ideology , referred to as kemalism , he added , how right is it for a kemalist woman to design such clothes \? ms hanif said her designs have always been a synthesis of east and west , and is none too happy about being thrust to the front lines of turkey s culture wars i am still working on different designs , colors and alternatives , she said when the designs are finished , they will be presented to turkey and the world
after two days of indecisive conflict , the union army sealed its victory at gettysburg on july 3 , 1863 , by repulsing a confederate attack over nearly a mile of open ground , directed at the center of the federal defense the attack involved 13 , 000 soldiers from five states under the command of gen james longstreet , but lives historically as pickett s charge the attack is one of the most infamous in military history , yet most people know little about it what happened , exactly , on that afternoon in july \? much of it hangs neither on gen george pickett nor longstreet , but gen robert e lee , whose perspective this article examines as the army of northern virginia began its pennsylvania invasion a month before , the sands of the confederacy were draining low in triumph lee had gained no lasting advantage by successively defeating four union commanders in virginia during the preceding 11 months his enemy simply reorganized north of the rappahannock river , designated a new commander , and replenished losses before renewing relentless pressure on the outnumbered rebels meanwhile , in mississippi , ulysses s grant held vicksburg in a death grip while southern resources steadily diminished everywhere consequently , lee believed that the best chance for confederate independence was to win the war quickly despite union success in the west , public and diplomatic interest focused on the east if lee could draw the federal army of the potomac , recently defeated at chancellorsville , into pennsylvania and decisively beat it again in a series of hammer blows , northern public support for the war might collapse as one massachusetts solider wrote home after the union victory , if the battle had gone against us , i should have made straight for home and had lots of company in a private meeting with gen isaac trimble the week before gettysburg , lee presciently explained how he hoped to sequentially wreck the seven corps of the federal army our army is in good spirits and can be concentrated in twentyfour hours when the enemy hear where we are they will make forced marches to interpose between us and baltimore and philadelphia they will come up strung out in a long line much demoralized when they come into pennsylvania i shall throw an overwhelming force on their advance , crush it drive one corps back on another and by successive blows create a panic and virtually destroy their army the first of gettysburg s three days almost perfectly conformed to lee s hopes only the union s first and 11th corps opposed him both were routed , suffering almost 50 percent casualty rates , including thousands who surrendered at the end of the second day , lee knew he had also smashed the illplaced federal third corps and could believe that he had badly damaged the second and fifth only the sixth was intact , but lee could not be certain it had even arrived , or would be available on the third day lee had three choices that day remain in place , retreat or attack he could remain idle only briefly because the federals were sure to be reinforced while the confederates could not , thereby lengthening the odds against him a retreat would forfeit victory to the federals and require a return to the weakening defensive status in virginia the only real choice was to attack , the only question how the final answer was pickett s charge the charge was not the only option discussed by lee and his generals , or even lee s first choice his second in command , longstreet , wanted to maneuver around the south end of the union army and assume a defensive position or attack but such a maneuver was risky it would invite union general george meade to attack the rebel army by the flank while it was in march formation and likely destroy it instead , lee initially settled on a plan to simultaneously assault the federal fishhookshaped defense from two directions one would be from the northeast , to seize the baltimore pike behind yankee lines the second would attack the fishhook shank and capture the taneytown road if successful , meade s army would be split into three components , with rebels blocking the best escape and reinforcement routes temporarily successful attacks on both sectors the previous day indicated that a harder push on the 3rd could succeed unfortunately , the federal 12th corps took the initiative at dawn on the third day , attacking the confederates along the northeast perimeter since lee s arrangements to attack the fishhook shank were not yet completed , his own plans for a twopronged assault had been preempted although he could hope that his forces on the northeast might still defeat the 12th corps , he couldn t assume such an outcome he could either give up and return to virginia , or develop a new plan like all civil war generals , lee appreciated that frontal assaults , like the one he was contemplating that morning , were rarely successful however , two months earlier , at chancellorsville , he defeated this exact same army with a combination of vigorous assaults when his command was only half as big as the enemy s his men were in high spirits , and he concluded it was a calculated risk that offered a prize worth the gamble if the attack was preceded by a skilled artillery bombardment and accompanied by advancing batteries , as at chancellorsville , it might succeed the rebel barrage from 163 guns began about 1 pm unfortunately , faulty fuses , a gradual tendency to shoot high after repeated recoils , and obscuring black powder smoke rendered the 90minute cannonade less effective than hoped since an administrative error removed the reserve ammunition to a rear position , col edward porter alexander , who oversaw the artillery , couldn t effectively move forward to protect the advancing infantry the failed artillery bombardment doomed picket s charge to futile glory although meade had drained troops from his center to strengthen his flanks , as lee hoped , the union was still able to meet the confederate charge with 13 , 000 soldiers in contrast , the original 13 , 000 attacking confederates were depleted by artillery fire as they marched over nearly a mile of open ground about 40 guns each from the north and south end of the federal line smothered the rebels in a deadly crossfire one northerner characterized the situation as an artillerist s dream and infantryman s nightmare upon reaching the emmitsburg road , the confederates met canister fire , which results when artillery is loaded with shrapnelpacked shells , transforming them into giant shotguns one michigan soldier wrote , i never saw such canister slaughter at the highwater mark , where the union line was pierced for 10 minutes , only about 2 , 500 rebels were left to make the final charge the rest were retreating , captured or casualties officer losses were so numerous that none were left to order retreat lee rode out to meet the survivors , repeatedly accepting blame without trying to shift any to someone else it is all my fault , he said again and again in response to a despondent general lee said , never mind , general all this has been my fault it is i that have lost this fight , and you must help me out of it in the best way you can he remained consistent a month later when he absolved the army in a letter to the confederate president , jefferson davis , i alone am to blame in perhaps expecting too much of its prowess and valor despite his gloom , lee presciently recognized that the gettysburg carnage left meade cautious despite his victory if gettysburg didn t result in a confederate victory lee predicted there would be no major federal offensive in virginia for the rest of the year except for a modest union effort late in november , he was correct thus , two months later he was able to dispatch general longstreet s entire corps to georgia where it contributed to the confederate victory at chickamauga follow

this is the way the euro ends not with the banks but with bungabunga ok , the euro isn t doomed yet but the italian election signals that the eurocrats , who never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity , are getting very close to the edge the fundamental fact is that a policy of austerity for all incredibly harsh austerity in debtor nations , but some austerity in the european core too , and not a hint of expansionary policy anywhere is a complete failure none of the nations under brussels berlinimposed austerity has shown even a hint of economic recovery unemployment is at societydestroying levels this failure came close to destroying the euro twice , in late 2011 and again last summer , as debtor nations threatened to enter a doom loop of plunging bond prices and failing banks each time mario draghi and the ecb stepped in to contain the damage , first by lending to the banks buying sovereign debt \( ltro \) then by announcing a willingness to buy sovereign debt directly \( omt \) but rather than taking the neardeath experience as a warning , europe s austerians took the ecbengineered calming of markets as a sign that austerity was working well , the suffering voters of europe just told them differently how could they not have seen this coming \? well , in europe even more than in the us the very serious people live in a bubble of selfregard at their own seriousness , and imagine that the general public will follow their lead hey , it s the only responsible thing to do wolfgang m nchau has a great lede in his column today , that gets at the essence there was a symbolic moment in the italian elections when i knew that the game was up for mario monti , the defeated prime minister it was when in the middle of the campaign in the midst of an antiestablishment insurgence he took off to davos to be with his friends from international finance and politics i know his visit to elite gathering in the swiss mountains was not an issue in the campaign , but it signalled to me an almost comic lack of political realism what europe s vsps fail to get is that the public perception of their right to lead depends on achieving at least some actual results what they have actually delivered , however , is years of incredible pain accompanied by repeated promises that recovery is just around the corner and then they wonder that many voters no longer trust their judgment , and turn to someone , anyone , who offers an alternative i wish i believed that the italian election would serve as a wakeup call a reason to , for example , give the ecb a green light for more expansion , a reason for germany to do some stimulus and for france to call off its unnecessary belttightening my guess , however , is that we ll just have more lectures to the italians and everyone else about how they just aren t trying hard enough and there may be worse figures than beppe grillo lurking in europe s future
as a taxpayer and a conservative who hopes to remain on good terms with the internal revenue service for many april 15ths to come , i do n't want to speculate too freely about the motives of the low level who decided to single out tea party groups for an inappropriate level of attention during the heat of the 2012 campaign but i'm willing to guess this much even though described their excessive interest in rightwing groups as about as constitutionally troubling as it gets , the bureaucrats in question probably thought they were just doing their patriotic duty , and giving dangerous extremists the treatment they deserved where might an enterprising , publicspirited irs agent get the idea that a tea party group deserved more scrutiny from the government than the typical band of activists seeking taxexempt status \? oh , i do n't know why , maybe from all the prominent voices who spent the first two years of the obama era worrying that the tea party just a typically messy expression of citizen activism , but something much darker an expression of cryptofascist , cryptoracist rage , part timothy mcveigh and part bull connor , potentially carrying a wave of terrorist violence in its wings the historical term for this kind of anxiety is brown scare an inordinate fear of a vast farright conspiracy , which resembles the anticommunist panics of our past as the historian in 2009 , brown scares no less than red scares recur throughout american history they fasten on realenough phenomena , from homegrown fascist sympathizers in the 1930s to the militia movements in the 1990s , but then wildly exaggerate both the danger these extremists pose and their ties to the conservative mainstream in the '30s , jenkins noted , this mentality inspired the persistent mediafed fear that the us was about to be overwhelmed by ultraright fifth columnists , millions strong , intimately allied with the axis powers in the '60s , it persuaded many liberals that dallas s rightwing fever was somehow responsible for john f kennedy s assassination even though the president s actual assassin was a communist sympathizer \( persists to the present day \) after the oklahoma city bombing , it led many people to tar the entire militia movement as terrorist , not just extremist , and then to conflate the militias \( this was one of \) with the mainstream smallgovernment right our own era s brown scare followed a similar pattern early in president obama s first term , a department of homeland security predicted an increase in rightwing extremism , citing real threats but also employing a definition of extremist so broad , reason magazine s jesse walker noted , that it seemed to include anyone who opposed abortion or immigration or excessive federal power as the tea party movement gathered steam , liberals consistently echoed the dhs report s themes , warning that the movement s fringier elements and oftenoverheated rhetoric \( which were real enough , and worth criticizing \) were laying the groundwork for a wave of farright violence and oklahoma city , these critics then leapt to connect the dots every time a kook pulled a gun or set off a bomb somewhere whether it was a lone neonazi shooting a guard at the holocaust museum in washington , the apparent murder \( ultimately ruled a suicide \) of a in rural kentucky , or even the failed times square bombing \( which turned out to be the work of a wouldbe jihadist , but not before michael bloomberg had suggested that it might be someone with a political agenda that does n't like the health care bill or something \) the dotsconnecting peaked , of course , with the shooting of gabrielle giffords , which was instantly deemed a case of rightwing incitement leading to political violence , with the blame going to sarah palin , glenn beck and conservatism in general when none of this turned out to be true , however the shooter was not really a political actor at all , but just a mentally ill lost soul with no connection to partisan politics the scare began a slow retreat the tea party had won its midterm victory , and as the movement s ardor cooled and its influence diminished , the fears of its critics began to diminish as well with beck off fox and the tea partyers off the streets replaced by occupy wall street and union protesters , often shouting nonetoomoderate slogans of their own it became harder to look at american conservatism and see brownshirts or grand wizards on the march but moods and prejudices linger even after panics recede the irs and the conservative movement have never been on the best of terms , and perhaps the recent abuses just reflect that longstanding tension but i suspect it s more than that , and that this episode will be remembered as one of the last embarrassments produced by our era s brown scare
d james dee retired this spring after 39 years in business as the soho photographer , with a high reputation for documenting artwork and gallery installations , great stories about the new york art scene in the late 20th century and more than 250 , 000 color transparencies and blackandwhite negatives for which he no longer had any use he and his wife , sarala , are moving to miami from their home and studio at 12 wooster street the vans will arrive monday and mr dee made it plain , in an article published june 4 in the new york times , that his photo archive was not coming along , even though it amounted to an astonishingly broad and professional visual record of new york artists and galleries , beginning in the mid1970s with the sculptor george segal the only hitch and it is not inconsiderable is that almost none of mr dee s images are labeled the transparencies were extra exposures he made at the time of shooting , as a kind of insurance the negatives were used to produce prints for clients after the jobs were done , he tossed the film in a box at the end , there were more than 65 boxes , far too many to take into retirement and a second career as an artist in his own right if no one claimed the collection , mr dee lamented , it was bound for a dumpster those who did step forward in the weeks after the article appeared included the state hermitage museum in st petersburg and the george eastman house international museum of photography and film in rochester , ny for one reason or another , however , nothing quite fit moving day was approaching quickly then came ian mcdermott , the collection development manager of artstor , a nonprofit , subscriptiononly digital archive that serves some 1 , 500 universities , colleges , libraries and museums worldwide artstor plans to work with museum and gallery officials , scholars and librarians to identify most of the artworks and installations in the captionless photos by mr dee crowdsourcing may one day complete the task a deal was born mr dee gave his archive to artstor , with the hope of receiving a tax deduction artstor will pay him to serve as a consultant as it begins digitizing the images and trying to catalog them there s a little more dotconnecting to do , mr mcdermott said tuesday , as a van pulled up at 12 wooster street to take the boxes away \( artstor is based in manhattan , making the logistics a bit easier \) mr dee demurred there s a lot more dotconnecting to do , he said , relieved that his archive had found a good home and that he would now have one less thing to do before leaving new york
the pro bowl receiver victor cruz signed a oneyear , restricted freeagent tender with the giants on friday , according to a person with knowledge of the deal the move gave both sides more time to work out a longterm agreement the deal worth 2879 million came days before the giants could have potentially reduced cruz s salary to 630 , 000 now the sides have nine months to try to reach a new agreement before cruz becomes an unrestricted free agent or is placed under a franchise tag the signing was first reported by espn on friday morning cruz , 26 , was initially offered the tender march 11 , and he had until april 19 to solicit better offers from other teams when none came , cruz had until june 17 to sign the giants' tender or , under the nfl s collective bargaining agreement , the team had the right to reduce cruz s tender by as much as 110 percent of the previous year s salary cruz skipped the giants' organized team activities last week and missed minicamp practices this week because of the ongoing negotiations he led the team in receiving the last two seasons , averaging 84 catches , 1 , 309 yards and 95 touchdowns , setting a team record with 1 , 536 yards receiving in 2011 his salsadancing touchdown routine became a sensation during the giants' super bowl run that season , and cruz , who was undrafted out of the university of massachusetts , became an overnight marketing phenomenon his no 80 jersey was the seventhmost popular jersey sold on the nfl s official online store this season if cruz has another similarly productive season , he could possibly command a deal on par with the 60 million over five years mike wallace received from the miami dolphins in march cruz is reportedly looking for a deal close to 10 million per season , not far below the annual salaries of receivers larry fitzgerald , calvin johnson , andre johnson , wallace and dwayne bowe if cruz does not sign a longterm deal with the giants , they could wind up losing both cruz and hakeem nicks , who is entering the fifth and final year of a 1254 million deal he signed in 2009 nicks , who had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in march , skipped organized team activities last week for a reason he chose not to disclose publicly nicks s absence also seemed to catch coach tom coughlin by surprise , and coughlin bristled when asked tuesday about his return to minicamp he s definitely not in tune with where we are , coughlin said the offensive coordinator kevin gilbride echoed the sentiment about cruz and nicks , saying this week that their absence was clearly noted the thing is they have n't been working , they have n't been listening , they have n't been growing , they have n't been developing , gilbride said they have n't been receiving the coaching that they need to get better to be quite frank , they need it but with cruz s deal now secure for the moment , the expectation is that he will report to training camp in july and pick up where he left off last season as the giants' dynamic slot receiver , in full salsadancing form
nairobi , kenya the crater of rubble where the mall collapsed is still so hot that investigators are having a hard time examining it for clues none of the bodies of the militants killed in the deadly siege have been clearly identified even the four attackers captured on security cameras are being called pink shirt , white shirt , black shirt , blue shirt , because investigators are not sure of their real names , said an official who had been briefed on the investigation nearly three weeks after militants stormed the westgate shopping mall in nairobi , killing more than 60 men , women and children , there are still as many questions as answers kenyan officials , using communications between the attackers overheard by witnesses , images captured on security cameras and information from unidentified sources , have released the names of some suspected of being assailants , but they are believed to be noms de guerre , not their birth names investigators are still tracing calls made from inside the mall during the attack to try to determine the precise identities of the combatants , the official said even the number of militants remains unknown kenyan officials had said that 10 to 15 militants attacked the mall with automatic rifles and grenades , but that number has fallen to as low as four and was probably no more than six for kenya , there s still not a lot of clarity about the specifics of the attack , said daveed gartensteinross , an expert on somalia and the shabab at the foundation for defense of democracies in washington the somali militant group known as the shabab claimed responsibility for the assault , and officials briefed on the investigation said that elements of the group appeared to have carried it out the shabab formally pledged their allegiance to al qaeda in 2012 , but the crosspollination among militant groups in east africa has a long history , making for networks spanning several countries there has to have been a significant period of surveillance and planning and effort to prepare for this , said another official , who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing they were too well organized they were too clear about where they were going and what was happening for there to have been anything but a period of surveillance and a good understanding of what they were going to do investigators have also been confronted by the collapse of a large section of the mall , which left behind a gaping crater full of debris the pit is still hot and is emitting fumes , products of combustion , which frankly is slowing and hampering the investigation , said one of the officials more bodies have been found in the rubble , but it is not clear whether they were attackers or victims the that they were investigating whether a norwegian citizen was involved in the siege , while the sudanese government has rejected kenya s claim that another suspect , identified as abu baara alsudani , was from sudan the many security cameras in the mall are providing much of the information investigators have to go on surveillance tapes show that wounded civilians were executed , but there is no evidence of torture or mutilation of bodies up to this point , one official said some analysts have questioned whether the shabab would be capable of conducting such a complicated operation on foreign soil , but major attacks by the group this year on a united nations compound and court complex in somalia s capital , mogadishu , have underscored the group s ambition and ability to carry out everdeadlier missions it s been obvious over the course of this year that they 've been involved in increasingly sophisticated attacks , mr gartensteinross said they 've clearly shown the ability to project power into kenya
sanford , fla a jury of six women will decide whether george zimmerman was acting in selfdefense when he fatally shot , an unarmed black teenager , in an altercation at a townhouse community here in february last year mr zimmerman is charged with seconddegree murder in the case , which set off national protests and cries of injustice because he was not initially arrested after claiming selfdefense the jurors , none of them black , include a hispanic woman with eight children , an animal rescuer who once had a concealedweapons permit , and a woman who said she had used mr martin s death as a cautionary example for her two adolescent children of the four alternates chosen for the case , two were men , and all were white nearly all of the jurors have children that the final jury was made up solely of women was unusual , legal experts said but what might resonate more in this racially charged case is that all but one of the jurors is white diana tennis , a defense lawyer based in orlando , said the chances of having a sixperson jury without any black jurors were high given the demographics of seminole county , where 11 percent of the population is black but should mr zimmerman , who is hispanic , be acquitted by a jury that includes no blacks could become a point of contention in the trial s aftermath , she said it s not statistically significant , ms tennis said , but whether or not it s significant for the community depending on the outcome is another thing potential jurors were questioned methodically , as lawyers for the state and the defense sought to weed out those who had formed opinions in this widely publicized case about 500 people were sent summonses pretrial questionnaires slimmed down that pool , and those who reached the last part of the process underwent oneonone questioning by both sides before appearing thursday for the final selection originally , the jury selection phase was projected to last three weeks , but it took only nine days the jurors , who are to remain anonymous for the duration of the trial , are referred to in court only by number they will be sequestered from monday onward , when opening statements are scheduled to begin the trial is expected to last two to four weeks experts had various opinions on whether an allfemale pool of jurors would be more of a benefit to the prosecution or to the defense women as a group might be less receptive to zimmerman s behavior than men , jules epstein , an associate professor at widener university school of law , wrote in an email also , ms tennis said , women might be more sympathetic to the loss of a child luis calderon , a criminal lawyer in orlando , said that because many of the women were older , they might identify with mr zimmerman s claim of selfdefense more one of the things you have to show is reasonable fear , he said , of being overpowered , of being helpless , of being in a situation where you ca n't defend yourself physically older women , he said , would be more inclined to understand that after court was adjourned , mr zimmerman s lead defense lawyer , mark o'mara , said , what i do think we have , and i'm very happy with this , is six jurors who have told us that they 'll be fair and impartial in a statement , the martin family s legal team said it also expected a fair and impartial jury with the makeup of this jury , the question of whether every american can get equal justice regardless of who serves on their jury panel will be answered , the statement read equal justice under the law is not a black value or a white value
exeter , nh racked by sudden spasms in her shoulders , back and hands the things she most relies upon to offset her paralyzed legs the american swimmer victoria arlen failed to qualify for the final in the 100meter breaststroke at the paralympics last summer but she persevered in the freestyle , going on to become one of the competition s breakout stars when arlen returned home to new hampshire with four medals and a world record , exeter threw her a parade but arlen s glittering paralympic career is now in jeopardy this summer , she became enmeshed in a dispute with the international paralympic committee over an issue fundamental to her identity and to the complicated , often ambiguous science behind paralympic competition whether she is disabled enough even to qualify as a competitor days before she was due to swim in the world championships in montreal in august , she was ruled ineligible because , the committee declared , she had failed to provide conclusive evidence of a permanent eligible impairment arlen , 19 , spent three years in a vegetative state because of an autoimmune disorder and woke in 2010 with paralyzed legs and other symptoms of the neurological condition transverse myelitis she said she was being punished because of her doctor s belief that there was a chance that her condition might improve being penalized for maybe having a glimmer of hope of one day being able to walk again is beyond sad , arlen said in an interview at home in a followup email , she said to have trained so hard this past year and come so far only to be humiliated and targeted by the ipc for reasons unknown baffles me for its part , the committee says it had no choice according to the rules , athletes have to provide evidence of permanent impairment to compete in the paralympics , and we do not have satisfactory confirmation of that , said peter van de vliet , the committee s medical and scientific director classifying disabled athletes sorting them into classes according to the type and severity of their disabilities is immensely complex , often subjective and among the toughest tasks the paralympic committee faces some cases , likes those involving congenital limb deformity , are straightforward but others , like neurological illnesses with fluctuating multiple symptoms like the one afflicting arlen , are not if you 're classifying an amputee , either they 've got a leg or they have n't , and in 12 months , they still wo n't have a leg , van de vliet said but when you get to these types of wheelchair athletes , it gets tricky officials are not suggesting that arlen is lying , but the paralympics is becoming increasingly competitive , and there are many cases of athletes exaggerating or faking disabilities the committee is still haunted by the saga of monique van der vorst of the netherlands , who won two silver medals in handcycling at the beijing 2008 paralympics she was paralyzed when she competed , apparently having muscular dystrophy but two years later , after 13 years in a wheelchair , she walked again she was given a new diagnosis conversion disorder , a psychiatric condition in which patients suffer inexplicable neurological symptoms the committee allowed van der vorst to keep her medals , but later it emerged that perhaps she had in which even van der vorst said while competing as a paralympian what would be the reaction of competitors who had raced victoria if , in a few years , she was able to walk \? van de vliet said the committee often reclassifies athletes and places them into different competition classes , depending on the severity of their impairments it has declared athletes ineligible before , including some who have simply misinterpreted the rules recently , van de vliet said , a jamaican competitor showed up at a competition with a note from his optician saying this man has a visual impairment , but when he wears his glasses , everything s fine the committee sent him home van de vliet said , it was a particularly sad case arlen s situation is different , in part because she is such a highprofile athlete after the international committee ruled her ineligible , her case became a cause c l bre , with sympathetic and other outlets new hampshire s governor and two senators publicly criticized the committee s ruling photogenic , poised , articulate , bitterly disappointed , a television natural \( she also models and works as a motivational speaker \) , arlen makes a formidable opponent for the paralympic committee it is impossible to hear her story about being a star child athlete who suddenly grew weaker and weaker and sicker and sicker until she became incapacitated about her years in a vegetative state and her family s search for medical answers about how she woke and had to relearn to talk , read and eat about how she resolved to be a paralympic swimmer about her triumph last summer without feeling sympathetic she was brought into the paralympic movement by people who knew about it and told her she could be good at it , and she trained and did everything she was asked to do , arlen s coach , john ogden , said in an interview she has been emotionally scarred and traumatized by this i am so disappointed in the paralympic movement right now , i ca n't even tell you but it is hard to ignore the committee s arguments that the matter is far from simple we take no pleasure in telling an athlete they 're not eligible to compete , van de vliet said there s no question that she s a great athlete , and no question that she s not faking but not every illness constitutes an entry into the paralympics and every sport has its rules , and we were provided with medical evidence that does not conform to the diagnosis of a permanent impairment the questions over arlen s eligibility began before the olympics last summer , when someone anonymously sent several videos to the ipc of arlen in competition and in television reports they seemed to indicate , officials said , that there was muscular activity in arlen s lower limbs one of the videos showed her doing what appeared to be tumble turns , in which swimmers push off from the side of the pool between laps with their legs an official raised questions on whether she should be able to do tumble turns but arlen cannot , ogden said it s an optical illusion he says that she has perfected a way of pushing off with her hands , but that she does it so deftly it looks as if she is using her legs we devised a flip turn where she can flip and put one hand out , he said she can turn as well as some of my ablebodied kids the paralympic committee was mulling over arlen s case when she arrived in london last summer after seeing her briefly , it delivered its verdict she was ineligible but the united states olympic committee protested , and an independent arbitrator ruled that she should be properly classified and allowed to race she was then subject to a grueling physical assessment , in and out of the water , over about three hours , in which , among other things , she was asked repeatedly to demonstrate that she could not move her legs the usoc kept telling the ipc guy , this is abusive , ' arlen s father , larry , said in the end , arlen competed under what is known as review status , meaning she would have to be reevaluated within a year arlen had a triumphant paralympics , winning a gold medal and three silvers in individual and relay events in the freestyle , and setting a world record in her class in the 100meter race she returned home a celebrity among other things , she threw the first pitch at a boston red sox game and dropped the first puck at a boston bruins match then she set her sights on the next big competition the 2013 world championships training 15 to 20 hours a week while also finishing high school ogden , her coach , said that there is no question about her disability it s not even a little bit ambiguous she ca n't walk , he said i run the biggest y swim team in the country , with 38 coaches and 500 kids , and there s no way she fakes anything the committee and arlen dispute what happened next arlen said she begged for a chance to be reclassified well in advance of the championships and sent more than 75 pages of medical and hospital records the committee said it asked repeatedly for documentation beyond what she provided , but none was forthcoming until late june that was after her meeting with dr michael levy , who reviewed arlen s case and gave her a 40minute preliminary examination at johns hopkins university the arlens said they consulted dr levy not because of any classification questions but because he is an expert in transverse myelitis dr levy confirmed the diagnosis , they said , and added a second one , of an autoimmune disorder called  the arlens said that helped explain many of victoria s symptoms , including her chronic stomach pain , her seizures , her inability to swallow and her threeyear lapse in and out of consciousness but van de vliet said that dr levy s medical report was reviewed separately by five doctors with experience in paralympic classification , and that it raised red flags the five all concluded , he said , that there were questions over the three main criteria used for paralympic classification whether arlen s diagnosis was accurate , how severe her impairment was and whether her condition was permanent among other things , van de vliet said , the report said there were motor tendon reflexes in the legs that seemed inconsistent with an absence of muscular activity he added that dr levy had set out a relatively detailed plan of rehabilitation that might help arlen walk again one day , suggesting that her condition might improve the arlens said the committee twisted dr levy s words his report , they said , found that she had some movement of her legs but no voluntary control victoria ca n't control her legs she is in a wheelchair and when she swims , she does not kick bottom line , jacqueline arlen , victoria s mother , said in an email but van de vliet said the committee contacted dr levy to ask followup questions and had been left unsatisfied the milliondollar question is , is this a permanent impairment \? he said the rules stipulate that only people with permanent impairments can compete , and the one thing the doctor could n't explain was whether this was a permanent impairment neither the arlens nor the committee would make the medical report available reached at work , dr levy said he had been told by johns hopkins that he could not comment jacqueline arlen , though , quoted dr levy as telling the committee that victoria had come to my clinic for a plan , not a second opinion regarding her eligibility to swim in a competition it is my duty to help her try to recover her maximum potential jacqueline arlen said he added i did not mean to imply that ms arlen would be able to walk quickly i also did not mean to imply that without a rehabilitation program , ms arlen will be able to recover on her own arlen was in montreal and ready to compete when the committee ruled her ineligible it denied her request to appeal , and she had to go home although naturally optimistic , she has been unable to get into the pool again and is not sure about her future as a paralympic swimmer she has good and bad days the nerve pain and muscle spasms are increasing , she says , and her hands are clenching more often that was the crazy thing about all this , arlen said my condition has gotten worse since london , and yet i was n't allowed to compete her parents are beside themselves it s cruel and heartbreaking , her mother said has n't she been hurt enough \? i'm done having my child hurt larry arlen said when he heard the ipc s verdict in montreal , i had the same feelings in my heart as i had when i was in the intensive care unit with her , wondering whether my daughter was going to live or die arlen said that she would be thrilled if her condition turned out to be temporary i would love more than anything to be running around , but that s not a reality , she said but the committee is standing by its decision if we ever receive sufficient medical evidence that shows she has a permanent impairment , she would be able to compete again , van de vliet said the door is open
as roger federer s summer of decline continued on monday , he refused to blame his bad back or an unfamiliar stadium for his earliest loss at the united states open in 10 years that left only his performance to explain another defeat and the pattern that continued to watch federer this summer is to listen to an opera singer who can no longer hit the high notes flashes of the usual brilliance remain but occur less frequently , less consistently , until a player who once seemed anything but beatable is now eminently so tennis is not like team sports , where aging outfielders become designated hitters , whose diminished skills can be hidden or disguised tennis is a solitary pursuit , like boxing , and when the reflexes slow and the legs go , the contrast is more obvious and stark in his 76 \( 3 \) , 63 , 64 loss to 19thseeded tommy robredo of spain , federer , seeded seventh , looked uncomfortable more than anything graceful footwork gave way to stumbles break points went unconverted where he once missed shots by inches , he missed by feet federer looked very much as he has looked throughout this summer vulnerable , human , diminished , if only slightly federer met the assembled reporters almost immediately afterward , a pattern consistent with his rare early exits at grand slam events he refused to accept the excuses lobbed in his direction his face glum , his eyes narrowed , he credited robredo through clenched teeth and blamed himself mostly , he blamed himself it s been a difficult last three months , you know , said federer , who was 100 against robredo my consistency is just not quite there yet maybe on a daily basis , setbyset or pointbypoint basis , maybe that s something that has been difficult for me it all seemed so surreal a rain delay forced federer to play at louis armstrong stadium to play at a smaller show court for the first time since 2006 and not at arthur ashe he squandered break points as if allergic to them the crowd , able to watch a star up close without paying for the most expensive tickets , implored federer forward the cracks in federer s game most revealed themselves in the firstset tiebreaker behind by 43 , federer hesitated , then charged on an approach shot , the lack of confidence evident in his first few steps robredo returned low , and federer clanked a backhand volley into the net stranger still , he charged the net again on the next point , as if he wanted to end it quickly , and robredo clocked a forehand winner and took the set on the next point commentators braced for a potential loss and its implications they noted that federer s record after losing the first set at a major tournament dropped to 2929 they searched for his last loss in the fourth round at the open \( david nalbandian , 2003 \) federer went on to play worse he looked especially tentative off the forehand he managed six breakpoint chances in the second set he converted none of them i almost don t believe what i m seeing , the commentator john mcenroe said on the espn broadcast it s not that he s missing it it s the lengths he s missing it by , the amount early into the third set , federer went ahead , 040 , on robredo s serve three more break points three more chances he shanked a forehand robredo passed him so continued this summer s pattern , a period that will mark the beginning of the end for a player many consider the best in tennis history or will simply constitute a stretch among the roughest of federer s career the latter will happen only if he rebounds , if he dominates again , if he wins another grand slam event all that seemed so far away monday so continued the pattern the secondround defeat at wimbledon , the semifinal loss in hamburg and the secondround fall at gstaad \( in his first match , no less \) , three stumbles that came against players ranked outside the top 50 , and now robredo federer , a fivetime open champion , had hoped to return to his old form under the lights in new york in the early rounds , he attacked more , volleyed more , approached the net as if this were 2004 all over again he did not lose a set in his first three victories then it ended , all of it his match his tournament his latest redemption bid the story of my life , federer said afterward when i lose , people are shellshocked to see me play this way as federer bumbled through his break chances , rafael nadal , once his chief rival , took the court at arthur ashe it was a scheduling quirk that nadal ended up there and federer at armstrong , but it seemed symbolic , too here were two players whose rivalry defined a generation of men s tennis , who have combined to win 29 grand slam singles titles , who because of an open rain delay ended up on court at the same time one ranked among the hottest players on tour this summer , the other desperate to halt a threemonth skid the delicious prospect loomed should both advance , they would meet in the next round , would meet for the first time at the united states open , in a quarterfinal nadal lost a set against philipp kohlschreiber but bullied his way into the quarterfinals , 67 \( 4 \) , 64 , 63 , 61 federer just lost so it goes in 2013 , when federer looks less and less like roger federer and more and more like the next great athlete to near the end maybe that is premature or maybe this , for federer , is the

andy benoit takes a quick tour of the weekend s playoff games share your thoughts ravens 38 , broncos 35 \( 2 ot \) this one belongs in the discussion of greatest playoff games of all time it s hard to give it the nod , though , because the most dramatic play and the most dramatic decision were more about one team s mistakes than about another team s greatness the mistakes came from the broncos one was safety rahim moore s failure to recognize his deephalf zone responsibilities on jacoby jones 70yard touchdown another was john fox telling peyton manning to take a knee with half a minute to go in regulation when the broncos had acceptable field position \( own 20 yardline \) and two timeouts why are you paying manning more than 1 million a game if you re not going to lean on him in that situation \? somewhat lost in the aftermath of this instant classic s drama is the epic performance of joe flacco we d call his 331yard , threetouchdown effort a coming out party except flacco already had his coming out party last year when he outplayed tom brady in the afc title game unfortunately , that performance was also overshadowed , thanks to lee evans s dropped touchdown and billy cundiff s missed field goal on saturday , flacco kept the ravens in it early with a pair of firsthalf touchdown strikes to torrey smith no one who watched the film on denver s week 15 thrashing of baltimore would have ever imagined the young wideout beating the future hall of famer s press coverage in the second half , flacco made a few tremendous throws down the stretch to his ancillary receivers , including a critical thirdand13 pass in the seam to dennis pitta flacco is the reason baltimore pulled off one of the bigger divisional round upsets in nfl history 49ers 45 , packers 31 it didn t take football america long to elevate colin kaepernick into stardom after this game twohundredandsixtythree yards and two touchdowns passing alone would have been great factor in the 181 yards and two touchdowns rushing and you have an alltime performance kaepernick was marvelous but why didn t packers defensive coordinator dom capers have someone spy him early on \? that s a tactic capers has done throughout the season \( often with clay matthews \) it s vital to do when playing tight man coverage against a mobile quarterback on the other side , san francisco played quality man coverage of its own \( as usual \) , keeping aaron rodgers in check no packers receiver other than james jones had over 55 yards , as rodgers frequently had to wait for the later reads in his progressions all season long , we ve talked up the downhill speed of san francisco s safeties and the coverage abilities of the inside linebackers those guys were great again on saturday , but the real stars were tarell brown and chris culliver on the outside and the 2011 pro bowler carlos rogers in the slot all three of those cornerbacks won their oneonone matchups against green bay s potent receivers falcons 30 , seahawks 28 the falcons played one of their sharpest games but still managed to create plenty of doubt about their playoff poise no need to talk about the onsidekick gaffe at the end it was a failure to execute a squib kick by punter matt bosher what s important is the way matt ryan led his team into fieldgoal range in the final seconds even though he supposedly doesn t \( or didn t \) have that ambiguous postseason it factor that lazy analysts love to talk about ryan and the offense did struggle a bit down the stretch against a seahawks defense that has two of the league s few cornerbacks who can take away downfield throws and wide receiver screens the falcons will have to sharpen up against the 49ers unlike the seahawks , the niners don t just have defensive backs who can contain roddy white and julio jones they also have linebackers who can defend tony gonzalez the veteran tight end s ability to make contested catches against tight coverage was the difference in this game the falcons will have to find a different difference next week defensively , seattle found the blueprint for beating atlanta s mixture of hybrid zones and rolling coverages trips sets \( ie aligning three receivers to one side \) with horizontal routes at the deepintermediate levels the seahawks went to this in the second half and exploded for three touchdowns on their first three possessions patriots 41 , texans 28 there s not a lot to analyze here the patriots simply had better players than the texans seasonending injuries to brian cushing , tim dobbins and darryl sharpton left the texans with barrett ruud and bradie james playing inside linebacker both were exploited in coverage situations by new england s running backs \( particularly shane vereen \) tom brady was a master at diagnosing and , with the occasional alignment shift , creating those mismatches before the snap on the other side , houston s offense was once again held down by the limitations of matt schaub and his receivers in addition to a costly inaccurate throw or two early on and a bad interception to rob ninkovich against a welldesigned zone exchange blitz , schaub on a few occasions failed to even pull the trigger when his pocket got muddied that s because he doesn t have the athleticism or arm strength to make throws under heavy duress unless this changes \( which is highly unlikely \) , schaub will always need a lot of space in order to throw and he ll need receivers who can get better separation against quality man coverage aside from andre johnson , none of houston s targets made life easy for schaub on sunday night follow andy benoit email andybenoit nfltouchdowncom
sanibel , fla at an office party in 2005 , one of my colleagues asked my then husband what i did on weekends she knew me as someone with great intensity and energy does she kayak , go rock climbing and then run a half marathon \? she joked no , he answered simply , she sleeps and that was true when i was n't catching up on work , i spent my weekends recharging my batteries for the coming week work always came first , before my family , friends and marriage which ended just a few years later in recent weeks i have been following with interest the escalating debate about worklife balance and the varying positions of facebook s sheryl sandberg , marissa mayer of yahoo and the academic , among others since i resigned my position as chief financial officer of lehman brothers in 2008 , amid mounting chaos and a cloud of public humiliation only months before the company went bankrupt , i have had ample time to reflect on the decisions i made in balancing \( or failing to balance \) my job with the rest of my life the fact that i call it the rest of my life gives you an indication where work stood in the pecking order i do n't have children , so it might seem that my story lacks relevance to the worklife balance debate like everyone , though , i did have relationships a spouse , friends and family and none of them got the best version of me they got what was left over i did n't start out with the goal of devoting all of myself to my job it crept in over time each year that went by , slight modifications became the new normal first i spent a halfhour on sunday organizing my email , todo list and calendar to make monday morning easier then i was working a few hours on sunday , then all day my boundaries slipped away until work was all that was left inevitably , when i left my job , it devastated me i could n't just rally and move on i did not know how to value who i was versus what i did what i did who i was i have spent several years now living a different version of my life , where i try to apply my energy to my new husband , anthony , and the people whom i love and care about but i ca n't make up for lost time most important , although i now have stepchildren , i missed having a child of my own i am 47 years old , and anthony and i have been trying in vitro fertilization for several years we are still hoping sometimes young women tell me they admire what i 've done as they see it , i worked hard for 20 years and can now spend the next 20 focused on other things but that is not balance i do not wish that for anyone even at the best times in my career , i was never deluded into thinking i had achieved any sort of rational allocation between my life at work and my life outside i have often wondered whether i would have been asked to be cfo if i had not worked the way that i did until recently , i thought my singular focus on my career was the most powerful ingredient in my success but i am beginning to realize that i sold myself short i was talented , intelligent and energetic it did n't have to be so extreme besides , there were diminishing returns to that kind of labor i did n't have to be on my blackberry from my first moment in the morning to my last moment at night i did n't have to eat the majority of my meals at my desk i did n't have to fly overnight to a meeting in europe on my birthday i now believe that i could have made it to a similar place with at least some better version of a personal life not without sacrifice i do n't think i could have had it all but with somewhat more harmony i have also wondered where i would be today if lehman brothers had n't collapsed in 2007 , i did start to have my doubts about the way i was living my life or not really living it but i felt locked in to my career i had just been asked to be cfo i had a responsibility without the crisis , i may never have been strong enough to step away perhaps i needed what felt at the time like some of the worst experiences in my life to come to a place where i could be grateful for the life i had i had to learn to begin to appreciate what was left at the end of the day , that is the best guidance i can give whatever valuable advice i have about managing a career , i am only now learning how to manage a life
philadelphia through surgical masks , while retracting a portion of bowel , was not how i had envisioned having an intimate discussion about my fertility yet there i was , two years into medical school , in the middle of an open cholecystectomy , discussing with my attending surgeon my efforts to conceive so , she said , a pregnant medical student that s not the worst idea soon after starting medical school , my periods had stopped further evaluation led to a diagnosis of hypothalamic amenorrhea , a form of infertility in which insufficient hormones for ovulation are produced i had always thought of having children , but years down the road , in my 30s , with an established career at that time i was 27 , going to school more than 300 miles away from my husband starting a family was not at the top of my mind but our physicians told us that our best chance of conceiving was immediately , when my age was our greatest asset so began our year of hormone injections , transvaginal ultrasounds and intrauterine insemination after one of my professors , who quite accidentally became one of my reproductive endocrinologists , examined me in stirrups for the first time , i blushed before saying , you must think i'm insane to be doing this now his response surprised me no , actually , i think you 're smart but as i sprinted from the exam room to an 8 am discussion on kidney disease , i could n't help but think that i might be out of my mind still , we were overthemoon happy when we conceived without having to move forward with in vitro fertilization , a considerably more invasive and expensive procedure and we continued to count our blessings when the pregnancy progressed normally i had n't intended to disclose my pregnancy that day in surgery but as i was scrubbing in , the nurse asked , we 're using fluoroscopy in this case , so there s no chance you 're pregnant , right \? fluoroscopy is an imaging technique that uses xrays , and the radiation exposure is thought to be harmful to developing fetuses momentarily befuddled , i mumbled , uh , yeah it was clearly not the answer he 'd anticipated well , how pregnant are you \? ! i told him 12 weeks sanitation measures were ceased , and the scrub nurse proceeded to shuttle me between operating rooms , each time stating , anna , here , is with child are you using xrays \? finally we settled on the cholecystectomy a gallbladder removal which was deemed to be a procedure appropriate for my delicate condition i proceeded through as many of the core clerkships internal medicine , family medicine , surgery , emergency , obstetrics , pediatrics , psychiatry , neurology as i could before my due date each one confirmed my decision when i arrived at morning rounds , hoping i did n't smell like my own vomit , i was thankful i was n't the intern or resident , responsible for more than twice my number of patients during pediatrics , while gaining some perspective on how much energy these adorable germbags consume , i considered that the sleep deprivation i experienced in med school had perhaps prepared me for something other than the sleep deprivation in residency and during obstetrics , when the effects of age on fertility were drilled into us , i was relieved i was n't putting off pregnancy until i had completed residency in my midtolate 30s every woman is different , but we know that fecundability \( the probability of achieving pregnancy in one menstrual cycle \) usually declines in the mid20s , drops more significantly in the early 30s and plummets a few years later , at about age 37 in the united states , around 6 percent of married women 44 and younger are infertile , and age is by far the most common underlying cause that s a problem , considering that more than a third of collegeeducated women today have their first child at 30 or older there s no solution for the fact that these childbearing years are also prime working years but whether they have children at 20 or 40 , most women today do n't have a choice about working i am fortunate enough to have a spouse who can temporarily support us , but we also have hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical student loans to pay off between the two of us as one doctor told me , i encourage my fellows to have children immediately if they want them it does n't get any easier later , we just get older far too often , women find out too late that they ca n't have the children they wanted unlike hypothalamic amenorrhea , where the lack of menstruation is a clue that something is awry , many causes of infertility are symptomless , and up to 30 percent are unexplained so in some ways i was lucky if i had n't had to face my infertility , if the decision had n't been imposed on me so early , getting pregnant might have been considerably more difficult , probably requiring more invasive , timeintensive and expensive procedures my pregnancy would be more likely to be fraught with complications my child would be more likely to have chromosomal abnormalities , most famously down syndrome , or congenital malformations or pregnancy would simply no longer be an option none of these possibilities would be made simpler by being further along in my career without the diagnosis , i would n't have chosen to have a child in my 20s , before even beginning my career but it was the right path for me and it might be the right path for more women , even those who do n't have any fertility problems since the birth of my daughter , there have been times when i 've felt close to smashing my head through a window , but the last several months have been some of the most fulfilling of my life holding her in my arms as a look of complete surprise flashes over her face when she feels a gust of wind for the first time , having her greet me with a smile , elatedly kicking her legs it s a privilege to experience such intense discovery and joy i hope that my husband and i will be able to have more children , in med school , residency , or anytime in our careers i find comfort in the fact that school is there , waiting for me , exactly where i left it for now , we 've stopped worrying about convenience
brad delong takes on john cochrane again i don t have the heart or the time to do a full takedown myself but i do want to make five points the first is the remarkable extent to which the antikeynesians remain addicted to arguments from authority , as opposed to arguments from evidence we now have more than five years of experience with fiscal and monetary policy under zerolowerbound conditions , and a large empirical literature studying that experience surely at this point you shouldn t be responding to claims about policy by asserting nobody has believed that since the 1970s what do smart people doing research on this massive natural experiment say now \? \( hint keynes is looking pretty good \) second , it s curious how the ground has shifted back in 2009 it was nobody believes that fiscal policy can be expansionary then people like cochrane learned that there was a large new keynesian literature , of which they had clearly been unaware so it shifted to nobody believes in the multiplier story in which spending raises incomes , which leads to further spending etc but even if it were true that nobody believed in that story , the new keynesian model in which government spending in a depressed economy puts idle resources to work would still be enough to make the case for stimulus and against austerity third , as brad says , the reason the classic keynesian multiplier isn t in nk models is not because it has been disproved , but because such models deliberately give hostages they show that keynesian outcomes can emerge even if you assume rational expectations and intertemporal blah blah many people who do such models consider this a useful strategy , but remain open to the possibility that given realworld imperfections the classic story also has explanatory power especially since empirical multipliers do seem to be more than 1 in fact well , let me quote from a paper that both offers an example of how this can work and refutes the claim that nothing like this is publishable in an economics journal finally , we turn to the role of monetary and fiscal policy , where we find , as already indicated , that more debt can be the solution to a debtinduced slump we also point out a possibly surprising implication of any story that attributes the slump to excess debt precisely because some agents are debtconstrained , ricardian equivalence breaks down , and oldfashioned keynesiantype multipliers in which current consumption depends on current income reemerge ahem finally , it is true that there has been a divergence between what gets published in the journals and what people in policyrelated positions believe keynesian models even new keynesian models remain hard to get past referees meanwhile , places like the federal reserve and the international monetary fund continue to do economic analysis with a strong keynesian flavor \( there was plenty of keynesian storytelling at last week s big imf event , and i did not exactly get laughed out of the room \) but look at who we re talking about here we re not talking about dumb politicians who still do sort of keynesian stuff we re talking about people like olivier blanchard and janet yellen smart economists with plenty of technical knowledge and credentials , who continue to find keynesian concepts useful even as such concepts are rarely published in academic journals and it s not just the people at the top there s a lot of keynesian stuff going on in the research departments of these institutions so consider two hypotheses one which cochrane appears to believe is that being inside the beltway has rotted janet s and olivier s brains , not to mention that of all their researchers , causing them to revert to primitive concepts that everyone knows are false the other which is what i hear from young economists is that there is an equilibrium business cycle claque in academic macroeconomics that has in effect blockaded the journals to anyone trying to publish models and evidence that stress the demand side obviously you know which story i believe the main point , though , is that trying to argue from authority is even sillier here than in most situations there s a huge difference between nobody believes that and none of my friends will let that get published in the journals they control

the election of hassan rowhani as s new president has created a sense that there are new possibilities of progress on the nuclear issue we need to respond , but warily iran s supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , allowed mr rowhani to win the election recognizing that he had run against current iranian policies that have isolated the country and invited economically disastrous sanctions but it is n't clear why mr khamenei allowed such an outcome , and here are some theories that have been proposed he believes that mr rowhani s election could provide a safety valve for the great discontent within iran he believes that mr rowhani , a president with a moderate face , might be able to seek an openended agreement on that would reduce tensions and ease sanctions now , while leaving iran room for development of at some point in the future he believes that mr rowhani might be able to start talks that would simply serve as a cover while iran continued its nuclear program he wants to rebalance the power relationship among iran s leading factions , reconciling their fissures while restoring the relative weight of the clerics vis vis the revolutionary guard mr rowhani is himself a cleric , but also a likely conciliator who might be a bridge between the harderline clerics and more pragmatic forces none of this means there will be a nuclear deal even if he were given the power to negotiate , mr rowhani would have to produce a deal the supreme leader would accept so it is far too early to consider backing off sanctions as a gesture to mr rowhani we should , instead , keep in mind that the outside world s pressure on iran to change course on its nuclear program may well have produced his election so it would be foolish to think that lifting the pressure now would improve the chances that he would be allowed to offer us what we need an agreement , or credible iranian steps toward one , under which iran would comply with its international obligations on the nuclear issue our bottom line here is that iran must be prepared to change its program so that it does not have a breakout capability to develop nuclear weapons the real question for ourselves is whether we should change our approach to diplomacy with iran , now that a new iranian president has advertised his desires to end iran s isolation and the sanctions imposed on it , and to repair the wound that he has said exists between the united states and the islamic republic until now , we have taken an incremental , confidencebuilding approach within multilateral negotiations with iran , but they have probably already run their course indeed , while our side \( the united states , china , russia , germany , britain and france \) negotiated with iran on and off for the last several years with no results , the iranians were dramatically expanding the numbers of centrifuges they had installed to enrich uranium they now have roughly 17 , 000 and have succeeded in upgrading to a new generation of far more efficient centrifuges those developments have shrunk the time we have available to ensure that the iranians cannot break out and present the world with the fait accompli of a nuclear weapons capability so we may have time for diplomacy , but not a lot we should move now to presenting an endgame proposal one that focuses on the outcome that we , the united states , can accept on the nuclear issue and we should do so even if our negotiating partners particularly the russians are n't prepared to accept such a move , since the clock is ticking we should give mr rowhani a chance to produce , but the calendar cannot be openended diplomacy often boils down to two simple elements taking away excuses for inaction and providing explanations for a deal that could be struck on the first point , the iranians say they do n't know what we will accept in the end the answer should be that we can accept iran s having civil nuclear power but with restrictions that would make the steps to producing nuclear weapons difficult , as well as quickly detectable our offer should be credible internationally if iran was not prepared to agree to it , the iranians would be exposed for not being ready to accept what they say they want indeed , if we make a credible proposal that would permit the iranians to have civil nuclear power with restrictions , it would allow them to save face for themselves they could say the proposal was what they had always sought and that their rights had been recognized this is not to say that such an endgame proposal can be made without risk the russians , in particular , may not want the situation clarified they may fear it will mean an end to the diplomacy because the iranians , in turning down such a proposal , will have signaled that their real aim is to obtain nuclear weapons and not just civil nuclear power that would leave the use of force as the only alternative the russians may prefer the stepbystep approach that keeps the diplomacy going even without results to be sure , if the iranians were prepared to suspend the further development of their nuclear infrastructure while diplomacy were under way , that would be an acceptable approach and time would not be of the essence but mr rowhani has already publicly dismissed the possibility of such a suspension , saying it was tried before , but in a different era so this time , it is the iranians who are forcing the window for diplomacy to close mr rowhani may well create an opening but we should be on our guard it must be an opening to clarify what is possible and to test outcomes , not to engage in unending talks for their own sake preserving a multilateral stepbystep approach that has outlived its usefulness , or allowing the russians at this point to determine how we proceed particularly at a time when the russians appear more competitive with the united states than cooperative is not a prescription that permits us to see if there is an opening and to act on it if we want diplomacy to succeed , the united states must find out now whether it can , and it must do so on its own initiative
boston david price knew this could be his last start with the he had seen the others ushered in and out the rays had drafted and developed him to be their ace , even as matt moore , alex cobb and chris archer joined the rotation , and as james shields and wade davis were traded last winter for younger , cheaper talent price may be next to leave set to be a free agent after the 2015 season , he will make an attractive trade chip this offseason speculation has swirled price acknowledged friday that the possibility of his departure had crossed his mind but he set those thoughts aside , he said , as he and his teammates made their exciting run to the postseason i want those thoughts to stay away , price said i want to enjoy my time here if saturday s start was his last as a ray , it went the way many games do here for opposing pitchers the knocked hits all around fenway park their fans taunted wil myers , the rays' prodigious right fielder david ortiz homered twice and boston ground out a 74 victory to take a two games to none lead in this american league division series the red sox will go for the sweep monday it was kind of a weird night , rays manager joe maddon said , the way everything set up for them and against us when price took the mound in the first inning , the boston faithful serenaded myers , his right fielder myers ! myers ! myers , whom the rays had acquired , in part , for shields and davis , had made a costly mistake friday , letting a pop fly by ortiz drop in for a groundrule double as price settled in , jacoby ellsbury looped a leadoff single that dropped just in front of myers ellsbury then stole second and took third as catcher jose molina threw the ball into center field two batters later , dustin pedroia drove in ellsbury with a sacrifice fly then ortiz hammered a cutter price had left over the plate for a solo home run to center price , the 2012 al cy young award winner , turned and watched the ball go , and then paced around the mound he regained his composure until david ross doubled off the green monster to lead off the third inning ellsbury then poked a fastball down the leftfield line for a double that drove in ross two batters later , ellsbury scored when pedroia hit into a forceout the next inning , the red sox added a run , giving starter john lackey a 51 cushion this has been a curious season for lackey , his first since having tommy john elbow surgery he had compiled a 352 earned run average , his lowest since 2007 , but it fluctuated based on where he pitched his era was 448 on the road and 247 at home in september , though , home or away , lackey seemed fatigued so he was given 10 days off , from his last start to saturday but the rest , lackey said , caused him to struggle with his command he worked around three singles and two walks and kept the rays at bay until the fifth , when he gave up a groundrule double to yunel escobar and hit david dejesus with a pitch james loney then drove them in with a long double to center , cutting the red sox' lead to 53 lackey then walked evan longoria and ran the count full against ben zobrist , who struck out looking at a fastball lackey pumped his fist as the crowd roared in the bottom half of the inning , ellsbury reached base for the third time off price , and pedroia drove him in all around , this game unfolded like so many before once lackey exited after pitching five and a third innings , the boston bullpen induced groundball double plays to end the seventh and the eighth myers , the target of chanting all night , went 0 for 5 with a strikeout ortiz crushed another home run , this one around the pesky pole in right , on a price fastball it was a first for ortiz , who had not hit two homers in a postseason game before his fastball was n't like it used to be , ortiz said , noting that price had just pitched a complete game on monday he added it was n't a bad fastball , but not 96 , 98 like he used to it was n't like you normally expect price stood off the mound , looking into center , expressionless , as maddon came to get him given the moment , based on the result , this was perhaps the worst start of his young career he dropped to 04 , with a 581 era , in his four career postseason starts price walked off slowly , head down , the crowd still delirious , and then disappeared into the rays' dugout , perhaps for the last time , unless the rays muster something and extend the series we 've been in this boat in the past and we 've forced game 5s in those situations also , maddon said afterward so boston this time of year is kind of lovely , and i'm looking forward to coming back in a few days
the following is a transcript of president obama s remarks about the health care overhaul and response to a question about electronic surveillance in san jose , calif , as provided by the white house mr obama good morning , everybody it is wonderful to see all of you , and i want to thank everybody who is here i think there s only one problem , and that is that my remarks are not sitting here people ! \( laughter \) by friday afternoon , things get a little challenged question will you answer a question in the mr obama i'm going to have a i'm going to answer a question at the end of the remarks , but i want to make sure that we get the remarks out people ! oh , goodness \( laughter \) oh , somebody is tripping folks are sweating back there right now \( laughter \) well , good morning everybody this afternoon , i'm going to be in southern california to meet with president xi of china but before i leave northern california , i wanted to take a minute to address something that s happening with the affordable care act in this state , and i wanted to meet with a group of people who are doing some very important work on behalf of california s middleclass families these leaders from california s government , the california endowment , and major spanish language media outlets have joined together to help implement the affordable care act here in california and to educate folks about how to sign up and shop for quality , affordable plans and their efforts have already shown some excellent results in the biggest insurance market in the country there are two main things that americans need to know when it comes to the affordable care act and what it means for you first of all , if you 're one of the nearly 85 percent of americans who already have insurance , either through medicare or medicaid or your employer , you do n't have to do a thing you 've just got a wide array of new benefits , better protections and stronger cost controls that you did n't have before , and that will , over time , improve the quality of the insurance that you 've got benefits like free preventive care checkups , flu shots , mammograms and contraception you are now going to be able to get those things through your insurance where they previously were not did n't have to be provided protections like allowing people up to the age of 26 to stay on their parent s health care plans , which has already helped 6 million americans , including 1 million young latino americans cost controls like requiring insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of the money that you pay in premiums in your actual health care costs , as opposed to administrative costs or ceo pay not overhead , but that money has to be spent on you and if they do n't meet that target , they actually have to reimburse you so in california , we 're already getting reports that insurers are giving rebates to consumers and small business owners to the tune of 45 million this year so already we 're seeing millions of dollars of rebates sent back to consumers by insurance companies as a consequence of this law all of that is happening because of the affordable care act all of this is in place right now , already , for 85 percent of americans who have health insurance by the way , all of this is what the republican party has now voted 37 times to repeal , at least in the house of representatives and my suggestion to them has been , let s stop refighting the old battles and start working with people like the leaders who are on stage here today to make this law work the way it s supposed to we 're focused on moving forward and making sure that this law works for middleclass families and that brings me to the second thing that people need to know about the affordable care act if you 're one of nearly 6 million californians or tens of millions of americans who do n't currently have health insurance , you 'll soon be able to buy quality , affordable care just like everybody else and here s how states like california are setting up new , online marketplaces where , beginning on october 1st of this year , you can comparison shop an array of private health insurance plans sidebyside , just like you were going online to compare cars or airline tickets and that means insurance companies will actually have to compete with each other for your business and that means new choices see , right now , most states do n't have a lot of competition in nearly every state , more than half of all consumers are covered by only two insurers so there s no incentive to provide you a lot of choices or to keep costs down the affordable care act changes that beginning next year , once these marketplaces are open , most states will offer new private insurance choices that do n't exist today and based on early reports , about 9 in 10 americans expected to enroll in these marketplaces live in states where they 'll be able to choose between five or more different insurers so for example , here in california , 33 insurers applied to join the marketplace covered california then selected 13 based on access , quality , and affordability , four of which are brand new to your individual market so what s happening is through the affordable care act , we 're creating these marketplaces with more competition , more choice , and so the question is , what happens to cost \? now , a lot of the opponents of the affordable care act , they had all kinds of skyisfalling , doomandgloom predictions that not only would the law fail , but what we 'd also is costs would skyrocket for everybody well , it turns out we 're actually seeing that in the states that have committed themselves to implementing this law correctly , we 're seeing some good news competition and choice are pushing down costs in the individual market just like the law was designed to do the 13 insurance companies that were chosen by covered california have unveiled premiums that were lower than anybody expected and those who ca n't afford to buy private insurance will get help reducing their outofpocket premiums even further with the largest health care tax cut for working families and small businesses in our history so about 26 million californians nearly half of whom are latinos will qualify for tax credits that will , in some cases , lower their premiums a significant amount now , none of this is a surprise this is the way that the law was designed to work but since everybody has been saying how it s not going to happen , i think it s important for us to recognize and acknowledge this is working the way it s supposed to we 've seen similar good news , by the way , not just here in california but in oregon and washington in states that are working hard to implement this law properly , we 're seeing it work for people for middleclass families , for consumers now , that s not to say that everything is going to go perfectly right away when you 're implementing a program this large , there will be some glitches there are going to be some hiccups but no matter what , every single consumer will be covered by the new benefits and protections under this law permanently so the bottom line is you can listen to a bunch of political talk out there negative ads and fear mongering geared towards the next election or alternatively you can actually look at what s happening in states like california right now and the fact of the matter is through these exchanges , not only are the 85 percent of people who already have health insurance getting better protections , and receiving rebates , and being able to keep their kids on their health insurance until they 're 26 , and getting free preventive care , but if you do n't have health insurance and you 're trying to get it through the individual market and it s too expensive or it s too restricted , you now have these marketplaces where they 're going to offer you a better deal because of choice and competition and if even at those lower rates and better insurance that you 're getting through these marketplaces you still ca n't afford it , you 're going to be getting tax cuts and tax credits through the affordable care act that will help you afford it and that s how we 're going to make sure that millions of people who do n't currently have health insurance or are getting a really bad deal on their health insurance are finally going to get it but and here s my final point to take advantage of these marketplaces , folks are going to need to sign up so you can find out how to sign up at healthcaregov , or here in california you can sign up at coveredcacom because quality care is not something that should be a privilege , it should be a right in the greatest country on earth , we 've got to make sure that every single person that needs health care can get it and we 've got to make sure that we do it in the most efficient way possible one last point i'm going to make on this , because there are a lot of people who currently get health insurance through their employers the 85 percent who are already out there and they may be saying , well , if this law is so great , why is it that my premium still went up \? well , part of what s happening across the country is in some cases , for example , employers may be shifting more costs through higher premiums or higher deductibles or higher copays , and so there may still be folks who are out there feeling increased costs not because of the affordable care act but because those costs are being passed on to workers or insurance companies , in some cases even with these laws in place , they 're still jacking up prices unnecessarily so this does n't solve the whole problem , but it moves us in the right direction it s also the reason why we have to keep on implementing changes in how our health care system works to continually drive better efficiency , higher quality , lower cost we 're starting to do that health care cost inflation has gone up at the lowest rate over the last three years that we 've seen in many , many years so we 're making progress in actually reducing overall health care costs while improving quality , but we 're going to have to continue to push on that front as well that s also part of what we 're doing in the affordable care act but the main message i want for californians and people all across the country starting on october 1st , if you 're in the individual market , you can get a better deal if you 're a small business that s providing health insurance to your employees , you can get a better deal through these exchanges you 've got to sign up healthcaregov , or here in california at coveredcacom all right \? so thank you very much question mr president \? mr obama i'm going to take one question and then , remember , people are going to have opportunities to also answer questions when i'm with the chinese president today so i do n't want the whole day to just be a bleeding press conference but i'm going to take jackie calmes' question question mr president , could you please react to the reports of secret government surveillance of phones and internet \? and can you also assure americans that the government your government does n't have some massive secret database of all their personal online information and activities \? mr obama yes when i came into this office , i made two commitments that are more important than any commitment i made number one , to keep the american people safe and number two , to uphold the constitution and that includes what i consider to be a constitutional right to privacy and an observance of civil liberties now , the programs that have been discussed over the last couple days in the press are secret in the sense that they 're classified but they 're not secret in the sense that when it comes to telephone calls , every member of congress has been briefed on this program with respect to all these programs , the relevant intelligence committees are fully briefed on these programs these are programs that have been authorized by broad bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006 and so , i think at the outset , it s important to understand that your duly elected representatives have been consistently informed on exactly what we 're doing now , let me take the two issues separately when it comes to telephone calls , nobody is listening to your telephone calls that s not what this program is about as was indicated , what the intelligence community is doing is looking at phone numbers and durations of calls they are not looking at people s names , and they 're not looking at content but by sifting through this socalled metadata , they may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism if these folks if the intelligence community then actually wants to listen to a phone call , they 've got to go back to a federal judge , just like they would in a criminal investigation so i want to be very clear some of the hype that we 've been hearing over the last day or so nobody is listening to the content of people s phone calls this program , by the way , is fully overseen not just by congress , but by the fisa court a court specially put together to evaluate classified programs to make sure that the executive branch , or government generally , is not abusing them , and that it s being carried out consistent with the constitution and rule of law and so , not only does that court authorize the initial gathering of data , but i want to repeat if anybody in government wanted to go further than just that topline data and want to , for example , listen to jackie calmes' phone call , they would have to go back to a federal judge and indicate why , in fact , they were doing further probing now , with respect to the internet and emails this does not apply to us citizens and it does not apply to people living in the united states and again , in this instance , not only is congress fully apprised of it , but what is also true is that the fisa court has to authorize it so in summary , what you 've got is two programs that were originally authorized by congress , have been repeatedly authorized by congress , bipartisan majorities have approved on them , congress is continually briefed on how these are conducted there are a whole range of safeguards involved , and federal judges are overseeing the entire program throughout we 're also setting up we 've also set up an audit process , when i came into office , to make sure that we 're , after the fact , making absolutely certain that all the safeguards are being properly observed now , having said all that , you 'll remember when i made that speech a couple of weeks ago about the need for us to shift out of a perpetual war mindset , i specifically said that one of the things that we 're going to have to discuss and debate is how are we striking this balance between the need to keep the american people safe and our concerns about privacy \? because there are some tradeoffs involved i welcome this debate and i think it s healthy for our democracy i think it s a sign of maturity , because probably five years ago , six years ago , we might not have been having this debate and i think it s interesting that there are some folks on the left but also some folks on the right who are now worried about it who were n't very worried about it when there was a republican president i think that s good that we 're having this discussion but i think it s important for everybody to understand and i think the american people understand that there are some tradeoffs involved i came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs my team evaluated them we scrubbed them thoroughly we actually expanded some of the oversight , increased some of safeguards but my assessment and my team s assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks and the modest encroachments on the privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and not looking at content , that on net , it was worth us doing some other folks may have a different assessment on that but i think it s important to recognize that you ca n't have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience we 're going to have to make some choices as a society and what i can say is that in evaluating these programs , they make a difference in our capacity to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity and the fact that they 're under very strict supervision by all three branches of government and that they do not involve listening to people s phone calls , do not involve reading the emails of us citizens or us residents absent further action by a federal court that is entirely consistent with what we would do , for example , in a criminal investigation i think on balance , we have established a process and a procedure that the american people should feel comfortable about but , again , these programs are subject to congressional oversight and congressional reauthorization and congressional debate and if there are members of congress who feel differently , then they should speak up and we 're happy to have that debate okay \? all right and we 'll have a chance to talk further over the course of the next couple of days question do you welcome the leaks , sir \? do you welcome the leaks \? do you welcome the debate \? mr obama i do n't welcome leaks , because there s a reason why these programs are classified i think that there is a suggestion that somehow any classified program is a secret program , which means it s somehow suspicious the fact of the matter is in our modern history , there are a whole range of programs that have been classified because when it comes to , for example , fighting terror , our goal is to stop folks from doing us harm and if every step that we 're taking to try to prevent a terrorist act is on the front page of the newspapers or on television , then presumably the people who are trying to do us harm are going to be able to get around our preventive measures that s why these things are classified but that s also why we set up congressional oversight these are the folks you all vote for as your representatives in congress , and they 're being fully briefed on these programs and if , in fact , there was there were abuses taking place , presumably those members of congress could raise those issues very aggressively they 're empowered to do so we also have federal judges that we put in place who are not subject to political pressure they 've got lifetime tenure as federal judges , and they 're empowered to look over our shoulder at the executive branch to make sure that these programs are n't being abused so we have a system in which some information is classified , and we have a system of checks and balances to make sure that it s not abused and if , in fact , this information ends up just being dumped out willynilly without regard to risks to the program , risks to the people involved in some cases , on other leaks , risks to personnel in a very dangerous situation then it s very hard for us to be as effective in protecting the american people that s not to suggest that you just say , trust me we 're doing the right thing we know who the bad guys are and the reason that s not how it works is because we 've got congressional oversight and judicial oversight and if people ca n't trust not only the executive branch but also do n't trust congress and do n't trust federal judges to make sure that we 're abiding by the constitution , due process and rule of law , then we 're going to have some problems here but my observation is , is that the people who are involved in america s national security , they take this work very seriously they cherish our constitution the last thing they 'd be doing is taking programs like this to listen to somebody s phone calls and by the way , with respect to my concerns about privacy issues , i will leave this office at some point , sometime in the last next three and a half years , and after that , i will be a private citizen and i suspect that , on a list of people who might be targeted so that somebody could read their emails or listen to their phone calls , i 'd probably be pretty high on that list it s not as if i do n't have a personal interest in making sure my privacy is protected but i know that the people who are involved in these programs , they operate like professionals and these things are very narrowly circumscribed they 're very focused and in the abstract , you can complain about big brother and how this is a potential program run amuck , but when you actually look at the details , then i think we 've struck the right balance thank you very much , guys
age is unkind to all athletes , but especially to starting pitchers a pitcher who can adjust as his arm deteriorates is one who will have a long , successful career which raises the question of how age will eventually treat 32yearold  for most of his career , sabathia was the mountainous ace with a lively fastball that overpowered hitters as he ages and the effects of various injuries sap him of his velocity , sabathia , who is recovering from offseason elbow surgery to remove bone spurs , will need to become a different pitcher after a rough first inning wednesday night at yankee stadium , sabathia was indeed a different pitcher he persevered , and eventually earned the victory when pinchhitter travis hafner decked a fastball from reliever david hernandez over the rightfield wall in the eighth inning to give the the yankees had trailed , 30 , after six innings after the game , sabathia did not look like a pitcher happy about his third win of the season instead , he appeared to be a pitcher at a crossroads in his career i'm hoping more velocity comes back , but if not , then we 'll work with this , he said sabathia s firstinning struggles demonstrated the precarious nature of his current repertory with a fastball that ranged from 87 to 90 miles per hour , sabathia was battered by diamondbacks hitters in that inning highlighted by a linedrive , tworun homer from first baseman paul goldschmidt and his ineffectiveness , even if only for a short stretch , signaled a troubling trend this season , sabathia has averaged , according to pitch fx data from fangraphs , only 90 mph on his fastball , a drop of more than 2 mph from last season , and the slowest average of his career only two years ago , sabathia averaged 94 mph furthermore , he has thrown his changeup more this season almost 25 percent of the time than he has the past two seasons \( 13 percent \) with his fastball the slowest of his career , sabathia is relying on his changeup more than ever but the speed difference between the two pitches only 5 mph , according to fangraphs is decreasing in almost every start goldschmidt s home run came on an 82mph changeup sabathia threw just four fastballs in his final three innings meanwhile , his first four pitches of the game were fastballs , none harder than 89 mph clearly , he no longer trusts his fastball the way he once did he credited his survival to smoke and mirrors it s the reality , sabathia said i 've never been through anything like this , so i do n't know i'm not going to lose sleep over it i 've been pitching for a long time eventually , this was going to happen sabathia said he did not believe that the arm surgery had affected his velocity more likely , he said , his 13 years in the majors are the culprit his 2 , 5921 3 career innings rank sixth among active pitchers , yet no else one in the top 20 is 32 or younger like sabathia , who is still owed a guaranteed 99 million over the next four years , including a 5 million buyout in 2017 sabathia has a vesting option in 2017 that would be worth 25 million but sabathia pitched well wednesday over all he allowed three runs and six hits in eight innings , marks that would not be uncommon when he hit the catcher s mitt harder in his late 20s he allowed just two hits after the first inning the bottom line is that he has to hit his spots , whether it s 90 , 88 , 95 , yankees manager joe girardi said girardi believes that sabathia will regain his velocity this season , perhaps even throw as hard as 94 mph again but sabathia is unsure for the first time in his career , he appears to believe that age has caught up with him if the radar gun refuses to push out better numbers , so be it sabathia may simply be entering the second act of his career there s nothing i can do about it , he said i ca n't throw any harder
damascus , syria in a terrace cafe within earshot of army artillery , a 28yearold graduate student wept as she confessed that she had stopped planning antigovernment protests and delivering medical supplies to rebelheld towns khaled , 33 , a former protester who fled damascus after being tortured and fired from his bank post , quit his job in turkey with the exile opposition , disillusioned and saying that he wished the uprising had never happened in the syrian city of homs , a rebel fighter , abu firas , 30 , recently put down the gun his wife had sold her jewelry to buy , disgusted with his commanders , who , he said , focus on enriching themselves now he finds himself trapped under government shelling , broke and hopeless the ones who fight now are from the side of the regime or the side of the thieves , he said in a recent interview via skype i was stupid and na ve , he added we were all stupid even as president bashar alassad of syria racks up modest battlefield victories , this may well be his greatest success to date wearing down the resolve of some who were committed to his downfall people have turned their backs on the opposition for many different reasons after two and a half years of fighting , some disillusioned with the growing power of islamists among rebels , some complaining of corruption , others just exhausted with a conflict that shows no signs of abating but the net effect is the same , as some of the syrians who risked their lives for the fight are effectively giving up , finding themselves in a kind of checkmate born of mr assad s shrewdness and their own failures though none interviewed say they are willing to return to his fold their numbers are impossible to measure , and there remain many who vow to keep struggling yet a range of mr assad s opponents , armed and unarmed , inside and outside syria , tell of a common experience when protests began , they thought they were witnessing the chance for a new life they took risks they had never dreamed of taking they lost jobs , houses , friends and relatives , suffered torture and hunger , saw their neighborhoods destroyed it was all they could do , yet it was not enough what finally forced them to the sidelines , they say , were the disarray and division on their side , the government s deft exploitation of their mistakes , and a growing sense that there is no happy ending in sight some said they came to believe that the war could be won only by those as violent and oppressive as mr assad , or worse such conclusions have been expressed by more and more people in recent months , in interviews in damascus , the syrian capital lebanon and turkey and via skype across rebelheld areas in syria many more fighters say they continue mainly because quitting would leave them feeling guilty toward other fighters it s undeniable that a lot of your early activists are disillusioned , said emile hokayem , a syria analyst at the international institute for strategic studies , adding that in revolutions , it is often your most constructive , positive people who are engaged early on who find themselves sidelined because such groups tend to be more vocal , he said , their changed views may be magnified beyond their numbers most are urbanites who had little understanding of the conservative poor whose mobilization is the backbone of the insurgency , he said but their backing off has real impact , he said , especially on local governance , where they tended to be active disillusioned activists say that early on , euphoric at being able to protest at all , they neglected to build bridges to fencesitters , or did not know how homegrown fighters desperate for help welcomed foreign jihadists , and many grew more religious or sectarian in tone , alarming mr assad s supporters , dividing his opponents and frightening the west out of substantially supporting them with a ruthless foresight , following the playbook of his father and predecessor , hafez alassad , mr assad s forces cracked down early and hard on the civilian , educated opposition , erasing the space where a middle ground could have emerged they used heavy weaponry on rebel supporters to an extent that shocked even their foes , while pursuing a deliberate and increasingly successful strategy of persuading syrians and the world that their opponents were a greater danger with the help of staunch allies , mr assad s government hung on through a war that has destroyed much of syria and its economy , leaving millions hungry and homeless , and even critics wistful for better days they changed the battle , said the 28yearold former activist in the damascus cafe now people are trying to survive more than they are fighting for their rights she and her friends , she said , sometimes think they are geniuses , this regime she continued they worked from day 1 to make it like this , and they succeeded we were just fooled going in the same direction they drew for us those still active say that as others drop out , their work becomes harder one activist who still tries to deliver humanitarian supplies from damascus to blockaded rebelheld areas expressed frustration that pharmacists and others who once helped her obtain baby formula now refuse , out of fear and despair another says that as young , motivated people flee the country , there are few to help with political organizing mr assad has moved to capitalize on opponents' despair , offering amnesties to rebels who lay down arms , even calling for army defectors to return to the government forces but abu firas , the former fighter in homs , laughed out loud at the idea of surrender ok , i will be on addounia tv as a hero for the proregime people , he said sarcastically , referring to state television , while my people spit on the tv , calling me traitor and coward and the day after , he added , i will find myself in saidnaya prison a government facility spending 31 years in the rule of a military court or court of terrorism the 28yearold damascus activist said that if the government prevails , she will leave the country or face arrest she believes the authorities know about her activities but have not arrested her because i'm not doing anything that hurts them now but later , they will remember , she said they will take everybody each of the disaffected has a story of personal betrayal or disappointment for the activist , it came when she realized there was a difference in values between her and some of the fellow protesters she had trusted , especially some who took up arms they think that they are in the right and they have the authority to do anything they want , she said they are fighting for islam or their beliefs , maybe not any more to bring down assad abu firas , in homs , said that at first he felt proud to carry his gun , even forgoing food or cigarettes during a government blockade but things went ugly , he said , when some commanders made profitable deals with government soldiers , endangering fellow rebels selfishness and greed just came to the surface , he said , adding that he tried to smooth out the problems , but it did n't work because you ca n't think right when you are hungry i think these corrupted commanders do not want this war to end , he said did i say war , not revolution \? yes , unfortunately i did ammar , 21 , stayed in his hometown , qusayr , recording videos for the rebels through a blistering defeat , living on little food , fantasizing about chocolate he had given up a comfortable life he studied english literature and his family owned apricot orchards when they fled to another rebelheld area , despite their sacrifices , they were kicked out of mosques and forced to sleep on streets i reached a stage where i hated the revolution , he said , visiting beirut , where he obtained a visa to emigrate to sweden i do n't want to be an activist any more i want to be a football player i want to eat a lot of chocolate

cairo a top adviser to president mohamed morsi issued an open letter wednesday afternoon lamenting what he called the imminent takeover of egypt s first freely elected government as i write these lines i am fully aware that these may be the last lines i get to post on this page , the adviser , essam elhaddad , wrote on for the sake of egypt and for historical accuracy , let s call what is happening by its real name military coup mr haddad and his family went to the streets two years ago to help oust former president hosni mubarak , he wrote we stood , and we still stand , for a very simple idea given freedom , we egyptians can build institutions that allow us to promote and choose among all the different visions for the country we quickly discovered that almost none of the other actors were willing to extend that idea to include us , he wrote , charging that the opposition and bureaucracy had refused to collaborate with elected leaders from the muslim brotherhood today only one thing matters , he wrote in this day and age no military coup can succeed in the face of sizable popular force without considerable bloodshed who among you is ready to shoulder that blame \? and he warned with new force that the president s islamist supporters would not go quietly hundreds of thousands of them have gathered in support of democracy and the presidency , he wrote and they will not leave in the face of this attack to move them , there will have to be violence it will either come from the army , the police , or the hired mercenaries either way there will be considerable bloodshed the consequences , he argued , would be felt far beyond egypt the message will resonate throughout the muslim world loud and clear democracy is not for muslims writing in english , he appeared to appeal specifically to americans the audience that reads this page understands the price that the world continues to pay for the wars in afghanistan and iraq , he wrote egypt is neither afghanistan nor iraq its symbolic weight and resulting impact is far more significant there are people in egypt and around the world that continue to try to justify the calls for early presidential elections because of the large numbers of demonstrators and the validity of their grievances , he acknowledged let me be very clear the protesters represent a wide spectrum of egyptians and many of them have genuine , valid grievances president morsi s approval rating is down but he insisted that the president had continued to reach out to the opposition , who refused to come to the table increasingly , the socalled liberals of egypt escalated a rhetoric inviting the military to become the custodians of government in egypt the opposition has steadfastly declined every option that entails a return to the ballot box as recently as tuesday the president , prime minister and top military officer had agreed on what mr haddad called an excellent path for egypt out of its current impasse , he wrote , including a full change of cabinet , a prime minister acceptable to all , changing the public prosecutor , agreement on constitutional amendments , and a reconciliation commission mr haddad also lashed out as western governments that he said had castigated egypt for lagging in its progress toward a modern democracy the silence of all of those voices with an impending military coup is hypocritical and that hypocrisy will not be lost on a large swathe of egyptians , arabs and muslims , he wrote many have seen fit in these last months to lecture us on how democracy is more than just the ballot box that may indeed be true but what is definitely true is that there is no democracy without the ballot box
new rules to , adopted last week by the commodity futures trading commission , are a victory for wall street and a setback for financial reform they may also signal worse things to come the regulations , required under the doddfrank reform law , are intended to impose transparency and competition on the notoriously opaque multitrilliondollar market for derivatives , which is dominated by five banks jpmorgan chase , goldman sachs , bank of america , citigroup and morgan stanley in the runup to the financial crisis and since the lack of transparency and competition has fostered recklessness and instability but banks like opacity , because their outsized profits depend on keeping clients in the dark about what other clients pay in similar deals under the doddfrank law , derivatives are supposed to be traded on swap execution facilities , which are to operate much like the exchanges that exist for equities and futures even as the new rules shift much of the trading to those facilities , they will also preserve the ability of the banks to maintain their old practices for instance , the commission s initial proposal called for hedge funds , asset managers and corporations to contact at least five banks when seeking prices for a derivatives contract in a major concession to the banks , that number was lowered to two in the final rule sometime in 2014 , it is supposed to rise to three , but that would still be inadequate worse , there s always the risk that delayed rules will never go into effect the initial proposal also called for derivatives trading to take place on open electronic platforms the final rules will allow much of the negotiation over derivative prices to take place over the phone , a practice that is difficult to monitor and prone to abuse by themselves , these new rules are not fatal to the overall reform effort and they are the best that the commission s reformminded chairman , gary gensler , could achieve at this time because of resistance to tougher standards by the agency s two republican commissioners and by one of its democratic commissioners , mark wetjen the problem now is that mr gensler s term has officially ended , and he is expected to at the end of the year given wall street s incessant lobbying and powerful presence in washington , it is assumed that he will be replaced by a chairman who is friendlier to wall street that bodes ill for rules that have started out weak and need to be shored up later to lose a reformer would also reflect poorly on president obama , but he has not yet shown interest in keeping mr gensler in the government in addition , none of the derivatives rules that have been finalized so far will make any real difference if they are not applied internationally yet mr gensler has met fierce resistance from banks , some cftc commissioners and regulators at the securities and exchange commission to his plan to extend domestic rules to foreign affiliates of american banks and to foreign banks operating in the united states anything less broad would make a sham of derivatives reform
glasgow , scotland in just under a year , scotland will hold a referendum on whether to become an independent country the issue is already so divisive that the comedian susan calman had to call for an end to the namecalling , swearing and death threats she received after making jokes about it on a radio show it s so controversial that it would be bad manners to bring it up with anyone who does n't agree with you already without unpacking any of the issues of nationhood , belonging or identity , we 're stuck in a rut and things are getting nasty each side blames the other fervor has enormous social currency the capacity to listen to people we disagree with is framed as indecision i recently appeared on a radio program to discuss the referendum i was billed as undecided , and there were three men on the panel , one pro , one con , and one an academic political analyst two of them had a brutal falling out before the discussion even began in fact , it was over the group email chain giving us directions to the studio it made me nostalgic for the '80s it had been so long since i had seen anyone called a communist stalinist anyway , during the course of the show i outed myself as not undecided , but sick to death of the debate s simplistic binary framing none of you are listening , i said voters are tuning out referendums have to be framed as yes or no because nuance makes terrible law , but the discussion needs to be expansive because independence is such a complex proposition it went down quite well the rivals finally made eye contact i felt , quite deeply , that in shifting the agenda from an adversarial one , i had won outside on the pavement we stood together and the rivals apologized for their manners i felt like gandhi , except with his foot on the chest of a toppled british empire , his little walnutty face laughing triumphantly at its sobbing widows take that , binary discourse then the yes man took me aside and asked , how would i like him to seem to be listening \? if he seemed to be listening , would that sway my vote \? he confided that he 'd made contact with people through the yes campaign that he simply could n't have met otherwise his contact book was bulging firstname terms good for business that was creepy i had a tip for him during the program he had suggested that independence would be more popular if every person in scotland knew they would be 500 about 800 better off every year if we became independent as a writer , i 'd made a mental note to counsel him that 500 was a bad number , too round , 47843 was more believable but in the end i did n't say anything the truth is , we do n't really know what scottish people want , let alone what independence will mean for us we know that scotland votes in a different pattern from the rest of britain the current coalition government is dominated by the conservatives , who have a single scottish mp \( and margaret thatcher never won a national election here \) but we do n't know whether this is a result of genuine political difference or of protest votes , cast in the assumption that they wo n't do anything dangerous if scotland leaves britain , will we be allowed to remain within the european union \? accepting an independent scotland might set a precedent for catalan separatists in spain and the walloons in belgium it could lead to the atrophy of an already tremulous european project rumors abound that the castles of the highlands are being bought by spanish , greek and russian millionaires in anticipation of the enormous tax cuts independence could bring the scottish first minister , alex salmond head of the scottish national party , whose raison d' tre centers on independence has been cozying up to rupert murdoch and donald j trump there s been much talk of an irelandstyle businessfriendly environment before that mr salmond s model was iceland imagine all the small nations of the world saying a collective prayer that alex salmond does n't mention them in a speech and jinx their economy some people , very laudably , hope that as a smaller country we will be able to take a lead in ecotech , developing sustainable energy sources and electric cars but sadly , we 're not really discussing any of these things we 're discussing yes or no the rest of britain is baffled , but senses the anger nigel farage , a british member of the european parliament who roughly equates with america s own dear rand paul , except really smug and annoying , was chased out of edinburgh earlier this year by an angry mob he put it down to antienglish feeling , despite the protesters' making their objections very clear in their chants of racist and homophobe he tried to escape in two different taxis , both of whose drivers asked him to get out so , let s hurry up and blame the media adversarial debate is full of drama and arrives at a conclusion in time for the adverts tweets are short and good for the rhythmic call and response of angry debate make no mistake , the only clear side of this debate is that intelligent public discourse matters , and that we 're not getting any of it at an event on cultural identity at the edinburgh college of art , i recently witnessed a room of arthipsters cower as an elderly man in a kilt walked in everyone mistakenly thought he was an angry nationalist who had come to disrupt the event actually , he was an eccentric englishman he made a great contribution by talking us through his outfit and sitting with his legs open that s more than you can say for most of our elected officials and cultural commentators
miami george zimmerman , who is charged with seconddegree murder in the killing of , is all but certain to take his case directly to a jury on june 10 and skip a highly anticipated pretrial selfdefense hearing , his lawyer said tuesday at a stand your ground hearing , the judge is tasked with weighing whether to grant immunity from prosecution under a florida law that gives people who believe they are in imminent danger of being killed or seriously hurt the benefit of the doubt to protect themselves a defendant who claims selfdefense in florida has a right to a pretrial hearing on the evidence if immunity is requested mr zimmerman , 29 , a neighborhood watch volunteer in sanford , fla , said he had shot mr martin , an unarmed 17yearold , in selfdefense after mr martin attacked him on feb 26 , 2012 prosecutors said mr zimmerman had pursued mr martin inside the gated community where mr martin was staying with his father s girlfriend and forced a confrontation , which led to the shooting mark o'mara , mr zimmerman s lawyer , did not close the door on an immunity hearing but made it clear that there would be little time to prepare for both a hearing and a trial in june mr o'mara told judge debra s nelson in circuit court in sanford on tuesday that he would not need the time she had reserved in april , when the hearing was expected to take place this will give us time to get ready for one hearing , and that s a jury trial where my client gets acquitted , mr o'mara said at a news conference after his courtroom appearance the trial is our focus in light of the national attention on mr zimmerman and the coming trial , mr o'mara said , a verdict delivered by a jury would be more meaningful than a decision made by a judge in a pretrial hearing george wants to have a jury of his peers decide the case , mr o'mara added the hearing on tuesday also chipped away at the credibility of a main witness in the case , called witness 8 , giving a boost to the defense witness 8 is a teenage girl who was on the phone with mr martin shortly before mr zimmerman shot him the witness has said mr martin told her that he was being followed by a man and was frightened afterward , witness 8 said she had been unable to attend mr martin s funeral because she had been ill and had gone to the hospital the defense asked to subpoena her medical records on tuesday , just before the hearing , prosecutors told defense lawyers that there were none in fact , she lied , don west , one of mr zimmerman s lawyers , said in court , asserting that she had not gone to the hospital the testimony of witness 8 is important because she described mr zimmerman as the aggressor and said mr martin had been trying to get away from him before he was killed i think witness 8 is a very significant , if not the most significant , witness , mr o'mara said
brussels it was a show of force in keeping with the ambitions of american law firms that increasingly see the s vast apparatus as a vital lobbying opportunity for themselves and their multinational corporate clients gathered at the brussels office of , a prominent washingtonbased firm , were some of its lawyers and lobbyists , along with executives from some of the world s largest companies , including chevron and statoil their aim was to help shape the european union s policies on the gas and oil drilling technology known as hydraulic fracturing , or fracking they were meeting with kurt vandenberghe , then a top environmental official for europe and a prime player in over fracking , which is even more contentious in europe than in the united states the host that day in june was , a former belgian diplomat whose career stretched from central africa to the inner sanctum of the european union and who is now an adviser at covington he and others on the recently expanded lobbying team there have delivered at least four senior european union policy makers to the firm s doorstep in recent months , including a top energy official , who arrived in september with a copy of a draft fracking plan that has yet to be made public it s key to us to be ahead of when the political debate starts , mr de ruyt said in an interview later because by then , we ca n't have an impact as the european union has emerged as a regulatory superpower affecting 28 countries that collectively form the , its policies have become ever more important to corporations operating across borders in turn , the influence business in brussels has become ever larger and more competitive , rivaled only by washington s no group is proving more aggressive in claiming a share of that business and provoking more criticism than covington and a dozen other major international law firms , some of which have imported american practices to brussels , the seat of european union power , while also operating with fewer constraints than in the united states the rules here differ in significant ways for starters , the european system is not greased by corporate campaign contributions , which are banned or strictly limited in many member countries but the law firms have managed to win results for clients , which include chemical and energy companies , drug makers , silicon valley firms , wall street businesses and military contractors the firms are taking advantage of weak ethics rules in brussels , including one that allows some former government officials to begin exploiting their connections the day they leave office a tradition in washington , hiring insiders was relatively rare at law firms in brussels until the american firms stepped up the recruiting of european politicians including top officials at the european commission , parliament and council , the three bodies that make up the government with fat paychecks the firms are undercutting efforts to bring more transparency to lobbying in brussels , citing lawyerclient confidentiality to evade a governmentbacked but voluntary disclosure effort covington , for example , refuses to identify its clients or whom it is lobbying , which it would have to do back home it can keep secret the sessions with clients and regulators at its offices , which most american officials would have been prohibited from attending or at least required to disclose in the united states critics , including rival lobbying firms and some european officials , accuse the law firms of operating in the shadows they hide behind confidentiality , said , an american who is a top executive at the brussels office of , a global lobbying and public relations firm it s unfair it s anticompetitive , he added there are people who want to do things secretly , and what they do is go to the law firms , a vice president of the european parliament from belgium who served on that three years ago helped create the voluntary disclosure program , also expressed concern i am not against lobbying , but i am against lobbying opacity , she said we have to know who works for whom and how much money they are being paid hidden in the leafy confines of parc l opold , which once was home to a zoo and an amusement park in the center of what is modernday brussels , is the , built a century ago by a belgian industrialist on a brisk night in september , with american lawyers as hosts , the library s reading room was packed with dozens of executives from corporations including boeing , intel and samsung , along with senior staff members of the european commission the guest of honor was james a baker iii , the former secretary of state and treasury and chief of staff to two presidents he was looking so fit , at 83 , that a lawyer asked him for nutrition tips mr baker had come to celebrate the first anniversary of the brussels office of , the houstonbased law firm cofounded by his greatgrandfather as attendees nibbled on foie gras lollipops , dipped in a chocolate fondant , they discussed the potential business bonanza from transatlantic trade negotiations that recently began between europe and the united states the goal of the negotiations is to harmonize the regulatory systems of the united states and europe , so that companies can meet a single standard worth hundreds of millions of dollars , if not billions , in savings for businesses , particularly if they can persuade negotiators to accept less strict rules in the process the deal making could also mean a huge wave of lucrative lobbying and legal work in brussels and in washington for firms , which charge up to 1 , 000 an hour it ai n't going to be easy it s going to be tough , mr baker told the assembled crowd but it s really important to get it done those kinds of opportunities help explain why american firms are attracted to brussels , where many locate near the rue belliard , a european version of k street , the lobbying corridor in washington several british firms have beefed up lobbying practices , too but there is tough competition akin gump , the prominent american law firm , closed its brussels office several years ago , with the top executive at the time calling the outpost a drain on resources others , though , are committed as brussels moves up the scale of importance to these companies , it becomes of increasing importance to any law firm like ours , said , a partner at hogan lovells , a firm that splits its headquarters between london and washington , who oversees its lobbying practice globally when lawyers at hogan lovells are stymied by the brussels bureaucracy , they routinely turn to , a softspoken , impeccably dressed man who was named a baron by the belgian king and worked as the european union ambassador to the united states i'm not looking for visibility , mr paemen said the important work happens on the telephone , or a lunch or coffee gettogether at covington , , once vice president of the european parliament s largest political group , the european people s party , serves as the goto person for assignments that require legislative action mr de ruyt focuses on the european council , where he once was a top official it s easier for someone who has been there , who understands how things go , he said covington also recently hired , a former staff member at the european parliament and a longtime brussels lobbyist i'm a gun for hire , he quipped more conservative firms in brussels are troubled by the notion of bringing in advisers like him and the former politicians , who are not lawyers , mr adamson added but covington has never been embarrassed about it the results are tangible , the firms say , providing documents to back up some of their claims last year , hogan lovells helped an american semiconductor company in european environmental law that allowed it to continue using a potentially hazardous substance in the computer chips it makes the firm also helped a group of american chemical companies avoid having to retest products to meet a new chemical safety law , striking an alliance with animal rights groups that did not want animals used for the retesting covington helped get an amendment to data privacy legislation that would ease restrictions on how companies are allowed to use certain personal data collected from consumers the proposal is pending the firm also recently successfully lobbied to weaken a proposed regulation intended to curb the ability of european pension funds to invest some of their money with firms covington declined to disclose the names of its clients , other than microsoft in marketing materials , though , the firm notes that its brussels clients have included the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america , and , a trade group whose members include oracle , apple and adobe systems hogan lovells also declined to identify most of its clients , but it did say it represented philips , the health care and consumer electronics company craig burchell , the global head of trade and market access for philips , said hogan lovells s mix of legal and policy advocacy is exactly what his company demands sure , we need lawyers who can handle antitrust work and trade matters , he said but what we really need is upstream influence on policy here , a member of the european parliament from luxembourg , refuses to meet lobbyists who have not registered in a voluntary disclosure database created in 2011 that includes names of nearly 6 , 000 businesses , organizations or lobbying firms that seek to influence the european government hundreds more are believed to have opted out , with some lobbying firms inspired by the example of the american law firms a ponytailed member of the green party , mr turmes took part in failed efforts to make the registry mandatory lobbying is a bit like prostitution it will always exist , and if you try to forbid it , then you would get a black market , he said i'm interested in all actors' views , but we have to do this in a transparent way some of the opponents of the mandatory registry included members of parliament who work at law firms , including , a christian democrat from germany who is a partner at the britishbased law firm and advises clients on european regulations , while serving as chairman for parliament s committee on legal affairs in brussels , the law firms argue that belgian bar rules prohibit them from violating the confidentiality of their clients in a public filing to the european commission last year , the council of bars and law societies of europe to expanding disclosure requirements for lawyerlobbyists , and called professional secrecy one of the core values of the legal profession many clients view secrecy as an asset even if the matter is public , the client does n't want our involvement to be known , said , a partner at hogan lovells a law firm provides very strong guarantees of confidentiality olivier hoedeman , the research coordinator at , a brussels nonprofit that studies the influence of lobbying on the european union , said he did not even know about some of the legislative favors the law firms had delivered to their clients there is no realistic way to track what they are doing if you do n't even know who their clients are , he said the kind of results they are achieving , outside of public scrutiny , it is undemocratic but for the companies involved it can be highly profitable maros sefcovic , vice president of the european commission and the official who oversees the government s efforts to increase transparency , said he was considering writing a letter to the law firms that are ignoring the register , pushing them to comply he estimated that the 6 , 000 companies , lobbying firms and nonprofit groups that have joined the register with about 30 , 000 lobbyists represent 75 percent of the universe of people trying to influence the european government and the area with the least compliance , he said , is the law firms the law firms are registered in the united states , but when they come to europe suddenly they pretend they do n't know what a lobbying register is , and what their obligations are , mr sefcovic said another european commission official wondered whether the law firm lobbyists get special treatment , given their deep network of personal contacts public authorities , by law , are obliged to offer equal treatment to every citizen , the official said , speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter but of course it makes a difference when you get a call , and it is a former colleague and they want a bit of your time still , scandals in recent years none involving american firms have spurred a movement toward change that many see as inevitable last fall , the european union s top health official departed amid a corruption investigation , and a sting in 2011 by of britain ensnared three members of the european parliament in a paytoplay episode at hogan lovells s brussels outpost , 28 lawyers and lobbyists from around europe met recently to discuss their work and opportunities to pick up new clients there was a sense , though , that the firm s ability to operate largely in secret may not last much longer we are a long ways from the us position , where it is very transparent , , a hogan lovells partner from london , told the gathering the culture of the clients , right now , is not toward openness but i have no doubt looking ahead , there will be obligatory registration with that , mr paemen , the former european union ambassador , headed out he was appearing at an event alongside a leading member of parliament and a top european trade official a similar session took place at covington s brussels offices , where four lobbyists discussed plans with a partner to try to influence debates on trade negotiations , data privacy and pharmaceuticals they mentioned fracking , too the firm is organizing an industry group to offer government officials suggestions in drafting the rules there have already been by the parliament suggesting it will demand strict oversight of the industry , an effort the lobbyists will try to derail mr van velzen told colleagues about planned meetings with members of the european parliament and the european commission , while mr de ruyt shared with the team the close ties he has with the new united states ambassador to the european union a relationship sure to come in handy as new client matters emerge there is a certain excitement of getting what you want through the system , mr de ruyt said in an interview , adding that he had learned the art of influencing decisions , instead of just making them i now know exactly how to do it
kabul , afghanistan president hamid karzai s widely criticized appointment of five new human rights commissioners has become a sore point with the countries that support afghanistan financially major donor nations and the united nations will call on wednesday for mr karzai to reconsider the appointments , according to two western diplomats the call will come along with an announcement by the donor countries on wednesday that afghanistan has so far met only 3 of the 17 benchmarks required for it to qualify for billions of dollars in reconstruction aid after 2014 one of those requirements was for an impartial afghanistan independent human rights commission afghan officials and the donors agreed a year ago to tie future aid to progress in improving government and fighting corruption , under the tokyo mutual accountability framework that established the performance benchmarks about 4 billion is at stake the announcement on wednesday will say that although 14 of the 17 benchmarks have not been achieved , they are works in progress in various degrees by the afghan government , in the words of one european diplomat , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential talks on the human rights commission , though , donors appear less disposed to give the karzai government the benefit of the doubt , after human rights and women s activists reacted angrily to mr karzai s choices for new commissioners , who are supposed to be apolitical and independent and have a background in human rights one of the appointees , qadria yazdanparast , that she intended to run for president next year another , maulavi abdul rahman hotak , is a former taliban official who said he believed his background as an islamic scholar qualified him in human rights ms yazdanparast , who resigned only recently from her leadership position in the central bureau of the fundamentalist jamiatiislami party , took issue with criticism of her human rights record and described herself as a longtime women s rights activist she said that she had been the author of the elimination of violence against women act , a landmark law in afghanistan , when it first came before parliament in 2009 women s activists involved at the time said that was not true shinkai karokhail , a member of parliament who was one of the leaders of the effort to pass that law , said ms yazdanparast s contribution was to delay passage by six months she was an obstacle , actually , ms karokhail said because she is a politically appointed woman does n't mean she was a women s activist she never supported women s issues still , the commission s chairwoman , confirmed that ms yazdanparast would be the commissioner overseeing women s rights cases the top united nations human rights official , navi pillay , last week publicly called on the government to reopen the selection process in line with the requirements of international human rights standards a spokesman for mr karzai called the appointments an internal matter that was none of ms pillay s affair the commission is financed almost entirely by international donors , chiefly canada and european countries , but not the united states its budget for the coming year will increase to nearly 12 million as it takes on additional monitoring in connection with election participation , especially by women the donors are furious about the human rights commission , particularly canada , said another western diplomat a spokeswoman for the canadian embassy declined to comment the countries that support the commission are also expected to contribute to the 4 billion in reconstruction aid that was agreed to in tokyo , contingent on achievement of the benchmarks of those requirements , the three that have been considered to be met are technical in nature budgetary and fiscal controls and a plan for afghanistan to join the world trade organization much thornier issues remain , including human rights and the appointment of independent election officials for the presidential election in april 2014 the time for complacency is gone , one diplomat said , adding that many western countries will lose patience if the goals are not met another sticking point is a benchmark calling for meaningful prosecution of the wellconnected figures who were responsible for the nearly 1 billion looting of the kabul bank although , western officials say that penalties for the worst offenders were too lenient and that too little of the money has been recovered
seoul , south korea with the arrival of nicolas anelka and didier drogba at shanghai shenhua last season , the international news media hailed the chinese super league as one to watch and talked of a shift in the global goalposts it is not surprising then that the departure of the two players has led to the lifting of that particular label it is a mistake shanghai s attempt to become a major soccer city may have stalled but that does not mean the party is over for the chinese super league the season is just beginning , although the year of the snake may not be quite as much fun as the 2012 year of the dragon despite the madness in china s biggest city with a power struggle behind the scenes resulting in anelka \( who somehow , despite a season that can politely be described as underwhelming , ended up at juventus \) and drogba \( professional , passionate and dedicated in his even shorter time \) heading back west amid reports of unpaid salaries , the progress of others is steadier one can only wonder what would have happened if drogba had joined guangzhou evergrande marcello lippi took control of the southern team in may and was said to be interested in the ivorian regardless , guangzhou s successful defense of its title was not quite as convincing as the debut triumph but amid asian champions league commitments , it was impressive nonetheless since november , lippi has invested further in a squad that has already had more than 70 million spent in it in three years unlike shanghai , run on the unpredictable whim of the online gaming tycoon zhu jun , which despite its stars still attracted less than 01 percent of its 23 million residents to the stadium , guangzhou is a soccer city , or at least it is now forty thousand fans , almost all clad in red , watch the home games , and off the field , the facilities and infrastructure are increasingly top class the solid domestic spine of the team full of chinese internationals was augmented last season by the talented south american threesome of argentina s dario conca \( twotime brazilian league player of the year \) , lucas barrios \( a paraguayan international who arrived from borussia dortmund \) and muriqui in the offseason , lippi shelled out about 8 million for another brazilian midfielder elkeson none can match drogba or anelka in terms of name value but all help elevate guangzhou from a good chinese team to potential asian champions the issue of improving the average local player is still there , but guangzhou is setting new standards in chinese soccer others are following dalian aerbin is an emerging power in the country and a new northeastern counterweight to the southern stars successive promotions took the team from third tier to the first and a debut finish of fifth place it helps to settle in the top league when your captain is the former barcelona star seydou keita and the former nigerian international peter utaka is scoring goals for fun in the offseason , the club has continued to look overseas perhaps the most interesting arrival in the entire league is guillame hoarau the sometime french international striker is not some thirtysomething headed east for a final payday but a 28 year old coming from the ranks of french club paris stgermain naturally , a significant pay packet of about 3 million helps but if he can adapt and succeed in dalian , then perhaps even shanghai will stop looking for the biggest names and focus on the best fits jiangsu sainty has been doing that for a while and it almost delivered the title last season it was a testament to the recruitment and skills of coach dragan okuka despite spending a fraction of shanghai and guangzhou , the team from nanjing finished second to be rewarded with a first spot in the asian champions league the league s topscorer was littleknown romanian striker cristian dalanche who flourished under okuka and with goalkeeper deng xiaofei in fine form , jiangsu had a solidity and a cutting edge guangzhou s city rivals rf had the latter , thanks to the goals of the premier league star of yakubu aiyegbeni , but not the former after a good start , the newly promoted team finished seventh now brazilian coach sergio farias has spent the past few months shoring up the backline , adding a better class of local players and then there is guizhou renhe the team from the poorer western region of china was linked last year with frank lampard and rio ferdinand the more modest but by no means less suitable signing has come in the form of experienced bosnia and herzegovina international midfielder zvjezdan misimovic to add to its spanish contingent in all , the imports are not quite as eyecatching as this time last year but on average , a better class of foreign player is going to china and to a greater number of club , s too the old guard of beijing , tianjin and shandong , is in danger of being left behind , these days there are new teams to drive the game forward drogba and anelka may be conspicuous by their absence but clubs are realizing that just because you have money , does not mean you should spend it on the biggest names you can get it may not be quite the rollercoaster ride of recent years but it should be a slower and steadier rise upward though in chinese soccer , you never quite know is importing professionals from abroad going to help china develop the domestic game \? in a country so vast that has been an underachiever internationally , can the national team soon challenge other asian nations like japan , australia and south korea \?

hong kong wang lin , an exponent of the ancient chinese practice of qigong , claims he has used his powers to cure cancer and has performed other mysterious feats , like conjuring snakes out of thin air but none of his abilities were enough to ward off the fury of the communist party , which has accused him of using superstition to draw in gullible citizens and officials for weeks , chinese web sites , newspapers and television have presented a swelling pile of accusations against mr wang bewitching and swindling patients , dodging taxes and associating with criminal gang members and corrupt officials on tuesday , the people s daily , the main newspaper of the communist party , raised the pitch of the official condemnations and accused mr wang of doling out spiritual opium to credulous cadres hiding in hong kong , where he fled to avoid possible arrest , mr wang said tuesday in an interview that he was the innocent victim of a political vendetta that has rippled outward from a business dispute in his hometown in jiangxi province in southern china hong kong is a special administrative region of china with considerable legal autonomy mr wang said he hoped that discussing his case would show he was the target , rather than the perpetrator , of corrupt political dealings it s as if the whole country has turned against me , turning black into white and white into black , mr wang said from a chic hotel room where he has been hiding out from reporters and , his associates said , chinese officials it s truly beyond my comprehension while china s leaders present their country as a model of resolute modernization , mr wang and his sudden celebrity are flamboyant testament to the attractions and dangers of traditional , mystical beliefs that the government has often sought to suppress after years of tolerating mr wang , the government has turned against him as an example of the lurid excesses and ideological rot threatening the communist party , , has emphasized the likes of wang lin are spiritual opium for some officials , the people s daily said he is also a mirror that has exposed the unchecked avarice and ugly souls of certain officials the newspaper called on officials to renew their faith in marxismleninism , a theme repeated several times by mr xi the brilliant performances and string of swindles of wang lin and his ilk will not become chicken soup for certain officials' souls , the paper said separately , an official from the national health and family planning commission , xue xiaolin , said on the agency s web site that mr wang was under investigation for illegal medical work , and warned there will be no soft handling if he is found culpable if i go back , i 'll certainly be arrested , said mr wang , wearing the glittery style of ring and watch favored by many newly wealthy chinese people he said he had made his money honestly , and never took money from officials or from ill people who sought his help i 've always kept to myself , never promoted myself , but now it seems the media can treat me as a criminal , say anything about me qigong is the ancient chinese belief that the body s energies can be channeled using breathing , massage and meditation techniques , and turned into a force for healing , health and some followers maintain uncanny supernatural abilities under mao zedong , qigong survived and adapted to communist control , but along with other traditional beliefs it came under official suspicion from the 1980s , though , qigong enjoyed a revival , becoming one of a number of traditional beliefs that found ardent followers and official patronage under deng xiaoping after 1999 , qigong again encountered official suspicion after the party suppressed falun gong , a spiritual movement whose beliefs included elements of qigong a diminutive 61yearold whose sculptured eyebrows and slickedback hair are reminiscent of liberace s , mr wang has attracted a following among businessmen , officials and others , according to chinese news reports his recent downfall started with a burst of publicity about his meeting jack ma , one of china s richest entrepreneurs , and , the former railways minister recently jailed for graft the pictures of those meetings dragged wang lin into the limelight , and then the publicity became fatal when it attracted official attention , said sima nan , a media commentator in beijing who has denounced mr wang wang lin has attracted a following among officials , and not just the ones who have been exposed on the internet we should make an example of him and those who abetted him mr wang said his dealings with officials were entirely innocent he said he met the former railways minister to discuss a business deal involving a friend but he denied reports that he had assured mr liu that he would not fall from power successful chinese people can feel drawn to mystical beliefs that promise guidance in a giddily materialistic society , said yu shicun , a writer in beijing who has studied traditional beliefs , the ancient practice of arranging rocks , waterways and other physical features to fend off ill fortune and attract positive forces the education is so rigid that people then feel they lack a solid system of their own beliefs , and then they can easily fall into believing most anything , mr yu said china has these many traditions that appeal to people , but those traditions have become distorted or ruptured by the environment they must survive in these days mr wang was coy about discussing reports that he has claimed to use psychic power to move heavy objects , and he said his performances involving conjuring snakes from thin air were tricks to amuse friends you can put the qigong label on many things , he said i never promoted myself as a qigong master others called me that but a friend accompanying him in hong kong was more enthusiastic about mr wang s powers i 've known him for 20 years , and you would n't believe the things he s capable of unless you were actually there , said the friend , peng taifeng , a coal trader from shenzhen , the chinese city next to hong kong mr wang said he had a permanent residence permit to stay in hong kong and for now had no intention of returning to mainland china he likened himself to edward j snowden , the former intelligence contractor who briefly hid in a hong kong hotel after disclosing information about the united states' intelligencegathering efforts
mark thoma has an excellent column at the fiscal times linking the fight over the debt ceiling to the larger issue of extreme inequality \( by the way , i start my day , every day , with a quick skim of the times followed by thoma s blog economist s view , which is the best place by far to keep up with the latest in economic discourse \) i d like , however , to suggest that the reality is even worse than thoma suggests here s how thoma puts it rising inequality and differential exposure to economic risk has caused one group to see themselves as the makers in society who provide for the rest and pay most of the bills , and the other group as takers who get all the benefits the upper strata wonders , why should we pay for social insurance when we get little or none of the benefits \? and this leads to an attack on these programs so he links the debt ceiling fight to the influence of the wealthy , who want to dismantle the welfare state because it s nothing to them , and they want lower taxes one could add that the very inequality that distances the rich from ordinary concerns gives them increased power , and so makes their antiwelfarestate views far more influential how , then , are things even worse than he says \? because many of the rich are selective in their opposition to government helping the unlucky they re against stuff like food stamps and unemployment benefits but bailing out wall street \? yay ! seriously charlie munger says that we should thank god for the bailouts , but that ordinary people fallen on hard times should suck it in and cope aig s ceo the ceo of a bailed out firm ! says that complaints about bonuses to executives at such firms are just as bad as lynchings \( i am not making this up \) the point is that the superrich have not gone galt on us not really , even if they imagine they have it s much closer to pure class warfare , a defense of the right of the privileged to keep and extend their privileges it s not ayn rand , it s ancien r gime
london alan rusbridger , the mophaired , softspoken editor of the guardian newspaper , finds himself in a shadowy battle with the british government over purloined secrets that the government will have a hard time winning in the internet age the guardian , which leans left and used to see itself as the voice of britain s socially conscious middle class , has struck a more combative tone in the last few years it was deeply involved in publishing the wikileaks material and with that organization s impresario , julian assange , and now glenn greenwald and t edward j snowden , the former national security agency contractor who leaked classifed information to glenn greenwald , ablogger for the guardian having gone global and remained free to readers on the web , with a newsroom in new york as well as in london , the guardian is a much harder news organization than most to intimidate or censor , as the british government , with no written constitution or bill of rights to enshrine protections of free speech , has discovered but the tale of the last two months , as mr rusbridger tells it , at least , is an extraordinary one of attempted political interference agents of the british government descended on the guardian s offices to monitor three executives as they physically destroyed computer hard drives containing some of the classified material that mr snowden downloaded from american intelligence databases and gave to mr greenwald and others you have powerful protections in america that we do n't , mr rusbridger , 59 , said tuesday in an interview after publishing an oped article in his paper describing some of the government s actions in conversations with him , the british government threatened the paper with prior restraint , he said , to stop it from publishing material , and then demanded that the guardian return or destroy the classified material it was holding it was quite explicit we had to destroy it or give it back to them , mr rusbridger said in an earlier interview with the bbc i explained that there were other copies , not within the uk , so i could n't see the point of destroying one copy but because we had other copies i was happy to destroy a copy in london the united states has sought the extradition of mr snowden , now in russia , but it has not acted to restrain newspaper publication or gone into newspaper offices to seize or destroy files and hard drives , as in britain mr rusbridger , guardian editor since 1995 , said he was prompted to describe the government s actions after the british police detained mr greenwald s partner , david michael miranda , at heathrow airport on sunday , on his way home from berlin to rio de janeiro mr miranda had met another of those aiding mr snowden , the filmmaker laura poitras , and was carrying encrypted material from her back to mr greenwald in brazil mr miranda , a brazilian , was held in the transit area of the airport under schedule 7 of britain s terrorism act 2000 for the legal maximum of nine hours he was questioned and his electronic equipment seized before being released without charges he and mr greenwald intend to file a lawsuit over the detention , mr rusbridger said , because it s not clear that he was actually committing any offense in carrying material through heathrow the british government has defended the detention after saying little on sunday or monday , a home office spokeswoman said the police had been looking for stolen information that could be of use to terrorists if the police believe that an individual is in possession of highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism , then they should act , and the law provides them a framework to do that , the spokeswoman said those who oppose this sort of action need to think about what they are condoning the prime minister s office was kept informed , as was the american government , which denied having asked britain to take any action against mr miranda mr rusbridger sees the detention as an act of intimidation using terrorism legislation that offers none of the protections that exist in mainland britain is quite a disturbing new turn , he said a lawyer for mr miranda , gwendolen morgan , told the guardian that the police used the antiterrorism laws to bypass normal statutory procedures for seeking confidential journalistic material under the 1984 police and criminal evidence act this act is likely to have a chilling effect on journalists worldwide , and is emphatically not what parliament intended schedule 7 powers to be used for , ms morgan told the guardian lawyers argued that the detention was also an unlawful deprivation of liberty under the european convention of human rights mr rusbridger said that two months ago he was contacted by a very senior government official claiming to present the views of the prime minister , david cameron there were two meetings in which officials demanded the return or the destruction of the material we were working on , and in other meetings , he said , officials said you 've had your fun , now we want the stuff back , and , you 've had your debate , there s no need to write any more the officials then threatened legal action to obtain the documents then two security experts from britain s government communications headquarters , known as gchq , the counterpart to the american national security agency , came to oversee the destruction of hard drives in the guardian basement by guardian executives , mr rusbridger said he called it one of the most bizarre moments in the guardian s long history efforts to prevent publication of snowdenrelated material began on june 7 , when defense officials issued a confidential notice to newspapers and broadcasters in an attempt to limit the coverage of mr snowden s revelations about surveillance tactics employed by intelligence agencies in britain and the united states editors were reminded not to publish information that could jeopardize both national security and possibly uk personnel the notice followed the guardian s first publication of details of the american intelligencegathering program called prism now , it is not just the opposition labour party that is questioning the use of the terrorism laws in this case to seize material intended for journalism , which in countries like the united states would be under more legal protection david davis , a conservative member of parliament , said that the responses of the home office fail logic 101 'if you 're not on our side , you 're on the side of the terrorists , ' is what they 're trying to say , mr davis said robert wintemute , a professor of human rights law at king s college , london , said that i hope this is an aberration rather than a signal of a wider clampdown on press freedom and human rights i do think greenwald and miranda should bring this to court , because winning in court will rein in the government s powers , he said
toronto coach mike woodson and the walked the walk of sorrow in the final seconds of their game with the on friday night woodson entered the locker room before his players did he went straight to a monitor to look at the final minutes of the game he said he needed an answer as to why the knicks fell just short against the raptors , 10098 , for their fourth straight loss did the knicks lose because of their lack of effort or their defense \? or did they rely too much on \? none of those , woodson thought watching the final two minutes again , woodson saw how the knicks did not attack the raptors on offense he noticed how anthony and others forced up long jumpers i thought our shot selection was awful , woodson said we were in the penalty , and we settled sometimes the 3s are appetizing we 've made them this year like that , but going back looking at the tape , the last two minutes , we had opportunities to take the ball to the rim and make plays , and they were blowing the whistle the knicks \( 3220 \) missed four 3pointers in the final two minutes on one possession , anthony could possibly have given the knicks the lead by driving to the basket instead he made a crosscourt pass to raymond felton , who missed a 3pointer after the game , anthony watched a replay and understood why woodson thought it was not his best option i think my play was definitely a play i should have took advantage of and drove to the basket , he said the raptors \( 2333 \) also took tough shots in the final minutes and they won the game in large part because kyle lowry made the most challenging shot in the game when the raptors needed a basket and the knicks needed a stop , it was lowry who swished a difficult runner over tyson chandler to put the raptors up by 9795 with 28 seconds left it was lowry s only basket of the fourth quarter , and the raptors led for good the knicks allowed lowry to get a oneonone match up with chandler , a much slower defender chandler , the reigning defensive player of the year , stayed with lowry to contest the shot good defense , but better offense tyson did a great job it s just kyle made a great shot , felton said of the play he shot a running floater over a 7foot1 guy my hat goes off to kyle hitting a tough shot i do n't think we can play that any better as a team chandler had his chance to tie the score with 21 seconds left woodson drew up the play for anthony but anthony passed to chandler , who was fouled cutting to the basket tyson had a clear lane , anthony said if they would n't have grabbed him , it would have been a wideopen dunk instead , chandler missed the first of his two free throws i did everything i normally do in a freethrow routine , chandler said it was the same thing i did in the second one , but the first was just a little long rudy gay extended the raptors' lead to 9996 when he calmly made two free throws for much of the night , the game was a battle between stars , anthony and gay each led his team with 32 points the knicks had said this game was about pride , after they were embarrassed by the indiana pacers two nights earlier in that game , the knicks failed to show much effort on offense or any intensity on defense and were severely punished for their lapses the pacers humiliated the knicks , scoring 74 points in the first half en route to an easy win the knicks called friday s game a must win but they walked to the locker room with another loss sometimes you ca n't explain it , felton said of the team s slump i feel like we played hard sometimes the ball just do n't go your way that s what happened down the stretch they hit shots , and we did n't  rebounds kenyon martin , whom the knicks have agreed to sign to a 10day contract , had his physical in new york the knicks also have to wait for ronnie brewer , whom they traded to oklahoma city , to pass his physical with the thunder the knicks will have three options after the 10 days are over they can sign martin to a second 10day contact , sign him for the remainder of the season or release him
one decade after saturday night live began in 1975 , it added the first black woman to its primary cast danitra vance , a gifted downtown actress and second city veteran , lasted just one season saturday night live later cast ellen cleghorne \( 199195 \) and maya rudolph , a biracial star who left in 2007 and that s it in this context , it s no wonder that the cast member kenan thompson this month when he explained the show s dearth of black women this way it s just a tough part of the business , he like in auditions , they just never find ones that are ready let me state the obvious that saturday night live , once home of the not ready for prime time players , has hired only three black women for its main cast in addition to yvonne hudson , a featured player in 1980 in four decades says more about the show than about the talent pool that does n't mean that the show s executive producer , lorne michaels , discriminates so much as he does n't put a premium on this kind of diversity jay pharoah , who plays president obama on the show , does , however he that snl should hire , a comic on tyler perry s sitcom love thy neighbor he praised her talent , but unlike mr thompson , he does n't merely talk about being ready why hire her \? because she s black , first of all , mr pharaoh said pointedly the bluntness of this comment is actually more important than anything mr thompson said that s because , for a show of topical parody rooted in current national politics and mass culture , diversity is a question not just of fairness , but also of art part of the reason this issue has moved into the public eye now is that after years of playing whoopi goldberg , jennifer hudson and other black women , mr thompson has decided to stop performing in drag , limiting the options for sketch subjects on the show \( he added that mr pharoah also does n't really want to do it \) crossdressing , of course , has a long comedic tradition , but the conversation on this practice shifted slightly after dave chappelle in a 2005 interview that black men in comedy were always asked to wear a dress in explaining how show business could corrupt black artists , mr chappelle described being pressured on a movie set to do drag and refusing you got to take a stand , he said when kevin hart played the actress quvenzhan wallis in a saturday night live skit this year , he got that cited mr chappelle s comments , something no white comic would deal with it s one example of how black and white comics bring very different things \( including expectations \) to the table , which is also why a heterogenous cast is an asset this is when it comes to network television , but it s more critical for a show with the broad ambitions of saturday night live when kerry washington hosts this week , the show will have someone who can credibly play beyonc for the first time this season there has n't been a cast member to portray michelle obama for her husband s entire presidency that matters the show , which , to be fair , has a range of talents , including a blossoming star in , benefits from diversity that tries to match the breadth of the mainstream popular culture it covers in the 2002 oral history live from new york , chris rock , a former cast member , had warm things to say about saturday night live , but described it as blind in some respects half the culture s into some form of hiphop sensibility , half of the white culture it s not just a black thing , he said but the show s never dealt with that part of the culture mr rock starred on saturday night live for three years , before leaving for in living color , one of several sketch shows , including the comedy central series chappelle s show a decade ago and key and peele today , that have both showcased black performers and exposed how tentative snl has been on the subject of race there are exceptions , none greater than the years with eddie murphy , who , it should be noted , was hired when mr michaels had temporarily left mr michaels has always looked for unknowns from a \( upright citizens brigade , the groundlings , second city \) that are predominantly , but by no means exclusively , white i saw a talented allblack female improv group at upright citizens brigade last year called doppelganger it featured nicole byer of girl code , keisha zollar and sasheer zamata , a nimble performer whose web include sharp sendups of style that could translate nicely to network television mr michaels would find more black comedians if he looked further afield online or in standup but with the show s long run and track record finding stars , he may be thinking , why change \? comedy has historically been rife with the same kind of old boys' clubs as in law , academia and hollywood while saturday night live looks for the best talent , why certain people make it , and others do not , is far more complex than simple merit ms vance , who , had the bad luck to appear during a famously disastrous season , and the roles she played included a teenage mother and a rapper rapping about wrapping paper soon after leaving , however , she displayed a mountain of talent in the colored museum , george c wolfe s modern classic that is the most brilliantly irreverent play about race ever written in one of many blisteringly funny in that production , ms vance played a stewardess on a slave ship called celebrity , all peppy assurances and smiling manipulation \( repeat after me i do n't hear any drums and i will not rebel \) she tells the passengers to buckle their shackles before giving the hard sell all right , so you 're going to have to suffer a few hundred years , she concedes , a shrill edge creeping into her voice i thought of this monologue while watching another sketch about slavery in last week s episode of saturday night live it began promisingly a newly freed black man \( mr pharoah \) walks into a southern bar not long after the emancipation proclamation has been signed besides setting up an underwhelming cameo by miley cyrus fertile ground for racial comedy the central joke was how oblivious he is to racism the scene s closing joke has him asking a white man if there will be a black president it s been two weeks ! he says , with exaggerated exasperation a joke about the impatience of a black person wanting representation would have been offkey and unfunny during reconstruction this month , it s just bizarre
in the 1990s , a technology company , cybermotion , tried to sell museums on the concept of robot security guards with a squat body on three wheels , a raillike neck and a rectangular head , the sr2 security robot looked like number 5 from the movie short circuit it used sonar and infrared technology to monitor the air quality , temperature and humidity in galleries , and could detect motion caused by potential intruders but the motorized museum guard failed to catch on , and cybermotion closed in 2001 nevertheless , some museum visitors might see guards , so often silent and stonefaced , as more machine than human that is a misconception many guards , like the six profiled below , speak with obvious passion about the exhibitions , as well as the visitors , for which they feel responsible museum guards find the lost , shepherd the confused and save runaway toddlers from impending collisions with immovable sculptures the job demands long hours , constant vigilance and a reservoir of patience to put up with illicit picture takers , soda smugglers and pontificating amateur art critics , among other annoyances consider these guards the army grunts of the art world national museum of the american indian most museum guards field common questions greatest hits include where are the bathrooms \? and can i touch this \? but visitors to the national museum of the american indian in new york often ask luther nakapaahu about survival skills for example , how do you make a bed in the snow \? mr nakapaahu , an enrolled member of the northern arapaho tribe , is the only guard of native american descent at the new york museum he grew up in honolulu and moved to the wind river indian reservation in wyoming when he was 17 , after his mother died his maternal grandparents put him right to work , rebuilding the family s horse ranch wyoming , it was a shock , said mr nakapaahu , 51 , a large man with closecropped hair and a baritone voice we started learning how to bale hay , going up to the mountains to cut tepee poles , learning to shave tepee poles , then learning to break and ride horses mr nakapaahu sees parallels between handling horses and communicating with crowds at museums sometimes with horses and people , patience is a virtue , he said with a grin , he recalled the first time he tried to corral horses by chasing them his uncle just started laughing what he showed us was you take a bale of oats , put it in a pail and yell and they come to us mr nakapaahu , who spends some breaks in the museum s library learning about his heritage , scans new exhibitions for artifacts from his tribe he recalled spotting a northern arapaho saddle displayed in , a 200911 exhibition it s sort of everything mixed up in one feeling , he said quietly happy , pride , shock walker art center if you notice a guard at the walker art center in minneapolis suddenly balancing on one foot or striking a yoga pose , it s probably just todd balthazor limbering up i'm stretching all the time , he said you have to do that , or else you are going to stiffen up we have some elderly workers , and they just walk like trees even when the galleries are packed , mr balthazor , 31 , admits to struggling on occasion against monotony to stay sharp , he developed tricks like memorizing a guest s outfit or holding his breath until you almost black out he also keeps an eye out for material for his , which the museum publishes online in the strip , it is what it is , mr balthazor frequently aims graphic barbs at museum guests , like the photo bomber , who poses in front of large paintings without considering the art they look at it like , this is going to be a great backdrop for my facebook profile , ' mr balthazor said in another strip , he bemoans having to guard ja ja ja ja ja , nee nee nee nee nee , an audio installation by the german artist joseph beuys it s an 11minute loop of him just going , ja , ja , ja , nee , nee , nee' you ca n't even think , unfortunately , when you 're next to that , he said and then you had to stand right next to the speakers because they did n't want people to actually poke at it with pencils philadelphia museum of art it s not going to work it s not going to work it s not going to work dynnita bryant heard that refrain repeatedly while laboring to persuade fellow guards at the philadelphia museum of art to form a union but ms bryant received encouragement from many visitors and inspiration from paintings in the museum vincent van gogh s sunflowers and peter paul rubens s prometheus bound particularly stirred her sunflowers' makes me think , i stand next to this priceless piece of art for this little bit of change , and prometheus bound' makes me think , this is us , said ms bryant , who now moonlights as president of the philadelphia security officers union in 2011 , the union s first contract with alliedbarton security services , which provides guards for the museum , increased guards' wages to 1088 an hour from 1003 and stipulated two subsequent raises guards also received up to three paid sick days before they had none ms bryant said the extra 85 cents an hour had improved the lives of many guards i could buy a loaf of bread and have some change , she said that was a victory to me smithsonian national air and space museum though he went handtohand with the taliban as a military policeman at guant namo bay naval base and fought in the gulf war , darrell lawrence argues that working as a guard at the smithsonian national air and space museum in washington is a more difficult job it s more peaceful here than in iraq , he allows , but in the military , you knew who your enemy was visitors to museums tend not to advertise themselves as terrorists everybody who comes through the door is a threat , said mr lawrence , who frequently responds to questions with no , sir or yes , sir the threat level rose in 2009 , when a white supremacist at the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington it s a wakeup call you hate for something like that to happen , but you have to be on your toes and more aware , said mr lawrence , who called working as a museum guard a national service while mr lawrence maintains an activeduty mindset , he still manages to admire some of the museum s exhibitions he is in awe of the , wilbur and orville wright s first airplane , but reveres a predator drone on display he credits a predator with saving his life during operation desert storm he was about to transport iraqi prisoners through hostile territory when the predator detected and destroyed a potential ambush i love the drone , he said i 've seen it in action guggenheim museum jeffrey salter s uniform at the guggenheim museum includes a large blue button that reads , ask me about the art mr salter is one of the museum s gallery guides , a job requiring the attentiveness of a security guard and the empathy of a psychotherapist though trained to protect exhibitions , gallery guides roam the guggenheim to discuss art with visitors during impromptu exchanges at the museum , mr salter often taps his training in improvisational theater if you are playing a scene and someone does n't say anything at first , you are looking for facial expressions and body language , he said on a recent saturday afternoon in a guggenheim conference room i think that s applicable to what i'm doing here he studied improv at the upright citizens brigade training center in new york and performs with a troupe called gayle , named for the television host gayle king , oprah winfrey s prominent friend mr salter , a thin , bearded 27yearold with an appreciation for the absurd \( in a comedic sketch , he portrayed the husband of \) , laments that museum guards have a reputation as scolds we 're not monolithic , authoritarian figures , he said we have these complex lives and are nice people to be around he can be tough if necessary to command attention while maintaining an affable tone , mr salter drew inspiration from his high school english class he recalled a teacher who was , on the one hand , a really accessible , friendly guy , but if you were talking during a lecture , he would let you know that was n't acceptable though he has yet to speak about his museum job on stage , mr salter often finds humor in art he singled out the work of the whimsical , who created not afraid of love , a lifesize sculpture of an elephant cloaked in a bedsheet with holes for its eyes and trunk there was something very funny , he said , about the proverbial elephant in the room trying to hide itself baltimore museum of art linda smith is used to being overlooked museum visitors , understandably , focus on the art rather than the people protecting the art the irony is that the guard is the most visible staff member in the museum , ms smith said museum guards , in her opinion , deserve more attention , so in 2011 she curated , a gallery exhibition showcasing art by her coworkers several pieces sold , including two paintings by ms smith , who earned an mfa from vermont college of fine arts she notes that several acclaimed artists have walked in her wellworn shoes former guards include jackson pollock , sol lewitt , robert mangold and mel bochner , who will be honored next year with at the jewish museum in new york the same institution that fired him as a guard in 1965 for sleeping on duty ms smith considers robert ryman her guardist role model ryman worked at the museum of modern art for seven years , she said he was not a painter when he started there , but he became one rather than being daunted by the works on the walls of a museum , ms smith made the case that spending all day around art \( or much of the night , the shift she works now \) could fuel a competitive spirit for many artists , she said , if they do n't get a jolt of inspiration from a piece , there s also the feeling of , well , i

amman , jordan in a listless border town , the teenager goes unnoticed , one of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled the syrian civil war , dashing across villages and farms to land in jordan , just five miles from home but this young man carries a burden maybe an honor , too that almost no one else shares he knows that he and his friends helped start it all they ignited an uprising it began simply enough , inspired not so much by political activism as by teenage rebellion against authority , and boredom he watched his cousin spraypaint the wall of a school in the city of dara'a with a short , impish challenge to president , a trained ophthalmologist , about the spreading national revolts it s your turn , doctor , the cousin wrote the opening episodes of the arab uprisings are growing more distant , the memory of them clouded by fears about what the revolutions have wrought in egypt s chaos , activists talk of a second revolution , and in tunisia a political assassination this week one of the region s more hopeful transitions then there is , where tens of thousands of people have been killed , hundreds of thousands have fled the country and the idea of the nation itself is disappearing amid cycles of sectarian bloodshed that war s brutality has made it difficult to recall , let alone celebrate , the uprisings' beginnings after the graffiti , the teenager and his friends were arrested and tortured , that , looking back , were the first days of the civil war two years later , the boys remain mostly unknown , none celebrated like mohamed bouazizi , the fruit seller whose selfimmolation started the arab uprisings , or khaled said , the young man whose beating death at the hands of the egyptian police helped start a movement for change some of the boys from dara'a are refugees , like the teenager in jordan , now 17 , who agreed , along with his father , to speak as long as his name was not revealed they said they were protecting relatives left behind in syria , but their reluctance also came from shame the boy s father had given him up to the police , to spare a second son , and the teenager informed on three of his friends to try to avoid the torture he suffered anyway given all that has happened , to his family and his country , the teenager said he had no regrets why should i \? it s good that it happened , he said during a meeting arranged by other refugees from dara'a speaking of mr assad , he said , we found out who he really is it began with the graffiti the government , nervous as leaders were being toppled around the arab world , reacted furiously to the slight , arresting the teenager and more than a dozen other boys and then torturing them for weeks the boy s relatives , neighbors and hundreds of others in the city gathered for protests demanding the release of the boys security forces opened fire on the crowds they calculated that zero tolerance would head off an escalation they were wrong the details of the teenager s story could not be independently corroborated , but its outlines matched accounts by a few of the other boys from dara'a who have spoken about that period three former residents of the city , including two who lived in the same neighborhood as the teenager and his family , confirmed that he was among the boys arrested in march 2011 recounting those days , the teenager said he passed a sleepless night after his cousin s acts of defiance it was not just the graffiti the cousin had set fire to a new police kiosk the same day in another act of lashing out the teenager and his friends did not talk much about politics , but the language of dissent was everywhere on satellite television small protests had begun to flare in damascus it was the right time , the teenager said the next morning , he noticed intelligence agents at a school and had little doubt about why they were there we knew what we did , he said over the next few days , the police , the military and the military police roamed the city day and night , storming the homes of suspects the teenager said he went into hiding i thought it would pass , he said but it did not when the police finally knocked on the family s door , the officers threatened to take a different son if the father gave up the teenager , the agents promised , he would be held for only a few days the father complied and took his son to the local security headquarters the boy started crying , and begging to be taken home but the father left his son behind you are to blame for anything that happens to him , his wife said when he returned home the abuse began as soon as the teenager arrived at a prison in the town of suwayda , where he was beaten during his interrogations are you the one who wrote it \? the interrogator asked , more a demand than a question the teenager said he dropped out of school when he was 8 i do n't know how to write , he told the interrogators for three days until , desperate for the abuse to stop , he confessed to spraypainting the phrase , though he had not he also gave up the names of three other boys who were there that day within two weeks of the arrest , the father received a call to go to dara'a omari mosque for a protest , in part to demand the release of the boys about 10 people had already gathered there the father said he and the other parents were convinced that if they did not protest , they would have taken more children the demonstration grew , and soon he saw most everyone he knew in the city it is impossible to say how things might have turned out had the assad government taken a more accommodating stance toward the protest activists from dara'a still insist that the pressures could have been contained , compromises reached , even after years of violent repression any such hope quickly passed as the deaths began to mount people became uncontrollable , the father said sometime after the protests in dara'a started , the father heard that the boys would be freed the teenager , unaware of the spreading revolt , said he was put on a minibus with other boys from dara'a and sent home when he arrived , his father said , i did n't recognize him his son fled to jordan about a year ago , where he spent his time looking for work as a day laborer , and dreaming about returning to fight the government in syria about two months ago , he heard that his cousin who wrote the graffiti and somehow managed to avoid arrest had joined the rebels as a fighter and had been killed

coverage and live analysis from times reporters , editors and others of tuesday s champions league semifinal between barcelona and bayern munich and make sure to come back on wednesday for the second semifinal real madrid vs dortmund thomas m ller scored two goals and set up two others as bayern munich thrashed visiting barcelona , 40 , on tuesday in a champions league semifinal the eagerly anticipated showdown between european heavyweights , both former winners of the competition , was a complete mismatch bayern dominated the midfield even as it surrendered much of the possession , frustrating barcelona s passing game before it could get close enough to create chances then bayern punished the catalans on set pieces at the other end , dominating the air at times simply bullying barcelona into submission barcelona had hoped to get a boost from its star lionel messi , who returned from a hamstring injury sustained in the quarterfinal , but the tiny argentine unable to find an inch of space and clearly not fit was virtually invisible all game barcelona never seemed to have a chance losing his marker in the 25th minute , m ller drove in a header for the opening goal four minutes after halftime , he headed a ball off a corner kick into the goalmouth , where mario gomez swept it in the visitors were stunned , and it only got worse m ller set a crushing pick on a defender to free arjen robben to score from a tight angle in the 73rd minute , and then slid in to add his second goal in the 82nd by then barcelona seemed to be praying for the end , just wanting to get out of bavaria and hopefully turn things around at its camp nou stadium next week but a fourgoal deficit will be almost impossible to erase , making it highly likely now that bayern will face the real madridborussia dortmund winner in the final at wembley on may 25  andrew das i couldn t agree more with this comment this seems a little sad to me not being a big fan of either team and so not being caught up in the final result , it just seems like it d be a better more interesting game with a fully healthy messi  , from la , ca messi cut a sorry figure throughout the game there was a moment in the first half when i watched him stand absolutely still for about 15 seconds as his teammates passed the ball around the poor guy was blatantly , piteously and depressingly unfit the coaching team at barcelona should take a long , hard look at the decision they made to put him in the team  mark walsh barcelona had about 65 percent possession there and still got thumped 40 but it s not about quantity , it s about quality the only stat that matters is the scoreline at the end bayern produced a performance of passion , power , poise and prowess every attack bristled with intent and penetration , while allowing barcelona to dally inconsequentially with the ball in the middle third of the pitch barcelona s best player because he had to be , just to stem the tide was gerard pique , by a mile bayern had 11 manofthematch performances , probably topped by muller , who scored twice , assisted one and got away with a cheeky body check to give robben the time to finish for the third goal an honorable mention should also go to a spaniard , javi martinez , who set the tone in the bayern midfield with some tough tackling and intelligent passing there was controversy over at least two of the bayern goals gomez looked slightly offside for the second goal \( i happen to disagree the attacking team should get the advantage \) , while muller s shoulder barge on jordi alba for the third goal incensed barca \( that wasn t a foul either , if you ask me muller held his ground , no more \) any debate over those two incidents would do bayern a disservice a 40 final result was no less than their performance deserved barcelona s two best chances fell to the last person anybody would have picked to sneak a goal young defender marc bartra unsurprisingly , he fluffed both does anybody think barcelona can overcome this deficit against that team \? not me not even a fully firing messi can save them now i also think that in bayern you have just seen the 2013 champions league winner and the new dominant force in european soccer  mark walsh mes que un whupping  andrew das \( andrewdasnyt \) 23 apr 13 a thrashing a 40 final that really wasn t that close  andrew das barcelona appeals , asking for only one iniesta is booked , killing a little more of it  andrew das xherdan shaqiri is on and who doesn t like typing xherdan shaqiri annnnnnd there s a yellow for jordi alba too  andrew das he was tracking back after robben , who smells blood in the water which is often a bad thing if you re a diver but not today  andrew das has barcelona issued a correction about its earlier announcement that messi was fit today \? because , you know , he s clearly not  andrew das claudio pizarro replaces him watch him get one now , too  andrew das holy cow ribery surges up the left , then leads alaba to the end line he crosses in front to the sliding muller , and just like that it s 40 this hasn t been a victory it s been a demolition a complete dismantling  andrew das he bravely charges out to meet muller , who pulled the ball to his left foot around pique at the six , to make a save with his face dani alves surrenders his right foot in keeping the rebound away from schweinsteiger  andrew das charles oakley would have loved the pick muller threw to free robben for the shot there , and there s no way robben was passing this time bayern just ran a nasty pic n roll lol  jozy altidore \( jozyaltidore \) 23 apr 13 kassai is going to feel bad about that one when he sees it later , but what s the use of the extra referee if guys are going to be allowed to do that \?  andrew das despite the deep affection that pep guardiola will presumably always have for barcelona , there must be part him thinking this result goes some way to justify his decision to quit while on top bayern has outclassed a messihobbled barcelona and you might just be seeing the changing of the guard when it comes to europe s toprated team and bayern has just signed german football s bright young thing , mario g tze for next season it s a decent job to take  mark walsh muller threw a worldclass pick on bartra there , freeing robben for an easy slot to the far post  andrew das a little more clutter to frustrate barcelona  andrew das barcelona finally gets a free shot in the area , but bartra is so stunned by the rare opportunity that his impotent shot goes straight to neuer really \? that s the best you can do \? seconds later bayern is circling the barcelona penalty area for the perfect spot to deliver another cross  andrew das does bayern s performance today fill you with optimism and excitement , or sadness \?  andrew das even halfchances are disappearing quickly for barcelona sanchez just took the ball to the end line and then kept right on going over it messi stood waiting for the goal kick with an expression that said , it s not supposed to be going like this  andrew das the achilles heel was exposed once again this time , m ller is the provider , rising highest at the back post to head a corner back across goal for g mez to sweep into the net barcelona s goalkeeper v ctor vald s was caught in two minds , but he wasn t the only defender at a loss to deal with the high ball barcelona has what is known in the trade as a dracula defense it s allergic to crosses now bayern is dominant and now barcelona has a real problem the only good news for fans of the blaugrana is that bar a have been on the hook for two goals before in this tournament in the last 16 , ac milan won 20 at home in the first leg , but were blown away in the return with messi inspirational  mark walsh they re just taking punch after punch in the corner of the ring right now , hoping to stay up  andrew das robben roars up the right , turns left \( where else \? \) and then dribbles , dribbles , dribbles , right across the field looking for an opening to uncork a shot finally , he gives up the ball for ribery , and he slips a defender but pulls his leftfooted shot across the go and just outside the right post i ve killed robben for his selfishness many times , but he s really playing well today \( he even had a rightfooted cross to set up the first goal \) and he s just frightening when he gets up a head of steam  andrew das i know , i know , he s better on one leg than most players in prime fitness , but lionel messi should not have started this match a hamstring injury for a player that relies on a nitrofueled burst of pace over the first two yards is not just painful , it s debilitating there was one instance in that first half when messi tried to accelerate past javi mart nez , but was dragged back yes , he won the free kick , but preinjury messi would have been a speck of dust on the horizon before mart nez could have even got close the other thing is , what message does it send to your substitutes the likes of cesc f bregas , for example when a limping lionel is preferred in the starting lineup \? barcelona has exposed its neurosis with playing the argentine messidependencia , they call it in spain when surely it would have been better to hold him in reserve , only use him in an emergency and let him recover properly for the second leg \? 57 bayern munich have lost none of his previous 57 home cl games after having scored the opening goal irretrievable  optajean \( optajean \) 23 apr 13 the corner sailed to muller at the far post , and he simply sent it back from whence it came barcelona appeals for offside , and it sure looked close on the first replay , but covering the two open men in the goalmouth might have been a better idea gomez simply swept the dying ball in with his left foot , right past valdes  andrew das another cross to the far post , headed back and banged in  andrew das for a foul on iniesta on the sideline  andrew das no changes well , lineupwise barcelona might want to consider a couple tacticswise just saying  andrew das just watched video of the goal again pique is completely adrift as the ball pingpongs over his head , covering no one in the end you can almost hear him swear to himself as he realizes that muller has him dead to rights  andrew das touches show bayern s firsthalf strategy work the wings keep barca out of the box http tco koh7lcdshy  paul carr \( pcarrespn \) 23 apr 13 bayern just isn t letting barcelona pull off any of that closequarter passing into the top of the area that just carves teams up yes , they re surrendering in the battle of possession , but they re losing it on their terms and where they want to messi has been really quiet , but iniesta didn t have a great half either maybe we all should have listened to heynckes when he said he knew all about spanish teams and barcelona  andrew das there s no surprise really in the way that bayern have played against barcelona the principle is simple get tight in midfield and pressure high up the pitch to prevent bar a from settling in possession many have tried it but many have also failed executing that tactic is tortuously difficult , particularly when you have touch technicians like xavi and andr s iniesta pushing the ball past you at phenomenally high speed it s also exhausting so , congratulations to bayern on a perfectly executed firsthalf game plan , but the question is whether they can keep the tempo similarly high in the second half the other difficulty with that tactic is that lionel messi is often left oneonone as players try to cover as much ground as possible and have no spare personnel to doubleteam on any particular threat the reason bayern have looked so dominant in the first half is because messi is looking extremely subdued \( and patently not fit \) , so the danger of isolating him against retreating markers recedes a little if the game were to finish 10 , both teams would take encouragement into the return leg but i still feel , bayern have a golden opportunity here to take an unassailable lead into the camp nou  mark walsh lots of possession for barcelona but not much danger created by any of it bayern has done a great job keeping tabs on messi who needs to work a bit harder in the second half to find a little space to work and of cluttering up the middle even without the ball , the german champions have been in control  andrew das for a foul on muller in the 39th minute he ll have to be a lot more careful with his yellow than gomez will need to be with his  andrew das friend of the goal blog stefan bienkowski just described messi as uncharacterically shy on twitter , and he s absolutely right invisible would be another word but bayern isn t giving him an inch of space , either wisely , i might add he only needs to pop up in the right space once though  andrew das nice ball into the box by xavi is headed down by ribery right into the goalmouth thanks for tracking back and all , franck , but maybe we shouldn t do that too often  andrew das for a foul on messi he doesn t agree we hit guys lie a bread truck all the time here in germany , he tells kassai  andrew das that one , a deflection off a header from a corner , seemed inadvertent by the barcelona defender but robben and the rest scream about it anyway working the officials  andrew das thomas m ller puts bayern ahead with a closerange header , exposing the suspected blind spot of barcelona s defense aerial attacks that goal also came about after mario g mez pressured marc bartra into the panicky concession of a corner the cross was only halfcleared , bayern piled the ball back into the box , where dante towered above barcelona s minuscule markers to head back across goal for m ller finding that bit of space in the box that we were talking about earlier so far , so far , lionel messi has been completely anonymous  mark walsh pedro drives in a ball past alaba on the right , and dante lunges for it in front of neuer but appears to miss neuer reacts on the fly as it sails through the goalmouth close call  andrew das robben crosses in from the right to dante at the far post , and he heads it back across into the path of muller , and he drives it past valdes we talked before the game about how barcelona s soft spot was its defense , especially in the air , and that s proof pique spun like a top there watching the ball go over his head twice once he realized that muller had left him and was going to get it , it was too late  andrew das i don t think there has been much rain in munich today , but the pitch is very sodden in the middle that may be a bit cute on bayern s behalf making the pitch heavy could , at least initially , bog down barcelona s passing patterns a few of the players on both sides have already been slipping and struggling with their footing tactically , watch out for some key duels on the flanks jordi alba and dani alves love to push forward from their fullback positions and make auxiliary attackers for barcelona whether they can impose their games on bayern munich and force the german club s wingers , franck rib ry and arjen robben , to concentrate on defending rather than attacking , may dictate who controls the territory in this match similarly , alexis s nchez and pedro , the barcelona wide attackers , will try to keep philipp lahm and david alaba busy that quartet of players out wide represent a key battleground thomas m ller looks to be occupying the same space on the field as sergio busquets , which is smart on bayern s part busquets is nominally a defensive midfielder , but his intelligent use of the ball often sets barcelona on the attack if m ller can bother him , that will be a plus for bayern  mark walsh he deflects a shot by lahm out for a corner , but does it with his right elbow as he turns away from the ball he sheepishly scurries back into position , looking just a wee bit guilty thomas muller will be the key for bayern today , only player barcelona can t seem to pick up so far  cristian nyari \( cnyari \) 23 apr 13  andrew das that shouldn t be a surprise , since they always do , but bayern is used to doing the same barca just won t give the ball back that just makes it more exciting , though , when bayern takes it away and storms forward you can feel the crowd rise with them each time great atmosphere but they ll need to be disciplined , and avoid being pulled out of position as they chase  andrew das so , quality players in every section of the pitch tonight bayern has mario g mez leading the forward line in the absence of mario mandzukic g mez is a goal machine , but his linkup play and work rate are sometimes suspect franck rib ry and arjen robben are archetypal wingers of the old school both are bursting with pace , trickery and scoring threat but i m particularly enticed by the prospect of watching bayern s dropoff forward , thomas m ller the german international is a favorite of true soccer connoisseurs he s not particularly tall , he s not particularly strong and he s not particularly fast , but he is adept at finding little pockets of space , little corners of opportunity that can unpick the opposition s defenses of all bayern s attackers , i think he is the only one who could fit into barcelona s style of play leaving the selection of messi to one side , barcelona have selected the inexperienced marc bartra to partner gerard piqu in the center of defense if there is a chink in barcelona s armor , that has to be it the only problem for bayern will be getting enough of possession to put the youngster under some sustained pressure i have a feeling that bayern s best chance of reaching the final is to get a positive result tonight messi can only be classed as half fit , while barcelona s rearguard has been hit by injury the whistle has blown , so let s see  mark walsh javi martinez backheels a lead pass in the area , dropping it for robben , but his shot goes right into the feet of valdez so no repeat of that stunning early goal in the first leg against juventus  andrew das like clockwork barcelona take the ball and begin 45 minutes of keepaway is hungary s victor kassai and we all know what that means kidding just trying to start trouble but you heard it here first !  andrew das wouldn t it be great if one time the players ran off after the anthem and the 22 kids took their positions instead \?  andrew das \( andrewdasnyt \) 23 apr 13 1 take a look to see if messi has his usual burst it was noticably absent when he came on as a sub again psg , as if he was unsure of whether he could really test his hamstring that day of course , that was two weeks ago , so he could be back to his normal explosive self 2 the play on the wings should be wild today , with bayern s robben and ribery passing pedro and jordi alba and dani alves like cars headed in different directions on the autobahn but if someone gets caught upfield on a turnover , or because they re slow getting back , it could leave their teammates exposed 3 mario gomez is great in the air , and he should get excellent service from all directions from muller and his wings keep an eye out for him rising out of a crowd in the center  andrew das as far as european club soccer goes , it doesn t get much more mouthwatering than this bayern munich vs barcelona in the semifinal of the champions league both bayern and barcelona have won this tournament four times in the past the german club last took the trophy home in 2001 , while barcelona s most recent triumph was in 2011 bayern has won the german league with games to spare , while barcelona is almost certain of the spanish title barcelona has been in six straight semifinals , while bayern has made the last two finals yup , there s no doubt about it , these are two of the true doyens of continental soccer with the semifinals of the champions league this year featuring two spanish teams and two german teams , there s also a feeling that we are witnessing duels between the two nations who have been tipped to dominate soccer for the next few years the spanish national team , which draws most of its starting lineup from barcelona and real madrid , is the reigning world cup holder and has won backtoback european championships germany , packed with both emerging talent and players entering their prime years , largely drawn from its two semifinalists this year , bayern munich and borussia dortmund , are many experts best bet to topple spain from its perch will these two semifinals prove bellwether results for the future of world soccer \? the bayernbar a tie has subplots on its subplots , but when the team sheets are handed in , it was the name of lionel messi that got most hearts racing after a twoweek break with a hamstring injury , the argentine genius has been deemed fit enough to start that could be massive for barcelona messi is the one who can add a picassolike touch of genius to the team s play he is the onfield brain who can take the angular lines of passing that barcelona so favors and turn them into high art but even the great little man has to be a little rusty and doubts must surround his ability to last the full 90 minutes , or even avoid aggravating the injury further how big a gamble will his selection turn out to be \?  mark walsh nick kulish of the times has a report on the surprising gameday news that mario g tze , who will play for dortmund against real madrid in wednesday s semifinal , will join bayern munich next season \( while many complained that the timing of the announcement was just awful for all involved , alex rodriguez has no problem with it \) so before kickoff , let s straighten out the

minutes at a time while fans take to the internet to complain that that s boring  andrew das barcelona probably could have waited another day or two , or three for its champions league semifinal against bayern munich , to allow for a few more precious hours of healing for lionel messi s injured right hamstring but someone has to go first in this year s starstudded semifinals , so why not the two clubs with the most recent record of success at this stage of the competition \? barcelona , the champion in 2009 and 2011 , is in the semifinals for the sixth year in a row bayern munich has been to two of the past three finals it would not be a surprise to see either team lift ol big ears at wembley on may 25 with none less than xavi calling this a 50 50 tie , the status of messi has been the biggest pregame talking point injured in the first leg of the quarterfinals against paris stgermain , he returned memorably as a substitute in the second leg to nurse barcelona through but he has skipped barca s last three league games , and the team has been circumspect about his condition and probably will continue to be right up until the lineups are announced starting him or leaving him on the bench is , obviously , not a minor decision while barcelona has been the gold standard in europe the past five years , they re lucky to still be in this year s tournament , extremely so given their uncertain recent performances without messi most would agree that barcelona was fortunate that it did not go out against milan in the round of 16 , and it had one foot out the window against psg in the quarterfinals before messi yanked the team back in but in they are , and facing their biggest test yet bayern clinched the bundesliga title almost three weeks ago , allowing to it narrow its focus to the one title it reeeeeaaaaallllly wants this year before manager jupp heynckes hands over the keys to pep guardiola like barcelona , bayern is seeking its fifth champions league title , though , oddly , the clubs have rarely traded paint in the tournament bayern prevailed in the first collision , two groupstage encounters in 1998 , while barcelona cruised in the second meeting , in the 2009 quarterfinals a glance at the lineups from that 2009 meeting could offer a clue about today s game here s a look back , with likely starters on tuesday in italics bayern butt , lell , l cio , demichelis , lahm , sosa \( alt ntop 78 \) , van bommel , ottl , z roberto \( borowski 78 \) , rib ry , toni barcelona vald s , alves , puyol , piqu , abidal , xavi , tour , keita , messi , eto o , iniesta \( hleb 78 \) a barcelona supporter would call that lineup with six starters still in the team today \( eight , if puyol and abidal had been fit all spring \) a symbol of continuity , of experience , of consistency , and note that the catalans thrashed the germans , 40 , in the first leg a bayern fan might wonder , especially given recent performances in europe , if bar a has grown a bit stale really , you re playing essentially the same team you played four years ago \? and still playing exactly the same way \? you don t think we have a dvr over here \? so confident are heynckes and bayern munich some are calling this the best bayern team ever that even the suggestion that having guardiola s insight at their disposal would be a valuable asset seemed to annoy them i admire pep guardiola , but i don t need any advice from other coaches , heynckes said i know my team better than anybody and i also know a lot about spanish football and barcelona well then heynckes does have a point , though even with xavi and andres iniesta \( and messi , whatever his condition \) , this is not the barcelona of 2009 and 2011 and bayern is much better , and at its best when it is pouring forward in red waves , winning corner after corner through the work of arjen robben and franck rib ry that could pose real problems in the next two games for barcelona s soft spot its defense , which remains vulnerable as long as carles puyol and javier mascherano are injured and victor valdes is healthy barcelona is so thin at the back these days that ric abidal just back after more than a year out to have a liver transplant went 90 minutes in a weekend win over levante in la liga the good news for barcelona is that they are comfortable on this stage they ll probably dominate possession as they usually do though bayern likes the ball too and they can still do things like this to create scoring chances the only question is whether they ll have the player they want to finish them messi is

kabul , afghanistan an unpublished united nations report on female police officers in afghanistan found accounts of pervasive sexual violence and harassment by their male colleagues , according to afghan and western officials familiar with the report the report , which the united nations has circulated only among senior afghan officials at the interior ministry , found that about 90 percent of the policewomen interviewed described sexual harassment and sexual violence as a serious problem , and that about 70 percent of the policewomen said that they had personally experienced sexual harassment or sexual violence themselves , according to people who saw the report or had it described to them while a much smaller fraction reported either being raped or otherwise sexually assaulted , the overall picture was of a police force in which women were constantly at risk although the report has not been made public and was not made available to the new york times , two other recent reports touched on similar problems , though they did not focus as closely on the issue of sexual assault and harassment ghulam mujtaba patang , who stepped down as interior minister in august , described the united nations report s broad outlines , but questioned its findings he said that after reading the report he sent a team to investigate the situation of female police officers and that none of the women his team spoke to complained of such mistreatment if an afghan policewoman is being raped or sexually harassed , they would report that they would n't keep it secret , he said the chief spokesman for the interior ministry , seddiq seddiqi , said he thought the report had some exaggeration of the issues and the problems both men insisted , however , that the ministry was committed to improving the situation of policewomen the report , according to two people familiar with it , surveyed nearly 10 percent of the female police force united nations officials would not discuss its details we are working with the ministry on followup to the report and to put in place improvements , said georgette gagnon , the united nations director of human rights for afghanistan few subjects are as taboo in afghanistan as sexual behavior , and female victims of sexual attacks are often accused of immorality , shunned and sometimes jailed women s rights advocates said that because afghan policewomen were afraid of being penalized for revealing the problem , it was extremely difficult to get them to talk about abuse that is all the more true if the person committing the sexual abuse is their commander or one of his close friends on the police force the policewomen interviewed by the times said they feared being fired or demoted , or being sent to work in a job that was far away from their home if they complained most policewomen are lowlevel security screeners at checkpoints or government buildings , and in many instances they are the only person earning money in the family and desperately need their salaries usually around 240 per month a further disincentive to talking publicly about sexual abuse or coercion is that many afghans already believe female police officers have loose morals simply because they are willing to work in public with men who are not relatives if a woman admits that she is under pressure to have sex , conservative relatives might force her to quit or even kill her to expiate the perceived dishonor to the family general patang said he had visited policewomen in all of the provinces and had never heard a complaint about sexual abuse most mentioned discontent with salaries or a lack of promotions , he said i think the reason they told these things to the un and did not mention it to my inquiry was that these were mainly illiterate women who thought they might gain more attention and support by making these claims , he said the situation for female police officers is made more difficult because there are so few of them barely 1 percent of the roughly 155 , 000member force a policewoman from eastern afghanistan who spoke on condition of anonymity said she was the only female of more than 20 people working at her checkpoint i have asked to move , the men are not good there , she said they were making bad cheap jokes every time i came in , and one man was leering at me every day saying , talk to me , be with me' what should i do \? she said though they questioned the scope of the report s findings , interior ministry officials said they were trying to improve conditions for female officers we are currently working seriously to make sure that the women are happy and women have the best environment to serve their country , said mr seddiqi , adding that the new minister , umar daudzai , wants to recruit 10 , 000 policewomen by the end of 2014 in addition , the ministry will strive to increase public awareness of the role of female police officers , mr seddiqi said the recruitment goal , while lauded by some , is in many ways a distraction from the problem even reaching the current goal of 5 , 000 policewomen by 2015 is behind schedule , according to ministry officials the to congress by the pentagon acknowledged that recruiting women will remain a serious challenge senior ministry officials understand that one way to decrease the chance of sexual harassment is to have more women in the police force so that it becomes more normal for them to work alongside men , mr seddiqi said now a number of male commanders simply do not want to fill posts with women , according to the pentagon report yet , it is difficult to persuade women to join the police if they fear they will be at risk of harassment , violence or worse in helmand province , where there are 30 policewomen , three have been killed since the beginning of july , including their commander , after being shot in the neck the day before the united nations report is the third this year that examines the hardships faced by afghan policewomen , including their vulnerability to sexual harassment the other reports were conducted by human rights watch and  the human rights watch report the lack of female toilets and designated changing rooms , which the report contended increased women s exposure to abuse the oxfam report focused on the tiny number of female police officers , and emphasized that the absence of policewomen also harms afghan women because they suffer from high rates of domestic violence afghan women would be more likely to discuss such violence with another woman , since they fear that a man might not believe them or , worse , return them to the family where the abuse took place
mexico city nearly 150 people and possibly hundreds more have disappeared at the hands of s police and military during the with little or no investigation of the cases , a human rights group said wednesday , as it called on the new government to account for the country s missing the organization , , said in a that mexico has the most severe crisis of enforced disappearances in latin america in decades the group found a litany of cases in which witnesses reported people had been abducted or were last seen with the military or the police , never to be seen again altogether the group documented 149 such cases in the past six years , after the previous president , felipe calder n , began his term with heavy deployments of military and federal police to combat exploding violence the group s investigation found 60 cases in which witness testimony and other evidence demonstrated that local police officers had colluded with cartels in abductions these are not isolated , jos miguel vivanco , americas director at human rights watch , said this is absolutely shocking human rights watch said it had investigated an additional 100 disappearances but could not conclude that state security was responsible or involved often , when family or friends asked the authorities , they were told their loved ones were not there or had not been taken in one of the more egregious episodes , the group documented more than 20 cases of abductions without explanation by navy personnel in , some recorded on video by enraged family members the navy later acknowledged it had come into contact with several of the men but denied they were being held all remain missing the interior ministry , which received the report wednesday , declined to comment , but president enrique pe a nieto has said he would be more attentive to the victims of violence , who themselves over how mexico should respond the group urged the government to investigate the cases and establish documentation procedures documenting deaths and disappearances in the drug war has proved difficult , because police agencies , especially at the state level , are often weak or corrupt and thorough investigations are rare in none of the 250 cases human rights watch found have there been any convictions mr calder n s government had compiled a list of 25 , 000 people reported missing in the past six years , but government officials and human rights groups have said it is incomplete and flawed among other problems , the list fails to distinguish how many were eventually found or how many people left by choice , though human rights watch said it nevertheless suggests the scale of the problem of disappearances an interior ministry official told reporters wednesday that the list would soon be released , though a version of it had been leaked to news organizations and a human rights group in december tallying the dead at the hands of organized criminal groups has also been challenging , with inconsistent criteria to determine whether a homicide is related to the fight against and among organized crime and drug gangs nevertheless , miguel ngel osorio chong , the interior secretary , recently told a radio program that 70 , 000 people died in the drug war in the past six years , while acknowledging the information was incomplete mr calder n , constitutionally limited to one , sixyear term , stepped down dec 1 and is now a fellow at harvard university s kennedy school of government his office did not respond to a request for comment
sometime this summer , in odessa , tex , the summit power group plans to break ground on a 25 billion coal gasification power plant summit has named this the texas clean energy project with good reason part of the promise of this power plant is its use of gasified coal because the gasification process doesn t burn the coal , it makes for far cleaner energy than a traditional coalfired plant but another reason this plant and a handful of similar plants has such enormous potential is that it will capture some 90 percent of the facility s already reduced carbon emissions some of those carbon emissions will be used to make fertilizer the rest will be sold to the oil industry , which will push it into the ground , as part of a process called enhanced oil recovery  let us count the potential benefits if plants like this became commonplace currently , some 40 percent of carbon emissions come from power plants the carboncapture process summit will employ is the only technology that can reduce co 2 emissions from existing , stationary sources by up to 90 percent , said judi greenwald of the center for climate and energy solutions to put it another way , this technology could be a climatesaver second environmentalists could call off their war against the coal industry , thus saving tens of thousands of jobs , as climatedestroying coalfired plants were replaced by clean coal gasification plants third gasfired power plants , which already emit 50 percent less carbon than coalfired plants , could become even cleaner if they included the carboncapture technology fourth using carbon emissions to recover previously ungettable oil has the potential to unlock vast untapped american reserves last year , exxonmobil reported that enhanced oil recovery would allow it to extend the life of a single oil field in west texas by 20 years fifth china too often , american environmentalists ignore the reality that the chinese are far more concerned with economic growth than climate change \( and who can blame them \? all they want is what we already have \) the chinese are relentlessly building coalfired power plants , which western environmentalists couldn t stop even if they tried but if power plants like summit s which will turn co 2 into profitable products were to gain momentum , that would likely catch china s attention a reduction of carbon emissions from chinese power plants would do far more to help reverse climate change than dare i say it \? blocking the keystone xl oil pipeline the summit executive most closely associated with the texas clean energy project is laura miller her environmental credentials are unimpeachable as the mayor of dallas in 2006 , miller founded the texas clean air cities coalition to fight a plan by txu energy , a big power company , to build 11 new coalfired plants during a trip to europe , she saw both coal gasification and carboncapture technologies being used when she left the mayor s office , she signed up with summit and became a passionate advocate of the odessa plant eric redman , the president and chief executive of summit power , describes her as the public face of the project \( as a young man , by the way , redman wrote one of the classic works about congress , the dance of legislation it s still worth reading \) so who could possibly be against coal gasification and carbon capture \? ratepayers , for one , mainly because carboncapture technology is so expensive in 2011 , american electric power , or aep , canceled a big carboncapture project , in part because it was clear that state regulators were not going to allow the company to pass on the additional costs to its customers to help make the project economically viable , the texas clean energy project is getting a 450 million grant from the department of energy \( absurdly , the internal revenue service is requiring summit to pay taxes on the federal grant , which means that a third of it will go right back to the government \) but if the plant proves successful as i believe it will and others replicate it , the costs will inevitably come down , and federal help won t likely be needed and the other opponent \? none other than bill mckibben , mr stop keystone himself when i emailed him to ask whether he supported carboncapture for enhanced oil recovery , he replied that if carbon were sent back into the ground the worst possible thing to do with it is to get more oil above ground he continued , it s time to keep oil in the earth , not to mention gas and coal to me , at least , his answer suggests that his crusade has blinded him to the real problem the enemy is not fossil fuels it is the damage that is done because of the way we use fossil fuels if we can find a way to create clean energy from fossil fuels , then they can become \( as they used to say \) part of the solution instead of part of the problem thankfully , laura miller and eric redman understand that , even if bill mckibben doesn t
the death of frank r lautenberg on monday has left gov chris christie of new jersey with the kind of opportunity that politicians usually covet the chance to give away a seat in the united states senate but the decision is fraught with pitfalls , none bigger than having to choose between improving his party s fortunes in washington and furthering his own political ambitions at home mr christie , a republican , is up for reelection in november and hoping to secure a huge victory margin , which he could then use to accelerate his drive to present himself as a presidential candidate with broad appeal even in a blue state but adding a special election for the senate seat to the ballot could put mayor cory a booker of newark at the top of the democratic ticket , potentially energizing more democrats , who already outnumber republicans in new jersey by 700 , 000 registered voters , to come to the polls the implications extend beyond new jersey to washington , where both parties are maneuvering for strategic advantage in a senate where even a single vote can derail legislation the appointment of a republican as the interim replacement for mr lautenberg , a democrat , would create immediate complications for the white house and democrats on capitol hill as they try to push through presidential nominations and an overhaul of immigration laws under the constant threat of republican filibuster mr lautenberg , a steadfast liberal who was new jersey s longest serving senator and the nation s oldest senator , died of complications from pneumonia in manhattan he was 89 and had already announced he would not run for reelection next year mr christie , whose popularity soared after hurricane sandy , is so eager to avoid appearing on the same ballot as mr booker , according to republican insiders , that he is considering two alternatives to a november election for mr lautenberg s successor each carries a potential political cost , and the dispute could easily be challenged in court the option that is being pushed by many in mr christie s own party would be to name a republican to hold the seat and then delay an election on a replacement until 2014 this would give his national party an unexpected gift a reliable vote in the senate for a year and a half , at least from a state that has not elected a republican to the upper house in 41 years but it would also open mr christie up to allegations of sidestepping the electoral process the alternative , lawyers in both parties said , would be for mr christie to set a primary election as early as august , which would mean a special election in october this would leave democrats in a stronger position to win the seat mr booker , in particular , benefits from a high national profile and strong fundraising , though he would be quite likely to face a primary challenge but it would also open mr christie to accusations that he was wasting some 24 million in taxpayer money by holding those two extra elections ahead of the regular november balloting for selfinterested political reasons he also risks alienating republican donors , whom he needs to woo mr lautenberg s death came a few days before mr christie is to attend a meeting of some of the biggest republican fundraisers , some of whom believe that mr christie s embrace of president obama after the hurricane damaged their party s nominee , mitt romney there are probably 49 other governors who would love to be in the position that chris christie is in right now , said brigid callahan harrison , a professor and seasoned observer of new jersey politics at montclair state university but it really presents him with a pandora s box of political choices the high stakes pose a new test for mr christie , who over the last year has made perhaps the most finely tuned calibration between the two parties of any politician in america after building a reputation as one of the nation s most visible and popular republicans , he has won praise and support from democrats across his state with his criticism of his own party and his praise for mr obama in the aftermath of the hurricane some democrats said they believed mr christie could see his support among democrats and independents erode if he appointed a republican to hold the seat beyond november i seriously doubt he would want to have to deal with a lawsuit in his own election year , especially a lawsuit that he might lose , said one senior democratic official who requested anonymity in order to not be seen as antagonizing the governor the coming days are most likely to be dominated by speculation as to whom mr christie will appoint to the seat but strategists in both parties agreed the more pressing question for now was when the election would be set the list of potential candidates is long , but holds few obvious choices two of the most recent republican candidates for senate were both moderate state senators joseph m kyrillos , who was badly beaten by senator robert menendez last year , and thomas m kean jr , who lost a closer race against mr menendez in 2006 dick zimmer , a former united states congressman , lost to mr lautenberg in 2008 mr christie could also choose his lieutenant governor , kim guadagno , or from among the republican members of congress , including the social conservatives frank a lobiondo and chris h smith , or the moderates rodney p frelinghuysen and leonard j lance another option would be to appoint a placeholder candidate who would not seek election to the seat , like former gov thomas h kean sr , who remains one of the state s most popular political figures but conservatives are already pushing mr christie to select a candidate who could then run as a credible opponent to mr booker or another democrat if nothing changes , the election this year will feature mr christie at the top of the republican ticket and barbara buono , a state senator from middlesex county who is struggling to raise money and name recognition , as the democratic standardbearer for governor republicans believe that mr christie s popularity he is far ahead in the polls would provide a significant advantage in turning out voters for lowerlevel races , including the entire state legislature and many county and local seats on the democratic side , mr booker , 44 , a twoterm mayor of newark , had already announced his intention to run for the senate seat next year representative frank j pallone jr , 61 , an 11term congressman from long branch with a large campaign war chest , has expressed interest in running against mr booker in a primary contest \( if the governor does not call a special primary election , the state democratic committee could decide the party s nominee for a november election to the senate seat \) even as politicians from both parties released statements praising mr lautenberg , the machinations over his seat threatened to overshadow his death so important was his reliably liberal vote that democratic leaders asked him twice in recent weeks to return to washington to vote despite his failing health just last month , mr lautenberg made a special trip to the capitol to supply a crucial vote that prevented mr obama s nominee to lead the environmental protection agency from being stalled indefinitely in committee republicans were threatening to boycott the vote to deny democrats a quorum mr lautenberg agreed to come to provide the quorum in another memorable instance in april , his aides helped push him out onto the senate floor in his wheelchair to cast muchneeded yes votes for a package of guncontrol legislation , a cause he had long supported though the bills were ultimately defeated in a republicanled filibuster , his presence that day served as a reminder of how the majority leader , senator harry reid of nevada , must scrape for almost every vote the last thing senator reid can afford right now is to lose a reliable democratic vote in a highly partisan senate , said jim manley , a former adviser to the majority leader who served in the senate when the illnesses of edward m kennedy and robert c byrd caused problems for democrats , who controlled even fewer seats he s got a better margin to play with when he did back when senator byrd and senator kennedy were sick , mr manley added but the fact of the matter is it s tough to lose a reliable democratic vote right now mr christie s appointee will arrive in the senate as the body prepares to tackle some of the most significant domestic policy issues in years immigration is foremost it will move to the senate floor next week with any significant matter that the senate takes up these days , the threat of a filibuster all but requires the support of 60 senators , the threshold at which a filibuster can be broken though republicans and democrats who support an overhaul to the country s immigration laws agree that the plan stands a good chance of passing , they have been counting every head , leaving nothing to chance losing a vote is more troublesome in another issue that has drawn both parties into a bitter feud republican threats to filibuster several of mr obama s nominees for cabinetlevel positions and the federal judiciary but where a single vote could matter the most to mr reid is in his plan to ram through changes to the senate s filibuster rules so republicans are much more limited in how they can block the president s cabinet and judicial nominees
beirut , lebanon the video was undeniably silly a 20minute mockumentary about a fictional martial arts school in dubai , in the united arab emirates , where grandmaster saloom snake trains combatants to throw sandals , strike with the thin ropes of an arab headdress and summon help on twitter for fights that never actually occur but the authorities in the united arab emirates were not amused in april , the police arrested five men who participated in the video , including an american citizen , shezanne cassim , 29 , and threw them in jail , where they have been awaiting trial for eight months on charges of threatening national security the case has worried american officials and baffled the defendants' families , who say the video merely pokes fun at emirati youth who imitate foreign films and rap videos but the men have faced a legal process set up for grave crimes rights groups say the case is only the most recent example of the extreme sensitivity of persian gulf monarchies to the power of social media as a forum for critical and uncontrollable social and political discourse satire , especially of the political variety spread on social media , is treated as subversive a number of persian gulf countries have laws against socalled cybercrimes , and in recent years a string of people have been jailed for content posted online but the case is also the latest instance of foreigners in dubai a city of extremes , with hardpartying clubs and conservative emirati norms getting entangled in the legal system for acts that might seem ordinary in the west , like public drinking or kissing in july , after a showing an emirati man hitting an indian van driver spread rapidly , the police arrested the emirati as well as the man who posted the video because he had shared images of a potential crime the case over the martial arts video is likely to embarrass the united arab emirates at a time when the country is advertising itself as an international destination for culture last week , dubai won the bid to host the world expo in 2020 under the slogan connecting minds , creating the future , after a lengthy campaign  sheikh mohammed bin rashid almaktoum , the ruler of dubai , that the expo would breathe new life into the ancient role of the middle east as a melting pot for cultures and creativity on friday , the dubai international film festival begins , with cate blanchett and martin sheen among the critics say that jailing residents for online expression contradicts that message of openness dubai s business model relies on it being able to project an image of progressiveness and stability , and hosting expos and film festivals all fits into this , said nicholas mcgeehan , persian gulf researcher for human rights watch but cases likes this seriously undermine that image and reveal it to be nothing more than a public relations artifice emirati officials did not respond to requests for comment the case has only become public recently , after the family members of mr cassim , the american citizen , decided that their efforts to navigate the emirati justice system had done them little good there seems to be no end in sight , said mr cassim s brother , shervon , who spent nearly three months in the emirates trying to secure his brother s release in a telephone interview from his home in north carolina , mr cassim said his brother s detention had become a bitter end to his family s decadesold relationship with the emirates his parents emigrated from sri lanka to dubai in 1976 because it was a land of opportunity where you could go and make your fortune , he said his mother worked for an airline and his father became an advertising executive , part of the large group of expatriates that helped expand the city from a desert backwater into the hypermodern crop of skyscrapers , malls and upscale hotels that it is today shezanne cassim s two siblings were born there and all three were educated in british private schools , where they had close friends from the emirates and many other countries , his brother said we were so happy to see dubai boom and we have so much affection for the city and its people , and yet this is how the authorities treat my brother , he said the family moved to the united states in the early 2000s and became citizens but shezanne cassim returned to dubai after graduating from the university of minnesota in 2006 to do business development for a subsidiary of emirates airline , his brother said three weeks before his arrest , he started a consulting job with pricewaterhousecoopers in his free time , mr cassim and his friends made spoofing aspects of dubai life the videos start with a do n't try this at home warning , then show mr cassim doing things he says are not done in dubai , like changing lanes on the highway to let faster drivers pass and cleaning up after yourself at mcdonalds in one video , he wears deodorant on public transit , implying that other riders do not in october 2012 , was posted online , in which a portly grandmaster in a striped robe explains the united arab emirates' key weapons the sandal , the rope from an arab headdress and the twitter in april , after the video had logged thousands of views , the police detained mr cassim and four others who appear in the video they were later put on trial for national security violations that include endangering public order emirati commentators , none of whom wanted to be named in connection with a national security case , guessed that the authorities objected to the video s stereotyping of emiratis or thought it implied that the country had gangs one suggested that the police cracked down to prevent a snowball effect of similar videos in the future the case recalls the fate of the sudanese rapper dangour , who was arrested in the emirates in june 2011 and jailed for two years after he posted a video of himself rapping about drugs and violence but not all such indiscretions are punished one month before dangour s arrest , the emirates welcomed the american rapper snoop dogg , who to deliver an expletivefilled show the verdict in mr cassim s case was expected in september , but it has been delayed numerous times his family says that he is being held in a desert prison outside abu dhabi with the other four defendants and that he has not been allowed to meet privately with his defense lawyer a state department official said that the united states was troubled by the prolonged incarceration of mr cassim and that american diplomats were working with their counterparts in the united arab emirates to to urge a fair and expedient trial and judgment mr cassim s next hearing is scheduled for dec 16
the aids epidemic in america is rapidly becoming concentrated among poor , young black and hispanic men who have sex with men despite years of progress in preventing and treating hiv in the middle class , the number of new infections nationwide remains stubbornly stuck at 50 , 000 a year more and more of them in these men , who make up less than 1 percent of the population giselle , a homeless 23yearold transgender woman with cafeaulait skin , could be called the new face of the epidemic i tested positive about a year ago , said giselle , who was born male but now has a girlish hair spout , wears a tshirt tight across a feminine chest and identifies herself as a woman i do n't know how , exactly i was homeless i was escorting i 've been raped yes , i use condoms , she added but i'm not going to lie i slip sometimes trust me everyone here who says , i always use condoms' \? they do n't always besides transgender people like giselle , the affected group includes men who are openly gay , secretly gay or bisexual , and those who consider themselves heterosexual but have had sex with men , willingly or unwillingly , in shelters or prison or for money \( most of those interviewed for this article spoke on the condition that only their first names be used \) nationally , 25 percent of new infections are in black and hispanic men , and in new york city it is 45 percent , according to the centers for disease control and prevention and the city s health department nationally , when only men under 25 infected through gay sex are counted , 80 percent are black or hispanic even though they engage in less highrisk behavior than their white peers the prospects for change look grim critics say little is being done to save this group , and none of it with any great urgency there was n't even an ad campaign aimed at young black men until last year what s that about \? said krishna stone , a spokeswoman for gmhc , which was founded in the 1980s as the gay men s health crisis phill wilson , president of the in los angeles , said there were no models out there right now for reaching these men federal and state health officials agreed that it had taken years to shift prevention messages away from targets chosen 30 years ago men who frequent gay bars , many of whom are white and middleclass , and heterosexual teenagers , who are at relatively low risk funding for health agencies has been flat , and there has been little political pressure to focus on young gay blacks and hispanics reaching those men is the holy grail , and we 're working on it , said dr jonathan mermin , director of hiv prevention at the cdc his agency created its campaign the one ms stone referred to and has granted millions of dollars to local health departments and community groups to pay for testing but he could not name a city or state with proven success in lowering infection rates in young gay minority men with more resources , we could make bigger strides , he said gay black youths are hard to reach , experts say few are out to their families many live in places where gays are stigmatized and cannot afford to move few attend schools with gay pride clubs or gay guidance counselors when we talked about hiv in sex ed , the class started freaking out , said alex , 20 , who was born in st croix but raised in new york one guy said , we ai n't no faggots why do we have to learn this stuff \?

first day wandering around new york last year , he was propositioned by an older homeless man and by an older transgender person the homeless man later admitted that he was infected , and added if you sit here long enough , you 're going to get some propositions and that s where you 're going to sleep tonight it happened to me , and it s going to happen to you kwame said he had sex that night with a man he met at a gay services center , where he had gone in search of emergency housing i wore a condom , he said i did it sort of out of guilt , or pity it s how i was raised i did n't want him to think i thought less of him also , i needed someplace to stay according to a major cdcled study , a malemale sex act for a young black american is eight times as likely to end in hiv infection as it is for his white peers that is true even though , on average , black youths in the study took fewer risks than their white peers they had fewer partners , engaged in fewer acts of sex while drunk or high , and used condoms more often they had other risk factors lacking health insurance , they were less likely to have seen doctors regularly and more likely to have syphilis , which creates a path for hiv but the crucial factor was that more of their partners were older black men , who are much more likely to have untreated hiv than older white men among the poor , untreated or inadequately treated hiv is the norm , not the exception , said perry n halkitis , a professor of psychology and public health at new york university according to , 79 percent of hivinfected black men who have sex with men and 74 percent of hispanics are not virally suppressed , meaning they can transmit the infection , either because they are not yet on antiretroviral drugs or are not taking them daily giselle admitted to sometimes skipping days the medicine gets you sick , she said it messes up your mental state or it can be freezing and i'm sweating missed doses let the virus rebound , sometimes in drugresistant strains , experts said other risk factors include depression and fatalism in a by the national youth pride services , an advocacy organization for gay black youths , more than half of the young gay black people questioned said they feared their friends or families would disown them if they came out as gay , and about 4 in 10 said they had contemplated suicide over being gay the image of a black gay man almost does n't exist , said shariff gibbons , 25 , who works with other young men at gmhc in the black community , the image that gay men are sissies' is amped up a billion times and we all have an aunt who goes to church and says , being gay is wrong' that makes young men hide roderick , 22 , said his aunt , who took him in after his parents were arrested on drug charges , became furious after he told her at age 15 that he was gay later he attended a small new jersey university and studied to be a veterinarian but when his aunt learned that he was dating a white man , she demanded that he return home and go to a local community college she and his cousins called him an oreo and even viler names , he said it got to where i felt i was going to snap , and kill myself or kill them i did n't want to do either , so one night i took my cousin s bike and i left , and took a train to new york i'm just basically dead to my family now in new york , he found

washington chuck hagel , president obama s nominee for secretary of defense , is perceived to have an iran problem and this week he has started to deal with it over the course of a dozen years as a senator from nebraska , mr hagel voted against unilateral economic sanctions against iran , and had warned , sensibly to many in the obama administration , that you cannot push the iranians into a corner where they ca n't get out'' his role in the obama administration s strategy of coercive diplomacy with iran , however , will be to convince tehran that there is no getting out of the corner no chance they can seal off the strait of hormuz or threaten israel or saudi arabia officials made it clear on thursday that mr hagel was sounding more hawkish on iran after four days of meetings at the pentagon , which were intended to bring him up to speed whether that shift is based in a change of view , an effort to get in sync with administration policy or an intention to preempt questions in the senate was not certain but one senior administration official familiar with the transition effort said that mr hagel believes that his public record found in his statements and his writings has been mischaracterized'' senator hagel believes in engagement , but he is not soft on iran , the official added , after mr hagel had met with the current defense secretary , leon e panetta , who has had his own challenges staying on the administration s message on iran in a transition office inside the pentagon , where he can receive classified briefings , mr hagel has also met with the deputy secretary , ashton b carter , a former harvard professor who officials say has indicated he is willing to remain in place , and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , gen martin e dempsey , along with several other senior military officers and civilian policy officials none of these officials are strangers to mr hagel in mr obama s first term , he served on mr panetta s defense policy board and was cochairman of the president s intelligence advisory board like other nominees , mr hagel is not speaking in public pending his confirmation hearing but officials said mr hagel has also been using the days since his nomination to telephone congressional leaders of both parties in advance of the hearing , expected shortly after mr obama s inaugration the officials said iran has been a topic of some of those conversations i 've known chuck hagel for a long time , mr panetta said during a pentagon news conference on thursday i think a lot of the criticisms that are being made right now are unfair he said , in these confirmation battles , there are a lot of charges that 'll be out there there 'll be a lot of criticism that are out there but ultimately , the truth prevails and i think the truth in this case will mean that he 'll be confirmed the confirmation battle is likely to focus as well on mr hagel s comments on israel where he has at times questioned whether the israeli government is acting in the country s own longterm selfinterest on iran , before his nomination , mr hagel often sounded like mr obama in 2008 and early 2009 , when the administration argued for engagement'' with a country that the united states had barely communicated with in three decades the united states should open a new strategic direction in usiran relations by seeking direct , comprehensive and unconditional talks with the government of iran , including opening a us interest section in tehran , '' he said at the brookings institution in 2008 , in a speech that gave mr obama s own statements some republican cover we must avoid backing ourselves into a military conflict with iran that need not happen , but it can be a selffulfilling prophecy'' mr obama still talks of engagement , but he has focused more on pressure the economic sanctions now in place against iran are far tougher than any during the bush administration , and they include the kind of unilateral sanctions barring banks and companies that do business with iran from also doing business in the united states that mr hagel once opposed there is covert pressure , most notably the cyber campaign against the country , codenamed olympic games , ' that went on for years in his confirmation hearing , mr hagel will almost certainly use the muchworn phrase that all options are on the table , '' a line he included in an oped in the washington post in september that is a way of conveying a willingness to use military force but he has also written that iran needs to be presented with a grand bargain to solve the nuclear standoff let them think about the substantial carrots of improved relations , not just the sticks , and there may be a deal to be had , '' he wrote in a 2008 book , as he was preparing to leave the senate quietly , the administration is debating how many of those carrots to put on the table but to make them work , mr hagel may be given the job of convincing the iranians that despite his familiar views that a military strike could prove disastrous , he is willing to conduct one if diplomacy fails
reminders of the glory days of fordham football are everywhere the famed seven blocks of granite are honored with a monument erected in 2008 vince lombardi , a guard on that unit and later a renowned coach , will forever be celebrated as a towering figure in the university s history one does not expect a return of the golden years of the 1930s , when fordham defeated national powers before capacity crowds at yankee stadium and at the polo grounds but none of that is keeping this from being a special time as the rams earned their programrecord 12th victory on saturday , 3727 against sacred heart , in the first football championship subdivision playoff game at jack coffey field in the bronx the sweetness of the moment was not lost on joe moorhead , the rams' secondyear coach he inherited a 110 program and oversaw a 65 turnaround that built momentum for this year s 121 breakthrough entering next saturday s game at towson in the round of 16 it seems like every week this season we 've remarked that this is our best win or this is something that has n't been done in fordham football history , moorhead said that was correct on two more counts today this is the first time we 've had 12 wins , and this is the first time we 've had an fcs win at home it s a credit to these young men , to their dedication and their persistence on a weekly basis to do what is necessary to win football games the rams set program records for points \( 460 \) and total yards \( 6 , 252 \) this season they continued to roll in their first postseason appearance since 2007 , outgaining potent sacred heart in yards , 539414 , and converting four turnovers into 20 points mark nofri , who guided the pioneers to a 103 record and their first fcs postseason game in his first full season , noted that his team had a plus22 turnover differential as the northeast conference champion we 've been on the plus side of the turnover battle all year , nofri said that s how we won games when we lost , we were on the minus side keshaudas spence , a bullish 230pound running back for sacred heart , carried 25 times for 197 yards and typically required a swarm of tacklers to bring him down he could not look past his two fumbles , though we definitely could have pulled away with a win , spence said we shot ourselves in the foot opponents have little margin for error when opposing michael nebrich , a junior quarterback who transferred to fordham from connecticut when moorhead left as the huskies' offensive coordinator to take over as coach of the rams nebrich converted 32 of 51 passes for 413 yards his three touchdown passes all came as fordham built a 3117 halftime advantage he also rushed for 38 yards fordham s offense cannot be stopped , he said , when it executes at a high level we 've shown it and proved it , nebrich said we 're not going to fear any defense we face , especially towson fordham used its rapidfire attack to run 48 plays for 348 yards in the opening half nebrich looked machinelike at times in completing 22 of 32 attempts for 306 yards in the half he was intercepted when a firstquarter screen pass slipped out of his gloved hand for fordham s lone turnover , which proved harmless nebrich connected with tebucky jones jr , son of a former nfl safety , for a 32yard catch and run that put fordham ahead , 107 , with 6 minutes 23 seconds left in the opening quarter he kept his hot hand with a pair of secondquarter touchdown throws a 19yard strike to sam ajalana , a junior wide receiver , and a 3yard toss to carlton koonce , a senior running back the touchdowns from jones and ajalana allowed the rams to capitalize on the fumbles by spence ajalana created fordham s largest advantage , 247 , when he reached the end zone at 1 38 of the second quarter ajalana , a junior , finished with seven receptions and led all receivers with 128 yards the rams converted all five of their chances in the red zone it means everything , koonce said of a playoff victory that seemed unthinkable only a couple of years ago as a senior , you never want it to end we 'll battle for another week and look forward to towson
\( top stop \) over the last decade , bachata has been a monopoly , or , at best , an oligopoly aventura , the onetime bronx boy band , effectively conquered the genre in the early 2000s , updating this dominican romantic folk form with contemporary hiphop attitude it s held tight to the throne , even after the frontman , romeo santos , pursued a solo career , and two other members formed vena , a group with a new singer it s been difficult for young singers to break through , but prince royce , a minor leaguer down to his name , cut through in 2010 with a bachata cover of ben e king s stand by me choosing this surefire classic as an introduction was smart , a nod to the wide age range of bachata s fans , and also its commitment to classic pop song structure three years later prince royce is the genre s titan the team that orchestrated his ascent , the executive producers sergio george and gregory elias , is now trying a second round with leslie grace , a female singer in a genre that has lately had very little room for women , if any at all ms grace s bachata rollout began with a slick version of the shirelles' will you still love me tomorrow \? that traveled between spanish and english , pop and bachata her amiable selftitled album also has a cover of the ronettes' be my baby same shtick both , though , suffer from mostly characterless singing , as if out of extreme deference to the source material in 2009 , ms grace released an allovertheplace album , pasi n ballads , latin rock , club music , none of it sticking the new album is more coherent , even if ms grace has a sultry voice that the genre does n't always support on no me arrepiento , she leans heavily into rb inflections , and she sounds strongest on odio no odiarte , one of the most traditional songs but as they did not do with prince royce s album , the minders are hedging their bets here there are take me away , a benign club song , and no te rindas , a slightly less benign club song one of the most striking moments is adi s coraz n , a big , brassy midtempo diane warren ballad that gives ms grace another direction to try , should bachata s glass ceiling remain unbroken \( blue note \) the first word in the title of live today , derrick hodge s adroitly designed debut album , is intended as a verb , which makes the phrase an imperative this becomes obvious on , thanks to some beatific free association from the rapper common but it s also clear enough in context mr hodge , a bassist with roots in gospel , jazz and rb , comes bearing earnest intentions and a glow of transparent optimism if you know his name , you probably know the robert glasper experiment , a modernday that counts him as a core member you may know his work with common , or with the trumpeter terence blanchard there s a slim chance you also know his leading role in the band that toured behind the rb heartthrob maxwell a few years ago anyway , live today can feel like the triangulation of all these data points it s an album of clear convictions but hazy definitions , which is partly the point beyond the essential bedrock of groove , and the earthy authority of mr hodge s electric bass playing , you wo n't find a single throughline there are bouncy tracks made only with the drummer mark colenburg and the trumpeter keyon harrold , multitracked into a chorus there s a love song performed by the singersongwriter alan hampton with a string quartet there s a version of the doxology , featuring the organist travis sayles , who makes no attempt to drag it outside the church another track with mr sayles , message of hope , has the gleam of a popfusion tune by marcus miller like mr miller , another bassist and melodist with broad musical tastes , mr hodge has an interest in film scoring , and there are moments here especially on solitude and dances with ancestors that call for a moving image another way to put it is that mr hodge , who will perform at the in manhattan on tuesday , has made a cinematic world of his own \( motown gospel \) it could be argued that modern africanamerican gospel is both the narrowest and broadest music in america the overall sound and narrative of new gospel records are so similar often recorded live or partly live with a congregation , with an almost established set of tones on guitar , drums and keyboards , all suggesting charisma there are a choir and an organ there s sermonizing there s an emphasis on repetition , steady upward key modulation and long , extravagant vocal runs and yet the best of this music takes in so much of what american pop is or has been for the last 20 years or so gospel consumes everything to appeal to anyone not everyone , but anyone tye tribbett , 34 , is a hyperenergetic singer , songwriter , keyboardist and choir director from the philadelphia area , and greater than , his new album and his first for motown gospel , is a pretty typical record heard from a distance but mr tribbett is an exceptional gospel artist , and hearing it from a distance is the wrong idea you want to follow it closely , because its songs are righteously carnivalesque , overstuffed in amazing ways one after another , they 're obsessively episodic , full of parts they might include highimpact vamps with crashing cymbals and distorted guitars bits of heavy funk , disco , country ballads , the most featherweight rb variations on rihanna and new electronic dance music pieces of pop songwriting possibly inspired by sting , sam cooke , bruno mars , stevie wonder or parliament funkadelic the nineandahalfminute he turned it includes a minorkey waltz , a bridge interpolating the vengaboys' eurohouse hit we like to party and a fast twobeat stomp like a praisebreak section in a service when its elements sound like pop , they do n't act like it time is n't compressed , and the gestures have time to stretch out each part stays for a serious while , investing heavily in you mr tribbett cues the choir , preaches , maintains the energy in the house , sings lead and plies his little repeated signatures everybody dance now and a squeaky , highpitched scream though he s a strong enough singer that he does n't need them they 're not necessary but this record is never concerned with what s necessary it gives you too much of everything , brightly and generously \( he 'll perform on thursday night at marcus garvey park in harlem , in a double bill with tasha cobbs details at \)

seattle andy pettitte has enjoyed many special moments at the pinnacle of his profession he has pitched 13 times in the world series , been a 21game winner , ridden on five parade floats and , best of all , celebrated the birth of four children who later rampaged around yankees clubhouses for the better part of the last two decades then , on saturday , pettitte s family and business life fused in the visitors' clubhouse at safeco field with a hug of mutual congratulations in the eighth inning of a game that would end with over the seattle mariners and the 250th of his career , pettitte emerged from the showers after shaving he had pitched supremely well once more , and now the ball was in the hands of the bullpen , anchored by mariano rivera , pettitte s teammate for 18 years , who had previously closed out 70 of his wins as the 40yearold pettitte walked into the middle of the clubhouse , his 18yearold son , josh , was just getting off the phone with damon oppenheimer , the yankees' scouting director josh informed his father that the yankees had selected josh in the 37th round of major league baseball s amateur draft , nearly 23 years to the day after the yankees selected his father out of the same high school , deer park , in texas the pettittes hugged , and the father kissed his son , who is still likely to turn down the yankees and stick to his commitment to attend baylor in the fall as a righthanded pitcher still , the honor of being drafted by the yankees minutes after such a big win for his father made for an unforgettable moment it s a good day for the pettittes , i guess , josh said his father stood to the side and watched as his son was interviewed by new york reporters later , asked which event made him happier , andy pettitte chose the drafting of his son after all , winning games in the major leagues is something he has being doing since 1995 , when he and rivera were rookies in the year after josh was born it s all tied in together now for me , though , pettitte said i ca n't separate them because they are both together it all happened right here as the game was ending , so it was just really cool a total of 250 victories for a pitcher is not considered a magical number in baseball like 300 wins or 3 , 000 hits it wo n't guarantee enshrinement in the hall of fame , is n't worthy of an hbo special and does n't warrant membership in one of the sport s elite clubs but it is still a remarkable feat , one that went unattained by some of the game s most accomplished pitchers , like whitey ford , juan marichal , pedro martinez and sandy koufax pettitte \( 53 \) won with a command performance in his 501st start he set down the first nine batters he faced and later set down 10 in a row he went seven and a third innings and limited the mariners to one run and three hits , striking out six and walking none rivera closed out the game by striking out the side for his 22nd save , the 630th of his career and his 71st in a pettitte victory , a record for any startercloser tandem rivera , who has known josh since the young man was an infant , also reveled in the moment i have the same joy he has , rivera said pettitte improved his career record to 250145 , including 37 wins with the houston astros , and passed vic willis on the career wins list his next victory will draw him into a tie with the hall of famer bob gibson pettitte was already one of only seven pitchers to reach at least 249 wins by his 500th start since the advent of expansion in 1962 that lists includes some of the best pitchers in the modern era , like jim palmer , tom seaver , greg maddux , randy johnson , roger clemens and ferguson jenkins pettitte also has 19 wins in the postseason , his first coming on oct 9 , 1996 , about a month before josh s second birthday both pettittes said that josh would turn down the yankees' offer so he could pitch in college the plan is for him to reenter the draft after his junior season , meaning another team could draft him but imagine this situation the yankees' drafting the young pettitte while his father is still pitching , which means josh could be around to hug his father if he joined the 300win club oh , my goodness , andy pettitte said in his most drawnout texas accent that s not going to happen then again , when he earned his first win on june 7 , 1995 , five years after the yankees took him as a lefthanded pitcher in the 22nd round , few would have predicted 249 more
zaghouan , tunisia hayet saadi says the trouble with her son aymen began more than a year ago , when he was just 16 he started attending the mosque five times a day , she said then he began talking of jihad , and of going to syria to join the rebels fighting the government of president bashar alassad in march , he skipped his high school exams and left home finally , on oct 30 , ms saadi came home to find the police surrounding her house a suicide bomber had blown himself up in sousse , a seaside resort about an hour s drive south another was caught before he could detonate his payload the police confiscated the family s computers and phones , and her husband spent the rest of the day at the police station he called her later from there yes , it is your child , he told her aymen is now in prison in the weeks since the attack , aymen s trajectory from promising student to potential suicide bomber has shaken tunisia , where the islamist government has recently shown moderation by striking a compromise with its secular opponents homegrown suicide attacks , previously unheardof here , are the latest sign of spreading radicalization among young people in a country that has become fertile ground for islamist groups recruiting fighters for the conflicts convulsing the region for now , jihadist violence in tunisia is on a low boil , with two political assassinations and 30 members of the security forces killed this year but there is growing concern that hundreds of young volunteers have been recruited through a widening network of hardline salafist mosques and then trained to fight in syria , with the potential to return home to cause more trouble , as aymen and his companion did even if just 200 come back , that could cause real problems , said mehdi taje , the director of global prospect intelligence and a specialist on north africa and syria is not the only place radicalized tunisians have gone to fight they have also been found with jihadist groups in algeria , iraq , libya and mali there is a precedent next door algerians who went to afghanistan in the 1980s to fight soviet forces returned to fuel an islamic movement and then a civil war at home that killed about 200 , 000 in the 1990s twenty years later algeria is still dealing with insurgents , who have retreated into the desert the tunisian police and army officials have warned of signs that islamist insurgents may be laying the groundwork for an armed insurgency in their own country , which lies between algeria and lawless libya since tunisia began the arab spring almost three years ago by ousting its longtime dictator , zine elabidine ben ali , who had forcibly secularized the country , fundamentalist salafist groups have sprouted in almost every town they draw thousands of young men and women to their mosques , where they recruit volunteers ostensibly for missionary work in tunisia , but also for jihad some began vigilante attacks , including an in september 2012 on the united states embassy in tunis , days after the fatal on the american mission in benghazi , libya in the spring , armed groups also appeared in the hills bordering algeria , apparently remnants of insurgents retreating from the french intervention in mali tunisia s top general , rachid ammar , warned in a television interview in june that militant islamists lodged in the mountains on tunisia s western border were training quasimilitary units and were set on overthrowing the tunisian state and setting up islamic rule this is not terrorism , it s a rebellion , warned the general , who has since retired this is one of the stages of rebellion the surge in youthful salafist followers like aymen was also evidence of a popular social movement the salafist mosques provide open spaces for inquiring youth who are lured by charismatic preachers offering a stirring mix of camaraderie and talk of holy war and selfsacrifice in the name of god although most salafists insist their activity is focused on educational and humanitarian causes , it is clear from dozens of interviews with families of the recruits , analysts and government officials that a growing number of young men are being drawn into militancy in august , the government outlawed one salafist group , , as a terrorist threat led by men who fought in iraq and afghanistan many of them released from prison since the start of the arab spring the group has recruited criminals and smugglers , and it has also drawn many young recruits into its ranks , security officials say the islamist government originally tried to woo the salafists to its side , but as violence increased it began a crackdown aimed primarily at ansar alshariah the police say that since may they have smashed several cells of the group , detained 300 people suspected of being members , and killed or arrested its main military leaders in october , six friends who were members were killed in a clash with security forces south of tunis we hit them very hard , mohammed ali aroui , an interior ministry spokesman , said in an interview ansar alshariah is in the past now , you do n't see their signs or slogans or tents anywhere the group s leader , seifallah ben hassine , known as abu ayadh , is thought to have escaped to libya , he said under pressure , ansar alshariah members have retreated underground , but recruiting for jihad continues , by ansar alshariah and other groups , through mosques and religious associations the volunteers are organized by a network of facilitators who supply money , cars and safe houses in various towns the recruits travel mostly through libya , where they receive military training in camps in and around benghazi from there they fly to turkey , which is the main access point for rebels entering syria the tunisian police have set up border controls to stop anyone under 35 suspected of traveling for jihad but tunisia s borders remain porous , as fighters and weapons cross to and from libya ms saadi says her son seems to have taken that route aymen , now 17 , first tried to go to syria in march when he left home , she said , but the police stopped him at one border check in august , he took off again and was gone for over two months aymen s plan was always to go fight in syria , but in libya some jihadists ordered the two bombers to go back to tunisia , his mother said his mother learned of her son s account from one of his prison wardens the libyan jihadists , whose faces were masked , told the two youths that it was not the time to go to syria the fight is in tunisia right now , we want to create an emirate there , they said when the two youths showed some reluctance , the masked men insisted , saying they had no one else for the job government officials confirmed the account from the time aymen started attending mosque regularly , it took barely 18 months until he was caught trying to blow himself up among a group of tourists at the tomb of habib bourguiba , the tunisian postindependence leader , in the town of monastir his parents , a teacher at a primary school and an agricultural engineer , had hoped he would follow his older brother to university he was good at math his mother did not blame the mosque for leading him astray none of his school friends wanted to go to syria , she added she blamed other strangers , older men and sheikhs with cars , for influencing her son it is a shame to call a young man a terrorist , she said of her son i see that he is a victim , and the real big terrorists are still roaming on the streets and young men like my son can be influenced
oakland , calif as the innings flickered by thursday , heads drooped in the outfield , shadows lengthened , and the stands slowly thinned out , as did the bullpens one by one a stream of relatively unknown pitchers jogged in from the bullpens to help prolong a game that defied closure for more than five hours the two stubborn teams played on , hour after hour , pitcher after pitcher , until finally , in the bottom of the 18th inning , the greatest relief pitcher of them all entered the fray five hours and thirtyfive minutes after the first pitch of the game was thrown at coliseum , mariano rivera , the 14th pitcher of the day , threw the 510th it shattered nate freiman s bat , but the ball blooped safely into left field john jaso jogged home from third base , and the poured out of the dugout to celebrate a memorable 32 victory that seemed to sap the life out of the  that was a difficult one , said vernon wells , one of several yankees to go hitless in a game in which they stranded 11 runners in extra innings alone and finished 10 for 60 as a team , with 15 strikeouts the yankees scored two runs in the first inning on a home run by robinson cano but did not score in the next 17 mark teixeira \( 0 for 5 \) , travis hafner \( 0 for 8 \) , kevin youkilis \( 0 for 7 \) and wells \( 0 for 8 \) each struck out three times we 've got to do better than that , teixeira said that s a nohitter for all of us the yankees did get exceptional pitching , from starter hiroki kuroda to adam warren , who entered in the 11th and threw six scoreless innings even rivera , who gave up two hits and an intentional walk without recording an out , broke two bats the team s defense was good , too wells , despite his offensive struggles , made a great throw home in the 15th inning to prevent what would have been the winning run , and catcher chris stewart held on after he was bowled over stewart rolled on his back after the play before hopping up and heading for the dugout at first it appeared he had been injured and was in need of immediate treatment but as he sheepishly explained later , he thought it was the third out of the inning it was the second i was concerned about that , manager joe girardi said but at least he went to the right dugout preston claiborne , who replaced warren before the 17th , got the first out of the 18th and then gave up a single to jaso rivera , who had warmed up several times in case of a save situation , was summoned with the score still tied , 22 seth smith singled into shallow left field , and jaso went to third rivera walked jed lowrie intentionally to load the bases , and then freiman singled to left that s the game of baseball , rivera said , shrugging sometimes they hit a line drive right to someone it s a give and take the game was the yankees' longest of the year and was the first time since sept 11 , 1988 , that the yankees had played at least 18 innings several of the yankees particularly warren , who threw 85 pitches , and stewart , who caught 255 will be unavailable for at least the next game , in anaheim , so the team seemed to need to make a couple of roster moves before friday s game to get fresh arms and legs on the roster if it was a test of endurance for the players , the game was also demanding for the umpires three of them , including the homeplate umpire , c b bucknor , called a 16inning game in seattle on june 5 with the win , the a s completed a series sweep and extended their domination over the yankees here to seven straight games , a streak dating to last year the seven losses are the yankees' most in a row here since they lost 10 straight from 1989 to 1991 the a s , who won a 19inning game earlier this season , became the first american league team since the 1971 washington senators to play two games of at least 18 innings in the same year stewart said that his glove hand was fine after catching all those pitches but that the rest of his body was starting to wear down his legs were fine through 14 innings , he said , but around the 15th or 16th , he started to feel their weight dragging him down by that point you 're just running on fumes , he said , trying to get the game over and help the team win after issuing an intentional walk to cano in the 14th , though , a s reliever jesse chavez set down the next 13 batters he faced , five by strikeout the last guy that threw was the best we faced all day , teixeira said and he did not even enter the game until the 13th inning
all of them witches let s say that you 're within the segment of the population prepared to greet the new black sabbath album with an excitement girded by skepticism , and maybe some mortification what you need is all of them witches \( rune grammofon \) , the new release by the hedvig mollestad trio led by the youngish guitar shredder hedvig mollestad thomassen , with ellen brekken on bass and ivar loe bjornstad on drums , this is a norwegian band that , unless it s the other way around the album , in any case , gives you darkchurning , a touch of wildness , and traces of doom metal and stoner rock , without ever sounding retro it also gives you a loose concept , with song titles that reach for the homeric \( achilles and sing , goddess \) , the biblical \( the new judas \) and the babylonian \( code of hammurabi \) the guitar playing is explosive but focused , and the cohesion within the band is unshakable however dense or spaced out this music gets , there s no question that it sounds alive for the love of abbey a jazz pianist of broad expertise , especially in the realm of rhythm , marc cary spent a good part of his early career apprenticed to powerful singers none more so than , with whom he played for a dozen years on for the love of abbey \( mot ma \) , due out on tuesday , he honors her legacy with soulful austerity and stoic introspection , which seems fitting it s his first solo piano album , devoted almost entirely to lincoln s songs , which tend to be hailed more for lyrical than melodic reasons mr cary , 46 , takes his time with them , giving down here below the proper air of rippling deliberation , and turning should 've been into a gospel dirge he locks more into a groove with and a reflective original , for moseka , that evokes the africanized jazz aesthetic of randy weston throughout the album mr cary s touch has weight and resonance , and his liberties are strategic it s clear that he has lyrics in mind , though he also savors strictly musical details , like the part of another world that cops the famous intervallic series from close encounters of the third kind boss of the plains dave rempis , a saxophonist with a busy profile in chicago s thriving experimental jazz scene , recently started his own label , aerophonic records , to claim firmer control of his output his first two releases , due out on tuesday , are phalanx , a double live album by his concussive rempis percussion quartet and boss of the plains , featuring wheelhouse , a chamberlike trio with the vibraphonist jason adasiewicz and the bassist nate mcbride phalanx packs the stronger wallop , but it brings nothing new to our understanding of mr rempis the wheelhouse album , on the other hand , unfolds as a series of small epiphanies it s the overdue debut release of a band that formed eight years ago , and has had mr adasiewicz , with his ghostly overtones and lightly clanking effects , provides the sonic glue but all three members of the group are thinking critically about timbre and silence , and mr rempis , playing baritone as well as alto saxophone , deploys a slippery narrative logic city of asylum the performance to write home about at this year s winter jazzfest was a freely improvised set by the bassist eric revis , the pianist kris davis and the drummer andrew cyrille musicians of intrepid poise , city of asylum \( clean feed \) offers a comparable experience mr revis , who has earned a reputation for hardswinging brio in the branford marsalis quartet , works here with mystery and indirection mr cyrille , an avantgarde eminence in his 70s , and ms davis , an ascendant talent in her 30s , explore a language largely defined by common touchstones , like the pianists cecil taylor and andrew hill the album has three proper compositions a slinky revis original \( question \) , a thelonious monk tune \( gallop s gallop \) and a hymn by keith jarrett \( prayer \) but its lifeblood is the uncharted territory , spread across seven tracks that cohere as a whole what that material reveals is the quality of the listening among the players , an abstract ideal made nearly tangible azure a similar spirit flows through azure , by the pianist marilyn crispell and the bassist gary peacock , due out on tuesday on ecm recorded in upstate new york , where they both live , it s a conversational study with an implied commitment to parity it features the same number of compositions by each player , along with a few spontaneous inventions the results are often starkly beautiful , with the sort of contemplative glow that only maturity seems to provide along with an interest in meditation , mr peacock , 78 , and ms crispell , 66 , share a tradition of duologue with other partners their documented history together involves a trio with the drummer paul motian if you know that trio , it can be hard to absorb azure without feeling a hunger pang for motian s alert and rustling presence especially since the album was recorded early in 2011 , more than six months before he died mr peacock and ms crispell probably feel this ache keenly themselves i heard great things about their contribution to a motian tribute this spring , which bodes well for their concert
london after the lives lost and the exhausted treasure , what was it all for \? that question is being asked here and in kabul as british troops , like their more numerous american counterparts , prepare to relinquish combat duties in next year after a tenure that appears to have achieved few of the goals set by their political masters in march 2002 , committed 1 , 700 soldiers to join american forces in what was portrayed as little more than rooting out the remnants of taliban and qaeda forces after the americanled invasion six months earlier the logic was that if the streets of britain were to be kept safe , then terrorism s distant havens had to be dismantled but that brief early deployment did not shield britain from the more immediate menace of homegrown terrorism on july 7 , 2005 , four suicide bombers killed themselves and 52 travelers on the london transit system none of them had ties to afghanistan by 2009 , the official mantra was the same , but the geographic reach had been redefined mission creep had raised the number of british soldiers to 9 , 000 the border areas between afghanistan and pakistan , said gordon brown , the prime minister then , were the crucible of global terrorism threatening the streets of britain in late 2013 , a new statistic has entered the calculations of loss 444 british military personnel dead the single most potent figure fueling the outrage expressed by many in britain when hamid karzai , the president of afghanistan , told the bbc last week that the entire nato exercise had been pointless the years of combat caused afghanistan a lot of suffering and a lot of loss of life and no gains because the country is not secure , he said , adding i am not happy to say there is partial security because that is not what we 're seeking what we wanted was absolute security and a clear cut war against terrorism cpl tom neathway , a briton who lost both legs and his left arm to a taliban boobytrap five years ago , said of mr karzai i think he s stupid to say that we may not be out there for the right reasons who knows \? but comments like mr karzai s , the corporal said , make a soldier just wonder whose side he is fighting on the resentments draw on a long history of interventions and invasion that left british imperial armies bloodied from kandahar , afghanistan , the 19th century to kut , iraq , in world war i then , as now , the imperative to mold farflung events collided with resistance but the precedents did not deter tony blair as prime minister from joining the united states as a junior partner in fighting in both countries , only to discover that history could not simply be rewritten when the invaders tired of the fray and wished to go home iraq is now seized with some of its bloodiest , sectarian violence since the darkest days of the americanled occupation afghanistan is threatened with internecine bloodletting the moment western forces withdraw next year while politicians and generals conspire to declare the campaign a success , the columnist simon tisdall wrote in the guardian , karzai s comments are a salutary reminder that all is far from well in afghanistan and things could turn very messy , very soon according to the web site icasualtiesorg , 2 , 287 american troops have been killed there since 2002 the coalition losses amount to far fewer than the thousands of civilian deaths tallied by the united nations , which blames insurgents for threequarters of noncombatant fatalities but , arguably the most troubling legacy is that the avowed target of the afghan campaign jihadism has simply dissipated to reform elsewhere , in somalia , yemen , the desert hideouts of north africa and the newest killing fields of syria most worrisome to the counterterrorism authorities here , scores of britons who have joined the battle against president bashar alassad may now return home , even as the afghan war winds down without the clearcut outcome invoked by mr karzai some specialists depict the shift of focus as the most ominous in a decade syria is a very profound game changer , said charles farr , who heads the office for security and counter terrorism , and the significance of it is still emerging

whenever you see a piece suggesting that the us economy has entered a new normal of slow growth , you re likely to see someone making the argument that if the economy actually had lots of excess capacity , we should be seeing deflation and the question of why we don t have deflation is a good one it is , however , a question that people like me have answered repeatedly unfortunately , it seems that this analysis hasn t been making it to , say , a number of current and former fed officials so here s a restatement of what we think we know longtime readers will find this familiar , but as a number of commenters have wisely pointed out , there are a lot of people reading this blog now who weren t reading it a year or two ago \( we re adding twitter followers at around 20 , 000 a month , which is some indication of the number of newbies \) ok , first things first back when the crisis started , i did expect to see deflation , japanese style , if it went on for an extended period i was wrong and i did what you re supposed to do \( but far too people actually do \) when they re wrong , which is to look for an explanation of your error that is consistent with the available evidence one immediate thing to look at was to see whether what was happening to inflation in the united states was consistent with historical experience of deep slumps that we know involved the economy operating well below capacity for an extended period and it turned out that the japanese deflation \( which has never been very fast in any case \) is pretty much unique the imf looked at protracted large output gaps plogs and found that in general inflation gets squeezed toward , but not below , zero and our own history actually points in the same direction the 1930s were marked by sharp deflation in the early years , but considerable inflation as the economy partially recovered , even though unemployment remained very high so inflation seems sticky but why \? one immediate thought was that we might be looking at the effects of downward nominal wage rigidity employers are very reluctant to engage in actual wage cuts way back in 1996 akerlof , dickens and perry suggested that this would make inflation stubborn at low rates , breaking the usual link between high unemployment and disinflation still , how can you tell if sticky inflation reflects sticky wages , as opposed to being the result of an economy that really doesn t have very much slack \? the answer is that sticky wages should leave a signature in the wage data a large number of workers whose wages neither rise nor fall , and a rising number of such workers as the economy slumps sure enough , researchers at the san franciso fed found exactly that actually , once you start looking for it , downward nominal rigidity is everywhere for example , catherine rampell had a great piece pointing out that starting salaries at elite law firms have been frozen at precisely 160 , 000 for years the bottom line is that we have a lot of evidence suggesting that the failure of deflation to materialize reflects wage rigidity , not absence of economic slack and it is therefore frustrating to see supposedly wellinformed people talk about this issue as if none of that work had been done
olympia , wash the cold war may have ended , but in the vietnamese community here in washington state , the muscle memory persists aging refugees who lived through the vietnam war and the fall of saigon in 1975 , many of them scarred by the experience , have not forgotten , nor forgiven even now , an accusation of sympathy with the communist government real or imagined can shatter a reputation or settle a score that is apparently what happened in the case of , according to the washington supreme court , in a civil defamation case that has offered a rare glimpse into the gutpunching , passionate inner life of vietnamese america tensions and worries about free speech have surged in recent days all over the nation amid the controversy over federal monitoring of telephone and internet traffic for national security and many of those anxieties are heightened in immigrant communities , especially those from the middle east , where the terminology of religious extremism can raise red flags here in olympia , the combatants were men of spare build and thinning hair one was accused of being a communist , the other of being a slanderer both worked for the south vietnamese government or military both became leaders in local groups that strove to keep vietnamese language and tradition alive in western washington but starting about a decade ago , mr le , who is 78 , said he became convinced that mr tan , 69 , was a secret sympathizer with the communists in their birth country he eventually went public with his assertions , which were published in the vietnamese press and spread through social media some elements of the proof mr le cited might sound comical to outsiders a cooking apron used at a community fair , for example , was produced at the trial showing a jolly , capwearing figure that mr le said was a clear representation of ho chi minh , the communist leader , but which mr tan said was in fact none other than santa claus a musician brought in by mr tan for a function struck up the first bars of the national anthem of modern vietnam , before awkwardly stopping and resuming with what people had expected to hear the south vietnamese anthem , theme song of a country that no longer exists conspiracy , mr le said accident , said mr tan mr tan ultimately sued in 2004 for defamation , itself a rare occurrence in vietnameseamerican communities , where disputes are usually hashed out internally a civil court jury found mr le and his coauthors liable an appeals court overturned that verdict , but then last month washington s highest court restored the jury s original finding , and the 310 , 000 award to mr tan and the vietnamese community of thurston county , a civic group mr le s lawyers have asked the court to reconsider but the scorchedearth battle has already changed the community , residents said a vietnamese language school , which mr tan once led as principal , shrank in the aftermath of the controversy from 120 students a decade ago to about 60 now , the current principal said large gatherings once common for cultural celebration in the olympia area , like the new year , have faded or stopped entirely in the last few years we are trying to avoid additional conflict , or labeling , said hiep tran , 50 , a transportation analyst for the state mai vu , 55 , said she became convinced in the 1970s , after a few years in america , that rallies and demonstrations were futile in ridding vietnam of the communists but now , she said , she feels a concern that not being seen as anticommunist enough could invite attack when we do n't go out in the street and denounce and say , down with the communists , ' then we are communist sympathizers , she said that s the trouble that i see , and i have a problem with that mr tan said an interview here in his lawyer s office \( where mr tran and ms vu were also interviewed , invited by mr tan and his family to speak about the community \) that he is not a communist , and that the very idea is insulting speaking through an interpreter , he said he believed the accusations by mr le arose over a personal dispute about leadership of a civic committee i believe it was a personal disagreement , a personal vendetta , mr tan said mr le , in an interview in his daughter s house in nearby lacey , remained adamant , too he spoke the truth , he said , and regrets nothing we need to speak up , because what brings us here is freedom of speech , mr le said , sitting in a living room where the yellow and red stripe flag of south vietnam fluttered at the entryway beside a united states flag , near a portrait of president ronald reagan charges of communist collaboration or sympathy sometimes accompanied by violence and even killings tore apart many vietnamese enclaves in america in the years after the war and the tough , nuanced personal choices of the period still resonate mr tan , according to the court record , signed a loyalty oath to the communist government to secure his release from a reeducation camp before fleeing the country in 1978 but the war generation s political passions no longer dominate the way they did , said jeffrey brody , a professor of communications at california state university , fullerton , who has for many years for many of the children and grandchildren of refugees , he said , acceptance of the current vietnamese government s right to exist , though rarely an applause line , has at least become a legitimate debating point the younger generation is much more politically tolerant of free speech , he said mr le , who spent more than nine years in a communist labor camp after the war , testified at the trial that people who lived through the takeover have a different perspective about communism , and an understanding about communist methods that american courts and jurors could probably never really grasp one justice on the state supreme court , james m johnson , agreed in a sharply worded dissenting opinion , he called the majority s ruling a miscarriage of justice for mr le and all those who have risked everything to enjoy the protections of the united states constitution he added the respondents' experiences with communism are most certainly relevant to this analysis mr le , in the interview , scoffed at the idea , however , that vietnamese communists are out to take over or undermine america the effort , he said , is all about image and control , fostering good opinion about the government in the diaspora among refugees and their children
we americans , we are an insular people a european suggested that i might like isabelle geffroy , and when i looked up her performances i discovered that she has a huge multinational following but none of my usual music sources here had even heard of her by the way , if you want to know what this song is about , beats me translated , the lyrics read like a parody of the subtitles to an old french art film and you know what \? who cares \? awesome
new delhi in the chandni chowk area of north delhi , a dilapidated mansion built in 1923 houses a governmentrun primary school every day , raj kumar , 42 , a contractor , transports boxed free lunches to the school earlier this week , he opened a container to show out how it was still half full look how much food went to waste today , he said these children have been eating less since they heard about the deaths in bihar that day , the children in new delhi had received a meal of chickpeas and semolina pudding as per the menu set by the government department that administers the school lunch program the food was prepared in a central kitchen run by a nongovernmental organization , unlike in bihar , where the meal that killed 23 children last week was prepared inside the school complex the principal of the school was arrested wednesday by the police around one million children are fed through the midday meal program in delhi the free lunch program , which covers nearly 120 million schoolchildren across the country , aims to tackle malnutrition and encourage school attendance the chandni chowk school has 60 students from grades 1 through 5 the school principal and his staff have been trying to reassure the students that the food served to them is not contaminated we taste the food first before serving it to the children , said s p sharma , the school principal the seal of the packed food containers is opened in front of mr sharma he said the children were served in dishes that they bring from their homes after the children are served , the food supplier returns the leftovers to the central kitchen the children are fed fresh food every day , mr sharma said the food served at mr sharma s school is prepared by stri shakti , a nongovernmental organization , which runs a central kitchen out of a compound in the nangloi area of west delhi , around 19 miles away the organization runs five kitchens that daily prepare lunch for around 300 , 000 children enrolled in government schools of new delhi we have been doing this for almost 10 years in delhi , said saravjeet kaur , who is a director with stri shakti , which also operates centralized kitchens to feed schoolchildren in other cities , including mumbai , ahmedabad and chandigarh mrs kaur watched over the kitchen staff from her office through a monitor connected to a camera in the kitchen in a 1 , 500squarefoot kitchen , a staff of 80 people , including 50 women , works two shifts to meet the daily demands of preparing the food that fills nearly 950 steel containers , which are sealed with plastic tape before being loaded onto vehicles the staff starts as early as 7 am to prepare the first round of meals for students enrolled in regular school , who are supposed to receive their free lunch at 10 30 am the afternoon batch is fed at 2 30 pm men and women go about their routine tasks in the kitchen wearing uniforms , which include a bandanna and a separate pair of slippers , the only footwear allowed inside the kitchen men wore brown loose pants with a shirt , and women were dressed in a redcheckered salwar kameez , traditional indian attire on this particular day , a fresh batch of rice had just been unloaded onto an aluminum tray from a rice cooker that can handle up to 330 pounds of rice approximately 5 , 000 kilograms are cooked on a day when rice is on the menu most of the food in the kitchen is steam cooked , a more economical and safer mode of cooking , said gurcharan singh , a manager at stri shakti two gargantuan steam boilers fitted outside were connected to 13 cookers through pipes that ran across the roof of the kitchen huge cauldrons sat empty in a corner , which are used as a backup when food needs to be cooked on stoves a woman and two men handled rice with a ladle and packed it into clean steel containers none of them wore gloves during the process mr singh explained that the governmentauthorized agency , which conducts regular inspections in the kitchen , had advised against the use of gloves the steamheavy operations causes the temperature in the kitchen to soar , he said , and plastic disposable gloves could make hands sweaty , increasing the chances that sweat could drip into cooked food in another section of the kitchen , women were cleaning the dishes through a threefold process first , the dirty dishes were washed with water , then dipped into a basin filled with soap and finally drowned into another basin of water treated with potassium permanganate , before setting the utensils aside to dry the kitchen floor looked clean , with one woman mopping it religiously the level of hygiene maintained in a centralized kitchen seems to be more of a personal choice as there are no strict government standards for cleanliness however , a sample of the food from the kitchen is tested in a governmentauthorized laboratory five times a month , mrs kaur said most of the staff at stri shakti is recruited from the neighboring areas the nongovernmental agency has formed selfhelp groups comprising 10 women each , who divvy up the daily tasks in the kitchen each group earns approximately 30 , 000 rupees , or 504 , at the end of a month the daily supplies of wheat and rice in the kitchen come from the government , but all the other ingredients including the lentils , cooking oil , potatoes \( for the only vegetablebased preparation in the menu \) and condiments are bought by them from the open market the government pays 3 rupees and 11paisa \( 5 us cents \) to the nongovernmental agencies for every child they feed according to the nutritional requirements set by the government every child is supposed to gain 450 calories from a meal that should include 1215 grams of protein as well a ricebased lunch is about 250 grams and a wheatbased one has to be 200 grams uma sharma , 35 , a kitchen supervisor , works from 7 am until 6 pm every day she has been with the organization for five years i love to ensure that kids get clean food , she said yet there have been days when the supplies from the government have been late or the quality of the grains has been poor we pay from our own pocket when the government does not provide the food supplies on time , mrs kaur said until 2003 the government schools in delhi offered only dry food like roasted chickpeas and biscuits to schoolchildren , she said , but even the current meals provided by the government are not nutritious enough the government needs to provide more money so that more nutrition can be given to children , she added i have two children of my own who studied in a boarding school , and when they would complain about food being served in their hostel , i didn t like it , she said this job is my way of making up for it she emphasized the need to improve the existing conditions in schools , which include clean drinking water and to impart better lessons in health and hygiene to schoolchildren if they don t get clean utensils from home , what can we do

while we wait to find out if russia s offer that we can t refuse will miraculously defuse the syrian crisis or somehow turn into a deal designed to fall apart , i thought i would highlight this interview with andrew bacevich \( via rod dreher at the american conservative \) , which i found helpful in clarifying why , despite noninterventionist sympathies , i m not sold on the foreign policy perspective that undergirds the more intellectuallyrigorous opposition to any us involvement in syria here s bacevich , one of the most distinguished of the dissidentconservative critics of the iraq war , explaining what he thinks has gone wrong with american efforts in the middle east i mean , if i could have five minutes of the president s time , i d say , mr president , the issue really is not syria i mean , you re being told that it s syria you re being told you have to do something about syria , that you have to make a decision about syria that somehow your credibility is on the line but i d say , mr president , that s not true the issue really here is whether or not an effort over the course of several decades , dating back to the promulgation of the carter doctrine in 1980 , an effort that extends over several decades to employ american power , military power , overt , covert military power exercise through proxies , an effort to use military power to somehow stabilize or fix or liberate or transform the greater middle east hasn t worked and if you think back to 1980 , and just sort of tick off the number of military enterprises that we have been engaged in that part of the world , large and small , you know , beirut , afghanistan , iraq , yemen , somalia , and on and on , and ask yourself , what have we got done \? what have we achieved \? is the region becoming more stable \? is it becoming more democratic \? are we enhancing america s standing in the eyes of the people of the islamic world \? the answers are , no , no , and no so why , mr president , do you think that initiating yet another war , cause if we bomb syria , it s a war , why do you think that initiating yet another war in this protracted enterprise is going to produce a different outcome \? wouldn t it be perhaps wise to ask ourselves if this militarized approach to the region maybe is a fool s errand i agree with bacevich about some of the specific military enterprises cited , but as an indictment of thirty years of american strategy his case leaves me distinctly unconvinced when i think back to 1980 and the context in which jimmy carter set the stage for an expanded us military presence in and around the persian gulf , it seems like the united states had four obvious , interrelated interests in the middle east preventing soviet domination , preventing the arabisraeli conflict from consuming the region , keeping the region s oil resources in the hands of relatively friendly governments , and avoiding a wave of fundamentalist coups against those same regimes none of these were madeup anxieties , all of them touched on clear national interests , and we had the examples of three major arabisraeli wars in a quarter century , the oil embargo and oil shocks of the 1970s and the iranian revolution of the 1979 as illustrations of precisely the kind of outcomes that we wanted to avoid and over the next two decades , as american military involvement in the levant and the persian gulf deepened , none of those outcomes were repeated obviously other crises erupted instead the iraniraq war , the first intifada , the invasion of kuwait but from the vantage point of the year 2000 , twenty years after the carter doctrine , there was a credible case that the 1970s were by far the worst decade for our interests in the region , that from the end of carter s presidency through the clinton era american power often was a stabilizing influence in the middle east , and that overall our military involvement in the region did , in fact , serve the national interest fairly well our relationships with israel and egypt clearly helped cool arabisraeli tensions , and our involvement in israelipalestinian negotiations eventually brought the two sides tantalizingly close to an actual deal our policy toward saddam hussein s iraq supplying covert assistance to his regime during the iraniraq war when iran had gained the upper hand , and then turning against hussein less than a decade later when he tried to annex kuwait did not exactly leave us with clean hands , but in balanceofpower terms it was fairly effective at preventing the emergence of a hostile regional hegemon in first tehran and then in baghdad our relationship to saudi arabia and the other gulf states was compromising in various ways , but given the experience of the early 1970s , the postcarter stabilization in global oil prices was not an achievement to be taken lightly and where our attempts at regional peacekeeping did overreach , as in lebanon in the early 1980s , we managed to pull back without disastrous or destabilizing consequences now one can look at 9 11 and everything after and interpret this relatively effective run as nothing more than a prologue to disaster during the runup the iraq war , that s how many hawks argued , insisting that the 9 11 attacks proved that mere stability could no longer be our middle eastern goal postiraq , it s an argument that you hear more often from doves of the left and right , who join with bacevich in interpreting both the 2001 attacks and the iraq quagmire as the bitter fruit of decades of corrupt entanglements but i don t think this is a fair way to judge a grand strategy every approach to world affairs creates unexpected new problems even as it tries to solve old ones that s just the nature of policymaking in a fallen world 9 11 did not prove that america should have never made allies in riyadh and cairo it just proved that unforeseen tragedies can flow from policies designed to solve an earlier , equallypressing set of problems the iraq war did not prove that the carter doctrine was an act of hubris it proved that invading and seeking to democratize iraq was an act of hubris , and that the quest for a relatively stable , usfriendly persian gulf region was better pursued by less grandiose and costly means the fact that the postarab spring middle east is unstable today in ways that make our reaganera and clintonera approaches seem obsolete does not prove those approaches were misguided at the time it just proves that what worked decently in one generation can t always be sustained into the next when it comes to what the united states should be doing in this era s middle east , i see a lot of wisdom in the antiinterventionist idea that we have more to gain by letting some of the region s ongoing conflicts shi a versus sunni , assad versus islamists , egypt s generals versus the muslim brotherhood play themselves out rather than pushing money and arms hither and yon in pursuit of an illusory sense of mastery \( and i see even more wisdom in the specific goal of avoiding any kind of iraqstyle occupation for the next , oh , 471 years or so \) but this idea gets less convincing when it s folded into a broader claim that american military alliances and guarantees and interventions have only led to blowback and disaster in the last thirty years , and that our entire strategic approach to the middle east has just been a long rolling hyperbellicose fiasco ever since the carter doctrine this is a caricature of a more complicated picture , and it s an argument that makes antiinterventionism seem less like a realitybased answer to the ideological crusading of a samantha power or a paul wolfowitz , and more like a rigidly ideological gloss on history in its own right
el reno , okla it takes imagination to picture the as it used to be hundreds of adults and teenagers packed the classrooms at the vocational education campus here in the daytime and evenings , studying the art of welding , cosmetology and graphic design and learning to fix airplanes and cars by working on actual airplanes and cars on sunday , the center and other parts of this suburb west of oklahoma city , the campus was a wreck peeledoff sections of roof , shattered glass on the floor and empty spaces where walls once stood an 18 , 000pound windmill blade that had been donated to the school and tied down with steel cables was picked up by the high winds and tossed into the day care center one of the airplanes used in instruction was upsidedown in debris on a tour of the campus with gov mary fallin and other officials on sunday , the technology center s superintendent , greg winters , made it a point to take her to an area at a corner of the main building he showed her a pile of concreteblock rubble that used to be a hallway next to a few classrooms had the tornado hit in the middle of a busy school day , students would have been taken to that hallway to seek shelter but the twister struck on friday evening , when there were only a handful of students and employees on campus and the day care center was empty they were taken instead to an underground classroom none of the 15 adult students and staff members were injured the campus provided another lesson for state and local officials about the value of underground shelters or safe rooms at oklahoma schools more than a week earlier , a far more powerful tornado than the one in el reno , south of oklahoma city , destroying plaza towers elementary school and killing seven of its students plaza towers had no underground shelter , and teachers sent students to closets , bathrooms and hallways some have called on officials to make underground shelters or safe rooms mandatory at all oklahoma schools a group of state lawmakers formed a nonprofit organization to raise private money to build or retrofit storm shelters in schools , and more than 30 , 000 people have signed four online petitions on changeorg pressing oklahoma officials to require tornado shelters in schools and day care centers after touring the technology center on sunday , ms fallin said she was going to encourage schools and education centers to look at secured safe rooms in their buildings , adding , they do work mr winters , the superintendent of the threecampus technology center , said he would not build another school without shelters , underground or aboveground , or safe rooms if it was a full school day , 500 , 600 people in the building at that time , that hallway would have been used , he said we 're going to build a new building why do n't we build one that s got multiple safe rooms \? why do n't we build one that we can safely put 500 people in at one time \? when you see the devastation and you see the end result , it clears up for you pretty quick mr winters estimated the damage to the school s four main buildings to be roughly 30 million the storm on friday produced five tornadoes and severe flooding across oklahoma city and its suburbs state officials increased the death toll on monday to 14 five children and nine adults the youngest was a 1yearold boy the oldest of those who have been identified was william rose o'neal , 67 firefighters continued searching monday for several children and adults who sought shelter from the high winds in storm drains but were swept away in the rushing waters a total of 17 people went into the two drains six pulled themselves out and six were found dead by firefighters , including one girl on monday deputy chief marc woodard of the oklahoma city fire department said the chances of any of the missing five being found alive were small it has been an extraordinary two weeks in central oklahoma ten or 11 tornadoes have touched down since may 19 in the oklahoma city region , killing about 40 people and damaging or destroying roughly 4 , 000 homes and businesses thirty counties have had some type of storm damage in recent days president obama called ms fallin on saturday evening to express sympathy and offer federal aid it s been hard to handle this magnitude of disaster throughout the state , but we 'll recover , said ms fallin , whose husband was born in el reno what was unusual about the tornadoes was not their number , but their frequency and relatively tight geographic concentration oklahoma averages 20 tornadoes in may statewide in just two weeks , roughly half that number emerged in one region i think it is safe to say , on a scientific level and a sociological level , for almost a dozen tornadoes to affect the most populated area of the state in a twoweek period is pretty uncommon , said kevin brown , a senior meteorologist with the national weather service in norman , okla they 're usually pretty spread out across the state el reno , a suburb about 30 miles west of downtown oklahoma city , experienced the most powerful of the five tornadoes that struck the region on friday the town has green pastures and a wideopen feel every week , thousands of cattle would come in and out of the okc west livestock market for auctions , but the market was severely damaged in the storm the market s restaurant , gilmore s kitchen , had no walls and no roof the storm did not spare moore state officials said 13 schools that were not damaged in the tornado on may 20 had water and roof damage on friday
hanover , nh a couple of months ago , jama internal medicine , a journal of the american medical association , published the findings of a brief online survey of middleaged americansmost had previously been screened for either breast or prostate cancer but the study found that about half said they would not choose to start screening if the test resulted in more than one overtreated person per one cancer death averted wow that implies that millions of americans might choose not to be screened if they knew the whole story that overtreatment is typically more common than avoiding a cancer death is the survey right \? honestly , i have no idea different surveys get different answers according to surveys , but a number of us like the affordable care act \( another name for the same thing \) and most of us like the bulk of the individual components of the law how you ask the question matters similarly , how americans feel about screening is obviously related to what they are told about screening most of the time they get a simple message it s the most important thing they can do to stay healthy occasionally , they may hear just the opposite it s dangerous the truth is , it s neither instead , it s a close call different people in the same situation can rationally make different choices but first , patients need some quantification of the benefits and harms in a to be published monday , dec 30 in jama internal medicine , a colleague and i attempt to provide that data for women making the choice about screening mammography let s be clear at the outset there is a lot of uncertainty and professional disagreement about what the data are so we provide a range of estimates , from optimistic to pessimistic there is no doubt that screening mammography in the united states leads to a lot of false alarms among a thousand 50yearold american women screened annually for a decade , how many will have at least one false alarm \? our estimate ranges from 490 to 670 the data come from the mammographers themselves the and reflect radiologists who deliver low and high rates of false alarms \( those in the 25th and 75th percentiles \) a screening program that falsely alarms about half the population is outrageous to be sure , many women are quickly reassured by a second test that their breast is normal but others while told they do n't have cancer are told that their breast is somehow abnormal , that they have dysplasia or atypia , that they are at high risk whether you blame the doctors or the system or the malpractice lawyers , it s a problem that needs to be fixed then there is the problem of overdiagnosis the detection of a cancer that was not destined to ever cause problems overdiagnosis is what leads to overtreatment a decade ago doctors debated whether this problem existed in breast cancer now the debate is about how often it occurs in a to help women decide about mammography screening in britain , the national health service now explicitly tells women that their chance of overdiagnosis is about three times higher than their chance of avoiding a breastcancer death i ca n't tell you if that is the right estimate since most everyone who receives a diagnosis of cancer is treated , overdiagnosis is rarely observed directly so it is notoriously difficult to quantify but i can tell you it s in the ballpark our optimistic pessimistic finding is this among a thousand 50yearold american women screened annually for a decade , 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and overtreated what about the benefit \? among those thousand women , 32 to 03 will avoid a breastcancer death if you do n't like decimals , call it 3 to 0 the optimistic estimate reflects the most favorable result of the nine most comprehensive randomized trials of breast cancer screening but these trials were initiated 20 to 50 years ago whether their results are still relevant is a question because of substantial improvements in breast cancer treatment , many cancers that would have been deadly 20 years ago now no longer are the better we are able to treat cancer , the less important it is find it early in other words , there are fewer deaths for screening to help avoid this is what is reflected in the pessimistic estimate one study comparing regions with similar populations and health care systems , but different screening policies \( like sweden versus norway and northern ireland versus the republic of ireland \) , found that breast cancer death rates had declined at similar rates , regardless of when mass screening was adopted so put it all together among a thousand 50yearold american women screened annually for a decade , 32 to 03 will avoid a breast cancer death , 490 to 670 will have at least one false alarm and 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and treated needlessly that may help some women choose whether to be screened or not but it s still not very precise , and it does n't answer the fundamental question now that treatment is so much better , how much benefit does screening actually provide \? what we need is a clinical trial in the current treatment era two randomized trials could begin to answer the central question of mammography interpretation how hard should the radiologist look \? women who view mammography favorably might be willing to be screened under either the current approach or a highthreshold approach meaning their radiologist would ignore small , likely harmless abnormalities found on a mammogramthose who view it less favorably might choose that highthreshold approach \( knowing that the harms of false alarms and overdiagnosis would be minimized \) or forgo mammography completely putting the two trials together , we could finally learn what level of screening minimizes false alarms and overdiagnosis while saving the most lives most experts would say that it s never going to happen it would cost too much , take too long and need too many subjects maybe they are right but maybe not sure , it would cost millions of dollars but that s chicken feed compared with the billions of dollars we spend on breast cancer screening every year sure , it would take 10 to 15 years but it would help our daughters know more sure , it would take tens of thousands of women to participate but maybe they would want to be part of the effort to help sort out the morass surrounding what is one of the most common medical interventions done to american women you never know , until you ask none of this should dissuade women from seeking a diagnosis when they develop a new breast lump \( that s a form of early diagnosis we all agree on \) or from seeking treatment for a diagnosed breast cancer \( better treatment , not early detection , is the real success story in breast cancer \) the uncertainties are about screening women who want to reduce those uncertainties will have to participate in trials
london first , a prominent tory called the party s rank and file swiveleyed loons then the populist politician nigel farage called prime minister david cameron and his toryled government a bunch of college kids then the daily mail called mr farage , the leader of the uk independence party , a pintguzzling eccentric at the heart of all this competitive insulting in the halls of westminster this week was something deadly serious a battle over the future of the fractured , fractious conservative party and its leader , the increasingly fragile prime minister mr cameron had a respite thursday from the negative chatter swirling around him when he appeared outside 10 downing street to denounce the of a british soldier on a london street the attack , he said , will only bring us together and make us stronger the country , maybe but the conservative party itself is in no mood for unity buffeted by criticism of his policy on europe , battered by rebellion in the ranks over his bill to legalize samesex marriage and wounded by the perception that he is supercilious , contemptuous and out of touch with mainstream conservatism , mr cameron earlier this week took the highly unusual step of sending a mass email \( or , as he called it , a personal note \) to his party s grassroots members mr cameron praised what he said were common conservative values like duty , decency and civic pride he said he believed that you change things not by criticizing from your armchair but by getting out and doing and then , in a reference to damaging reports that one of his closest allies had dismissed provincial tories as unhinged \( and crazyeyed \) , he declared that he had nothing but respect for such tories i am proud of what you do , mr cameron wrote and i would never have around me those who sneered or thought otherwise we are a team , from the parish council to the local association to parliament , and i never forget it at a time when mr cameron is being squeezed from both sides from the right by members of his own party and by the antiimmigrant , antieurope uk independence party , and from the left by his liberal democrat coalition partners the move seemed uncharacteristically clunky is it not a bizarre moment when a party leader has to write to his members to say he respects them \? chris bryant , a labour member of parliament ,  indeed , the party does not seem convinced last week , the problem was europe this week , it was samesex marriage when mr cameron said he would introduce legislation to make it legal for samesex couples to marry , the bill seemed like a sure thing , a chance for him to fulfill one of his progressive social policy goals with relative ease but the bill ran into unexpected trouble this week , as more and more tories publicly attacked it , with 129 of them deviating from the party line to vote against it tuesday the bill is likely to become law eventually , but only with help from the labour opposition and only after inflicting substantial wounds on the government with mr cameron already on the back foot after a parade of influential tories declared that britain should hold an immediate referendum on whether to leave the european union instead of waiting , as mr cameron favors other unhappy party members have seized on the chance to air wider criticisms their basic complaint mr cameron is too liberal , too metropolitan , too snobby , too out of touch with what traditional tories , who tend to be older and live outside london , are feeling tim bale , a professor of politics at , and the author of the conservative party from thatcher to cameron , said the prime minister had made a fundamental mistake in trying to impose his socially liberal agenda on members of his party without convincing them of its merits one can make a reasonable argument that the guy is outthatchering thatcher in some ways , dr bale said , referring to the government s austerity spending program and increasingly tough line on immigration , and yet his party still has a problem capitalizing on the restive mood , mr farage , the uk independence party leader , took out an advertisement in the daily telegraph this week inviting unhappy tories to defect in it mr farage sniped that the cameron government made up disproportionately of career politicians who graduated from eton and oxbridge was run by a bunch of college kids , none of whom have ever had a proper job in their lives moreover , he said , these kids are obsessed with wind farms and introducing gay marriage , and happy to open the door to 29 million romanians and bulgarians from january 1 next year \( the last bit was a reference to the lifting in 2014 of restrictions on the movement of bulgarian and romanian citizens through the european union \) london s rightleaning newspapers , which tend to run hot and cold on the prime minister , are veering toward arctic right now the times of london said that mr cameron was weak and lacking in the most basic party management skills the daily mail , which provides a running litany of how the country is going down the tubes , accused the prime minister of sublime incompetence , calling his management of the european union issue a fiasco and his handling of the samesex marriage bill an embarrassment the daily telegraph compared the current situation to that faced by former prime minister john major , whose premiership was buried beneath a mountain of internecine squabbling , mostly over europe and then , from out of right field , came norman tebbit , a former conservative party chairman who tends to speak for a small but steady rightwing minority in the party , dead against samesex marriage in an , mr tebbit imagined a situation in which some future queen is a lesbian who marries another lady and then decides she would like to have a child if someone donates sperm , he continued , and she gives birth to a child , is that child heir to the throne \?

bandrichiwadi , india on the morning of july 23 , shakuntala kirkire , a housewife in bandrachiwadi village in the western state of maharashtra , carried her 10monthold daughter in her arms and walked in rain down the slope of a hill on which her village stands her husband , ajay kirkire , walked close to her , holding up an umbrella to protect their sick child as they tried to reach the governmentrun clinic in a neighboring village a few minutes later , mr and mrs kirkire stopped midway priya , their child , had died she had been born healthy but had lost weight rapidly over the months at the time of her death , priya weighed 45 kilograms \( 10 pounds \) , four kilograms less than what is considered normal for her age doctors listed pneumonia as the cause of her death in government records bandrichiwadi is a picturesque and poor village in the mountainous jawhar area in the district of thane jawhar , about 150 kilometers \( 93 miles \) east of the megacity of mumbai , is home to various tribes , who are among the most marginalized sections of indian society about 87 percent of maharashtra s 1124 million people are tribals , according to the 2011 central government census intense public attention was focused on the area in the early 1990s , when hundreds of children died of malnutrition in 199293 in jawhar and the adjoining mokhada and vikramgarh subdistricts little has changed in the past 20 years in july this year , 12 children under the age of 6 , apart from priya , died there in june , it was 11 children in may , another nine between july 2012 and july 2013 , 80 children died in the jawhar subdistrict the official causes of death , listed in the medical records of the children who died in june , include pneumonia , aphasia and febrile convulsions , which are usually not fatal but the government records also show that the deceased children were malnourished , and more than half were severely malnourished , like priya malnutrition is a precipitating cause , so we speak of deaths that are attributable to malnutrition , victor aguayo , chief of child nutrition and development at unicef india , explained in a recent interview in new delhi in 2011 , the infant mortality rate , expressed as the number of children younger than 1 who died per 1 , 000 live births , was 44 in india , which translates into 119 million infant deaths , according to data collected by the registrar general of india in 2010 the under5 mortality rate stood at 59 , one of the highest in the world a study published by the british charity save the children in 2012 estimated that 183 million indian children die every year before the age of 5 most of the deaths occur from treatable diseases like pneumonia , diarrhea , malaria and complications at birth , the study noted the child may eventually die of a disease , but that disease was lethal because the child was unable to fight back because of malnutrition , mr aguayo said the indian government has not updated its national statistics on nutrition , known as the national family health survey , since 20052006 even its smaller and poorer neighbor , bangladesh , has conducted three such surveys in the past decade india s data from 20052006 showed that 425 percentage of children under the age of 5 were underweight , a measure of acute and chronic malnutrition half a decade after the last national family health survey , the levels of malnutrition remained startlingly high a 2011 hungama survey , carried out through a collaboration between several independent organizations , showed that among the children under 5 in 100 districts of the country that have historically fared poorly on child nutrition indicators , 42 percent are underweight prime minister manmohan singh responded to the findings of the hungama survey by describing malnutrition as a national shame according to the official records at the bandrichiwadi village council office , 25 out of the 42 children under 6 in the village are malnourished a wave of malnutritionrelated deaths in the village is also exacerbated by the lack of pediatricians in rural hospitals we are not pediatricians , said vijay sangle , a doctor at the public hospital where the kirkires had once sought treatment for their child we are not even equipped to diagnose a respiratory infection as pneumonia dr sangle and his colleagues refer most patients to a bigger hospital at jawhar , about 5 kilometers away bandrichiwadi sits atop one of the many hills that rise up on the lush green landscape of jawhar , dotted by small seasonal streams and muddy pathways seeping through the frequent rainfall lends a perpetual mistiness to the upper reaches of hills along the only road that runs from jawhar to the villages , a sturdy surfaced road gives way to a mushy rocky track leading up to bandrichiwadi , on which hardly any motorized vehicles ply passing through are laborers on their way to work and women , some with waterfilled pots on their heads , others with children clinging to them there is no public transport after dusk the night before priya died , the doctors at the village hospital had told the kirkires to take her to the jawhar hospital it was evening , there was no way for us to get there , mrs kirkire recalled no one told us that we could get an ambulance to go there the kirkires are from the varli tribe , which is listed in the indian constitution as a scheduled tribe , groups recognized as historically disadvantaged , isolated from the indian mainstream , which qualifies them for affirmative action policies scheduled tribes make up 86 percent of india s population of 12 billion , according to the 2011 census among tribal populations spread across 10 states in the country , 52 percent of preschool children \( between 15 years \) were underweight , a national nutrition monitoring bureau survey noted in the tribal districts of maharashtra , 64 percent of preschool children were found to be underweight , with 288 percent considered severely underweight the varlis , who are known for their folk art , wall paintings made from rice paste , are mostly either daily wage agricultural laborers or subsistence farmers the root cause of malnutrition is the loss of control over food production and food security , said milind bokil , a sociologist and writer although the kirkires grow rice , millet and finger millet on their 25 hectares of land , the produce is not enough to sustain them throughout the year mr kirkire , like most men in his village , supplements their meager income by working as laborer in the sandmining industry in neighboring districts for most of the year mrs kirkire , like most village women , has to walk three kilometers to get drinking water from a well a photograph of mr and mrs kirkire hung from a wooden pole supporting the roof of their singleroom mud house a broken clock hung by a bamboo pole next to the photograph since their child s death , mr kirkire has been spending his days by roaming aimlessly in the village fields mrs kirkire moved out and has been living in her parents home , about an hour away i cannot bear to be in that house , said mrs kirkire i can still hear the cries of my child mrs kirkire s pain is compounded by the awareness that breast milk was crucial for the health of her child , but she suffered from a condition known as inverted nipples , in which a mother s nipples retract inwards and make it difficult for the baby to suckle mrs kirkire had to feed powdered milk to her child , which cost 300 rupees \( 5 \) for two tins but because they couldn t afford any more tins , the kirkires switched to rice starch our family hardly makes enough to sustain ourselves , said yashwanti kirkire , mr kirkire s mother workers with the governmentsponsored integrated child development scheme place part of the blame on parents in these impoverished tribal areas being inattentive to the needs of their children , but crushing poverty forces most women to leave their young children at home and work in the fields during the agricultural seasons none of the women here sit at home and feed their children for the first six months , said surekha patekar , the program caseworker at bandrichiwadi the common practice is for 5 to 6yearold children to start working with the parents in the fields or stay home to take care of the younger children parents have to go to the fields leaving their child behind there is no other way , ms patekar said they will have nothing to eat otherwise a few meters from the kirkire house

needham , mass four days after the boston marathon bombings , ali tepsurkaev was at work on a construction site on nantucket when his boss approached him to deliver the news the two prime suspects had been identified as ethnic chechens for mr tepsurkaev , 33 , who fled the wars in chechnya more than a decade ago , immediate disbelief turned quickly to fear and despair the violence that had once consumed his homeland had found him again , this time shattering the quiet refuge he had found here in new england i was so upset , i couldn t work , said mr tepsurkaev , who soon left his nantucket home to be with his extended family here in needham , a boston suburb i left my guys i couldn t finish it felt so horrible until a few days ago , most chechens in the united states lived largely anonymous lives few americans even knew what and where chechnya was now , two chechen brothers are at the center of one of the most serious terrorist attacks on the united states since sept 11 , 2001 while the motivations behind the bombings are still unknown , the attack has made chechnya , a mostly muslim region in russia , a focus of american scrutiny , and it has thrust chechens living here into an unwanted spotlight several chechens in the boston area and elsewhere said the attack had left them feeling exposed and embarrassed some worry about being branded terrorists in a country that they credit with offering them sanctuary for most of them , the attacks raised fears that their past was somehow catching up with them hundreds of thousands of people were killed in two vicious wars between russian troops and chechen separatists in the 1990s and early 2000s the wars led to widespread destruction in chechnya and spawned a violent islamist insurgency that created even more misery many chechens fled , taking their traumas and battle scars with them most stayed in europe but a handful , perhaps no more than a thousand , came to the united states , where few expected to see the kind of the indiscriminate slaughter that had engulfed their homeland , particularly an attack committed by fellow chechens mr tepsurkaev , who has a wife and 3yearold daughter , said seeing two chechens held responsible for the boston attack had left him feeling irrational guilt most of us would be dead right now if it wasn t for the united states giving us a home and saving us from all the violence , he said it feels embarrassing for us after all this hospitality we re getting from americans , to hear that some chechen he said , breaking off it s hard it s difficult to explain he spoke with a reporter over tea at his uncle s house across from a playground here in needham , about 10 miles from the bombing suspects home in cambridge he was surrounded by cousins close to the age of dzhokhar tsarnaev , 19 , the younger of the two suspects , who was taken into custody on friday two of the cousins , islam and maryam baiev , are planning to go to college in the fall to pursue careers in medicine they speak english with no accent , but can still banter easily in both chechen and russian i remember them in the dungeon just hiding from the bombs , mr tepsurkaev said of his cousins they ve seen the screaming , they ve seen the blood , but as you see they re getting educated here , trying to get into college and living their lives no hate , no violence they ve seen it , that s why they appreciate it even more but these guys who haven t seen anything , he said about the bombing suspects i have no idea what kind of crazy ideas they have going on in their head the two suspects , dzhokhar tsarnaev and his older brother tamerlan , 26 , lived in dagestan , a region in russia that borders chechnya , and in kyrgyzstan , a former soviet republic that is now independent , before coming to the united states as children but they had never lived in chechnya itself any attempt to make a connection between chechnya and the tsarnaevs , if they were guilty , is futile , ramzan a kadyrov , chechnya s leader , said in a post on instagram they were raised in the united states and their views and convictions formed there the roots of evil must be sought in america none of the chechens interviewed said they had more than a passing knowledge of the tsarnaev brothers , who are accused of killing three people and wounding more than 170 in the bombing at the marathon and then going on a rampage that left one police officer dead and another struggling to survive
you remember , the one with the two franchise quarterbacks at the top , the one that produced a rookie class that may have made more of an immediate impact than any other \? it is time to get over it this draft class does not have franchise quarterbacks at the top in fact , it seems to have precious few franchise anythings offensive tackles are important in a passcentric game , but when the nexus of speculation is which one will go first , well , you know it is a lowglamour year this , then , is the draft of the complementary players , the ones who fill the holes in the roster , but perhaps not the ones on the marquee and because the strength of this class is not in the first few picks , but later in the first round and beyond and because many teams filled some desperate needs with free agents from a flooded and lowcost veteran market it is especially difficult to predict what teams will do when the draft starts thursday night , because so many of them want to trade down the flight of free agents left the jets with many needs an outside linebacker to rush from the edge maybe lsu s and a guard are high on the list but if the jets add another firstround pick in a potential darrelle revis trade , might mark sanchez s eventual successor be on the radar \? the bills have already acquired kevin kolb , but they could also draft a quarterback , perhaps , who played for the new coach doug marrone at syracuse at some point , they have to get a receiver to team with steve johnson and perhaps a guard to replace andy levitre free agency s most active team filled many of its most pressing needs , and with five picks in the first three rounds , miami could also set the draft pace the gaping hole is obvious offensive tackle new england lost out when pittsburgh matched its offer for the restricted freeagent receiver emmanuel sanders so it stands to reason that the patriots will try to find a fieldstretching receiver to join danny amendola in a cast that is going to look different this season but after that , bill belichick can return to the defense , which struggled for much of last season the hyperventilating over the postsuper bowl departures subsided when the ravens filled many of the holes with good freeagent signings they are not desperate for anything , but their needs are inside linebackers , to replace ray lewis and dannell ellerbe , a left tackle and at receiver and did ozzie newsome tip his hand when he told reporters there was a safety the ravens could take in every round \? historically one of the league s best drafting teams , pittsburgh will have to be this year to address a number of needs none are bigger than the one left by james harrison , which makes a new passrushing outside linebacker necessary the steelers' secondary needs to be shored up , too and even though emmanuel sanders will stay this year , the steelers have to get another receiver and a running back with 10 picks , the normally staid bengals could move up to get anybody they want but what do they need \? a safety , an offensive tackle , a linebacker , maybe a wide receiver to join the superb a j green , maybe a running back to eventually supplant benjarvus greenellis one of the most intriguing teams because of all the unknowns cleveland could draft a quarterback if it is not sold on brandon weeden and jason campbell , and it definitely needs a starting cornerback the browns do not have a secondround draft pick they have so many needs that almost any player they take at any position would fill one but after saying goodbye to desmond bryant , richard seymour and tommy kelly , they are most desperate for a defensive tackle and while matt flynn might patch the hole at quarterback , drafting another one seems likely they got their quarterback in alex smith , and with the first overall pick , the chiefs will almost certainly take an offensive tackle , one of the strengths of this class after that , defense should dominate they need a safety and an inside linebacker the most obvious need for the chargers' new regime is a left tackle to protect philip rivers , but picking at no 11 could leave them out of range for the best of this class they also need a nose tackle and plenty of help in the secondary is there anybody in the game who better appreciates how much a running back can help a quarterback than john elway \? so maybe he will draft one , but the broncos have many more defensive needs on the defensive line , which lost at middle linebacker , after keith brooking s departure and throughout the shaky secondary a busy freeagency period filled a lot of holes , but one priority has to be protecting andrew luck , so expect a guard to be taken at some point with dwight freeney gone , a pass rusher could be the first pick of general manager ryan grigson they signed andy levitre , but the titans could take another guard to fix their offensive line after that , improving one of the league s worst pass defenses could prompt the titans to focus on pass rushers , cornerbacks and safeties for a new regime beginning yet another overhaul , the needs are many , but the first question is whether it believes any of the quarterbacks are worthy of the no 2 pick to replace blaine gabbert after that , the jaguars also need an offensive tackle , the secondary is bereft of experience , and the pass rush needs a big upgrade after finishing last in the league in sacks for one of the league s most complete teams , there is a glaring need , a receiver to play opposite andre johnson , and it would be a surprise if the texans did not address it in the first round after that , with connor barwin gone to philadelphia , the texans need another pass rusher , and the right side of the offensive line has to be shored up to limit pressure on matt schaub nobody knows which way chip kelly will go in his first draft is he satisfied with some amalgam of michael vick nick foles dennis dixon at quarterback , or does he think anybody in this lessthanalock class is better , especially in the first round \? and is there any way he can pass on a badly needed left tackle \? it is no secret that the defense , statistically one of the worst in the league , has to get better , and selecting linebackers , a defensive lineman and a cornerback seems likely but do not discount the need to strengthen the offensive line , too washington is limited because it does not have a firstround pick and picks late in the second round the secondary is the primary concern , particularly safety , after the defense struggled against the deep pass all season but since everything revolves around robert griffin iii , the redskins have to consider drafting an offensive tackle , even though they signed the inconsistent  yes , the changeover in defensive scheme will demand some new parts , but first the cowboys have to improve an offensive line that was no help in pass protection or run blocking luckily for them , this is a good draft for linemen , although many of the best will be gone by the time they pick then they can look for a safety , a position the cowboys have struggled to nail down for years after last season s defensive debacle , the focus should be clear they have to get help all across the unit , with a particular emphasis on an outside linebacker to improve the pass rush coach sean payton has also indicated he is worried about protecting drew brees , so do not be surprised if an offensive tackle is in the mix their draft will revolve around improving the pass defense , by finding a cornerback after several departures and a pass rusher to solve a perennial issue with 11 draft picks and an established willingness to boldly go after players he wants , general manager will be worth watching thursday so much depends on whether a trade for darrelle revis finally happens cornerback is so clearly the bucs' biggest need that even if they get revis , they should probably use one of their remaining picks on another corner they could also use a tight end and a defensive tackle but everything hinges on revis with only five picks , the panthers are not going to get everything they need , and they need plenty their most pressing problem a lack of defensive tackles a position that is talentrich in this class they could also use another receiver for cam newton , and upgrades across the board in the secondary with an absurd 13 picks , the 49ers can do practically anything they want , including moving up to add critical pieces to an already talented roster the only real hole is at safety , after dashon goldson s departure , but the struggles of the pass rush after justin smith s injury last season highlight a need to build depth on the defensive line , too um , are there any holes at all \? seattle has to do something with its 11 picks , even though it added two pass rushers and a gamechanging receiver returner , so it might as well try to get an offensive tackle who can pass protect better than breno giacomini did last season the acquisition of carson palmer solves the quarterback problem for at least the short term , but now the cardinals have to get an offensive tackle to protect him the entire offensive line has to improve if the run game is going to get better the secondary took major hits in the offseason , so drafting a safety is imperative with two firstround picks , st louis could address several needs after the rams lost danny amendola and brandon gibson , the most glaring one is receiver but this division features two of the league s most explosive offenses , and anquan boldin and percy harvin have been added that puts a premium on secondary play , and neither of the rams' starting safeties last season is still on the roster finding one is critical after that , they need a running back because they lost steven jackson some offseason departures dictate the vikings' needs , and to fill them , they have six picks in the first four rounds two each in the first and fourth the vikings needed a wide receiver even before percy harvin went west , and with antoine winfield gone , too , finding a cornerback is a priority jasper brinkley went to arizona , so a middle linebacker has to be found this is a deep class of safeties , and green bay has to come away with one to replace charles woodson but how about giving aaron rodgers a viable running game \? for that the packers need a running back expect them to look at linemen , too the packers indicated that they think they need a nose tackle when they sniffed around steve mclendon , and the offensive line needs shoring up , particularly at tackle could the successor to dick butkus , mike singletary and brian urlacher be manti te'o \? it could happen because the bears need a player at their most iconic position , middle linebacker the bears have a measly five picks , but it is a deep cornerback draft , so they could pluck one of those and then perhaps select a guard somewhere , matthew stafford is probably cowering under the covers , hoping detroit uses its fifth overall pick on an offensive tackle , since he needs two the problem for stafford is that the lions are also desperate for an outside rusher whichever way they go first , they need both if they are to avoid backsliding into perpetual mediocrity
the internal revenue service is under fire for inappropriately targeting conservative groups that sought taxexempt status as i wrote earlier this week , the revelation has the potential to motivate conservative turnout in the 2014 elections , perhaps costing democrats as they seek to gain seats in the house and retain control of the senate some conservatives , however , are alleging that there is another component to the scandal they accuse the irs of targeting not just conservative groups that sought 501 \( c \) \( 4 \) status , but also individual taxpayers who oppose president obama or have supported conservative causes the second part of the scandal is the auditing of political activists who have opposed the administration , the wall street journal columnist peggy noonan wrote on thursday , describing the irs s actions as the worst washington scandal since watergate what evidence does ms noonan present for this second allegation \? she reports on four cases of conservatives who she says were targeted for audits , and infers that there were undoubtedly many more the journal s kim strassel reported an idaho businessman named frank vandersloot , who d donated more than a million dollars to groups supporting mitt romney he found himself last june , for the first time in 30 years , the target of irs auditors his wife and his business were also soon audited hal scherz , a georgia physician , also came to the government s attention he told abc news it is odd that nothing changed on my tax return and i was never audited until i publicly criticized obamacare franklin graham , son of billy , told politico he believes his father was targeted a conservative catholic academic who has written for these pages faced questions about her meager freelance writing income many of these stories will come out , but not as many as there are ms noonan is surely correct that many conservative taxpayers were audited in fact , based on some simple math that i ll present in a moment , it s likely that hundreds of thousands of mitt romney voters were selected for an audit in 2012 however , it s also likely that hundreds of thousands of mr obama s supporters were audited although the percentage of taxpayers who are audited is relatively low about 1 percent the number of taxpayers in the united states is so large that this still yields well more than a million audits every year , across the political spectrum the irs publishes data each year on the number of taxpayers it audits in 2012 , it conducted just shy of 15 million audits out of 144 million individual income tax returns the probability of being audited is highest for highincome taxpayers about 12 percent of individuals who made more than 1 million were audited in 2012 although taxpayers who report little to no income are audited at higher rates than those with average incomes in fact , about onethird of audits pertained to people who claimed the earned income tax credit , a benefit for lowincome taxpayers in the table below , i ve estimated the number of taxpayers in each income group who were audited in 2012 , as derived from statistics in the irs s 2012 data book it is also possible to estimate how many mitt romney and barack obama voters would have been audited last year the calculation assumes that an individual s chance of being audited was related to their income , but not to their political views i estimate the number of voters in each income bracket from the 2012 current population survey i then estimate the share of the vote in each income bracket that went to mr romney and mr obama based on last year s national exit poll \( note that the income brackets used in the exit poll and the current population survey do not exactly match the income brackets listed in the irs s audit data , so i use the closest available approximations \) this results in an estimate that about 380 , 000 of mr romney s voters were audited last year , as were about 480 , 000 of mr obama s voters to be clear , this calculation assumes that individuals risk of being audited is independent of their political views in fact , there is no way to know exactly how many supporters of each candidate were chosen for an audit nor could there be , since individuallevel voting records and audit records are private the point is , however , that even with no political targeting at all , hundreds of thousands of conservative voters would have been chosen for audits in the irs s normal course of business among these hundreds of thousands of voters , thousands would undoubtedly have gone beyond merely voting to become political activists the fact that ms noonan has identified four conservatives from that group of thousands provides no evidence at all toward her hypothesis nor would it tell us very much if dozens or even hundreds of conservative activists disclosed that they had been audited this is exactly what you would expect in a country where there are 15 million audits every year none of this ought to take away from the major part of the irs scandal the targeting of conservative groups that applied for 501 \( c \) \( 4 \) status , which the irs has admitted to and for which the statistical evidence is very clear and evidence could yet emerge that there was targeting of politically active individual taxpayers but the principle is important a handful of anecdotal data points are not worth very much in a country of more than 300 million people ms noonan , and many other commentators , made a similar mistake last year in their analysis of the presidential election , when they cited evidence like the number of mitt romney yard signs in certain neighborhoods as an indication that he was likely to win , while dismissing polls that collectively surveyed hundreds of thousands of voters in swing states and largely showed mr obama ahead
washington with the next budget deadline just weeks away , top lawmakers said this week that they had made significant progress negotiating a huge governmentwide spending bill that gives the once mighty congressional appropriations committees an opportunity to reassert control over the flow of federal dollars we have a chance to prove to the rest of the congress that we can produce bills , representative harold rogers , the kentucky republican who is the chairman of the house appropriations committee , said in an interview the past few years have proved frustrating for members of the spending panels with house republicans unable to come to terms with senate democrats on a budget , the government has mainly functioned under a series of continuing resolutions that have taken the appropriations committees out of the game it has been a real struggle and tough at times , mr rogers said while most members of congress have scattered for the holidays , the panels' bipartisan leadership and senior staff members have been assembling a 1 trillion measure that splits an extra 45 billion between military and domestic needs under the terms of the overarching budget deal reached this month and signed into law by president obama on thursday lawmakers involved in the talks say both republicans and democrats are determined to get legislation through congress by the jan 15 deadline , even though many rankandfile members are likely to be wary of an omnibus measure that takes in 12 sweeping spending bills intended to be considered separately the jan 15 deadline essentially leaves just more than a week to win passage , given that members of the house and the senate will not start trickling back until jan 6 committee members say the bipartisan push behind the measure has produced results as they struggle to work out the myriad issues and financing disputes that can tangle appropriations bills and have contributed to the messy budget fights that have snarled the appropriations process i am on the phone three , four , five times a day , said representative nita m lowey of new york , the top democrat on the house panel we are really talking specifics so far , we have n't hit any bottlenecks those negotiating the legislation are holding details of the talks close , unwilling to let too much become public for fear of giving opponents time to build a case against the spending measure or incite lobbying campaigns by those who believe they are being overlooked this is a time for the hard work and less public announcements , said ms lowey , who acknowledged that serious challenges remained , and that the committees faced an extraordinarily tight deadline for such a sweeping legislative job budget watchdogs said they were not surprised that those drafting the legislation were divulging few details they just want to spring it on us at the last minute , said steve ellis , the vice president of taxpayers for common sense these are oldschool appropriators these are people who know how to write these bills in an effort to improve the bill s prospects , mr rogers said he and senator barbara a mikulski , the maryland democrat who is the chairwoman of the senate appropriations committee , had agreed to limit contentious policy riders that can tie up a spending bill riders often focus on politically charged issues like abortion , environmental policy and antiterrorism tactics holding riders to what mr rogers called a bare minimum might prove difficult because many lawmakers will see the spending measure as one of the few major pieces of legislation likely to clear congress in an election year and will want to take advantage of it there are some general priorities as lawmakers get a chance to reorder spending after many agencies have been running on autopilot under socalled continuing resolutions that essentially extend existing financing levels and programs democrats such as ms lowey and senator tom harkin of iowa , who oversees much of the government s social spending , say they want to use the 22 billion in extra domestic dollars to expand health care research and preschool programs , among other initiatives at the same time , defense hawks see the legislation as a chance to undo damage they think was done to the military through automatic cuts required when congress failed to reach a broader budget agreement in 2011 failure to win passage would mean that the pentagon would again operate under a continuing resolution between lawmakers interested in steering more money to domestic initiatives and those focused on the pentagon , the appropriations leaders hope to secure the votes to push through the legislation over the objections of conservatives who are unhappy with new spending and of liberals who believe that social programs are being shortchanged while the appropriations leaders are optimistic , potential stumbling blocks are numerous congress has struggled for years to pass legislation financing labor and health programs , and some republicans will again balk at money for the new health care law battles will also most likely arise over spending for the environmental protection agency , nasa , military pensions and the internal revenue service , which has been under fire from republicans for singling out conservative groups for special scrutiny the budget fights reached a peak in october with the government shutdown in its aftermath , mr rogers pressed speaker john a boehner of ohio and other house republican leaders none of whom have ever served on the appropriations committee to strike a deal that provided an overall spending figure the committees could work with all i wanted from him was a number , mr rogers said , and he delivered the spending bill covers federal agencies through sept 30 but the budget deal also set spending for the 2015 fiscal year , providing the appropriations committees a chance to restore a semblance of order to a process that has gone badly off the rails mr rogers said the committees hoped to return to the textbook approach of conducting oversight hearings on agency spending , assembling and passing bills in each chamber , and then holding housesenate negotiations to resolve differences success could restore some of the luster to the appropriations committees it is simple , he said somebody has to propose how we spend the money , write it down on a piece of paper and say , here , what do you think \? ' that is what appropriators do

kabul , afghanistan the taliban attacked afghan police posts in a violent and longcontested corner of southern afghanistan , setting off two days of clashes that left at least six police officers dead , afghan officials said tuesday , though the americanled coalition played down the violence as little more than driveby shootings the afghan government portrayed the fighting in the sangin district of helmand province , which began monday , as a major victory for its forces , with officials describing a massive taliban effort to overrun the area omar zwak , a spokesman for the provincial governor , put the number of attackers at 1 , 000 and said arab and chechen insurgents that is , al qaeda members were fighting alongside the taliban the taliban also claimed to be engaged in a broad assault on sangin , saying in a text message to reporters that insurgents had overrun three police posts and were close to taking more the coalition , though , was far more circumspect about the scale of the fighting it said the taliban force totaled 80 to 100 fighters and managed to launch only sporadic attacks on outlying police posts in the district ten groups of between 8 and 10 taliban fighters were doing driveby shootings against five police checkpoints , said col thomas collins , a coalition spokesman none of the checkpoints were overrun another coalition official added that american marines , who still maintain a sizable presence in the district , would have joined the fight had the taliban presented any significant threat , and coalition air power would probably have been called in had the taliban massed in numbers as large as those described by afghan officials the official spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid publicly disagreeing with his afghan counterparts the taliban have stepped up their attacks on the afghan army and police since the start of the annual fighting season they say that a broad summer offensive that will expose the weakness of the afghan security forces is now under way , and that they have managed to inflict significant casualties at least six afghan police officers were killed in the past two days in sangin , for instance , according to hajighulam ali khan , the district police chief but the most dramatic battles between the taliban and the afghan security forces seem to be those portrayed by their spokesmen for media consumption , with both sides claiming to have scored hardfought victories over one another this week s fighting in sangin could well prove to be part of the intensifying propaganda war the district was the scene of fierce fighting by british troops and united states marines to root out the insurgents , and both the taliban and the afghan government would benefit from claiming a victory there but if the taliban s attack this week did consist mainly of sending small bands to harass police posts , as the coalition asserted , it would hardly count as a significant victory for either side it would instead seem to indicate that the insurgents do not have the strength or the will to threaten the entire district with a headon assault , and that the security forces there have yet to be tested by a big attack afghan officials , however , were adamant that their forces had repulsed a huge taliban attack the taliban were trying to show us their power but they have been repelled by afghan forces , said mr khan , the police chief the fighting had begun early monday , and afghan soldiers were called in to help repulse the attacks , he added some police were still engaged in isolated firefights , but order had been restored in most of the district , he said , adding that the marines were not needed at any point in the fighting taliban , with their great forces , attacked the boundary in which the security check posts surround the district center and some of the check posts are still under their constant firefighting , he said we do n't know exactly how many taliban have been killed i can say they are losing their men
milwaukee less than 48 hours after in the death of ignited passions and throughout the nation , a jury was selected here for a trial with some striking similarities the defendant , a white man , shot and killed an unarmed black teenager , in an effort , prosecutors say , to take the law into his own hands the defendant , john spooner , 76 , did not dispute that he shot darius simmons , 13 , in may 2012 , believing the teenager broke into his house and stole his shotguns two days earlier mr spooner was of firstdegree intentional homicide on wednesday , moving the trial into its second phase , where defense lawyers will try to prove that he should not be held responsible because of the state of his mental health the shooting of darius is just one example of racially charged cases around the country that are similar to mr martin s death i think the timing is evidence of how this type of thing happens all too often in various communities around the nation , said , the president of the milwaukee branch of the naacp from the beginning , the shooting resonated among the city s black residents , leading to claims of racial profiling and calls for mr spooner to face hate crime charges during the trial , mark s williams , the lead county prosecutor , laid out a narrative of the shooting that was essentially undisputed by the defense mr spooner s house had been burglarized two days before and , though he strongly suspected darius of stealing four shotguns , the police said they did not find enough evidence to continue their investigation mr spooner then confronted darius around 10 am as the youth was retrieving a garbage can in front of his house and demanded the return of the guns , which the teenager denied knowing anything about mr spooner lifted a 32caliber pistol and fired a shot into the chest of darius , who fled down the street before collapsing near a playground none of mr spooner s guns were found in the teenager s home the timing of the trial , so soon after mr zimmerman was found not guilty on saturday , has added a layer of complexity for lawyers working on the case and a heightened anticipation of the verdict from blacks in milwaukee , many of whom say they have lost confidence in the legal system we felt let down , said danielle jackson , 34 , a black resident of milwaukee who was outraged by mr zimmerman s trial and is now watching mr spooner s case closely if he gets off , that s going to bring us down more , she said tuesday in milwaukee , a city with a history of racial tensions , many black residents have a deep distrust of law enforcement and the legal process despite outreach efforts by the police , black leaders in milwaukee still criticize the department s community relations , pointing to episodes like the , a 22yearold black man who collapsed in the back seat of a police cruiser in 2011 after telling officers he was having trouble breathing and asking for medical attention by the time the police offered cpr , it was too late a medical examiner s report that police may have been in part to blame in the episode , though no charges were filed after a special prosecutor s investigation the police s handling of darius s death was criticized , as well officers would not immediately allow the teenager s mother , who witnessed the shooting , to accompany her son to the hospital , keeping her in the back of police cars for an hour and a half for questioning they also searched the family s home for mr spooner s missing firearms and arrested darius s brother , who had five unrelated municipal warrants after an internal police investigation , a commission found none of its policies were violated by the officers , though their report admitted a dimension of racial insensitivity that negatively influenced the trust of some members of the community the people that i speak with seem to have this continuing frustration that there does n't seem to be anything they can do , said jonathan s safran , a private lawyer for darius s family , which filed lawsuits against mr spooner and the city of milwaukee last year they continue to see cases that have what they perceive as the wrong results in an interview , franklyn m gimbel , mr spooner s lawyer , said the timing of mr zimmerman s acquittal added a challenging variable to the trial , despite explicit instructions from the court that the jury , which has one black member , must not link them i have people off the street sitting to make judgment here , he said notwithstanding what they might have said during the selection process , they do have sometimes triggered memories about those kinds of things mr gimbel said it was unfair to compare the two cases and argued that race was not a factor in mr spooner s trial , which was expected to end on thursday many of mr spooner s neighbors , both black and white , agreed they described a usually kind person who was frequently seen walking his dogs and talking with people of all races on the block we all loved that old man , said john davis , 43 , who is white and lives nearby but while some of the city s black residents expressed sympathy toward mr spooner s age and health problems his lawyer said he was having trouble breathing during the trial others cited their feelings about mr martin s death and said what little faith they had left in the legal process would be at stake when the jury decides whether mr spooner was responsible or mentally ill there would n't be no loopholes if the roles were reversed , said derrell price , 28 , who is africanamerican and works at a thrift store on milwaukee s south side if he gets off like zimmerman did , then this whole system is messed up
london forget kim jongun s nuclear posturing and the latest bad news on the euro the other drama that is grabbing attention in the european press this week is the fate of justin bieber s monkey the teen superstar s pet simian has been behind bars at a munich animal sanctuary since it was quarantined by german officials the 14weekold capuchin monkey , mally , was seized after mr bieber landed at munich airport for the german leg of a european tour without proper documentation for the pet mally is reportedly cheerful and is eating well however , german animal rights groups have criticized the canadian singer for having such a young animal as a pet and said he could grow up with serious behavioral disorders the monkey , that is britain s the sun has meanwhile offered to find mally a comfy new home in a british zoo if mr bieber fails to reclaim the pet , which he reportedly received as a 19th birthday gift last month on the premise that all publicity is good publicity , it has been a great european tour for mr bieber , who has been a source of problems wherever he goes , according to grazia , a french style magazine a french poll named him the most irritating celebrity of the month in march alongside president fran ois hollande and nicolas sarkozy , the latter s predecessor the star s image transformation from postpubescent heartthrob to bad boy has prompted some inevitable generational harrumphing about the vacuity of modern youth culture and demands for him to set a good example for his fans bieber must face up to his responsibility , also as a role model for many young people , said wolfgang schr der , president of the german animal protection society in a comment on the mally debacle urging mr bieber to apologize to his 52 million facebook fans and 37 million twitter followers , he said , from the point of view of animal protection he should under no circumstances be allowed to keep the animal that was brought into the country illegally during the british leg of his believe tour , which one reviewer found dazed and deeply confused , mr bieber appeared two hours late for one show and had to cut short another after he fell ill on stage and he had to be restrained by his bodyguards after getting into an argument with a photographer outside his london hotel none of the publicity seems to have dented the ardor of his teenage fans , certainly not in norway , where bieber fever has prompted some schools to reschedule exams so that they do not clash with the singer s april gigs so , is there anything new in the bieber version of youth culture mania , or was it ever thus \? teddy wayne , the novelist , wrote in a recent new york times article recording mr bieber s latest travails , the response to mr bieber s crackup says much about our culture s discomfort with changing notions of childhood , a decadelong shift in values and conventions that he exemplifies better than anyone he added that because mr bieber is so ambitious and enterprising , he can also be considered an emblem of the overscheduled , futureoriented generation y striver the bieber phenomenon in the new socially networked world has not escaped the attention of academics such as melissa avdeeff , a canadian sociologist who wrote in a study  through an examination of justin bieber s popularity in mainstream culture , as mediated through social networking sites such as youtube and twitter , the cultural groundedness of pop popularity is demonstrated , as well as the renegotiation of the barrier between pop artist and fan music world veterans such as sharon osbourne have questioned whether the bieber phenomenon will endure or whether his career will crash and burn before he hits 20 perhaps the singer should take heart from the experience of the rolling stones , britain s enduring bad boy band mick jagger will be leading the group out for a concert in london in july , just around the time of his 70th birthday
monza , italy as the italian grand prix brought an end to the formula one season in europe on sunday at this celebrated track , sebastian vettel of germany had posted another starttofinish victory , outpacing ferrari s fernando alonso and taking a formidable step toward his fourth consecutive driver s championship but much of the attention before and after the race was on alonso , vettel s main rival for the championship although he trailed vettel s red bull car throughout the 53lap race to finish second , nearly six seconds back , alonso was given a hero s welcome at the finish by a mass of italian fans chanting alonso ! as vettel was met with prolonged booing vettel , 26 , can afford to take the theatrical flourishes that are common at monza in stride , having now won 6 of the season s 12 races , and none more decisively than here accordingly , he took the crowd s reproaches in good humor the more they boo me , the better i do , he said , smiling he noted that he had built a much larger lead before being advised by his team to bring his car home cautiously after signs of gearbox trouble i did n't have to push that much , he said we beat the red guys , so we 're very proud of that , he added , referring to alonso and his teammate , felipe massa of brazil mark webber , vettel s red bull teammate from australia , finished third ferrari has 18 victories at monza since the formula one world championship began here in 1950 , and the team came here hoping it could turn around a disappointing season by winning on a highspeed track with superior speed on low downforce tracks like monza , ferrari had been expected to have an advantage here over the red bulls vettel s britishbased team has relied on its superior aerodynamics , which have performed best on slower , more sinuous tracks , allowing the red bull drivers to post faster lap times even with lower straightline speed than ferrari and some other teams but one of the surprises at monza was that vettel , with a straightline speed of 2082 miles per hour , was only a fraction slower than alonso , who recorded 2094 mph vettel , whose average speed for the race was 1455 mph , completed the 1906 miles in 1 hour 18 minutes 3335 seconds his victory gave him a 53point lead in the championship with 222 points to alonso s 169 britain s lewis hamilton of the mercedesbenz team is in third with 141 points there are seven races left in the 19race calendar , including the united states grand prix a on nov 17 in austin , tex , and each victory counts for 25 points alonso told reporters after the race that he would need a lot of luck to overtake vettel and win his third world title first , red bull has to lose and ferrari has to win , he said there is a very big gap in the championship , and we will need to be lucky in all of the races that remain and we 'll also need to have some didnotfinishes from the red bull team but alonso has some work to do closer to home if he is to mend fences with the ferrari team known for his ultracompetitive and often fractious nature , alonso upset the ferrari camp and the company s chairman , luca cordero di montezemolo , when he said after a bad finish in the hungarian grand prix in august that he would welcome for his 32nd birthday somebody else s car , seemingly referring to vettel s red bull he was sharply rebuked for that comment by di montezemolo , who said in effect that he cared more for ferrari , its reputation and its work force in the small town of maranello , than he did for the team s grand prix drivers , who , he said , come and go the response by di montezemolo was widely interpreted as a warning to alonso that his contract , said to be worth tens of millions of dollars a year and set to run for another three years , could be abrogated unless he became less abrasive at monza , matters appeared to take a turn for the worse during qualifying saturday , when bungled tactics by the ferrari pit crew appeared to spoil an attempt to have alonso follow in massa s slipstream and gain time in his bid for the pole position by gaining what is known in racing as a tow a broadcast of alonso s cartopit radio message after he finished fifth in qualifying , two rows behind vettel , appeared to have him saying to his crew chief , you 're really idiots , mamma mia , guys ferrari officials tried to mitigate the damage by saying that the word he used was geniuses not idiots , and suggested that the italian words in each case were similar and prone to be misunderstood by nonitalian speakers but a race official , who had heard another radio message by alonso , said that there were two messages , one using the word idiots and the other geniuses alonso sought to mitigate the damage by telling reporters sunday that they had attempted to stir a controversy out of nothing , and that his relationship with the team was fine after accepting his secondplace trophy on a podium atop the pits after the race , he appeared keen to demonstrate that he had the strong support of italian ferrari fans remaining on the podium after vettel left , alonso waved repeatedly to the crowd , encouraging the chants of his name
london parsifal was the undoing of richard wagner after his wife found out about an extramarital affair from the first production , they had an argument and he suffered a heart attack and died but this opera can also be the undoing of the company that puts it on it s a formidably demanding piece that calls for massive gestures and minute precision , passionate commitment and a clear head all at once and although the new production , which opened saturday at the royal opera house at covent garden manages to keep some of those balls in the air , it s the allatonce requirement that proves difficult it s a problem not so much for the conductor antonio pappano , who lets nothing drop in an encompassing and radiant musical account , but for the director stephen langridge who begins impressively , leaving the audience at the end of act i desperate to know what happens next , but struggles to provide an answer in acts ii and iii as covent garden s grand , and only , gesture for the wagner bicentenary , much was resting on this parsifal and much was resting too on mr langridge , who had been around for some while , doing education work and fringe shows , before breaking through to wider recognition with a 2008 royal opera staging of harrison birtwistle s minotaur a highimpact premiere of a hardhitting piece that earned him this return he justifies it in the two long hours of the first act , establishing the narrative superbly in a clear way that builds steady tension through extended timespans and adopts a cool , considered line on wagner s pseudochristian ritualism one of the divisive issues in the piece a medieval mystery play weighed down with 19thcentury neuroses , parsifal concerns a community of military monks in disarray because its leader has been sexually compromised and wounded in the process , leaving him unable to perform the ritual of the grail his followers demand he needs redemption , which arrives in parsifal a holy fool who learns compassion and becomes a savior figure given that the ritual of the grail is a communion rite , using the cup that caught the blood of jesus dripping from the cross , this may sound christian but the christianity of wagner was ambiguous , perverse , entangled with ideas of aryan supremacy and festishistic sadomasochism so it s not uncommon for directors to leave jesus out of it and try to cleanse the story of its spiritual toxicity which is what seems to happen here with a severely stylized , semiabstract set by alison chitty and the cast in sober modern dress , the opening stage design is clinical not least because the monks are made to look like delegates to a midwestern medical convention , watching over an experiment but what they 're actually watching over is the body of amfortas , the failed leader he lies on a bed within a perspex cube , which serves as sickroom , shrine and reference to the cuboid structures francis bacon used to paint around the anguished subjects of his paintings both the bed and cube are constantly onstage , the suffering amfortas a persistent presence and what s happening around them is initially presented with a quiet intensity and sense of purpose but these are shattered when the ceremony of the grail turns out , for mr langridge , to involve no sharing of a cup but a disturbing rite in which a young boy , nearly naked , has his side pierced and his blood distributed it s an extraordinary image and the audience holds its breath is this community engaged in child abuse \? we want to know then come acts ii and iii and we are none the wiser quiet intensity gives way to overdetailed , undermeaningful , occasionally messy stage ideas and mr langridge s sure grasp falls loose especially at the end when kundry the seducer gets her man , runs off with him , and we 're left wondering if parsifal is nothing more than a frustrated marriage tale in other words , the stuff of comedy as music , though , this production is the stuff of wonder , prepared with immaculate and loving care by mr pappano to the point where every detail is in place , secure , unsweated , and his focus can take in the longer view of wagner s sweeping architectural span in generally good form these days , the covent garden orchestra excels itself with fine ensemble playing , and a fair approximation of the sonic halo that surrounds and integrates the textures when you hear them at bayreuth which is to say , it feels authentic vocally the stars are ren pape whose gurnemanz is easy , conversational but cavernously strong , and gerald finley as amfortas it s mr finley s second wagner role he s slipping gradually into the genre and indicative of great potential a complete performance , powerfully done simon o'neill plays parsifal like peter grimes a whiskery roughdiamond who could well have wandered into the wrong opera with an agile brilliance slightly compromised by acid tone willard white s klingsor is undercharacterized but otherwise all there and the only equivocal singing comes from angela denore s kundry , which some might hear as pure \( the audience liked her \) but is what i 'd call a naked voice , without enough flesh on the bone it suits the servile , broken aspects of the role , but is n't too seductive you can see why parsifal rejects her one last cause for comment are the bells with his accustomed lack of interest in practicality , wagner requires the sound of four sensationally deep and powerful bells in parsifal , without suggesting how to make it the results are almost always disappointing , done these days with synthesizers but for this production , covent garden promised some astounding innovation that would shake the building sadly , it did not
buffalo the have the worst record in the nhl at 2111 , and that is bad enough for their fans but the sabres have also become pariahs , so widely criticized for a handful of violent incidents that fans in buffalo and commentators across the continent are calling for their coach s ouster it s one thing to be bad , said buxees singh , a sabres fan since the team was founded in 1970 it s another to just go out there and make you and your fans look like idiots when the sabres play the rangers on thursday at madison square garden , they will be without their oftensuspended agitator patrick kaleta , who is finishing a 10game sanction of columbus blue jackets defenseman jack johnson neither will they have the services of the 6foot8 enforcer john scott , who is provisionally suspended and faces a league disciplinary hearing on thursday for a blindside hit that gave boston bruins forward loui eriksson a concussion this is an unusual place for the sabres to be for brief periods in the late 1980s and the late '90s , they had a reputation for fighting , but they never developed a lasting image as a goon squad darcy regier , the general manager since 1997 , disagrees with the perception that the sabres are cheapshot artists , calling the criticism of coach ron rolston piling on the sabres have not won a stanley cup , but they reached the finals twice and the conference finals another four times they finished last in their conference only once in 43 seasons , in 198687 but this season is shaping up to be far worse than any in sabres history it is part of a calculated strategy to blow up the team and build from scratch with young players , no matter how bad the shortterm results last weekend , buffalo traded forward thomas vanek , their leading scorer in three of the past four seasons , to the islanders for matt moulson and two draft picks goalie ryan miller , a vezina trophy winner , is believed to be on the trading block as well in several games this season , the sabres have used four teenage players they are already anticipating a high position in the 2014 draft that s been the game plan since the start , rolston said play a lot of the young players , get high draft picks for the future angry fans in buffalo , where hockey is practically a religion , have adopted their own phrase for this approach embrace the tank , they call it since last season , they have regularly chanted fire darcy at games at first niagara center but all that seems mild compared with the criticism leveled by hockey writers and television commentators at rolston , a firsttime nhl coach who replaced the longtime coach lindy ruff in february rolston had spent the previous nine years behind the bench at the junior level with usa hockey and with rochester of the american hockey league rolston was fined during the preseason for player selection and team conduct after he put scott on the ice against toronto s star forward phil kessel in the third period of a close game last month , and scott trailing by two goals against boston early in the third period last week , rolston put scott on the ice again , and scott , giving him a concussion i 'll tell you right now , he s way over his head in fact , he s drowning , mike milbury said of rolston on the nbc sports network , which telecast the bruinssabres game it s a bushleague play by a coach that does n't know any better and does n't have enough experience in the league and should n't be afforded another game not one on cbc s hockey night in canada , don cherry also faulted rolston for the way he used scott rolston said that scott was a fighter , not a cheapshot player i do n't think that was in johnny s mind at all , he said regier , the general manager , called criticism of his coach inappropriate and unfair he has no history of coaching like that , regier said of rolston he s been a teacher , he came up with the us development program what he s been accused of , there s just none of it in his background but , regier added , he has a responsibility to control our players the players rolston would have to control are specifically kaleta , born and raised in the buffalo area , and scott , who grew up a sabres fan in nearby st catherines , ontario scott , who has one goal in 187 nhl games , was signed last season because the sabres were consistently being physically dominated by the rival bruins regier acknowledged that kaleta and scott needed to evolve patty is going to have to change his game , regier said of kaleta , who has been fined or suspended six times in his nhl career for dangerous acts he s made some adjustments , but not enough the league is clearly cracking down on these types of incidents and is very aware of concussions and the dangers associated with them scott declined an interview , but last week he said he was not a dirty player and was sick to his stomach about the injury to eriksson i get frustrated when people say i'm a goon , he said i have a role , i do it and i go out and be physical nevertheless , the photo of scott above his stall in the sabres' dressing room shows him towering over the islanders enforcer matt carkner , arm cocked to deliver a punch he s a smart guy , singh said of scott , who has a degree in mechanical engineering but when he gets out on the ice , he acts like a palooka kaleta said that he was trying to reform his game , as matt cooke did in previous seasons with pittsburgh i 've been working at it , and i'm still going to have to work at it and continue to make strides in the right direction , he said but kaleta also suggested that some things about his game would not change for me personally , no matter what happens , every game i'm going to go out and give my teammates , my coaches , my fans , my family , everyone , everything i 've got , he said kaleta is eligible to return saturday against anaheim , scott sometime later how they act will determine whether , fairly or not , the sabres' reputation changes , too

are you coming back because they asked you or you yourself want to \? mr tsarnaev nobody asked initially , when this happened to our sons i wanted to leave , but i could not do it and you know why because there were a great number of questions from both here and there and from all sides it looks like there is some kind of an international agreement between the two powers until it s clear , they asked the same what children we had , the same questions you are asking now they were asked by the fbi no complicated questions , only about our family , about our children just as i say , what were they doing , who were they , did you have any suspicions , were there any changes in their character , were they worried about anything such were the questions q was it they who told you that you would not see dzhokhar \?

ms tsarnaeva now they 're working on it q can you tell us more about the relationship between your two sons , the relationship between tamerlan and dzkokhar , how were they as brothers \? ms tsarnaeva very close they loved each other they loved each other when dzhokhar used to come on friday , on friday night , home from the dormitory , tamerlan used to hug him and kiss him hold him , like , because he was a big , big boy , tamerlan so he would hug him like this , and he would hold him my dzhokhar' and he would kiss him like this he would never , he would never think that kissing brother is a shame he kissed him and he kissed not only him , his sisters , us so that s how he was always q did you apply to the russian authorities with a request to investigate it \? mr tsarnaev no ms tsarnaeva we have not had time to do anything we asked vladimir putin a question but there was no specific answer q could you tell us , could you tell us why tamerlan decided to come to dagestan for such a long time he has a very small child that he was taking care of at home , and a wife i know he had n't seen relatives for a long time , but why was he coming to dagestan for six months , that seems very unusual why \? mr tsarnaev i 'll tell him why was he in dagestan \? for a long time \? his cousin called him when there was a marriage of his cousin they asked come to the wedding he wanted to come to the marriage at the time , but it did not work out the marriage took place in january , and when he went after it , when time ran out , he went to see the fianc e , spend time with the relatives i told him go , and at the same time you will get your passport , apply for the passport because his kyrgyz passport was about to expire his passport was about to expire in june or in july and that is why i said , you have to get a russian passport' because we left kyrgyzstan for the states to seek political asylum in the states and kyrgyzstan refused us citizenship then we applied to the kyrgyz embassy in washington , sent documents not only for tamerlan but for alina , bella to restore the passports because they could not go anywhere he had to receive a new passport i was here at that time and went there together with him we gathered documents and he had to wait it s not done instantly , some time passes , up to six months , maybe three or four months he left russia on a kyrgyz passport because we came from kyrgyzstan we have kyrgyz passport we were in kyrgyzstan his kyrgyz passport was about to expire , and he did not have time to get a russian passport he was told that he had to wait for one month more , but if he waited for the russian passport he would not be able to come back to the states q why was it important for him to get a russian passport \? mr tsarnaev he did not have american citizenship the kyrgyz passport was about to expire , and if it expired then the man finds himself without citizenship , without anything he would not be able to go anywhere , neither in russia nor anywhere this is why i said go , finish this , finish that and when he came here he was with me , worked in the apartment , broke concrete walls we bought an old apartment and did repairs there he was with me he did not go anywhere he did not communicate with anybody sometimes we went to the mosque together , and that s it ms tsarnaeva they said he even went to georgia mr tsarnaev it s all lies misinformation , and that s it one should not accuse a person now what for \? it s mean he was seen here by everyone there are all kinds of special services here which work efficiently they had to know everything , be it georgia or whatever , why say stupid things \? q why do you think the russian special services applied to the fbi \? mr tsarnaev nobody applied this is lie i heard on the news that he came here twice ms tsarnaeva they told us this mr tsarnaev he came to russia for the first time since he was little child he was not here for 10 years q your son dzhokhar told investigators that he was motivated by islamic extremism , you must have seen that \? mr tsarnaev who saw this \? ms tsarnaeva i 'll answer advokats lawyers , the ones that are with dzhokhar they told me even yesterday that he was not questioned yet where does this information come from \?

' so somebody is , you know , of course it is probably who are they \? ' they are the american fourth so they are bringing him out of a land cruiser i am a mother , i would know my son , tamerlan , even between a million , million people , i would know my son he comes out of the car , he comes out of the car naked my tamerlan was a really , really beautiful boy handsome like hercules tall and beautiful his body was like oh my god , ' like , written you know , shedevr masterpiece so it is not possible not to know the body of my child of course his face , his head , i do n't even need to see the face i see the body and i know i did not even need to see , if there would not be even a face , i would tell that this is my son , but there was a face too when he just came like this , they put his hands in the back , so they 're putting him into the police car now because if they had brought him and they are putting him into the other car , so he s just naked , his body is naked nothing is on him they undressed him , because they 're probably , they were talking about the belt , nothing on his body so they just put him , he just sat , he was really really quiet , no words , nothing , he just sat in the car , and they just closed that door they left it was a really good episode of my son being alive when they were talking about him being killed at the moment when it started , when they that what is it the operation , whatever the terroristic operation so then they called me , somebody is calling me of course from america of course i was like , oh my god , ' my son is alive my son is alive what is this \? is this some kind of dirty game my son got involved in \? what do they put him in \? where is my son \? you took him so my son is alive that s what i was screaming at them so this is some kind of show , spectacle q did you ask the fbi about this yesterday \? ms tsarnaeva i did tell them they were really like shocked too q what did they tell you \? ms tsarnaeva they were shaking their heads they could not express any words , they just , yeah , we will , pay attention we will look at it' and then the next day , at that day when i saw the body of my child alive , the next day i went again to see the naked body , that s the link what you had to print to bring that out was that tamerlan is alive that s what his sister told me too , that is when it came up so the next day when i just did the same at first day when i saw only the body there was n't nothing on the bottom but the next day it was like a dead body of tsarnaev tamerlan so i opened it the same body like i saw , that body that i saw , like nothing changed there and they 're asking me , like wounds , like holes , in his body \? ' so then the correspondents are asking me are you sure this is your son \? are you sure \? he was your son' the one who is killing and the one who is naked , this is identical there , in the first picture , in this first video , you just cannot see his face clearly , which i do n't even need to see i know this is my son and the head and everything his hair and when he is laying down they 're already killed , cruelly killed oh my god , i wanted to scream , scream to the whole world what did you do \? what have you done with my son \? he was alive why did they need to kill him \? why did n't you send him to guant namo or whatever \? why did they kill him \? why \? why did they have to kill him \? ' they got him alive he was in their hands q you say they were set up who would want that \? mr tsarnaev i do n't know how can we know \? ms tsarnaeva the point is that politics is a dirty game we all know this it s just that not everybody can speak about it i do n't know who wanted this mr tsarnaev it s the special services that have to sort it out and find out who needed it ms tsarnaeva i know one thing that it was not my children who did it there are many things there that are n't clear there is much that did not correspond to the information here it s one thing and here is something different and as for the kids and their actions it does n't coincide at all q can i ask , in 2011 , the fbi reviewed tamerlan at any point did something enter your mind that something was wrong , maybe he had some contacts or some activities that were suspicious , did that enter your mind \? mr tsarnaev on the contrary , we thought that the fbi came to us , as they said , to save them they said it was for the prophylactic purposes we do n't only come for you , we come to all young people we know what you read , which web sites you visit , we know each step of yours such is our work so that people would live quietly , so that nothing would explode' i said , great we are glad that our children are looked after' and in fact we were glad to it q you asked him yourself , you were going to say you asked him yourself \? ms tsarnaeva of course when police come , when you realize that there is somebody from the government interested in your children , you ask of course i asked tamerlan they were there when i asked i asked , do you know if there is something wrong \? ' no , no , there is nothing wrong we just wanted to talk to share some opinions , what tamerlan is doing , what tamerlan is reading' actually they told me do n't you think tamerlan is being a little bit extreme about religion \? do you think he would think about organizing some kind of terrorist attack \? aggression \? do you see any aggression in tamerlan \? ' so , no i did not i did not i really did not see any reason to worry , and then when i talked to tamerlan maybe you did something , maybe you read or whatever' mama , i do read , like everybody reads what , i ca n't read \? ' and i told them too , i will read this , i will read that i will read whatever is there that s why the information is there and that s why the head is here' q did you see those web sites \? ms tsarnaeva no , i did not mr tsarnaev he said i read everything , both pushkin , dumas , everything' and in english he was interested in everything and while here he read books during all his free time and i told him have you come here to read \? get to work do something' q apparently the fbi had some specific concerns coming from the russian government \? ms tsarnaeva who \? i do n't believe in it if they would be something like they were worried , or really concerned , they would not leave him q let s talk about misha who , it has been reported , is a radical islamist who may have had an influence on tamerlan tsarnaev ms tsarnaeva misha \? i do n't know who even mentioned that misha misha is the nicest man mr tsarnaev armenian guy q poor , like russians say , he s a poor guy mr tsarnaev misha and sergey ms tsarnaeva they 're brothers one is converted to islam , one is armenian i do n't know their last names i did n't meet with them specially it happened that he came to us as a guest from the very first time , we liked misha mr tsarnaev he was from here too ms tsarnaeva he used to come to our house there was nothing not to like about him very nice , very gentle we were just embarrassed in front of him when he was in our house praying we were n't i was n't , he was n't , tamerlan q he had some sort of influence on tamerlan \? he made him more religious \? ms tsarnaeva that s why i'm telling you , i'm explaining that when he asked us could we make a wudu , ' when you do the namaz , you need to wash your hands and everything and he asked us if i can do the wudu and i said , of course , ' and while he was in our house visiting us , it happened twice so he did it twice and prayed we were talking about how he , being an armenian , became such a good muslim man i was just really impressed there was nothing not to like about him q nothing extreme about him \? mr tsarnaev and ms tsarnaeva nothing extreme ms tsarnaeva well then tamerlan thought and i thought , and when he left we just started talking about him and i told tamerlan , look at him is n't it impressive what he s doing \? he is just so great' q did he bring you closer to islam \? ms tsarnaeva yes he did ! i was n't praying until he prayed in our house , so i just got really ashamed that i am not praying , being a muslim , being born muslim i am not praying misha , who converted , was praying q what did he say to you that made you change your mind and made you start praying \? ms tsarnaeva i did not stop , i started q what did he say that convinced you to start \? ms tsarnaeva there was no reason even to say anything he just prayed , and that was enough for me q how can you explain to us that do n't understand \? mr tsarnaev if you accept islam , we will be glad that will be our reward for any muslim , that is the reward q when did you meet misha \? ms tsarnaeva i do n't remember , 2007 \? mr tsarnaev i do n't remember q what did tamerlan think about him \? ms tsarnaeva very much respected him q for what \? ms tsarnaeva for him , knowing islam the way he does he was like mama , look at him , he is praying , he is fasting all the time' mr tsarnaev we did not see him for two or three years after that q where was he from \? ms tsarnaeva he was from nearby mr tsarnaev he is russianspeaking moreover they were from baku in azerbaijan from baku when there was the war their father is a famous gymnastics trainer , their father his son sergei is a professor his brother a senior professor of history , he made a world map , i do n't know it s a very decent family he accepted islam because he grew up in baku together with muslims , you understand \? they were born in baku q was he orthodox before \? ms tsarnaeva i do n't know , the armenians , what are they \? mr tsarnaev under soviet power everybody was an atheist q zubeidat , what will it take to convince you that your sons may have been responsible for this attack \? ms tsarnaeva video you know evidence mr tsarnaev video live video q if you find the evidence , will you accept that \? ms tsarnaeva yes q charges against dzhokhar are partly based on security cams ms tsarnaeva i do n't even know i wo n't even believe it , because nowadays they set up anything i know my kids q have you seen the security cameras from the marathon , where the charges against dzhokhar are partially based by identifying him on the security cameras leaving a backpack and then when the first explosion goes he s the only person in the camera who does n't react to the explosion , and he leaves a large backpack at the place where the second explosion happened and walks away and shortly after the second explosion happens ms tsarnaeva that can be done easily too there are some experts that are saying , in the computer we are reading , that the backpack on dzhokhar s back is different from the one they show as dzhokhar s in the beginning they are showing dzhokhar with one backpack , and there is another one everything is in the computer q will you believe the evidence \? ms tsarnaeva no q not even video evidence \? ms tsarnaeva no because it can be set up and then i thought that it can be done easily q anzor , when are you leaving russia \? mr tsarnaev today or tomorrow i do n't know q would you like tamerlan to be brought here to be buried \? you 're talking about renouncing us citizenship would you like your son to be brought here for burial \? ms tsarnaeva yes i would q why \? ms tsarnaeva why \? because that is the land where he got killed i would love taking him out of there but again , allah , god , is one he gave the land for everyone , so he can be buried there too q did you ask investigators if you can bring his body here for burial \? mr tsarnaev no ms tsarnaeva actually , we did not get to that point yet his brother just got there he s working on it but it s not easy either , because financially it is too expensive so q why have you not traveled to america yet \? ms tsarnaeva wel , l we were doing something here q are you going together \? ms tsarnaeva well we are thinking yes mr tsarnaev yes ms tsarnaeva they are telling us that they are not going to show dzhokhar to us they already are talking about me being a terrorist and i think that they could set up something for me too q do you know that you can be arrested in the us because of a prior shoplifting charge \? ms tsarnaeva yes it s not serious at all q is that why you 're not traveling \? you said the father is going to go , but you did not say you were going to go is that the reason you are not traveling this time \? ms tsarnaeva no , i am thinking about it q but the warrant does n't play any factor in that \? ms tsarnaeva no q two questions first , were you given any guarantees that the warrants would not be carried out or legal assistance that if you went into the united states you would not be arrested \? ms tsarnaeva lawyers are already calling me q and they can give you guarantees that wo n't happen \? ms tsarnaeva yes q anzor , just to clarify , you are leaving for the united states \? mr tsarnaev yes , i am q when \? mr tsarnaev i do n't know soon as soon as possible q anzor , will the fbi want to talk to you again when you arrive in the united states \? mr tsarnaev i do n't know ms tsarnaeva they did n't say q do you plan to go to boston \? mr tsarnaev yes , boston q did tamerlan go to the mosque on kotrova street in dagestan , with a reputation for its extremist interpretation of islam \? mr tsarnaev yes he did q how many times \? mr tsarnaev on friday we were both in dzhuma , we went everywhere we went anywhere close by when there is space in kotrova there is always a lack of space , it s small in dzhuma , in reduktorny , everywhere ms tsarnaeva he was taking him as a child they say he managed to be in georgia , managed to go somewhere else , some money he took him as a child no way q were there any friends like in chechnya \? ms tsarnaeva in chechnya , also with him mr tsarnaev there were no friends , he has not been here for a long time i told him you have come from the states , so look i know that the situation here is not an easy one' he was walking next to me q when the terrorism is linked to the north caucasus , what do you respond \? mr tsarnaev it s stupidity ms tsarnaeva funny mr tsarnaev it s complete misinformation q what was the yesterday s meeting about \? mr , tsarnaev they asked questions what was he doing here \? the same questions you are asking ms tsarnaeva i want to tell you one thing it does not make any difference where one prays kotrova , it does not matter i began to understand only now they say kotrova , kotrova i did not even know that it is considered radical or extremist only now i begin to learn that the one on kotrova is considered a more radical one mr , tsarnaev moreover , if it s considered the radical one it had to be under control , full control , it s even better and everything that you do is under control who goes where , who talks with who is taped is n't that so \? then what questions do you have \? why are you branding kotrova \? i do n't understand it q were you asked specifically about the contacts with people who tamerlan could meet in kotrova \? did they mention any names \? mr tsarnaev no if there were any they would immediately give this information it s dagestan , everybody knows each other one cannot remain unnoticed you have found us no matter where we go , you find us the special services are working , they are paid for this they would be the first to know what s going on there ms tsarnaeva if tamerlan was noticed there he would not have left mr tsarnaev an american citizen got registered , they a copy of documents , registered him it means even more that they had to watch him q what else specifically did the fbi representatives want to know yesterday \? ms tsarnaeva we asked , where is this video from \? ' the one where they arrested him alive we 'll look into it , ' they said q what did they ask you \? mr tsarnaev just what you ask kotrova , where he was , why did he come \? where did you go \? i told them ms tsarnaeva if he traveled anywhere besides dagestan , like chechnya , probably because they had the information about georgia that is coming up now mr tsarnaev that is new ms tsarnaeva now it s coming up that he went to georgia i know that he never went there never now they 're finding his steps in georgia somewhere else you know , everywhere q did they suggest to you that they have a certain line of inquiry \? did they have an idea about tamerlan s alleged motivation \? what did they say to you about what they were understanding about why this happened \? ms tsarnaeva i am convincing you that they did not do it , and you are asking me the same question they had the same questions they also asked what it could be mr tsarnaev they say , we will investigate it' it s interesting to them themselves this is why i am going there to ask how come this happened q anzor , tamerlan spent six months in dagestan last year mr tsarnaev yes q what impression did that trip make on him \? did he talk to you about his impressions of what he saw here , the situation in dagestan \? mr tsarnaev ah , of course dagestan made an impression on him q and the situation here \? mr tsarnaev he said that he did not see anything of what he heard about , the explosions ms tsarnaeva i 'll tell you one thing when i talked to him on the phone , i'm like how are you doing \? he s like , mama , they are really strange here' he was walking by the sea he usually used to run or sit down on the beach and breathe the air or something or he just , he loved it he s like , the police came there and they asked for documents' they asked him to follow he was asking them , he was like in shock he s like what , is there something wrong with me \? am i strange , or do n't look like everybody \? and , of course , they inside , he told them , where is he from and how is he enjoying his people \?

re , by michael r bloomberg \( oped , aug 23 \) i must first note the mayor s enormous influence on tobacco control under his leadership , new york city has become a peerless leader in efforts to end the preventable damage and death caused by tobacco use the obama administration has a long history of tackling the tobacco epidemic , including the landmark tobacco control act , expanded cessation coverage and new investments in communitybased prevention the united states government s proposal on tobacco in the transpacific partnership negotiations represents a step forward for public health in the international trade community it would provide health authorities a new opportunity to voice their views , and critically , it recognizes that tobacco is a product like no other with an unparalleled effect on human health because it is addictive , always harmful to health , and the single most preventable cause of death worldwide bill corr deputy secretary , dept of health and human services washington , aug 24 , 2013 i applaud the contributions in tobacco control by mayor michael r bloomberg of new york and president obama the mayor s efforts have improved air quality and curbed youth smoking , and obamacare intelligently factors individual responsibility into insurance premiums for smokers together , the president s 2009 increase in the cigarette tax and the mayor s leadership have resulted in cigarette prices in new york city that are among the highest in the country i appreciate mayor bloomberg s disappointment regarding the transpacific partnership , and also understand the difficult realities to reach consensus in the trade agreement controlling the global epidemic of tobacco use is an international responsibility that other world leaders must also champion it is my hope that the leadership of the mayor and the president can be unified to resolve remaining domestic tobacco concerns first banning menthol in cigarettes , regulating electronic cigarettes and achieving the full use of graphic warning labels to end tobacco s deadly toll in america john maa oakland , calif , aug 24 , 2013 concerning the position of american business and agriculture with regard to public health , the transpacific partnership negotiations and trade agreements in general we support efforts to improve public health , but we oppose inserting provisions in trade agreements in the name of public health that are unnecessary and unjustified and could open the door to measures by our trading partners that threaten american exports and jobs for half a century , administrations have maintained that in trade agreements the united states remains free to safeguard the national and public interest , including public health to change their carefully crafted language in ways that could cause harm would be a mistake when science and evidence support a nondiscriminatory regulatory action , it already has a safe harbor in our trade agreements and under sovereign united states law to imply otherwise is to create problems where none exist calman j cohen president , emergency committee for american trade washington , aug 23 , 2013
on april 13 , prime minister salam fayyad of the palestinian authority resigned it was an easy development to miss , but not one to be ignored it was very bad news , because salam fayyad was the arab spring before there was an arab spring that is , he was what the arab spring was supposed to lead to a new generation of decent arab leaders whose primary focus would be the human development of their own people , not the enrichment of their family , tribe , sect or party that fayyad s brand of noncorrupt , institutionfocused leadership was not sufficiently supported by other palestinian leaders , the arab states , israel and america is really depressing it does not bode well for the revolutions in egypt , syria or tunisia none of which have a fayyadquality leader at the helm who is salam fayyad \? a former economist at the international monetary fund , he first came to prominence when he was named finance minister of the palestinian authority in 2002 , after donors got fed up seeing their contributions diverted for corruption shortly after he became prime minister in 2007 , i coined the term fayyadism the alltoorare notion that an arab leader s legitimacy should be based not on slogans or resistance to israel and the west or on personality cults or security services , but on delivering decent , transparent , accountable governance fayyad dried up all slush accounts and went against yasir arafat s orders by insisting on paying all security officials by direct bank account \( rather than with cash given to their commanders based on a questionable list of personnel \) , wrote daoud kuttab , a prominent palestinian journalist , in the jewish daily forward fayyad also became the first arab government official to publish his government s entire budget online , ushering a new transparency not seen in the entire arab region fayyad also played the leading role in rebuilding the palestinian security services in the west bank , which even the israeli military grew to respect , and in trying to build palestinian institutions , on the argument that the more palestinians built their institutions finance , police , social services the more israel s denial of them of a state will be unsustainable fayyad s embrace of economic transparency , which included usled audits , was instrumental in attracting increased international aid , noted david makovsky , director of the project on the middle east peace process at the washington institute despite a deep worldwide recession , the imf reported 9 percent growth for the west bank between 2008 and 2010 as late as the second half of 2011 , public support for fayyad s government was at 53 percent , 19 points ahead of the hamas government in gaza hamas hated fayyad , and many palestinian authority officials were jealous of him , but success protected him until 2011 president mahmoud abbas , frustrated by the rightwing israeli government s refusal to strike a landforpeace deal , decided to seek recognition of palestinian statehood at the united nations the united states retaliated by cutting off aid , and israel did so by withholding palestinian tax receipts i thought it foolish for abbas to go to the un , but i thought it irresponsible for america s congress to cut off aid to the palestinians for doing so when we 've never retaliated for the even more obstructionist building of settlements by israel the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in aid tanked the palestinian economy publicsector workers went unpaid , and fayyad had to impose austerity abbas and some of the old guard in his fatah party , who never liked fayyadism , used fayyad as a scapegoat for palestinian economic troubles , in part out of resentment at his efforts to constrain patronage and corruption , noted makovsky blaming fayyad for the latest downturn is especially audacious , he added after all , last fall , fayyad broke his hand in a meeting with fatah members as he banged it on the table , vehemently arguing that it was irresponsible to go to the un unless there were sufficient reserves to cover an aid slowdown fayyad finally got fed up and quit my four takeaways 1 for palestinians , particularly abbas and fatah , who so easily turned their most effective executive into a scapegoat , if there is no place for a salam fayyadtype in your leadership , an independent state will forever elude you 2 hamas and the israeli settlers are both really happy today fayyad s aim to build a decent palestinian state in the west bank , at peace with israel , was a huge threat to both of them they both prefer permanent struggle so they both can claim there is no one to talk to on the other side and , therefore , they never have to change policies 3 thanks , american congress and israeli government your mindless , repeated cutoffs of cash to fayyad s government helped undermine the best palestinian peace partner israel and the us ever had nice job 4 there is nothing inevitable about a liberal order emerging from any of these arab awakenings , argues the pollster craig charney indeed , to produce that outcome takes someone like a fayyad with the consistent help of external parties as well as a loyal base at home ready to see it through in the end , fayyad had neither add another nail in the coffin of the twostate solution
cambridge , mass horace greeley , napoleon bonaparte and cecil rhodes may seem strange bedfellows , but they all agreed that territorial , political and economic size was critical to a country s success they wanted more land in the west , in europe or overseas in 1904 , halford mackinder , an oxford geographer , told an august assemblage at the royal geographical society that the country that controlled the russian heartland , a frostbitten central asian steppe , would dominate the world island the combined territory of europe and north asia and in time come to rule the world a centrally located piece of territory like the russian plain , mackinder argued , could be expanded west and east without the need for naval power as it turned out , russia was then facing both war and revolution , and could not fully control the heartland , to say nothing of ruling the entire world but mackinder s terms pointed to the critical role of territorial and economic size in the competition among nations without quoting mackinder , president obama and chancellor angela merkel of germany have recently sought to form a huge freetrade zone that would join europe with the united states in a new transatlantic trade and investment partnership , creating an economic power with nearly half of the world s gross domestic product on june 19 , alongside ms merkel in berlin , mr obama declared that europe and the united states were the and that they should see ourselves as something bigger in the global quest for freedom , justice and peace of course , the joining of the two continents would increase trade and employment it would facilitate mr obama s goal of doubling american exports and increasing investment and consumption ms merkel would smile as german cars and medical equipment poured into american markets , and washington would return the favor with microprocessors , biotechnical devices and liquid natural gas if the deal is concluded next year as planned , economists estimate the creation at least one million jobs over 10 years , and a 05 percent increase in gdp , on both sides of the atlantic the new pact would draw together 259 of the fortune 500 companies investment flows and tourism would bubble to new heights but the underlying reason for bridging the narrowing atlantic channel is that power is shifting east , and there is a need to reconsolidate the west paradoxically , closer ties with europe will be the means by which mr obama carries out his pivot to asia as america and germany bring together advanced industries and a vast population of skilled workers in the short term , china will respond \( and has already responded \) to this transatlantic combination by strengthening its ties with the outside world while dumping dollars and buying euros , china has sought to turn its american bond holdings into shares in american corporations it has moved into london s money markets and invested heavily throughout africa none of this has created an alternative political unit , however countries like sudan , zimbabwe , myanmar and north korea will never be pillars of a new international economic order there is no looming political or economic counterweight to the west s assembly of democratic nations , which earlier this month embraced croatia as the european union s 28th member mr obama s and ms merkel s pursuit of greater democratic size is not a new objective strategists have always known that countries with more people , wealth and economic space can produce more and trade over a larger region worldwide tariff cuts have failed what could be more appropriate than for mr obama and ms merkel to seek the largest alternative place in which to trade freely , thus stimulating their industries in competition with rising eastern nations \? the strategists of the postwar era reached similar conclusions the state department s legendary policy planning chiefs george f kennan and paul h nitze recognized that a combination of the physical resources of russia and china with the technical skills and machine tools of germany and the eastern european countries might spell a military reality more powerful than anything that could be mobilized against it thus began the patient accumulation of allied nations into what became the north atlantic treaty organization , which was buttressed by the economically consolidating european common market and then the european union under mikhail s gorbachev and particularly boris n yeltsin , russia wanted to join the west and the european union the 1996 election led some to believe that moscow could eventually become an approximation of western democracy when vladimir v putin succeeded yeltsin , however , this dream vanished as former kgb agents came to dominate and when oil prices rose , abundant energy supplies allowed russia to conclude that it did n't need the west , nor did it need to be democratic finally , victory in the cold war stemmed from a western agglomeration of decisive economic and industrial strength it was not an equality of power that brought the soviet union to heel , but a surplus of power , or an overbalance in the hands of the west this is not a declaration of economic war against the east rather , it reflects an awareness that china and others need to be brought into the west , bringing two halves of the world together a greater american and european combination would amass 32 trillion today and much more tomorrow a balance of power leads to conflict but an overbalance attracts others to its economic core and china is dependent on that core unlike russia , china must import the majority of its oil , and its use is currently at 97 million barrels a day the money to buy this petroleum and natural gas must come from exports , mainly exports to the west here the west maintains a continuing advantage , because china receives only about 50 percent of the value added of its exports the rest is garnered by european and american companies , which provide the research and development , design , marketing and financing for most products exported from china for decades to come , china will have to sell in the west to gain money and access to technologies that it does n't yet possess the consolidation of a euroamerican economic unit will require china to join , too , as it becomes a more open , liberal and rulegoverned polity skeptics will argue that this is just an incremental enhancement of an already strong relationship and that the west could draw china in without this new trade deal but america has tried and failed it tried to form a bilateral bloc with china , the g2 , in 2009 , but china s leaders refused and frustrated mr obama s plans to cooperate on addressing climate change it was clear that america would need a stronger west to get china s attention the key advantage of a new trade partnership with europe is that it has a strong political and security foundation it will be a peaceful but powerful alliance will add elements of technology , military strength and political will to resuscitate the west in its dealings with the rest of the world in the end , trade not war will attract others to the west s economic core
cairo for millions of egyptians still reeling from the shock of wednesday s stateled massacre , which killed at least 600 peaceful protesters and possibly many more , the questions are now very basic how do you reconcile with people who are prepared to kill you , and how do you stop them from killing again \? i represent an alliance of egyptians who oppose the military coup that overthrew president mohamed morsi in july over the last two weeks , we have met with foreign diplomats , including bernardino le n , the european union envoy , and william j burns , the american deputy secretary of state , who were invited by the coup s leaders to mediate we respectfully listened , honestly communicated our assessment of the situation and emphasized our desire to find a peaceful solution but those efforts were doomed by the bad faith of gen abdulfattah elsisi , egypt s military ruler it was he , not the alliance , who rejected the mediators' proposals the mediation efforts have been problematic diplomats and journalists continue to speak about negotiating only with the muslim brotherhood , even though the protesters come from all over the political spectrum of the country opposed the coup , one egyptian poll showed worse , shocking and irresponsible rhetoric from the state department in washington and from other western diplomats calling on the brotherhood and demonstrators to or violence \( even when also condemning the state s violence \) has given the junta cover to perpetrate heinous crimes in the name of confronting violence the protest sites have been teeming with foreign correspondents for the last several weeks , and there has not been a shred of evidence suggesting the presence of weapons , or of violence initiated by protesters the mediators' most disastrous error was their choice to put pressure on the victims in their eyes , we were the cause of the crisis , not the illegal putsch that suspended the constitution and kidnapped the president secretary of state john kerry s on aug 1 that the coup was restoring democracy , despite a disavowal from the white house , did not leave the impression that america was on the side of the peaceful protesters if only we could accept the coup as a fait accompli , we were told , all would be well there would be good will gestures from the military , and there would be an inclusive democracy we have heard all those promises before the military and socalled liberal elites have shown time and again that they believe they are entitled to a veto over egyptians' choices but the general who betrayed his oath and held the only elected president in the history of egypt in extralegal detention cannot be trusted to let an opposition movement survive , let alone thrive for those seriously interested in a way out of this crisis , some hard facts must be acknowledged first , this is a battle between those who envision a democratic , pluralistic egypt in which the individual has dignity and power changes hands at the ballot box and those who support a militarized state in which government is imposed on the people by force second , this coup has already sent egypt back into the dark ages of dictatorship with tight military control over both stateowned and private media , attacks on peaceful protesters and journalists , and detention of opposition leaders without criminal charges or due process third , there is no promise that general sisi can make that he has n't already betrayed he took an oath to uphold the constitution he suspended the constitution he took an oath to loyally serve in the government he toppled that government and in the classic doublespeak of military juntas , he loudly condemned the opposition for dealing with foreign powers , while he was actively seeking the help of western diplomats as well as the persian gulf sheikdoms that largely financed his coup through all this , the united states government has pleaded impotence hardly a day goes by without some press officer , analyst or public official pushing the idea that washington s influence really is n't that decisive with the egyptian generals this copout simply wo n't do america had influence and still does it was an american official , not an egyptian one ,  there is only one way forward in egypt today the legitimate government must be restored only then can we hold talks for a national reconciliation with every option on the table the reinstatement of mr morsi is not about ideology or ego it is not political grandstanding it is not a negotiating tactic it is a pragmatic necessity without this crucial step , without accountability for those responsible for the bloodshed and chaos facing egypt today , none of the promises of inclusion , democracy , liberty or life can be guaranteed what the united states ultimately decides to do with its diplomatic relations or foreign aid is president obama s decision but americans need to recognize that every passing day solidifies the perception among egyptians that american rhetoric on democracy is empty that american politicians wo n't hesitate to flout their own laws or subvert their declared values for shortterm political gains and that when it comes to freedom , justice and human dignity , muslims need not apply the regime we are facing in egypt is not new it is one with which we are intimately familiar its leaders are selling torture , repression and stagnation we are not buying and america should n't either
los angeles in the days after the elementary school massacre in newtown , conn , tony beliz and his staff at the county s mental health department here made a series of calls they checked in with a 16yearold boy with a fondness for bombmaking chemicals who , two years before , told them , i have to get rid of the bad people in this world , and described a special plan he said he would put into action in a few years they called the mother of another teenager they have nicknamed him jared loughner , after the man who shot representative gabrielle giffords in tucson in 2011 who was obsessed with weapons and killing , had access to firearms and had extensively researched school shootings they contacted a 20yearold who in 2010 was fantasizing about killing members of his family and carrying out a shooting at school the young men had been brought to the attention of the school threat assessment response team program overseen by dr beliz , one of the most intensive efforts in the nation to identify the potential for school violence and take steps to prevent it the program , an unusual collaboration involving county mental health professionals , law enforcement agencies and schools , was developed by the los angeles police department in 2007 , after the shooting rampage at virginia tech university , and was taken countywide in 2009 by dr beliz , a deputy director of the mental health department in the national debate that has followed the killings at sandy hook elementary school in newtown , much of the focus has been on regulating firearms but many law enforcement and mental health experts believe that developing comprehensive approaches to prevention is equally important in many cases , they note , the perpetrators of such violence are troubled young people who have signaled their distress to others and who might have been stopped had they received appropriate help when we looked at kids who had committed attacks , the vast majority had come to the attention of an adult for a behavior that was concerning but would not necessarily cause someone to conclude they were planning an attack , said bryan m vossekuil , former executive director of the , part of the secret service , and a coauthor of a 2002 guide to threat assessment in schools published by the service and the federal education department many secondary schools and universities around the country have protocols for dealing with students who threaten violence and cities besides los angeles have started programs intended to identify students at risk but criminal justice experts say that the program in los angeles , financed under california s , is noteworthy for the sharing of information among agencies and for the degree of followup in keeping track of worrisome students over time i think la really is a shining star and a standard in relation to how a big city can actually collaborate , said j kevin cameron , an expert on school shootings and executive director of the , who has consulted with the program each day , several dozen calls come in to the program s dispatch center from principals , counselors , school security officers or parents worried about students who have talked about suicide , exhibited bizarre behavior or made outright threats we 'll go to a school , evaluate the individual there , then what we 'll also do is go to the kid s home and we 'll ask to see the bedroom and we 'll do a very datadriven assessment , dr beliz said we 're trying to figure out , what are the triggers here \? what are the risk factors \? what s really going on and how can we intervene \? he and others involved in the program said that in more than a few cases , the approach had been successful in heading off violence part of the challenge , dr beliz said , has been educating school administrators and mental health professionals about their legal responsibilities and the exceptions in federal privacy laws that allow information to be shared in exigent circumstances for example , when a threat is involved schools and mental health practitioners are often reluctant to release any information to county officials or law enforcement officers , believing incorrectly that the law prevents disclosure under any circumstances another difficulty has been convincing school administrators whose first impulse is often to expel students who have made threats , even empty ones , that doing so only pushes the problem onto another school or leaves a child at home with free time to surf the internet and nurse a grudge against the school what we do is , we work with the school to think that through , dr beliz said , adding that one of their goals is to keep the kid in school , because that is their holding environment depending on the situation , a student who has made a serious threat might be put on a 72hour mental health hold , or arrested , if a crime has been committed a mental health hold is often preferable , law enforcement officers said , because under california law it allows the seizure of firearms but even when a student is judged to be expressing frustration or making a bid for adults to take notice , the team works to get the student into counseling and help families link up with appropriate social services detective charles dempsey , the officer in charge for the lapd s part of the program , said that in most cases , parents consent to letting field teams of clinicians and trained law enforcement officers look in a student s bedroom or search through backpacks and notebooks we get a lot of cooperation from parents , he said after the initial shock , they want to know , too , what did i miss \? if a case is converted to a criminal investigation , the procedures become more regimented during a recent week , dr beliz s team looked into the case of a high school student who had been overheard talking about a school shooting in a notebook , he had scribbled , kill everyone leave none alive , next to drawings of a bomb hitting a building they evaluated a 19yearold who had posted on facebook photos of himself holding a gun with the words school tomorrow , and a 14yearold girl who said she respected adam lanza , the gunman in newtown , because by killing 20 children he had saved them from the misery of life at a recent morning meeting to discuss current cases , the team members reviewed the students' history , statements , actions and family dynamics and came up with an assessment of the seriousness of the threats , judging whether a student was on a path to violence , as dr beliz puts it , or instead was experiencing emotional difficulties unlikely to erupt into violent behavior if a child s really depressed and has been bullied and is feeling on the fringes and nobody s doing anything , they say , i'm going to bring a gun to school and shoot up the school , ' and suddenly everybody is paying attention , said linda boyd , the program manager for the threat assessment team in most cases , the more the team finds out , the less worrisome the case becomes in the three recent cases , the students , upon further investigation , were judged in need of various kinds of help but not to pose a risk of imminent violence but ms boyd said that the team had also dealt with students who had made hit lists or been discovered with caches of weapons knives and guns , but also crossbows and bombs there are some kids that we end up being really , really , really worried about , ms boyd said dr beliz noted that some school gunmen mr lanza , for example have already left school when they turn to violence , and that such cases are the most difficult to identify and prevent we 'll stay with these people as long as we can , and it makes a difference , because we 're knocking on their door or their therapist s door , he said that s the missing piece in some of these school shootings they were in engaged in some sort of way , but dropped out and no one really thought to follow them yet the concern for community safety can bump against individual rights , especially when no crime has been committed at a recent case meeting , dr beliz and his team discussed a worrisome high school senior who had made serious threats in school and was now applying to colleges could they notify the university where the student eventually enrolled about his behavior \? it was , they agreed , murky legal territory
nice , france after the first stage of the tour de france on saturday , oricagreenedge was ridiculed by the peloton its team bus had become stuck on the finish line as riders descended upon bastia , causing a series of events that sent the race into chaos three days later , after its second consecutive stage win , in which its leader , simon gerrans , took the yellow jersey , the team has become the toast of the 100th tour on a beautiful summer day in nice , the riders for were the fastest on stage 4 s 155mile team time trial course around the mediterranean city , narrowly beating prestage picks like omega pharmaquick step and sky by threequarters of a second some of cycling s bestknown television images may be of solo mountain breakaways and sprinters raising their arms after vanquishing rivals , but every rider is part of a nineman team at this year s , which ends july 21 in paris the team time trial , which was last held at the tour in 2011 , pits each team s riders against the clock most teams on saturday had nine , except for those like the french team cofidis , which had eight it is indeed a team effort , with riders taking turns at the front of the group , striving to keep a fast pace going wearing their team s whiteblueandgreen jersey , and his team surprised the field we were by no means the favorite , but we 're a wellbalanced , strong team , said gerrans , the sixth australian to wear the yellow jersey as leader of the tour we thought that if everyone could play their role , if people did n't try to do too much or too little , we would have a chance to finish very close to the top it was not as close as gerrans s victory monday in stage 3 , however , when he beat peter sagan to the line by less than a wheel s length to claim the team s first tour de france stage victory started in 2011 , oricagreenedge is australia s answer to britain s team sky built around a deep corps of australian riders like the sprinter matt goss and stuart o'grady , who is in his 17th tour de france , it has quickly achieved success nothing , however , prepared it for what has happened this tour yesterday was big , said matt white , the team s general manager the biggest win for the team ever today , we did n't really expect it gerrans said that his victory monday was the result of months of preparation , but he could have said the same thing about tuesday s stage of all of the sport s disciplines climbing , sprinting , individual time trials the team time trial demands the most precise timing and coordination teams do not just show up at the start line they rent former formula one tracks in marseille to experiment with different bikes , wheels and rider formations , as bmc racing did after the giro d'italia in may garminsharp , which won the tour s last team time trial , in 2011 , abandoned race radio in favor of giving riders direction over a loudspeaker mounted on the trailing car and sky , with four of its nine riders based in or around nice , had intimate knowledge of the course but none of them were able to best oricagreenedge garminsharp finished sixth , sky third and bmc racing ninth , 26 seconds off the pace riders on each team are given the same finishing time tuesday s time trial was not decisive in terms of the overall classification , but bmc s finish put cadel evans 23 seconds behind chris froome , the sky captain , who is three seconds behind gerrans a time trial is perhaps the only time professional cycling resembles golf riders or teams who finish early are left to watch their rivals complete the course orica went off toward the end of the afternoon , but there were still four teams behind it as the day ended , though , with only radioshack left on the course , the excitement was palpable we did a great time trial , we 're happy , gerrans told french television as he waited for the final results we 'll have to see what happens , he said diplomatically , but then broke into a big smile
huntingdon , tenn miranda learned she was pregnant on her 18th birthday last september she and her mother soon painted the nursery pink with brown accents , as they had seen in catalogs miranda knew it was going to be a girl , and she had a name ready akyia nicole by march , the room was in perfect order , as if the baby might arrive in the next moment , not the next month a mobile dangled over the crib , and the changing table was stocked with diapers and wipes on top was an album of ultrasound pictures she s got my chin , miranda said , finding detailed lines in the shadowy shapes you re crazy , her mother , theresa , said with a laugh a rocking chair sat in the corner the closet was filled with frilly clothes and lots of little shoes , as if every day of akyia s life would be sunday the bedroom next door was miranda s room the door was covered in stickers and drawings with colorful pens , and the walls had posters of justin bieber and lil wayne under a window was a cage with a hamster named sniffers at the foot of miranda s twin bed was a portable playpen , assembled and ready for use i know i ll be a good mom , she said but it s kind of scary i ve never raised a baby the edge of one bedroom wall held four certificates of which miranda was especially proud one was a certificate from carroll academy another was a high school diploma , granted by the state of tennessee the other two were for completing programs at drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers in 2011 years ago , miranda was found to have depression and bipolar disorder she became a heavy drinker in her midteens she was known to explode in anger she put me through some stuff , her mother said what kind of trouble was she not getting in \? carroll academy changed her around that was the best thing that could have ever happened to her at carroll academy , after her time in rehabilitation , miranda played center on the basketball team , but she did not score any points she missed two free throws during a game at big sandy high , her previous school and i always make my free throws , she said but i guess i was so nervous doing it in front of big sandy , and i missed them i was so mad , too teammates adored her , because she was earnest and cheerful , never judgmental , with an easily enticed giggle some kids that go there , when they get out of there , they still do the same stuff they did before , miranda said her round belly pointed toward the ceiling as she sat in the rocking chair where she expected to hold her newborn baby in the coming weeks some people learn from it some people don t but i did i don t remember when s the last time i ve been in some trouble it s been a long dang time miranda was one of nine girls on carroll academy s girls basketball team in 201112 , a squad that won none of its 32 games and lost many of them by more than 50 points that loose band of troubled teens , assigned to the school by the county juvenile court system , extended the program s losing streak to 184 games this season , another winless one , pushed it to 213 like all carroll academy teams , last year s lady jaguars were temporarily tossed together by circumstance and disbanded at season s end the nine girls splintered in different directions several earned their way back to regular school , as they called it a couple stayed at carroll academy and played on this past year s team one moved to illinois to live with her father three of the girls , however , graduated last year miranda , destiny and summer were freed from the binds of school , unshackled from the juvenile court system , and set adrift in the broader world of west tennessee they shared one unpredicted sentiment each wished , in a way , that she could go back to carroll academy they found that life was harder outside the school than inside it none of the girls had jobs none went to college or trade school none had a place of her own all spent their days in relative isolation , finding structure and routine mostly in the daytime television schedule destiny and summer regularly smoked marijuana and drank alcohol miranda was about to join summer as an unwed teenage mother they were caught between two worlds the one of rules and order that they left behind , and the one filled with responsibilities they did not imagine and hopes they could not reach our job here is to keep them out of custody and give them the education , said the carroll academy director randy hatch , who grew up in huntingdon then we turn them loose into the world no different than huntingdon high school , where the locals go we re putting them out into the world what s for them to do \? what is out there \? all three girls applied multiple times to the various fastfood restaurants in their towns each pondered more education at one of the region s technical schools but the lack of jobs , and the cost of cars and gas to navigate the stretchedout landscape , made even the first steps into the real world daunting , if not unmanageable so they waited , frozen in time and place for someone who s 18 , you ve got one of two choices , that i see , hatch said you re either going to go to college , if you can get in , or you re going to join the military if you can find a job , it s going to be by the hour you re not going to find something that s going to help you raise a family those jobs are just not here destiny had no car and earned money babysitting for a friend summer had a 2yearold and a brokendown car in the front yard miranda dreamed of cosmetology school before she became pregnant in march , she said her next goal was to move to paris paris , tenn , a nearby town of 10 , 000 none of the girls wanted to leave ambitions rarely extend past the horizon i ve said , look , go out and do a 360 , and stand around and just look as far as you can see , hatch said all you see is trees i call it the tree line and i m telling you , i m promising you , beyond that tree line , there is a world of opportunity not to say there isn t here but there s a world of opportunity and you re going to have to reach out and find it the problem is , how do they get out beyond the tree line , whether it s through education or finding a job or something \? it s really difficult for most of her pregnancy , miranda did not want to discuss the baby s father it was a friend , she said , someone she had hoped to start dating regularly before she became pregnant but then the two split , and miranda learned she was pregnant , and she had not talked to him since she told him that the baby was his she hoped he would come around i want her to have a father in her life , she said in march and the child support miranda s reluctance in discussing the baby s father stemmed from the fact that he was black the 2010 census counted 557 residents of big sandy none were listed as black black people would be scared to come here , miranda said the only time they would come would be at night , and then they d still be scared why at night \? because no one would see them , she explained theresa , 44 , grew up in the area she said its reputation for being unfriendly to blacks was once deserved , and has been hard to shake the winding roads to big sandy are lined with several homes flying confederate flags i think it s changed a lot since i was little , theresa said miranda waited many months before she told her mother about the baby s father i didn t really say nothing , theresa said i just don t believe in blacks and whites together i ain t got nothing against black people it s just that i don t believe in it i don t know maybe it s just how i was raised or whatever but i don t have a problem with them whatsoever miranda planned to stay in her mother s house for at least a few months after the baby was born , but wanted to move to paris , where blacks make up about 20 percent of the population and mixedrace babies are increasingly common theresa agreed that it might be best to have akyia grow up outside big sandy on april 12 , at a hospital about 90 minutes away in jackson , akyia nicole was born she was 8 pounds 5 ounces and deemed perfectly healthy miranda did not try to reach akyia s father he doesn t know she was born yet , she said , more than a month after the birth and i don t feel like telling him if she wants to know her father , i ll tell her but until then , no i don t want her father in and out of her life i ve had two fathers a biological one and a stepfather and neither of them are in my life maybe that s where that comes from into the summer , three generations lived together in the woods outside big sandy miranda , owner of a drivers license after about a dozen failed attempts on the written test , proudly drove akyia to see friends from carroll academy , like her old basketball coach , tonya lutz she posted photos of akyia on facebook almost every day the freshly painted and wellequipped nursery went virtually unused akyia slept every night with miranda , in the bedroom with its walls covered in posters of justin bieber and certificates from carroll academy , and where a small cage under the window was home to a hamster named sniffers for the fourth day in a row , destiny sat on the living room couch , watching a dvd of the movie welcome home roscoe jenkins she lived rentfree in a brick duplex in the town of milan , spelled like the northern italian fashion capital but pronounced mylin in west tennessee it is not far from dresden and paris , other small towns named for grander places destiny , 18 , knew a 22yearold woman named melissa , who saw in destiny a little bit of herself a troubled background , a life on the verge , a need for help destiny had a high school diploma from carroll academy , the same school melissa attended for several years but destiny had no job , no car , no money and no place to live melissa , with a new job as a homecare provider helping patients get fed , use the bathroom and keep their homes clean asked destiny to come live with her this spring melissa had two daughters , ages 3 and 6 , and wanted destiny to walk them to school and to day care , and be there to greet them at the end of the day melissa paid destiny 40 a week and bought most of her food she did not charge rent d j s been running from place to place , not having any place to go , melissa said , using destiny s nickname when the job called me , i knew i had to have somebody help me it s me versus the world i ve got to make a way for me and my kids period but i knew d j was in need , too she needed a place to stay and a place to call home she wouldn t have to worry about where she was going to sleep at night a year earlier , destiny was the best player on the carroll academy lady jaguars , the leading scorer in all but two games she was a tough , sometimes pugnacious point guard , equally adept at putting her head down and driving toward the basket or lofting rainbow 3pointers in the final game , she scored 28 points in a 5232 loss , one of the closer contests of the season but she had tenuous , strained relationships with her parents , and often killed time on street corners and in the living rooms of acquaintances , stumbling into her next high she slept wherever she was invited part of the group that destiny hung around with included a halfsister of melissa s they grew close , and destiny got a tattoo of the girl s first initial on her left arm \( on her right arm , she had an incomplete cross that she created with a doityourself tattoo kit \) but they went their separate ways this spring , and melissa reached out to destiny as long as she stays around people who are going to motivate her , people who are going places and want to do things , she ll be fine , melissa said destiny said she often woke up , got the children to school and day care , and returned to bed she spent hours each day watching television she began playing basketball for the first time since she left carroll academy with boys at a nearby playground milan is about 20 miles from huntingdon , and other towns where destiny knew people distractions were few , and with no car , usually out of reach i wanted to get out of carroll county , destiny said there was too much drama here , i don t hardly know nobody , so i can t just walk out and see people , like , hey what s up \? it s very good for me i like it but weekends brought parties , and destiny found her way to more than a few even in the quiet hours at home , she found herself regularly smoking marijuana if i really wanted to stop , i don t have to have it , destiny said but it removes a lot of stress destiny visited carroll academy for the first time in nearly a year she wore jeans and a shortsleeved yellow knit shirt hatch , the school director , tossed her a carroll academy lady jaguars sweatshirt as she folded herself into a large , padded chair i miss carroll academy , she said i miss it so much i love it here i didn t at first , but now i think dang , they told me those things for a reason it s weird i hated this place with a passion i did i tried to do everything i could to get out it was across the hall , in the bathroom , where destiny had taken a urine test for drugs a year before it immediately came up as positive she worried that her chance at getting a high school diploma was gone , and that a stint in jail was possible but now she wore a smile , one that reflected the comfort she had in these hallways , a shelter from the world outside everything hits you , all at once , she said smacks you like , hey , world i like being out of school , but i like being in school , too if you don t have a job , there s nothing to do i d rather be sitting here with a pencil in my hand than sitting at home watching tv a few nights later , she came to a basketball game with summer and constance , two other former lady jaguars she wore a flatbrimmed cap and mostly sneered , interrupting her swagger with occasional bursts of maniacal laughter from across the floor , the girls on the current lady jaguars thought destiny was trying to show off and rolled their eyes those who knew destiny presumed that she was high on something something was not right before the end of the game , destiny was in a sudden and desperate search for a ride she had no car , and worried about how she would get to milan or where she would sleep that night she left abruptly word of her behavior spread through carroll academy the next day tonya lutz , her former coach , called destiny the next day to see that she was ok weeks later , at the home she shared with melissa , destiny was introspective and polite it was early afternoon , and she had cleaned the house and was watching television melissa arrived , between home visits for work , wearing green medical scrubs destiny said that she had applied at all the fastfood places in town , some of them several times but those jobs were hard to get she looked online at options for school , maybe down in jackson or over at the technicaltrade school in mckenzie , but she did not know what she wanted to do besides , she had no car her biggest thing is that she needs transportation , melissa said melissa drove a 2001 buick century with a broken odometer i might get a car and give her mine , she said i feel like she would take care of it i m not going to sign her name to it right away not going to lie but if i ve seen that she s got a job or that she s going to school , i d sign it over to her she s just got to show me she s doing something with it the two of them stepped onto the front porch to smoke cigarettes the house sat on an ushaped street lined with small brick duplexes , public housing for the poor melissa had landed there , a former carroll academy student and admitted former drug addict , now a single mother toting two girls from two fathers , with a job she barely tolerated and a 12yearold car out front she was destiny s steadying influence a year from now \? she ll have a parttime job , melissa said of destiny maybe school she ll be doing something she doesn t like to be doing nothing she s not hard to motivate melissa thought for a moment really , she said , no one s hard to motivate if they see they re getting something out of it a year ago , after the lady jaguars finished their season and before summer was scheduled to graduate , summer stopped going to school she was a single mother , her son nearly a year old , and she was doing drugs again her juvenile probation officer saw summer walking through a neighborhood in mckenzie carroll academy officials called her , urging her to return she was only weeks from getting her diploma a school employee picked up summer and brought her in she sat in the office of hatch , the school s director mr randy said if i didn t come back to school , he d have a warrant out for my arrest in every county i could go to , summer recalled this spring and i d do my homework behind bars i didn t have a choice hatch smiled at the memory i bluffed her , he said carroll academy and the juvenile court system had no jurisdiction over her , since she had turned 18 but i said , if you miss another day , you re going to jail , and we ll bring your books to the jail summer finished school she received her high school diploma by the end of the school year , she was helping tutor other students it was late march this spring , just after her 19th birthday , and summer sat on the couch of the house that her father shared with his girlfriend summer watched television , and her 21monthold son , damarion , played on the shag rug at her feet she wore jeans and a tight tshirt , exposing a tattoo of her son s name below her left collarbone on her abdomen was a tattoo of the name of an aunt who was murdered several years ago in nashville on the inside of her left wrist was a tattoo of red brass knuckles summer s hair was streaked reddishblond , not the light brown that it was the year before the year had not been kind to summer the damage , she admitted , was largely selfinflicted a year ago , i probably would have said i d have a job , have my own place , summer said in her singsong lilt but it s been rough i m still learning everything didn t go as planned it s been hell i ve been through lots of stuff she bounced from home to home , a string of trailers and old motels with a shifting cast of friends and roommates she became pregnant again but awoke one morning to stomach pain and soon learned from the doctor that she lost the baby she got into two fights with other girls , behavior that helped land her at carroll academy for her senior year of high school last summer , she said , she smoked marijuana and took several adderall pills that she said a friend s mother gave them i was up more than 24 hours , summer said all of a sudden , i was sitting there , writing a letter , and i started feeling sick my head hurt and my vision was wigging out everything was shifting , all crazy i was laying there , and it felt like my heart was going to come out of my chest i was crying and praying freaking out i finally fell asleep someone called it speedballing after that , i kind of slowed down summer said that she still smoked marijuana most days she drank often , too cheap vodka , mostly when someone else watched damarion , often her mother , living with her own mother about 20 miles away , summer and her friends sometimes bought pineapple soda , or other flavored soft drinks they dumped out half of the soda and filled the void with vodka now we re buying lemonadeflavored vodka , she said for part of the year , summer received 142 a month , and a 15 gas card , she said , from tennessee s families first program it required that she spend a set number of hours looking for a job she applied mostly at fastfood places and at walmart she even talked to a marine recruiter , summer said , but she does not want to leave damarion behind for military service for those unable to find work , the welfare program required community service summer worked at a salvation army retail store until she argued with a supervisor and walked out the welfare checks soon stopped summer s father and his girlfriend , a woman in her 20s with two children , were engaged on valentine s day by then , summer had returned to live with them , in a wellkept ranchstyle house on the bend of a country road , a couple of miles off the highway that connects mckenzie and gleason for summer , it was a blessing and a curse away from the troublesome distractions that always seemed to pull her in , but uncomfortably distant to friends and the world she knew she had no transportation an old nissan maxima could be hers , but it sat broken down in the driveway , its problems too expensive to repair her connections were largely through facebook , her postings mostly streamofconsciousness doodles of scattered emotions damarion s father , a former carroll academy student , spent part of the past year in jail after being caught by the police with a large stash of marijuana summer said she had not seen him for months , until he was out on a workrelease program , and they bumped into each other at a party he worked at mcdonald s and spent weekends back in jail , summer said , which is why he missed her birthday party , where her father barbecued and there was a bonfire in the backyard and people crowded around the television to watch an ultimate fighting bout but he paid her 300 a month in child support , she said , and with the blessing of summer s father , eventually moved in to the house we re saving money to get a place together , summer said in march i m doing better now that i m back with him , i ve got my priorities right my family my little family i m trying to get a job and get out of here a few weeks later , damarion s father had moved out summer was a leader of the 201112 lady jags , a charismatic , fasttalking senior during one game , she collided with an opponent and split the corner above her right eye she wobbled to the bench and passed out an ambulance carried her to the hospital , where she had several stitches that left a scar summer liked it , but it had faded over the past year she had been a good athlete as a girl , spending years on travel softball teams it was when she quit those teams in her midteens , her father said , that she stumbled into trouble , filling the vacant hours with drugs and delinquency that divide is reflected in a daytoday life of contradictions summer can seem two different people she picked fights on facebook and spoke the foul language of ghetto bravado she finished notes with smiley faces and had insightful conversations with perfect grammar spongebob squarepants blared on the television damarion walked around , chewing on snacks and clinging to his mother when he knocked over a cup of sprite , summer quickly and gently dabbed it from the new rug when i went to carroll academy , i had someone to talk to , she said the students and the teachers , they could understand where you re coming from , because they know what it s like they re not judgmental she checked her phone for messages and then you get out , and you have no one to talk to , she said there s no one to support you i guess that s part of growing up recently , summer and damarion moved out on their own , into a small apartment in huntingdon it is not far from carroll academy
los angeles as a special guest for southern california s spring football game on april 13 , andy enfield had a sideline pass after taking care of his news media responsibilities , which have become part of his daily routine , he wanted to pay close attention to the game enfield considers himself a big football fan about midway through the game , a play developed in the vicinity of enfield a defensive back was chasing a wide receiver toward the sideline after some quick calculations , enfield realized he had a splitsecond to avoid being pulverized by 450 pounds of colliding muscle he somehow hurtled to safety , his instincts as a college athlete still apparent , and yet the entire episode was basically business as usual for enfield , whose career trajectory over the past five weeks has been fast and furious , everything coming at him at once if i could pick one word , he said on a recent weekday morning , it would be nonstop' enfield was hired as the men s basketball coach at usc on april 1 , vaulting from relative anonymity to the realm of pseudocelebrity because of the job he did at florida gulf coast remember the eagles \? they became the first no 15 seed in the ncaa men s tournament to advance to the round of 16 , employing enfield s whizbang brand of offensive pyrotechnics to maul georgetown and san diego state while captivating the basketball world enfield , 43 , now faces an even greater challenge reviving a dormant program in a city with no shortage of distractions los angeles has the lakers , the clippers and the dodgers los angeles has hollywood starlets , warm beaches and innout burger in this crowded market , usc men s basketball has been an afterthought , hindered by decades of mediocrity enfield wants to change all that if it happens , he said , it will not be by accident you have to build something , said enfield , who likened coaching to running a small business you have to communicate with your employees you have to show up every day wanting to improve you have to create a culture and a brand enfield is already making changes several weeks ago , he had a wall torn down in his office to create additional space for meetings for now , he and his assistants are making do with dining room furniture though he is capable of improvising , enfield also prepares after every meeting , he prints spreadsheets for his staff the material might cover recruiting , game strategy or coming travel he s the most organized person i 've ever met , the assistant tony bland said at least until his family relocates from florida at the end of the academic year , enfield is living at a radisson near galen center , which houses usc s gymnasium and basketball offices enfield said he thought he had no choice but to pull 16hour days , arriving for work at 5 30 am he needs to recruit and he needs to promote , especially as he tries to extricate the trojans from the morass of a 1418 season that included the dismissal of coach kevin o'neill pat haden , usc s athletic director , said it was a priority for him to hire a coach who would establish an uptempo style of offense enfield was a check in that box florida gulf coast averaged 729 points a game last season and was at its most dynamic in the tournament , scoring 78 points in its openinground win over georgetown and 81 points against san diego state in the round of 32 , giving rise to dunk city as a cultural meme it s what our fans want and our players want in southern california , said haden , a former usc quarterback and rhodes scholar the halfcourt style , while i know it s been really successful at a lot of places , it just does n't resonate in los angeles enfield s biography has become something close to hagiography at this point after growing up in pennsylvania \( where he was his high school s valedictorian \) , he attended johns hopkins \( where he set the ncaa division iii record for freethrow percentage in 1991 , 953 , which has since been broken \) and worked for a stretch in the technology sector \( where he helped build a successful startup \) he spent the past seven seasons coaching in florida , first as an assistant at florida state and then as the coach at florida gulf coast and yes , he married a supermodel enfield has lived most of his life on the east coast , but he does not want to be perceived as an outsider here he cannot afford to be , not when it comes to the highstakes business of recruiting i 've spent significant time in the los angeles area , he said yet enfield recognizes that his west coast roots are not particularly deep it was no accident that he quickly hired two assistants with long ties to southern california bland , who was an assistant at san diego state , was a standout at westchester high school , an area powerhouse and jason hart , who was on the coaching staff at nearby pepperdine , played and coached at los angeles high schools one of the first things he told me was , hey , we 're going to recruit nationally , but we need to take care of home we need to take care of la , ' bland said usc has a rare opportunity to gain some traction after a handful of substandard seasons , ucla has its own new coach , steve alford the bruins have long cast a long shadow over their crosscity , conference rivals so much so that it has never been that much of a rivalry ucla has won 11 national titles usc has made two appearances in the final four , and none since 1954 in 2006 usc invested about 145 million in the construction of galen center , and it seemed to spark renewed interest in the program tim floyd took the team to three straight tournament appearances , from 2007 to 2009 but that success was undermined by allegations that the star guard o j mayo had accepted improper benefits the o j mayo mess , as haden described it , led to floyd s resignation and penalties that included scholarship cuts and a postseason ban you need stability , haden said i told andy you have an athletic director who is going to be incredibly supportive of basketball you 're going to have all the resources you need' enfield met more daunting obstacles at florida gulf coast , but there are those who point to his relative inexperience is he a onehit wonder \? can he do it again \? in his new office at the bigger university with the bigger budget , enfield is tackling the same challenges everybody , he said , loves the underdog story
house speaker john boehner threw an incendiary device into the immigrationreform debate yesterday but it could just have been a smoke bomb politico reported that he promised republicans in a closed meeting on tuesday that he would not allow an immigration bill to come to a vote unless a majority of republicans supported it that is , he would invoke the hastert rule , an informal , oftenviolated principle named for the former speaker who codified it , in which only the majority of the majority gets to decide what passes , shutting out the democratic minority completely given that a hardline faction of house republicans will never accept an immigration bill that includes legalization for millions of undocumented immigrants a key element of comprehensive reform that hardcore republicans condemn as unthinkable amnesty that could mean death on arrival for the bipartisan legislation now moving through the senate mr boehner has suspended the hastert rule before , in order to pass necessary legislation and to sidestep ridicule for his party but politico , citing an anonymous source , quoted mr boehner as saying i have no intention of putting a bill on the floor that will violate the principles of our majority and divide our conference one of our principles is border security i have no intention of putting a bill on the floor that the people in this room do not believe secures our borders it s not gonna happen mr boehner has the famously difficult job of presiding over a governing body that includes some tea party members rabidly opposed to governing there is an overourdeadbody caucus on immigration that will never consider anything president obama or the democrats want , especially if it includes anything involving legalization more border security , of course but amnesty , never we can only hope that mr boehner was telling these people what they wanted to hear , with tactically vague language leaving open the possibility that at some future date , comprehensive legislation could make it through the house this could happen after the house has passed its own version of immigration reform , maybe an array of individual bills on border and workplace enforcement and other things , and after that legislation is merged with the senate bill in a conference committee this is all theorizing , since the senate hasn t even finished its bill yet but if mr boehner does the right thing , he would go a long way to leading his party out of the wilderness of immigration extremism if he bends to the will of the hardliners , he wouldn t none of this changes the fact that mr boehner s message is the wrong one what those republicans wanted to hear was bad for their party and bad for the country the united states can t enforce its way to an immigration solution deporting millions of people through new enforcement and sealing the border tight if such things were even possible will not keep the immigration system from failing no matter the tea party zealots will tell you , it is possible to pass a bill that includes the smartest and soundest immigration policy , that solves the republican party s broken relations with latinos , that secures the border and that gives the country the 21stcentury immigration system it needs such a bill could pass there are enough republicans and democrats to send it straight through both houses and onto mr obama s desk but it would need the help of that thing what do you call it \? majority rule democracy an upordown vote
as more schools consider arming their employees , some districts are encountering a daunting economic hurdle insurance carriers threatening to raise their premiums or revoke coverage entirely during legislative sessions this year , seven states enacted laws permitting teachers or administrators to carry guns in schools three of the measures in kansas , south dakota and tennessee took effect last week but already , , the liability insurance provider for about 90 percent of kansas school districts , has sent a saying that schools permitting employees to carry concealed handguns would be declined coverage we are making this underwriting decision simply to protect the financial security of our company , the letter said in northeast indiana , douglas a harp , the sheriff of noble county , offered to deputize teachers to carry handguns in their classrooms less than a week after 26 children and educators were killed in a school shooting in newtown , conn a community member donated 27 , 000 in firearms to the effort school officials from three districts seemed ready to sign off but the plan fell apart after an insurer refused to provide workers' compensation to schools with guncarrying staff members the oregon school boards association , which manages liability coverage for all but a handful of the state s school districts , recently announced a new pricing structure that would make districts pay an extra 2 , 500 annual premium for every staff member carrying a weapon on the job scott whitman , an administrator at the jackson county school district in southern oregon , where a committee is looking at arming school staff members next year , said costs would be a factor in the decision with 10 buildings , the expense of arming and training more than one staff member at each school would easily exceed 50 , 000 a year pretty much every last bit of our money is budgeted , he said , adding , to me , that could be quite an impediment to putting this forward increasing the number of firearms in classrooms across the country has been the cornerstone of the national rifle association s response to the newtown massacre and the legislative fights over proposed gun laws that followed it in april , the gunrights group that called for armed police officers , security guards or staff members in every american school more than 30 state legislatures introduced bills that permit staff members to carry guns in public or private schools this year , according to the national conference of state legislatures supporters say training teachers to carry guns would better protect students and , if anything , should put insurance companies more at ease but worries remain about who could be sued if a gunrelated accident occurred on school property , giving way to business realities for some insurance providers , which include both commercial carriers and nonprofit cooperatives some are saying this is so high risk we 're not going to touch it , said kenneth s trump , the president of national school safety and security services , which discourages districts from implementing concealed carry policies others may say this is so high risk that you 're going to pay through the nose few districts in the nation currently allow teachers to carry firearms in k12 schools those that do are often in rural areas where it could take a while for first responders to arrive it is still too soon to tell whether that number will rise as more states consider laws , as many administrators have started discussing the matter with parents and school lawyers only in the past six months jenny emery , head of the association of governmental risk pools , said none of her members plan to withhold coverage like emc but many are strongly recommending other security alternatives , she said , noting that cooperatives provide some form of risk financing to about 80 percent of public entities across the country i have n't seen evidence yet that suggests people are determining that arming teachers is a recommended way to manage risk , she said far from it still , insurers in some states said they were unsure how to approach the subject when the time comes days after the new law took effect in tennessee last week , the state s largest k12 insurance provider , tennessee risk management trust , had not reached a conclusion about whether the price of its coverage would increase if employees carried guns firearm training rules for teachers in south dakota , which , have not yet been approved , in part delaying serious talks between districts and their underwriters because it s not something the schools are considering , the issue really has n't become full blown yet , said wade pogany , the executive director of the associated school boards of south dakota i think it will eventually after the kansas law passed in april , more than a dozen school administrators across the state were mulling a move to arm their staffs , according to david shriver , who oversees insurance programs at the kansas association of school boards he stopped getting calls about it as soon as emc made its policy clear , he said if there s no insurance available , he added , it s difficult to do anything in an email statement , mick lovell , vice president for business development at emc , said the company , which is based in des moines , was upholding its longheld guidelines that school security should be provided only by qualified law enforcement officers for three kansas community colleges , which were insured by emc but decided to allow concealed carry on their campuses under the new law , the search for another insurance provider was easier than expected dan barwick , the president of independence community college , said his college and two others recently signed a joint insurance plan with another company at a rate that he expected would save the group about 2 million over the next decade advocates for arming teachers point to the colleges as evidence that some insurance providers are willing to stomach the risk , should k12 schools in kansas decide to shop around what will happen is the market will take care of this , said forrest knox , a kansas state senator who helped pass the concealed carry legislation other companies are going to do the dollars and cents that theory is certainly true in states like texas , where strong tort protections have made it easier for about 30 districts to arm their employees this year dubravka romano , who oversees a cooperative that insures about half of the state s 1 , 035 districts , said schools there were not charged extra for having guns on campus one such district , harrold independent , has switched insurance providers twice since it started arming employees in 2007 , saving around 5 , 000 a year with each move david thweatt , the superintendent , would not disclose how many armed employees patrol school hallways , but he said fears of increased liability were overblown there have been no gunrelated accidents or injuries at harrold schools since the policy started , he said the only time we 've had to use a firearm , he said , was to shoot at a wild pig
ann arbor , mich the nhl s schedule of six outdoor games , its most ever , will begin wednesday with the winter classic before an expected crowd of about 110 , 000 at michigan stadium that game and three others are sold out or nearly sold out but two other outdoor games are about 80 percent sold , according to the nhl the los angeles kingsanaheim ducks game at dodger stadium on jan 25 and the rangersislanders game at yankee stadium on jan 29 the game between the rangers and the devils on jan 26 at yankee stadium , the first nhl game to be played there , sold out three weeks ago but many of the higherpriced tickets remain for the rangersislanders game three days later , on a wednesday night rather than a sunday afternoon that game is also generating a relatively low response on the ticket resale market the nhl s schedule of six outdoor games is a big increase over the one or two the league had staged in recent years none were held last season , when an owners' lockout forced the cancellation of about half the schedule the stadium series was created partly to make up for the lost revenue from the lockout according to ticketmaster , the league s ticket dealer , two outdoor games were sold out as of monday morning the rangersdevils game at yankee stadium and the blackhawkspenguins game march 1 at soldier field in chicago as of monday afternoon , a single ticket remained for wednesday s winter classic between detroit and toronto , according to ticketmaster section 312 , row 5 , seat 4 that game is expected to set a world record for hockey attendance a few scattered seats remained for the heritage classic between the vancouver canucks and the ottawa senators on march 2 that game will be played in vancouver , british columbia , at bc place last week , the nhl cut prices for some tickets to the kingsducks game , the first nhl regularseason game played outdoors at a warmweather site a ticketmaster sales agent said monday morning that a lot of seats remained for the kingsducks game at all prices , which range from 49 to 279 the agent said plenty of higherpriced tickets remained for the rangersislanders game at yankee stadium seats were available for 238 , 288 and 308 , but tickets at prices from 79 to 198 were sold out , as were the highestpriced tickets at 349 according to one key measure , the volume of tickets available on the resale market , the rangersislanders game is generating the lowest demand among the six outdoor games some 24 , 000 listings for the game were posted on ticket resale websites , according to , a site that aggregates major reseller marketplaces like stubhub , ticketsnow and ebay that figure stands in sharp contrast to the 1 , 400 to 9 , 800 ticket listings tiqiq found for the other five nhl stadium games jesse lawrence , tiqiq s chief executive officer , said the 24 , 000 listings for the rangersislanders game translated to roughly 15 , 000 actual tickets available on the resale market he said the average resale price for a rangersislanders ticket at yankee stadium , 255 , was significantly lower than that for a rangersdevils stadium ticket , 327 lawrence also said that the average price for rangersislanders stadium tickets on the secondary market had dropped by about 5 percent in the last week , another indicator of relatively light demand rangersdevils prices have held steady one game at yankee stadium , nobrainer high demand , high price , lawrence said two games , a little bit different but this is the first time the nhl has done so many outdoor games they 'll measure demand , see what it looks like in more markets , and i'm sure next year , they 'll apply what they 've learned even if the rangersislanders and kingsducks games do not sell out , the nhl will still reap benefits in terms of publicity and increased visibility in the two biggest media markets , new york and los angeles the yankee stadium games will be sharing the spotlight , though , with the super bowl , which will be held feb 2 at metlife stadium

year s extravaganza , which runs through july 28 , has 62 performances by artists and troupes from 10 different countries that s fewer than last year s 85 performances , but more than the 47 presented in 2010 it is pared down from previous years in other ways , though there is no dance , no film , no art or video installation and hardly any complementary seminars and lectures nor is there a marathon foreign epic that requires survivalist skills that may disappoint some dance fans who have become accustomed to seeing the mariinsky ballet or merce cunningham dance there speaking of this omission , linda shelton , the executive director of the , which specializes in dance , said , i did notice it when i got the brochure although she admitted being unable to suppress a selfinterested pang of glee i thought , less competition for us' ms shelton pointed out that some festival productions , like monkey , do incorporate dance ultimately , what characterizes the lincoln center festival is that it cannot be characterized , mr redden said we are a very different festival than those that are discipline specific , he said we do n't have a formula , and we have the luxury of being scattersite , and using a range of theaters every year the lack of a formula the major attraction , said mark russell , the artistic director and producer of the under the radar festival at the public theater that s actually why i count on this festival , he said there s always a surprise every festival is a combination of soaring artistic ambition , gritty logistical details and scheduling kismet those forces aligned this year for monkey which mr redden said he had first started talking about in 2006 but they did not for a dance company \( mr redden , who also serves as general director of the spoleto festival usa in charleston , sc , brought monkey there in 2008 \) so he decided to try something new and schedule 27 performances of monkey to run for the entire length of the festival at the david h koch theater , the usual stage for dance troupes it demands a longer run , mr redden said of the large and complicated production , and it demands word of mouth as for michaels reise um die erde \( michael s journey around the world \) , an excerpt from s 29hour opera cycle licht , mr redden said the festival had been on the lookout for a work by this composer but did not have a particular piece in mind if dance is not on the calendar , other festival favorites are simon mcburney s british theater company is back for its fourth engagement and its second collaboration with setagaya public theater of japan the play based in the writings of , is about the relationship between a blind musician and her servant lover in 19thcentury japan and includes puppetry by blind summit theater aur lia thierr e and her mother , the groundbreaking director , are returning with a dreamlike show that includes the american dancer jaime d martinez and the swedish circus artist magnus jakobsson s twonight appearance grew out of a previous engagement at lincoln center she came here last year as part of the curtis mayfield tribute and was very moved , mr redden said she decided she wanted to do something different and wanted to do work with gospel music , something one would not particularly associate with her what remains unchanged is the festival s motivating force the desire to attract new visitors to its upper west side campus the first time someone steps over the threshold is the most difficult time , mr redden said lincoln center has always been coy about the cost of the threeweek event , and declined to release budget figures new york s polyglot population means there is a builtin audience for attractions from farflung places still , the unfamiliar offerings and hardtopronounce names can be hard to sell out in 2002 , for example , the festival sold 83 percent of its 107 , 481 tickets while last year it sold more than 88 percent of its 81 , 013 seats , said betsy vorce , a lincoln center spokeswoman this year , 92 , 599 tickets are available competition from international arts events hosted by other institutions in the city or even other programming efforts at lincoln center itself are not a concern , mr redden insisted in new york , you can create a festival for yourself every weekend , he said we make a rule of trying not to compete with what else is going on in town jedediah wheeler , the artistic director of the series in montclair , nj , praised mr redden s approach good programming is filled with surprises , he said , and hopefully annoys a few people
shinzo abe has taken japan off in a surprisingly keynesian direction noah smith points out , again , that he s probably doing it for disreputable reasons , mainly oldfashioned ldp porkbarrel \( katsu barrel \? tofu barrel \? \) politics but this may not matter noah also raises a different point does japan really need a big boost \? he points to the low measured unemployment rate after a couple of decades of watching japanese unemployment numbers , i don t think that tells us much but there is a case to be made that japan s economy is in better shape than most people believe overall gdp growth since the crisis has been roughly comparable to the euro area , but with far worse demography in fact , given that japan s workingage population is actually shrinking , there s a reasonable argument to the effect that japan is closer to potential output than the us but if japan is doing relatively well in cyclical terms , it s still far from clear that macroeconomic caution is appropriate after all , japan has a much longerterm monetary issue persistent deflation , which among other things has meant that japanese real interest rates have been well above those in the united states even though nominal rates are low \( i wrote about that here \) what japan needs , then , is to boot itself out of its deflationary trap and a situation where there isn t too much economic slack is actually a very good time to do that and here s an important point that has gone remarkably unreported , except on a few financial blogs something dramatic does seem to be happening on the expected inflation front here s the 5year breakeven , the spread between indexed and nonindexed bonds the big move actually came before abe took office , maybe reflecting the sense that the political environment had changed and that the bank of japan s freedom to impose monetary orthodoxy was about to end whatever caused it , this is a remarkable change it s the kind of upward move in inflation expectations advocates of radical monetary policy in the us can only dream of and coupled with a fiscal boost , it could mean that japan s long deflationary era is finally coming to an end so while i very much dislike what abe stands for on cultural issues , and take very seriously noah smith s warning that he may be basically about patronage politics , none of that matters on the macro front it sure looks as if japan is , for whatever reason , doing the kinds of things an economy still stuck in the lesser depression should be doing
tampa , fla oldtimers day went smoothly at the ' training camp sunday two 40andover stars ascended the mound to face hitters in a simulated game , while the 38yearold went through his workouts and reported that he was on track to be with the team on opening day , who is returning for his 18th season after an abbreviated 2012 , threw to hitters for the first time this spring on a chilly weekend morning with fewer than two dozen fans witnessing the event it was only two innings of a fake game , but pettitte seemed energized about how well he threw and about the prospect of pitching at least one more season , perhaps even into october i'm loving being back , he said i'm excited about the season , and obviously i'm all in for this club and this organization to try to help us win another championship same old story hope we all can just stay healthy and make a good run at this thing health will be vital for all the yankees , but particularly pettitte , who made only 12 starts last year after starting the season late and later he made only 21 starts in his previous season of 2010 , because of a groin injury opposing pettitte on the mound was , 43 , who threw one inning and looked as treacherous as ever rivera is making his methodical return from that he sustained last may 3 at kansas city , and appeared to be on track to start the season april 1 he made one nasty pitch that the righthanded hitter matt diaz managed to bounce up the middle rivera smiled and yelled at him , how do you hit that \? how do you throw that \? diaz yelled back rivera said his next step might be to throw in a spring game , but he will not rush it i 've waited 10 months i can wait a few more days , he said jeter is progressing as planned and is scheduled to play as the designated hitter in a week or so he is recovering from a but said he was feeling no pain where the operation was done he , too , is professing patience , but there are signs he may be antsy when asked about pettitte and rivera , he said , i almost tried to jump in there , but i did n't know about it until i got here the yankees may abandon curtis granderson s switch to left field , manager joe girardi told reporters after the yankees' 52 exhibition win over the boston red sox girardi said he was fairly certain that when granderson returned from a broken right arm , probably sometime in may , he would play center field because he would not have any time in spring training to practice playing left yeah , there s a chance i'm going to abandon it , girardi said spring training was supposed to be the testing ground for granderson to reassure girardi that he could smoothly switch to left from center , where he has played in his first three seasons with the yankees brett gardner started in left field against boston while melky mesa was in center , and if the yankees take mesa north for the regular season , it could remain that way if the yankees take another outfielder , like juan rivera , then gardner will be the center fielder , but perhaps only until granderson returns girardi also said there were some configurations that could have ichiro suzuki in left field occasionally the yankees originally wanted to make the shift because they felt gardner was a better outfielder , and because granderson s power profiles more as a left fielder s granderson has started 1 , 043 games in the outfield , but only three in left , and none since 2007 when he does return , he will almost certainly play in minor league rehabilitation game first the yankees could test him out in left field during those games , but they are not certain there would be enough time for that boone logan said he was not concerned about the lingering tenderness in his elbow because a magnetic resonance imaging test friday revealed no ligament damage still , logan said he had never had elbow discomfort quite like this , so there is an uncertain quality to it he said it was diagnosed as inflammation he will begin taking antiinflammatory medication and hopes to start throwing again in the next few days phil hughes resumed throwing for the first time since feb 18 , the day he first felt the discomfort from a bulging disk in his back hughes played catch for a few minutes and said he felt no effects of the injury
one of the most riveting moments in the george zimmerman trial this week was the playing of a police tape that showed what he said happened the night he fatally shot trayvon martin to say that there are inconsistencies between that reenactment and zimmerman s verbal and written testimony elsewhere is to be charitable for instance , in an interview zimmerman gave to the police the night of the shooting , he says of martin i was walking back through to where my car was , and he  however , in the video reenactment , which took place a day after the murder , it s clear not only that there are no bushes near the sidewalk but also that zimmerman never mentions martin s jumping out from anywhere but what i find most interesting is the moment in zimmerman s police interview that night in which zimmerman claims that after martin asked if he had a problem , i got my cellphone out to call 911 this time pay attention to that statement about his cellphone , because it 'll be important to my line of questioning aside from all the other inconsistencies in zimmerman s accounts of the scuffle , the basic physics of the fight as he describes it are hard to make jibe in the reenactment , zimmerman says that after a verbal encounter , i went to go grab my cellphone , martin punched him in the face , zimmerman stumbled or was pushed to the ground by martin , and martin got on top of him zimmerman then says that he started screaming for help and tried to sit up , and that martin then grabbed his head and slapped it on the cement he just kept slamming it and slamming it , zimmerman said it is interesting here , in the video , to watch zimmerman s hands he demonstrates the slamming twice and both times he does so with clenched hands , as if martin was holding something on the sides of his head like his ears but , as has been mentioned in the trial , there was none of zimmerman s blood or dna under martin s fingernails and there were no injuries documented on or near zimmerman s ears how could this be \? and if martin grabbed zimmerman s head some other way , what way was that \? his hair was buzzed short and it was raining that night , so presumably his head was wet when zimmerman was asked in a followup interview how martin grabbed his head , he said he did not recall furthermore , , a medical examiner who reviewed zimmerman s injuries , testified tuesday that the injuries on the back of zimmerman s head were consistent with just one strike against a concrete surface , not multiple ones rao went on to call zimmerman s injuries insignificant and not life threatening , and said , if you look at the injuries , they are so minor they are not consistent with grave force she continued , if somebody s head is banged with grave force i would expect a lot of injuries i do n't see that if you believe rao , the struggle simply could n't have happened as zimmerman described it in the reenactment , zimmerman says that he tried to squirm his head off the concrete , and then he says that s when my jacket moved up , and i had my firearm on my right side hip and , he saw it , i feel like he saw it , he looked at it zimmerman says it is at that point that martin told him that he was going to die that night then zimmerman says he reached for it , but he reached , like i felt his arm going down to my side and i grab it , and i just grabbed my firearm , and i shot him one time this fight scene leaves me particularly incredulous , partly because of what zimmerman is saying , partly because of the forensics and testimony and partly because of what zimmerman demonstrates in the video the idea that martin , while straddling zimmerman , would be able to see a gun that was presumably behind him , and the idea that zimmerman would feel martin s hand snake across his body , pinch that hand underneath his arm and then reach for and retrieve the gun himself if zimmerman s hand was free enough for such a maneuver , were his hands not also free enough to try to push martin off , or force martin to release his head and not bang it against the concrete , or to hit martin back \( which he never says he does during the entire encounter \) \? did zimmerman s mixed martial arts training provide him no defensive options whatsoever \? something about this just does n't sound right and , by the way , how was zimmerman able to get around martin s leg , retrieve the gun and aim it at martin s chest so easily \? this is what happens when you try to make the fight fit zimmerman s telling things do n't make sense but what if we back up to the cellphone moment , before any physical encounter occurred , when zimmerman and martin had their first verbal exchange what if we dispense with zimmerman s version , revisit the order of things and ask a different set of questions \? in the video zimmerman looks to his right front pocket when he says he s looking for the phone that s the same area as the gun , which he says he has on his right hip is it possible that zimmerman did n't go for his phone but for his gun \? and even if he does n't retrieve it , is it possible that he exposed it \? \( in the video , zimmerman demonstrates that he can expose the weapon without even using his hands to lift his jacket \) is it possible that martin first saw the gun when they were standing and talking \? is it possible that the physical struggle was about the presence of a weapon between a man trying to retrieve it and an unarmed teenager who had seen it \? in that scenario , is it possible that martin could be on top of zimmerman and still yelling for help \? is it possible that zimmerman was n't using his hands to fend off martin because he was using them to go for , control , or aim a weapon \? and , what happened to the cellphone zimmerman said he got out just before a prolonged struggle \? he makes no mention of putting it away his key and flashlights were photographed in the grass , as was martin s cellphone they did n't hold on to those things what about zimmerman s phone \? where was it when the police arrived \? \( by the way , the night of the shooting zimmerman says he got the cellphone out the next day , during the reenactment he changes that part of his story , saying i went to go get my cellphone , but my , i left it in a different pocket i looked down at my pant pocket , and he said you got a problem now , ' and then he was here , and he punched me in the face \) these are interesting questions to ponder , the answers to which might make what followed make more sense but of the two people able to answer those questions , one will never take another breath and the other may never take the stand
on sunday , when the times editorial board endorsed christine quinn in the democratic primary campaign for mayor of new york \( and joseph lhota in the republican race \) , we invited readers to weigh in with their own endorsements who was their choice , and why \? so far , bill de blasio is winning that contest , handsdown as of thursday , we have published 502 comments , with the overwhelming majority supporting mr de blasio readers like his message about battling inequality , his campaign s major theme many are simply pleased that he is not ms quinn i support the candidate who i believe has the middle class most firmly in his vision for nyc ! kate from manhattan de blasio s continued commitment to keeping inequality frontandcenter is inspiring and important as bloomberg showed us , the mayor of ny plays an important role in shaping local , national , and even international civic discourse \( look at how many times bloomberg has been in the economist \) , and we need someone who truly gets how important social justice and economic mobility is over the last six years i have watched my adopted city make amazing progress on so many fronts , but i have also seen more and more new yorkers pushed to the sides , completely unable to afford to participate in the new and improved new york a playground for the world s rich is nice to look at and visit , but soulcrushing to live in jesse b from manhattan the difference between quinn and de blasio is that quinn talks about the middle class while de blasio talks about the rich and poor frankly , de blasio s terms better describe who we are as a city look at the census data for 2010 what you see is truly a tale of two cities , as de blasio says mayor quinn will coddle the rich , but who will speak for the poor , the homeless , the unemployed , the marginalized \? we need bill de blasio gregory from manhattan i am tired of seeing neighborhood after neighborhood of nyc being turned into elite enclaves that only the megawealthy can afford , and i refer not only to manhattan christine quinn is unquestionably in the pockets of real estate developers and believes that such development is the hallmark of a city s allure there is much more to life than luxury or simply very expensive housing furthermore , ms quinn did nothing absolutely to nothing to try halt the closure of st vincent s , a vital , if financially troubled , centerpiece of lower manhattan bill de blasio represents an important step in returning ny to a city of vibrant , varied , and accessible life gary giardina from manhattan some readers couldn t get past quinn s support for bloomberg s third term and wanted to support someone completely different bill de blasio will be best for ny , but frankly i ll vote for anyone but quinn ivy from queens quinn can never be forgiven for enabling bloomberg s third term against the law and against the repeatedly expressed will of new yorkers good riddance to the pair of them looking forward to nyc that is once again not just about rampant overdevelopment and moneyed interests , but a vibrant and livable place for all of us ! anonymous from queens in terms of vision where the city should be four years from now mr de blasio is head and shoulders above the others ms quinn and mr thompson are both intelligent , hardworking and truly committed to doing what s best for the most new yorkers possible but , from my perspective , they represent the past ms quinn s comment that she would want to keep comm kelly in place , is a good example anthony n from manhattan ms quinn does have her supporters chris quinn has not promised the world because she knows we can t pay for it i like her practical approach the other serious candidates promise the world i am not interested in unlimited promises , but a working , thriving city she can do the job and , she speaks for herself and has since becoming speaker i don t think the other candidates do the same anonymous from manhattan i believe christine quinn is the whole package in that she has a much better handle on the mulchfaceted needs of the city and also facing the city ms quinn has shown the ability , competence , business knowledge , and gravitas required she has a vision for this city , and is a new yorker through and through , wanting what s best for new york and i believe she s the only one of the candidates who can accomplish the bettering of the city she s not waging decades old battles , she s only looking forward k carroll from bronx i think she s the only candidate who can plausibly wrangle all of new york city s various interests and actually accomplish something at the end of the day andrew from brooklyn of the republican candidates , mr lhota received the most reader endorsements let s just get this over with and elect someone with experience running the city joe lhota is even tempered , analytical and even personable he has integrity and has shown willingness to roll up his sleeves on behalf of his hometown i don t usually vote for republican but the democrats aren t leaving me any choice vote joe clara from queens why lhota \? because rome wasn t built in a day that , however , is what the rest of the candidates are proposing joe lhota s a realist he knows that you can t fix every single problem in new york just by throwing money at it because new york doesn t have money to throw yet the democrats propose spending on huge projects a new position in the police , replacing textbooks with tablets , more housing great ideas , yes but how do we pay for them \? quinn doesn t want to raise taxes \? where , exactly , is she going to get money to pay for a tablet for every student in every school \? de blasio will raise taxes on the rich , but the same thing will happen in new york as in france the rich will leave so who will pay then \? lhota has simple , realistic ideas that will make the city money money first , ideas later mike from staten island of all the candidates its joe lhota best combines the skills necessary for an executive position such as mayor , a job that truly is part politician and part ceo lhota is not a bureaucrat or professional politician like much of the democratic field , yet can draw on years of public sector experience similarly lhota is not a career businessman like catsimatidis but still has valuable private sector experience at companies important to new york s economy its this unique combination of public and private sector experience that qualifies lhota as the city s next mayor nick from brooklyn in terms of the issues , cost of living seemed to concern most of living seemed to concern most of the readers \( 71 picked that topic \) , along with policing and civil rights \( 43 \) , schools \( 38 \) , jobs \( 38 \) , housing \( 38 \) and poverty \( 37 \) bill de blasio believes in quality for all new yorkers he s right when he says new york must be a city that everyone can afford to live in trina from bronx \( cost of living \) john liu is the only one of bunch who believes that stop and frisk should be ended completely that the nyts could support quinn who loves ray kelly and this racist policy is truly outrageous ! teri from brooklyn \( policing and civil rights \) i ve got 2 children in the nyc public school system , so i m pretty much a single issue voter right now bill de blasio also has kids in the system it s clear that he has an understanding of how bloomberg s reforms are actually working on the ground , ie , too much high stakes testing and a stressful and complex choice system that doesn t seem to be leveling the playing field \( the schools get the choice , not the kids and families \) he s got my vote laura from brooklyn \( schools \) lhota knows what the city needs to compete globally , and to give taxpayers the best return on their money 1 \) quality public services provided in a cost efficient manner 2 \) a growing economy that provides more and better private sector jobs 3 \) real continued focus on crime reduction 4 \) better accountability of teachers under the city s payroll none of the republican or democratic candidates have shown a similar knowledge of best practices , nor a willingness to act in the taxpayer s best interest franklin a e from brooklyn \( jobs \) whom do you endorse \? let us know in the comments section of this editorial comments will remain open until primary day
dublin a woman even while she was having a miscarriage was told that her repeated pleas could not be granted because is a catholic country , an inquest has confirmed in a case that has reignited tensions over ireland s strict abortion laws , ann maria burke , the midwife who attended to the pregnant woman , said at the inquest in galway on wednesday that the remark had come out the wrong way and that she had not meant it to be hurtful the pregnant woman , savita halappanavar , a dentist born in india , had mentioned the hindu faith and that in india a termination would be possible , ms burke said i was trying to be as broad and explanatory as i could it was nothing to do with medical care at all the state coroner , dr ciaran mcloughlin , testified that public hospitals in ireland were not bound by any religious dogma dr halappanavar s husband , praveen , has said the couple were told that the country s catholicism was the reason for the refusal to terminate the pregnancy , even though his wife was in severe pain and they had been informed that the fetus had no chance of survival in ireland , abortion is legal when there is a fetal heartbeat only if there is real and substantial risk to the life of the woman dr halappanavar , 31 , was 17 weeks pregnant when she sought treatment at university hospital galway on oct 21 , complaining of severe back pain dr katherine astbury , a senior obstetrician who had attended to dr halappanavar , said at the inquest that although the fetus s prognosis was poor , she had refused to conduct a termination until the fetus s heartbeat had ceased i recall informing ms halappanavar that the legal position did not permit me to terminate the pregnancy in her case at that time , dr astbury said , referring to a conversation they had on oct 23 she also recalled telling dr halappanavar , who she said was physically well at that point but emotionally distressed , that her only option was to sit and wait for as long as the heartbeat persisted when dr halappanavar s condition began to deteriorate rapidly soon after , dr astbury considered performing an abortion regardless of the presence of a fetal heartbeat , she said on oct 24 the heartbeat ceased and the remains of the fetus were surgically removed but by that time , dr halappanavar had contracted a bacterial blood disease , septicemia she was admitted to intensive care but never recovered , dying on oct 28 the inquest has also heard testimony that several hospital protocols were not followed , amounting to system failures that contributed to dr halappanavar s death dr astbury said she might have intervened sooner had she been made aware of the results of earlier blood tests instead , she relied on clinical signs , none of which pointed to sepsis although limited abortion has been legal since a 1992 supreme court judgment , successive irish governments have failed to introduce legislation giving the ruling full effect under pressure from the council of europe in strasbourg , france , but in the face of stiff opposition from the antiabortion lobby , the current government has promised to introduce such legislation by the end of the summer the inquest , which began monday , is expected to last at least another week
washington justice is a proud daughter of new york city , and her adjustment to life in the nation s capital has been rocky do not get her started , for instance , on ordering takeout i go to new york , i order food , it s at my door in 10 to 15 minutes ok \? she said in an interview in her chambers in washington , she said , there is n't a place i call where it does n't take 45 minutes and then getting the food delivered to the supreme court \? they 've got to stop at security , security has to call you , you 've got to go downstairs by the time you get downstairs you may add another 15 minutes to the 45 minutes and the food is icecold there are four justices from new york city these days , each representing a different borough , and it sometimes seems that the court speaks with a new york accent justice sotomayor , who grew up in the bronx , recalled getting to know justice antonin scalia , who is from queens and whose friends call him nino one day nino looked at me and said you 're a real new yorker i love you you take as well you give , ' she said with a big laugh and i understood you know , we 're just out there and up front and fun she mentioned a second colleague , justice elena kagan i dare say elena has a little bit of that justice kagan is from manhattan , and justice ruth bader ginsburg , who is more reserved , is from brooklyn the boroughs are different , justice sotomayor said , and so are we the occasion for the chat was the publication of justice sotomayor s memoir , my beloved world , this week it is steeped , and it is an exceptionally frank account of the challenges that she faced during her to the court s marble palace on first street justice sotomayor turns out to be a writer of depth and literary flair , a surprise to readers of her judicial prose \( i am a lawyer s judge , she said on hearing the observation i write very technically \) her chambers are sleek , modern , filled with light and bursting with pottery , art and mementos there are photographs of her relatives , a group portrait of the four women ever to serve on the supreme court and one of justice sotomayor with  in a corner , there is a bag overflowing with characters from sesame street , where she has been known to dispense advice \( pretending to be a princess is fun , but it is definitely not a career , , offering alternatives you can go to school and train to be a teacher , a lawyer , a doctor , an engineer and even a scientist \) and there is a sign of the sort you might find in the novelty section of a gift shop wellbehaved women rarely make history justice sotomayor s book ends in 1992 with her appointment to federal district court in manhattan there are only stray references in the memoir to her service there , on the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in new york , where she served from 1998 to 2009 , and on the supreme court but her life story , which includes chapters at princeton , yale law school , the manhattan district attorney s office and private practice as a civil litigator , illuminates her judicial work she acknowledged that she entered the ivy league through a special door and that her adjustment was rough i felt like an alien landing in a different universe , she said of her arrival at princeton her childhood was so urban that she was known to confuse cows for horses i did n't know what a cricket sounded like , she said she was part of a vanguard not always welcomed by the old order in the book , she recalled letters in the daily princetonian lamenting the presence on campus of affirmative action students , ' each of whom had presumably displaced a far more deserving affluent white male and could rightly be expected to crash into the gutter built of her own unrealistic aspirations there were vultures circling , ready to dive when we stumbled , she wrote she did not stumble on graduating , she was awarded the pyne prize , the university s highest undergraduate award , presented for a combination of academic success and extracurricular work asked if the programs from which she benefited are still needed , she was initially vague , perhaps as a consequence of a pending case about the constitutionality of the university of texas s affirmative action plan we have to look and ensure that we 're paying attention to what we 're doing , she said , so that we do n't reflexively institute processes and procedures that exclude people without thought her bottom line , though , was clear we 've got a way to go still , she said i mean , clearly , we do after her second year at law school , justice sotomayor spent a summer working at a prominent new york city law firm , the vast majority of summer associates at big law firms in those days received offers for fulltime jobs , but she did not she called the experience a kick in the teeth asked why she chose to discuss the matter , she said if i write a book where all i 've ever experienced is success , people wo n't take a positive lesson from it in being candid , i have to own up to my own failures , both in my marriage and in my work environment \( she married kevin noonan , now a biologist and patent lawyer , after graduating from princeton in 1976 they divorced in 1983 \) justice sotomayor s affiliations on the supreme court create a complex pattern she is part of the court s fourmember liberal wing , one of its three women , one of its three yale law graduates and one of its four new yorkers she is also one of its six catholics but she said her experience with catholic education , at blessed sacrament school and cardinal spellman high school , was mixed it was a different time and a different generation that believed love was discipline , she said nuns and priests , like every other human being , are products of their environments i was alien to the nuns and priests , too , because none of them were minorities these days , she said , her faith is not entirely conventional i am a very spiritual person , she said , though maybe not traditionally religious in terms of sunday mass every week , that sort of thing the trappings are not important to me , she said , but , yes , i do believe in god and , yes , i do believe in the commandments and , yes , i do believe in their message of thou shalt not kill , ' thou shalt not steal' and the rest of it justice sotomayor said she started to make her peace with life in washington after eight months of grieving she recalled a morning drive down rock creek parkway that allowed her to see the city fresh i thought to myself , this is a really beautiful city , ' she said it s a very different life than new york the pace is really different , and for the breakneck speed at which you live in new york , this could be a little slow at times she has moved to a scruffy part of town , near u street in northwest washington it has a touch of the east village in it , she said i picked it because it s mixed i walk out and i see all kinds of people , which is the environment i grew up in and the environment i love in her book , she confesses that she does not always observe the letter of the law i'm a new yorker , she wrote ,

how she \? ! \? of course if a guy has one of those , it s a triumph all the pleasure , none of the commitment and boys , after all , will be boys we 'll never know precisely what happened on the night in perugia , italy , in 2007 when meredith kercher , 21 , was killed knox , her housemate , was found guilty , then acquitted and will soon , despite the profoundly flawed case against her , face another trial the italian judicial system works about as smoothly as the italian government but we know this the double standard concerning men s versus women s sexuality not only survives but thrives , manifest in the enduring notoriety of foxy knoxy , whose memoir was published on the same day last week that the abc news aired keep the rest of her story the same but make her a man in the midst of erotic escapades abroad are we still gawking \? is abc trumpeting diane sawyer s exclusive sitdown with the lascivious pilgrim \? similar questions can be asked about jodi arias , 32 , whose in arizona was winding down last week the arias case has n't made quite the leap from the tabloids into the mainstream that knox s did but hln , the cable network on which nancy grace fulminates , has enjoyed a ratings bonanza with its saturation coverage of the courtroom proceedings arias has admitted to stabbing , shooting and slashing the throat of a former lover an act of selfdefense , she unpersuasively claims and while his death was certainly grisly enough to explain a baseline of media interest , the amount of attention it has received stems from the courtroom juxtaposition of the defendant , outfitted in nerdy eyeglasses and a frumpy hairstyle , and evidence of what a steamy , pliable playmate she was it stems from pictures of her genitalia that she let her lover take , audiotapes of the phone sex that the two of them had and that she recorded it stems from the shock and censure of such potent female desire knox and arias are n't just women accused of murder they 're accused of murder , sitting in their courtroom seats with scarlet letters emblazoned on their chests , no jury needed to pronounce them guilty of wantonness at the very least for men , lust is a tripwire for women , it s a noose i 've heard quite a bit lately about david petraeus s road to redemption i 've heard less about paula broadwell s yes , he s the more public figure , but the disparity also reflects the way their affair was often portrayed in the first place he strayed she preyed he was weak she was wily he was the fly , she the spider let s bring a few other recent news stories into this let s indulge in a few hypotheticals what if it had been antonia weiner who took to twitter and there had been a different architecture to the image she tweeted \? would she be able even to entertain the idea of a political comeback \? and would the spouse standing dutifully by her be seen as a brave and magnanimous stalwart , the way huma abedin is viewed in some quarters , or dismissed by one and all as a pitiable pushover \? had a southern governor named marcia sanford been entangled with a latin lover when reputedly hiking the appalachian trail , would she today be her party s nominee for an open congressional seat \? we know the answer , and we know that wilhelmina clinton and newtina gingrich would n't have rebounded from their infidelities as robustly as bill and newt did men get passes , women get reputations , and real , lasting humiliation travels only one way the size and scope of that mortification , despite many decades of happy talk about dawning gender equality , are suggested by recent news stories of and who hanged themselves after tales or cellphone pictures of their sexual violation circulated among peers it s impossible not to wonder if shame drove them to suicide , and it s impossible not to ask what sort of world allows the victims of such assaults to feel more irredeemably branded more eternally damned than their accused assailants by all appearances do i 'll tell you what sort a world in which there s a cornucopia of synonyms for whore and slut and no comparably pejorative vocabulary for promiscuous or sexually rapacious men a world in which knox s vibrator and the lingerie she was said to have bought in a perugia store were presented not just as newsworthy but as germane to the charge of murder against her referendums on her character , glimmers of her depravity , clues to precisely how a good girl went bad a world in which her erotic appetite made her a man eater , as the italian press wrote and as the rest of the world more or less parroted a world in which her tally , scribbled on a sheet of paper in her prison cell , of seven sexual partners in all of her life was seen as sensational a similar count for a guy in his early 20s would provoke not derision but disagreement swordsman or slacker \? when we chart and lament the persistence of sexism in society , we look to the united states congress , where women are still woefully underrepresented we look to corporate boardrooms , where the glass ceiling has n't really shattered but we need n't look any further than how perversely censorious of women s sex lives we remain , and how short the path from siren to slut and from angel to shedevil can be
sugar and corn syrup have become a large part of the american diet on average , teenagers get 17 percent of their daily calories from added sugar meanwhile , public health officials have taken note that more and more studies suggest a link between sugar consumption and health issues like obesity and diabetes some go so far as to say that sugar is toxic to our bodies , and as dangerous to our health as cigarettes  in this series of lesson ideas , which can be done individually or together as part of a larger unit , we ll help students investigate the science and myths about added sugars how unhealthy are they \? what happens to sugar when ingested \? how much sugar do we actually consume \? is there a real difference between sugar and corn syrup \? and what has the public health response been , and how could it be better \? our final idea brings the unit together as students create their own public health campaigns 1 how unhealthy is sugar \? the new york times magazine published a cover story investigating whether sugar , in all its forms , was not just a guilty pleasure but was indeed toxic to human health this story ran over a year before mayor bloomberg announced his intention in may 2012 to ban large sugary drinks in new york city sugar , corn syrup and processed sweeteners have been blamed for all sorts of health issues , from tooth decay to obesity but how bad is sugar really \? what does the science say \? suggested activity in pairs , groups or individually , review and discuss the evidence in various scientific studies reported in the times what kinds of claims can be made about the link between sugar and diabetes , obesity , heart disease , weight gain and tooth decay \? what claims have the most evidence \? based on the evidence , and that fact that some of the evidence is inconclusive , what health recommendations would you make about sugar consumption \? 2 what happens to sugar when it enters the body \? sugar is sometimes called empty calories because its consumption provides energy but no nutritional value do sugar and corn syrup deserve this description \? what is the chemical makeup of sugar , and what happens to sugar as the body digests it \? the term sugar refers to a broad group of chemical compounds that usually give foods a sweet taste while numerous public health campaigns promote limiting the amount of sugar in our diets , the body does use sugar to produce chemical energy in the form of atp note you might need to review , or wish to emphasize , cellular respiration and glycolysis to help students make the connection between the foods they consume and how the body uses them for energy milk , fruit , vegetables and other foods contain naturally occurring sugars , like fructose and lactose fruits , vegetables and dairy products also provide vitamins , protein and other essential nutrients in addition to the sugars they contain in comparison , many processed foods contain added sugars , and it is added sugars that many health experts recommend we limit in our diet these calories are called empty because the sugars added to these foods do not include other essential nutrients a sweet potato , for example , contains natural sugars but it also contains betacarotene , vitamin a , fiber and other components of a health diet a can of soda , on the other hand , contains added sugars and none of the nutritional benefits of a fruit or vegetable suggested activity students can learn more about what sugar does to the brain and body and then keep a food diary for a week to observe their own intake of sugar and how it affects them at the end of the week have them analyze exactly what and how many sugars they consumed , and in what form are they above or below the norm according to this recent study for their age group and gender \? how does their weekly diet compare with that of others in their class \? what effects , if any , did they observe in their own bodies before and after they ate sugar \? 3 how much sugar and sweetener do americans consume \? what s the big deal anyway \? do we really consume all that much sugar \? to find out how much sugar americans consume , students can read about the government s attempts to estimate our sugar intake and , they can read about a study focusing on children specifically students can also view times graphics on daily , yearly and lifetime consumption of sugar and corn syrup , images that include wheelbarrows and jacuzzi pools to get the point across suggested activity ask students to guess how much sugar is in a 20 oz bottle of soda , the kind popular in many vending machines and corner stores then , you can either use the new york city health department video \( above \) to demonstrate the answer , or actually pour sugar packets into a measure cup for effect new york state also has a math activity that uses the nutrition labels on a cocacola bottle and domino sugar packets to solve the problem as well you can repeat the activity using other soda sizes , like a twoliter bottle , or other foods as well ask students based on the readings and health department warnings , how much daily sugar intake seems healthy for someone their age \? 4 is there any real difference between sugar and corn syrup \? corn syrup was hailed as an alternative to sugar when it first became popular following the adoption of the 1977 sugar tariffs and quotas , which raised the cost of imported sugar but lately , corn syrup has been much maligned in the minds of many americans as being much more unhealthy than natural sugar in fact , by 2010 over half of all americans say they are concerned that highfructose corn syrup may pose a health hazard , up from 40 percent in 2004 but is corn syrup really any worse than sugar \? the corn syrup manufacturers were so spooked by all the negative publicity that they released a commercial fighting back , saying that their product is made from corn , is natural , and like sugar , is fine in moderation the commercial inspired plenty of parodies , including this saturday night live one and this spoof comparing corn syrup to cigarettes \( please preview both to make sure they are appropriate for your students \) the situation has gotten so gloomy for corn refiners that the industry lobbied to change the name of high fructose corn syrup to corn sugar the times asked a panel of experts to recommend their own new names as well you can even weigh in on which name you think is best but , ultimately the fda denied the petition , and corn syrup will just have to keep its name but is it all just much ado about nothing \? in is sugar toxic \? , gary taubes writes all of this condemnation of high fructose corn syrup borders on humorous highfructose corn syrup was portrayed by the food industry as a healthful alternative in the 1980s , and that s how the public perceived it it was also cheaper than sugar , which didn t hurt its commercial prospects now the tide is rolling the other way , and refined sugar is making a commercial comeback as the supposedly healthful alternative to this noxious cornsyrup stuff but marketing aside , the two sweeteners are effectively identical in their biological effects highfructose corn syrup , sugar no difference , is how lustig put it in a lecture that i attended in san francisco last december the point is they re each bad equally bad , equally poisonous mr taubes goes on to describe how sugar and corn syrup behave when ingested refined sugar \( that is , sucrose \) is made up of a molecule of the carbohydrate glucose , bonded to a molecule of the carbohydrate fructose a 5050 mixture of the two the fructose , which is almost twice as sweet as glucose , is what distinguishes sugar from other carbohydraterich foods like bread or potatoes that break down upon digestion to glucose alone the more fructose in a substance , the sweeter it will be highfructose corn syrup , as it is most commonly consumed , is 55 percent fructose , and the remaining 45 percent is nearly all glucose it was first marketed in the late 1970s and was created to be indistinguishable from refined sugar when used in soft drinks because each of these sugars ends up as glucose and fructose in our guts , our bodies react the same way to both , and the physiological effects are identical in a 2010 review of the relevant science , luc tappy , a researcher at the university of lausanne in switzerland who is considered by biochemists who study fructose to be the world s foremost authority on the subject , said there was not the single hint that hfcs was more deleterious than other sources of sugar suggested activity since corn syrup is having a bit of an identity crisis , make a facebook page for this vilified sweetener in your page , capture some of the rhetoric on both sides of the battle about the real nature of this nearly ubiquitous ingredient here is a template students can use below are some questions students can consider in making their page through your project , make sure you somehow communicate your own ideas about the sugar vs corn syrup war what does the science say about corn syrup \? should consumers care about what type of added sugar is in their food \? should marketers care about corn syrup s public image \? 5 what actions have public health officials either taken or considered in order to decrease the amount of sugar americans consume \? this week , new york city mayor michael bloomberg s ban on large sugary drinks was struck down by a new york state judge , who ruled that the ban was arbitrary and capricious the mayor vowed to appeal the ruling but whatever the final verdict is for the city s sugary drink limits , new york city s initial foray into government regulation of sugar consumption is likely to continue in one form or another suggested activity study the details of the new york city ban and watch the opdoc video above , and then make your own judgment do you think the government should limit the size of sugary drinks \? do you think the proposal is supported by science \? do you think the proposal , if enacted , would change people s behavior \? do you agree with the judge s decision \? after , consider what other proposals are public health officials considering in new york and around the country ask students which proposals seem to be the most effective or have the most potential \? what is your evidence \? if you were a public health official in your community , what proposals would you work toward adopting \? then , look at how the soda and sweetener industry has responded to its adversaries how have industries responded to health initiatives and negative publicity \? what do you think about their response \? what industry approach do you think is most effective in keeping sales high \? 6 what can you do \? as a culminating activity after students have done one or more of the activities above , invite them to make their own public service announcements , videos , or social media campaigns warning the public of the dangers of added sugar who is their targeted audience \? how will they get that audience s attention \? students might also write press releases to accompany their campaigns and provide additional science and public health information about sugarrelated health problems , consumption habits , and nutritional values reading 1 read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text 2 determine central ideas or themes of a text and analyze their development summarize the key supporting details and ideas 8 delineate and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text , including the validity of the reasoning as well as the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence speaking and listening 1 prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners , building on others ideas and expressing their own clearly and persuasively health standard 6 understands essential concepts about nutrition and diet standard 8 knows essential concepts about the prevention and control of disease
detroit this city was already sinking under hundreds of millions of dollars in bills that it could not pay when a municipal auditor brought in a veteran financial consultant to dig through the books a seasoned turnaround man and former actuary with ford motor co , he was stunned by what he found an additional 72 billion in retiree health costs that had never been reported , or even tallied up the city must take some drastic steps , the consultant , john boyle , warned the city council in delivering his report at a public meeting in 2005 among the options he suggested was filing for bankruptcy i thought all hell would break loose i thought the flag would finally be raised , mr boyle recalled in an interview last week but his warning drew little notice it was utterly astounding , he said the financial crisis that has made detroit one of the largest cities ever to face mandatory was decades in the making , a trail of missteps , of trimming too little , too late , of hoping that deeprooted structural problems would turn out to be cyclical downturns that might melt away as the economy picked up some factors were out of the city s control as auto industry jobs moved elsewhere over the decades , for example , detroit lost much of its affluent tax base lower than expected state revenue sharing did not help , nor did corruption allegations in the administration of kwame m kilpatrick , a mayor in 2008 and was convicted on monday of racketeering and other federal charges but recent findings from a stateappointed review team and interviews with past and present city officials also suggest a city that over the years was remarkably badly run the state review team found in recent months that the city s main courthouse had 280 million worth of uncollected fines and fees no one could tell the team how many police officers were patrolling the streets , even though public safety accounted for a little more than half the budget the city was borrowing from restricted funds and keeping unclaimed property that it was required to turn over to the state in some city departments , records were basically stuff written on index cards , as one city council member put it this was bad decisions piled on top of each other , gary brown , the detroit city council president pro tem , said the other day it has all been a strategy of hope you keep borrowing where every piece of collateral is already leveraged you have no bonding capacity you 're at junk status you 're overestimating revenues and not managing the resources now the chickens have come home to roost once the nation s fourthlargest city , detroit had grown up around the auto industry , booming right along with it in the 1950s city workers gained ground with pay increases intended to keep pace with those the united auto workers won for its members , analysts said it was easy to do so back in the 1950s , said joseph l harris , detroit s former auditor general the city had 18 million residents then but as auto jobs moved elsewhere and the region aged , detroit s labor costs retiree health care costs , especially ballooned at the same time , officials papered over growing deficits with more borrowing finally detroit s legal debt limit , which is linked to the total value of real estate in the city , fell when the mortgage bubble burst and property values plunged today the city says its debt limit is 1 billion , and it has effectively lost its ability to issue debt in the name of its taxpayers when a city cannot borrow , it cannot function new york city showed that in 1975 , cleveland in 1978 but even as detroit has approached the critical limit , some city leaders have seemed unaware , quarreling over smaller , symbolic issues like whether to lease a cityowned park to the state it is peeling an onion , mayor dave bing said of his growing understanding after he took office in 2009 of the depths of the city s financial woes you dig and you dig and you dig , and you really start to find out how bad the problem was mr bing knew plenty about the city s struggles before taking office and ran on a platform of reversing the spiraling finances still , within his first six months in office , the city came close to not making payroll that s a scary moment , he recalled in an interview you 've got people living from paycheck to paycheck , week to week , and you 're about to run out of cash you can only imagine what kind of impact that that s going to have just on the life of the average person the big structural imbalance was hard to see building up , because until 2008 , when a new accounting rule took effect , cities like detroit were not required to keep track of their workers' lifelong health care bills that is why mr boyle found a 72 billion promise that no one knew about detroit s generalobligation debt to its bondholders , by contrast , was a little less than 1 billion that year , safely within the city s legal debt limit , then 14 billion but while the numbers are particularly grim here , the basic story line is hardly unique the same path , long and slow , can be found from providence , ri , to stockton , calif to preserve cash , the city resorted to increasing its workers' future pensions at contract time , instead of raising their pay that helped balance the immediate budgets , but set up a time bomb sure to explode as more workers retired the cost of the retirees' pensions also grew because of an inflationprotection feature that compounds every year detroit cannot renege on paying the benefits , at least outside of bankruptcy , because the state constitution makes it unlawful to reduce pensions after public workers earn them by the 2000s , detroit was borrowing to solve budget shortfalls meanwhile , property tax revenues fell , not just because of departing residents , but also as values fell and some people quit paying the city has reported collecting 84 percent of property tax levied , but a suggests a collection rate closer to half of property owners in recent years , city officials have made deep cuts in staff and operations , leaving residents complaining of darkened streetlights , slow police response times and bus delays but while cutting workers can help reduce the current year s costs , it moves many of those people into the ranks of retirees , putting heavy longterm pressure on detroit s two public pension funds by late 2011 , a sense of crisis descended on detroit in november , mayor bing , a democrat , addressed the city on live television , warning that detroit would run out of money without concessions from unions , layoffs and privatization a month later , gov rick snyder , a republican , of detroit s finances , a first step in cases where the state is preparing to send an emergency financial manager city officials held off further intervention by committing to a legal agreement with the state in 2012 that laid out measures to save money by fall , a board overseeing the agreement said progress was moving too slowly while city council members are contesting the matter during a hearing in lansing on tuesday , mr snyder s administration is preparing to name an emergency manager within days mr bing says his administration has drawn up to spare the city , though he acknowledges that it has yet to be fully put into effect under michigan law , the emergency manager would ultimately have the authority to remove local elected officials from most financial decision making , change labor contracts , close or privatize departments , and even recommend that detroit enter bankruptcy proceedings , a possibility that experts say raises the prospect of the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation s history , at 14 billion worth of longterm obligations none of the decisions , experts here say , will be simple , and some wonder whether detroit can be saved at all some 700 , 000 residents now live in this vast 139squaremile city that once was home to nearly two million people that number may fall to close to 600 , 000 by 2030 before the population begins to rise again , projects by pushing costs into the future while its population is shrinking , detroit has left the people least able to pay with the biggest share of its bills detroit is a microcosm of what s going on in america , except america can still print money and borrow , mr boyle said
los angeles police chief charlie beck stood in front of a bank of television cameras on sunday afternoon facing what seemed like two impossible tasks luring in a fugitive former police officer accused of three murders and simultaneously assuring the public that his department was not backsliding on accusations of racism and corruption for the last four days , dozens of law enforcement agencies across southern california have been searching for christopher j dorner , the former officer who posted a manifesto online promising revenge against los angeles police officers and claiming that racism had led to his firing chief beck said on sunday that the search for mr dorner , who is wanted in connection with the killing of a former police captain s daughter and her fianc and the shooting death of a police officer in riverside , calif , was by far the largest manhunt in the history of the la region chief beck spoke with visible emotion of the toll the threats were taking on officers i think all of us in law enforcement accept a level of risk when we become police officers , he said at a news conference where he announced a 1 million reward for information that leads to the arrest of mr dorner but none of us accept that level of risk for our families , believe me at the same time , chief beck said he was eager to protect the reputation of a department that he had worked painstakingly to repair over the last several years on saturday , he said he would review the investigation of the 2007 episode that led to mr dorner s dismissal he was fired in 2008 for giving false statements after he accused his training officer of kicking a suspect i hear that people think that maybe there is something to what he says , and i want to put that to rest , chief beck said the only way i know how to put that to rest is to review what has already been reviewed at multiple levels but it has never been reviewed by me though many say the los angeles police department has radically transformed over the last two decades , mr dorner s letter has renewed talk about the department s history of problems in dealing with africanamericans and in investigating charges of racism in its ranks when i read that manifesto , my heart sank , said connie rice , a civil rights lawyer who represented police officers who faced retaliation after reporting racial problems and who has worked closely with the department to institute changes anything that threatens to undo what we 've worked so hard for can mean a real crisis they need to show that this is n't the old lapd circling the wagons and manning the ramparts , but instead going to look to see if any mistakes were made it was still unclear exactly how the department would investigate mr dorner s claims , but ms rice and others said someone outside the police force should lead the inquiry i still do n't trust internal affairs , ms rice said late last week , chief beck said he believed that mr dorner s dismissal had been thoroughly adjudicated and reviewed at multiple levels but that did little to quiet speculation in some quarters that the former officer had legitimate claims of racism the mistrust of the police deepened for some after two officers mistakenly shot two latina women , a 71yearold and her 47yearold daughter , who were delivering newspapers in a truck that officers thought matched the description of mr dorner s vehicle that s the undercurrent you have that police were in such a rush to kill him they shot two latina women who resemble nothing like a 6foot2inch black man , said najee ali , the executive director of project islamic hope , who has been a frequent critic of the department that was a game changer for those who had just been casually watching and waiting for this to unfold it gave the notion that they are out to get people credibility but in some way , mr ali said , the chief s decision lends more credence to mr dorner s claims , which are just one part of his eightpage screed that also criticizes wayne lapierre of the national rifle association and praises the actor charlie sheen \( mr sheen posted a video on the internet over the weekend asking mr dorner to call him so they could figure out together how to end this thing \) they 're turning him into some kind of a folk hero , mr ali said it gives people a context to view him as a man wrongly vilified by the system if beck is caving to political pressure , i'm not sure what it gets anyone it s not as though he is going to get his job back earl ofari hutchinson , who hosts a radio talk show here , said he heard from dozens of listeners who saw a pattern in what mr dorner described given the history of the lapd and the fact that there are so many people who have problems , there was going to be a huge backlash , mr hutchinson said there was going to be so much public clamor that beck knew he had to get in front of it even the fact that they are willing to walk it back and look into it is going to be persuasive at a forum on saturday for candidates running for mayor sponsored by several africanamerican groups one woman asked each candidate if they would support an investigation of mr dorner s case each said they would this has gone far beyond just being about dorner , said jan perry , one of the candidates there is a real level of anxiety that people are talking about , and the chief is intelligent to engage in this process john mack , the vice president of the police commission who frequently criticized the police in the past , said it was important that the department not become complacent and assume that the right actions are taken at every level we have to keep our eye on the ball and challenge the system , he said but he dismissed any concern that a renewed investigation would encourage others who have been dismissed to take similar actions we need to be clear this in no way even implies that there was any justification to mr dornan s actions whether an investigation will lead to any new discoveries about mr dorner is impossible to know but mayor antonio r villaraigosa seemingly acknowledged that the authorities wanted him to know that they were looking into his claims this is a man that s been preparing what he s doing for a long time now , it seems as long as 2009 , the mayor said you can bet , if he s still alive , that he s watching this newscast , that he s reviewing every single article that s written on this
if i d spent the past five years living in a monastery or something , i would take the treasury department s declaration that the coin option is out as a sign that there s some other plan ready to go maybe 14th amendment , maybe moral obligation coupons or some other form of scrip , something and maybe there is a plan but as we all know , the last debt ceiling confrontation crept up on the white house because obama refused to believe that republicans would actually threaten to provoke default is the wh being realistic this time , or does it still rely on the sanity of crazies \? the thing is , the coin option sounds silly , but it clearly obeys the letter of the law as far as i can tell , none of the other options other than outright surrender has the same virtue failing to pay debt service would be a breach of contract paying contractors , and maybe social security recipients , in scrip would violate the law , which says that they should be paid not given ious deciding that the president has the right to ignore the debt limit after all would avoid these legal breaches at the expense of another breach and default in any of these senses would risk a huge collapse of confidence so is there a plan , or will it just be another case of tough talk followed by a tailbetweenthelegs retreat \? as i said , if we didn t have some history here i might be confident that the administration knows what it s doing but we do have that history , and you have to fear the worst
rabat , morocco this year , like every year on throne day , king mohamed vi of morocco handed out royal pardons with the occasion falling on july 30 , during an official visit from king juan carlos i of spain , it was announced that 48 spanish citizens serving time in moroccan prisons would be freed among them daniel galv n vi a , who was convicted two years ago of molesting at least 11 children in the moroccan town of kenitra and sentenced to 30 years in jail sexual assault , trafficking and prostitution are serious problems for children in morocco , especially for those who live on the street or among the rural poor but such is the deference to the king here that at first few dared to criticize him directly for setting galv n vi a free none of morocco s cowed political parties or newspapers took up the issue even the founder of hands off my child , the ngo that helped the families of galv n vi a s victims win their landmark case against him one of the first in which an offender was given such a heavy sentence defended the monarch s right to give out pardons as he sees fit online , though , there was outrage soon after news of galv n vi a s release appeared on the independent news site lakome , it spread across social media pardons in other countries can be controversial , too , but this one had everything to shock and anger here was a spanish criminal getting away with abusing moroccan victims , and a royal prerogative trumping the justice system last weekend the colonnaded avenue mohammed v in central rabat echoed with the chants of young protesters \( long live the people ! down with perverts ! \) and their running footsteps , as they dashed away from police squadrons other small demonstrations have since taken place in other moroccan cities five days after news of the pardon leaked , the king exceptionally reversed his decision and asked for an investigation to determine who was responsible for selecting galv n vi a for release \( the exconvict has since been arrested in spain , but getting him extradited to morocco could take years \) an official communiqu from the royal palace said , the king had never been informed , in any manner or at any time , of the gravity of the abject crimes for which galv n vi a was convicted had the king known , he would not have issued the pardon as the novelist laila lalami put it in summary the king has absolute power , but is absolutely not responsible for what happened  morocco s small activist community has seized on the controversy as a rare chance to shed light on the operations of the royal cabinet a shadow government that far outranks its elected counterparts and call for more transparency how did galv n vi a s name get on the lucky list \? especially when the justice ministry claims it alerted the royal cabinet of his crimes most moroccans are still loath to question the king , in matters big or small but it is through controversies such as this one that the relationship between the crown and its citizens evolves as the first sheds its pretensions to infallibility and the second its habit of silent obedience
david brooks as opinionators , this is the late winter of our discontent the world just hasn t thrown up that many topics to generate passionate debate i m not counting the new episodes of the bachelor gail collins david , do you find it strange that we live in a country where arranged marriages are regarded as unwise and antiquated , yet one of the longest running programs on television is about a bunch of young women who compete for the affection of a young man none of them had ever met before \? a show where it is preordained that at the end of the season said bachelor will announce that he is in love with two of them and will need the full twohour finale to choose his mate \? but i suspect you were not actually inviting me into a serious discussion of reality television you were talking about your discontent is this about president obama or congress or both \? david we re at the beginning of a presidential term , but it doesn t feel that way it feels like the seventh year of a presidency , not the start of the fifth i suppose that s because the last three years have been composed of these endless and tiring budget fights one year of budget fights feels like three years of normal time gail well , i can t argue with you about the budget fights the problem is there s never any payoff , unless you count a continuing resolution as closure the bachelor , on the other hand , always meets his deadlines the latest one picked a vegan blogger from seattle david things have been especially hard on us nonfemale , noncatholics the two big discussable items these days are sheryl sandberg and the papal election gail this is possibly the first time in my life that someone attempted to get the upper hand in a discussion by hinting that catholic women have an unfair advantage all those years of training at st antoninus elementary school have finally paid off david somehow i feel i m traipsing onto somebody else s turf if i wade into the sandberg debate and start telling women they can t have it all i say this even though i am rigorously consistent on this matter the very definition of conservatism is you can t have it all no matter who you are , you can t have it all the universe is specifically structured to prevent this still , this feels like an intrafemale debate gail if having it all means fame , fortune , happiness and perfect body tone , then obviously you re right but when it comes to women , having it all has historically referred to being able to have both career and family and if you define career as going for the top of your profession ceo or law firm partner or presidential candidate or whatever it s still generally much harder for women to combine that with raising children in college , the guys aren t worrying about whether they ll be able to pursue their career dreams and still have kids so how do you give smart , accomplished , ambitious women the same opportunities as men to reach their goals \? what about universal preschool and afterschool programs \? what about changing the corporate mindset about the time commitment it takes to move up the ladder \? what about having more husbands step up and take the major load \? there are lots of potential answers , but after half a century of debate , we re still far from solutions just saying you can t have it all is like saying there s no problem here i can t buy that as long as the united states senate is only 20 percent female and the group of fortune 500 ceo s is made up of only about 4 percent women ceo s david i would only add from a neutral swiss perspective that the whole sandberg debate reminds me that while feminists have been rooting for female success for decades , many writers in that camp never seem to like specific females who are actually successful gail david , i have been to 10 million gatherings of feminists celebrating successful women ten billion this idea that women who make it are objects of scorn is totally crazy there was a cover on time this week with a picture of sheryl sandberg and the headline don t hate her because she s successful that s ridiculous you can criticize somebody s ideas without criticizing their achievements david the other thing i d note is that there is no selfrighteousness so virulent as the selfrighteousness an uppermiddleclass writer adopts to criticize the outoftouchness of an upper class writer the inability to afford a second home seems to be regarded by some people as a mark of their own godlike purity not that i m interfering in this fracas not me strictly neutral gail someday perhaps there will be a fairer and more perfect world in which the media devotes more time to eviscerating the work of unsuccessful writers and the controversial ideas explored in their unpublished books david i also feel somewhat out of bounds interjecting myself in the race to be pope i guess i don t want catholics telling me who should be the next sturgeon king  gail well , i love an election , and if you want to give me odds on the next pope , i promise to develop an informed opinion on the sturgeon guy david my only position on this matter is that i am hoping that the bishops pick someone who can write good encyclicals we ve got thousands of institutions on this earth who regard the material world as all there is the catholic church is one of the only selfconfident institutions that regard this world as insufficient and that orients itself around another one that naturally gives it a set of interesting perspectives , even though this can be hard for others to fathom and process i once was watching easter mass from rome on television the pope \( it was john paul ii \) delivered his sermon , and then they cut away to the television reporter on the scene , who reported in disapproving tones , he didn t really say anything new i m not sure novelty is the proper measure for easter mass gail i have pretty much given up hope on getting a pope who will do something sensible about the church s longstanding nuttiness when it comes to matters of sex i speak as a person who literally went to a school where the nuns told us we couldn t wear shiny shoes because they might reflect up our skirt but there seem to be papal candidates who are capable of reminding the world about the side of catholicism that celebrates voluntary poverty and service to the indigent i m rooting the cardinals find such a person maybe we won t get married priests , but at least we d get a decent audit of the vatican bank david i suppose the one new thing these days is the way president obama is breaking bread with members of congress \( even republicans ! \) while white house staffers tell reporters that the whole exercise is pretty much a waste of time i know it will get me kicked out of the court of the knowing and the cynical , but i actually think these meetings are terrific i say that on pure epistemological grounds having sat in on many sessions with the president and many sessions with congressional leadership , i m always amazed by the misconceptions they have about one another this facetoface contact , at long last , won t eliminate the real disagreements , but they may reduce the utter falsehoods that are lodged stubbornly in their minds gail when the president met with that handful of republican senators for dinner , a participant estimated that he talked only about 10 percent of the time this charm offensive may be less about a free exchange of ideas than just barack obama voluntarily submitting himself to dozens of minifilibusters i wish we had secret recordings maybe one of the networks could turn them into an exciting new series in which a lonely chief executive searches for a budget soul mate the winner gets a rose and a large package of entitlement reforms
leeds , england trey was nervous he tapped his bare feet on the studio floor and pulled the zipper on his indigo jumpsuit up and down so fast it sang he was talking a lot he was talking too much trey , please , said helen linsell , the dance director it was noon seven hours to go until they would be on stage , and not just any stage , but the prestigious riley theater in leeds of the 24 teenagers who had started rehearsals in june , 18 had made it to august but the mood in the studio was edgy the day before they had almost lost four dancers , including trey a lanky 17yearold who likes to call himself the bob marley of the group , he had turned up late , rolling in at 11 am shannon , the girl with the curfew monitor on one ankle and the mum tattoo on a foot , lost her temper parts were redistributed there were tears and insults and very nearly a fight this is no ordinary dance company the young people at have a background in trouble , not ballet school dropouts and petty and not so petty criminals , they have been , as one youth worker put it , sentenced to dance referred by schools , parents and more often youth services , they train six hours a day for six weeks with professional contemporary coaches in a highly disciplined dance boot camp there is a 14yearold girl at risk of sexual exploitation in her housing estate a boy whose voice has barely broken but whose girlfriend just had an abortion there is trey s girlfriend , ellie \( they started dating the second week \) tall and cheerful with ravenblack hair pulled back in a messy bun , she is perhaps the most gifted dancer in the group but a few weeks ago her mother kicked her out of the house and now she is , in her own words , drifting \( in line with a statute on the protection of minor offenders , none of them can be identified with their full names \) trey , shannon and many others have been in and out of courtrooms but nobody talks about it here not even the staff members know their histories they deliberately choose not to giving them a clean slate is fundamental to our philosophy , said duncan bedson , the manager of the leeds project we ca n't be prejudiced for six weeks , they are dancers , period many cannot take the rigorous schedule in week three this year they lost georgia , who was so angry she punched a wall and hurt her hand so badly she had to go to the hospital they lost billiejo , who said on her first day in the studio that she was excited about being happy for once but those who stick with it get a chance to perform in a professional theater and , as the experience of 36 dance united academies in leeds , bradford , wessex and london over the past seven years suggests , they also have a good chance of going back to school or finding jobs on average , 7 in 10 make it onto the stage of those , 8 in 10 return to mainstream education or work , and more than 3 in 4 do not commit offenses or become repeat offenders one in 10 even goes on to study dance professionally , with one dance united graduate , matthewjay pratt , now in his final year at the competitive conservatoire of music dance in london it is one of the most original and successful youth engagement programs in , costing its private and public backers about 3 , 000 per person but saving society an estimated 128 , 000 in legal costs and welfare benefits , according to , a research firm that calculates returns for donors to charity on a thursday in july , about halfway through the leeds academy , the students were in the studio going over a tricky lift it was shannon s turn big luke danced across the diagonal and grabbed shannon s waist , trying to turn her upside down and swivel her around , but her legs refused to go into the spinning wheel she stumbled i ca n't do it , man yes , you can , ms linsell said come on , let s try again in his north london office , rob lynden , acting chief executive and creative director of dance united , spoke of the transformative power of dance we try to push , push , push the young people to an uncomfortable place , he said we expect nothing less than what they can give because we know when they exceed their own expectations and that of others , they change dance united started out in the 1990s , working with ethiopian street children , youths in postreunification germany and young catholics and protestants in northern ireland but in these times of economic hardship and austerity there is plenty of work to be done in england , particularly in the jobstarved north , where the number of those under 24 who are neither employed nor in school has reached southern european levels , at nearly one in five ask trey what he has learned and he eagerly shows off his favorite move a long sideways jump , his face and chest turned skyward and his arms wide open but he has also learned about getting up in the morning , even when his mother is still asleep , and how to follow a healthy diet the dancers eat cereal for breakfast and tofu bolognese for lunch soda is banned there is water and juice and trey has learned about books and the power to take control of your own story the show is called rewritten pages it is about shedding labels and reshaping one s life few of the teenagers had been read to as children , let alone read much themselves , except text messages and facebook but they know the power of words , of labels , first hand when the lights went out in the riley theater on aug 1 , and the chatter in the audience subsided , 18 young dancers took the stage trey flew like an eagle and shannon was suspended in midair , her legs tracing a perfect halo in the spotlight above later , as the restless guitar music gave way to the sound of a heartbeat , she spun around and ripped two pages out of a book , discarding them calmly on the floor then she faced the audience , her gaze steady and her hazel eyes proud
washington for all the attention to s new campaign of outreach to republicans , it was four months ago on the eve of bipartisan budget talks that he secretly invited five of them to the white house for a movie screening with the stars of lincoln , the film about that president s courtship of congress to pass a significant measure none accepted the president s associates , busy lately fielding questions of what took so long , readily acknowledge that mr obama could have done more over the past divisive four years to wine , dine and simply engage the other side to reach bipartisan deals on a range of issues they give multiple reasons for his reserve personality , family commitments \( 6 30 dinner is said to be sacrosanct most nights \) and too little appreciation for the aura of the presidency but now that he is trying harder on tuesday mr obama makes the first of four visits to the capitol over three consecutive days democrats say that his effort will put to the test , or at least expose , what they call the biggest factor of all republicans' resistance to what overtures mr obama does make , whether social or legislative , given the political danger of appearing too close to a president so unpopular with the conservative base i find it sort of hard to stomach the criticism that he has not been reaching out to republicans , said representative chris van hollen of maryland , a democrat close to the white house republicans are politically schizophrenic , he added on the one hand they complain about the president not reaching out , he said but when he reaches out directly , a lot of them are running for cover what spurred mr obama to reach out to rankandfile republicans with a flurry of phone calls , meals and now capitol visits were the recent announcements by their leaders speaker john a boehner and senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky that they will no longer negotiate with mr obama on budget policy as long as he keeps demanding more tax revenues as the condition for democrats' support of reduced spending on and other entitlement programs both leaders face political risks from dealmaking with the president mr boehner the potential loss of his leadership job mr mcconnell the danger of a challenge as he faces reelection next year the record is full of examples of republicans who have paid a price for appearing too cozy with mr obama given that , administration aides for a long time would not confirm that any members of congress had been invited to the intimate movie screening in the white house theater on nov 15 , on the evening before mr obama was to have his first white house meeting with leaders of both parties about avoiding an approaching of automatic tax increases and spending cuts the five republicans invitees , including mr boehner and mr mcconnell , sent regrets aides cited the lateness of the invitation and the leaders' commitments on capitol hill four of the five democrats who were invited , including both party leaders senator harry reid of nevada and representative nancy pelosi of california did make it , joining not only mr obama but the film s director , steven spielberg its screenwriter , tony kushner and the actors , sally field , tommy lee jones and james spader senator tom coburn of oklahoma had a scheduling conflict that evening , but he has been one of the few republicans in congress to have an open channel to the president , a relationship that began when mr obama was a senator mr coburn , in an interview recently but before the president s latest outreach , said that such legislative engagement was counter to mr obama s personality type what he does n't realize is if he tried a different style , he 'd get a whole lot more cooperation , mr coburn said , adding he s really a neat guy people do n't know that about him but mr obama insists that he tries i promise you , we invite folks from congress over here all the time , mr obama said at a white house news conference in january , when challenged about criticism of his infrequent outreach he added , sometimes they do n't choose to come , and that has to do with the fact that i think they do n't consider the optics useful for them politically mr obama cited the example of charlie crist , the former republican governor of florida in early 2009 , mr crist literally embraced the new president and his 800 billion twoyear economic stimulus package when mr obama visited florida , thereby poisoning his candidacy for his party s senate nomination it went to marco rubio , who then won the general election it was the death knell for me as a republican , said mr crist , who is now a democrat mr rubio , he recalled , put a photograph of the cristobama embrace on his political literature and , at one rally , an angry republican voter heckled , why do n't you just go hug obama \? \( these days it is mr rubio , widely considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate , who has been trying to walk a hazardous line between getting legislative results in his case a bipartisan bill that mr obama will sign and not appearing too close to the president \) more recently gov chris christie of new jersey , another republican seen as a presidential contender , enraged conservative activists with his warm reception of mr obama as he toured the state after , just before the november election mr crist said his immediate thought was first crist , now christie look out buddy before long came news of mr christie s snub by organizers of the annual he is not invited to this week s conclave , which for years has served as a showplace for ambitious republicans mr obama s promise to end washington s wars was a big part of his appeal in the 2008 campaign , and to buttress that vow he pointed to his bipartisanship as a state senator in springfield , ill , he was known for weekly poker games with republicans and democrats as well as legislating with them one republican illinois senate leader , kirk w dillard , famously went so far as to make a television ad in 2007 for mr obama s campaign for the democratic presidential nomination republican legislators respected senator obama , mr dillard said , looking into the camera his negotiation skills and ability to understand both sides would serve the country very well mr dillard s ad became a big issue in his own campaign for republicans' 2010 nomination for governor after starting far out front , he narrowly lost we must oppose this guy , the influential conservative blogger erick erickson wrote a week before the primary , citing only mr dillard s relationship to mr obama now mr dillard is running for governor again , seeking the 2014 nomination and testing whether republicans have forgotten the proobama ad aides say mr obama will continue his outreach even if the phone calls and other overtures can feel fake to him , in the words of one associate the president signaled as much in his january news conference now that my girls are getting older , they do n't want to spend that much time with me anyway , mr obama said so , he added , maybe a whole bunch of members of the house republican caucus want to come over and socialize more
washington the allegations had all the makings of a perfect electionyear scandal that might threaten s chances for a second term and reenergize a listless an activist president , running an overbearing government , treating conservative groups unfairly by wielding the federal taxing power to undermine his adversaries but a year ago , when the current scandal that has swirled around mr obama first emerged , washington and , apparently , the white house shrugged it was march 2012 and tea party groups around the country had been complaining for months of what they called an irs conspiracy to delay and disrupt their efforts to obtain taxfree status a few republicans in congress expressed concern , sent letters to irs officials and scheduled a hearing reporters wrote a handful of articles about the tea party allegations a louisiana republican , representative charles boustany jr , held his hearing in room 1100 of the longworth building none of the republican candidates for president seized on the allegations as big news for a white house typically equipped with wellhoned political radar designed to sniff out and derail conservative conspiracy theories about mr obama , the potentially damaging events at the irs seemed to pass with little notice at the time , it was a dogbitesman story , said matt bennett , the senior vice president for public affairs at third way , a liberal policy group tea party complains about irs that s not interesting there s zero there that would capture anybody s attention it is still not clear if anyone in the white house took note of the situation at the irs in the spring of 2012 republicans have speculated , so far with no proof , that the tax agency was acting on behalf of political orders from higherups , presumably in the white house or at the president s campaign but the president s top campaign aides said they did not recall a single discussion about the issue at the time i honestly do n't remember one conversation on it , said david axelrod , the campaign s top strategist stephanie cutter , another top campaign aide , agreed i have no knowledge of any discussions on the campaign on these issues , and very , very much doubt that there were any , she said a white house spokesman declined to comment about the reaction inside the west wing at the time which is not to say there was n't anything to talk about in a new york times article on march 7 , 2012 , the executive director of the kentucky 9 12 project said that his group had applied for taxexempt status in december 2010 in february 2012 , the group finally got a response , he said a sevenpage questionnaire with 30 multipart questions , 88 inquiries in all businessweek magazine covered mr boustany s hearing and offered the response of douglas h shulman , the irs commissioner there s absolutely no targeting , mr shulman said at the hearing this is the kind of back and forth that happens to people who apply for taxexempt status but it was n't only the white house that appears to have missed the hearing and the subsequent articles the republican colleagues of mr boustany did not seem particularly exercised about the potential for abuse either there were no news conferences or major speeches on the house or senate floors perhaps those who live in the nation s capital can be excused for missing the potential import of the irs allegations because of everything else that was going on in the first week of march , mitt romney was locked in an existential struggle with rick santorum for the republican presidential nomination on march 6 super tuesday mr romney barely won in ohio even as he lost to his rival in oklahoma and tennessee , raising fresh doubts about his campaign in the same week , rush limbaugh , the conservative icon and radio host , called a georgetown university law student , sandra fluke , a slut for her comments about the availability of birth control the fallout from that consumed washington , and mr obama eventually called ms fluke congressional republicans at the time appeared more focused on trying to pass legislation that would force mr obama to approve the pipeline , a project that environmentalists bitterly oppose to others in the city s political establishment , the tea party s complaints seemed like conspiracy theories from the fringe there had been plenty of irs accusations before , with accusers often seeking to elevate their complaints to the level of president richard m nixon s abuse of the tax agency to target his political enemies with audits during the watergate scandal as the huffington post yawned in one of its only stories on the issue in march 2012 over the years , the irs has periodically been accused of political vendettas by liberals and conservatives alike , usually without merit , tax experts say by contrast , the recent admission by irs officials that they did , in fact , target conservative groups has pushed the story into the scandal stratosphere republicans are now giving the hearings primetime style billing and the white house is fully engaged irs admits targeting the tea party , ' said mr bennett , of the third way that s a story that washington would take notice of
for once , it seems , joakim noah was not the one looking for a fight noah , the center , is often the nba equivalent of an internet troll he has had so many runins during his career that the satirical website headlined bitter feud developing between joakim noah , rest of humanity but last week , when noah was exchanging postgame pleasantries with some oklahoma city players in their locker room , the thunder s kendrick perkins let it be known that he was not happy about the visit from an opponent with reporters present , , we just let anyone in here now \? he and noah exchanged words , but noah reportedly kept his cool and asked perkins if he should leave noah was questioned about the incident by nba security , but said saturday that there were no hard feelings he s just an angry dude , you know \? noah told reporters before the bulls game against cleveland it s all good for noah , that degree of restraint seemed somewhat out of character he hardly would seem to be a bluecollar player his father , the tennis player yannick noah , was born in france , grew up in cameroon and won the before becoming a professional singer his mother , cecilia rohde , was miss sweden in 1978 , seven years before joakim was born noah , 28 , with his long hair and distinctive dress , has always seemed out of step with other professional athletes at the university of florida , he became known as a thinking man s athlete while helping the gators win backtoback ncaa championships in his seven seasons in the nba , noah has been a 6foot11 bruiser in the paint , thriving on the dirty work that many stars avoid an elite defender , noah blocks shots , bangs bodies and is one of the league s top rebounders it is a style of play that has led to feuds with opponents throughout the league much of noah s antagonism comes off as playful , but he has developed a reputation for getting under the skin of opponents , on the court and off in one memorable instance in 2010 , he took on kevin garnett , one of the game s biggest stars , calling him dirty and saying he regretted having looked up to the future hall of famer as a child he s a very mean guy , noah said in a radio interview where s the love \? none at all ugly , too last season , after noah had badly outplayed the knicks' tyson chandler , they fought briefly on the court and were ejected many players would have chosen not to comment , but noah took a swipe at chandler and the knicks i do n't think they 're used to being down that much , noah told reporters , referring to the knicks' huge early deficit in the bulls' if they were up 20 points , i do n't think they would have been that frustrated but noah directs most of his vitriol at lebron james of the miami heat a beloved superstar , james is generally viewed as a freakishly talented goofball , but for a number of seasons noah has taken offense at james s style of play and tendency to celebrate on opponents' courts he once objected loudly to james s dancing on the court , and this month noah talked about disliking the heat after the bulls beat the visiting heat , 10787 , noah said you wake up in the morning and you feel it , you feel people in the city , they do n't like the miami heat we do n't like the miami heat , and it always feels good to beat them he may grow angry with players like james , but noah has a tendency to back up his big words he looked energized that night against miami , with 17 points and 15 rebounds james had an off night , scoring 21 points and collecting 5 rebounds heat center chris bosh had 10 points and 2 rebounds noah s teammate luol deng joked with reporters after the game , saying , if we played miami 82 times a season , jo would probably be the best player in the league now that the perkins outburst is public , it will be interesting to see if it instills a similar intensity in noah when the bulls play the thunder again in march it would not be surprising for noah to do plenty of talking off the court , and plenty of damage on it
washington the energy department is moving toward abandoning a halfbuilt factory that has cost 37 billion so far and was intended to make reactor fuel out of plutonium from retired nuclear bombs part of an agreement with russia to shrink the world s supply of nuclear bomb fuel after the cold war the department s estimate of the cost to complete the plant , at the has jumped to 77 billion from 49 billion the obama administration is seeking to reduce the construction budget for the fiscal year that begins on oct 1 , and has proposed allocating no money at all in subsequent years if the plant were to be abandoned , the government would owe its contractors a cancellation fee that is likely to run into the tens of millions of dollars , according to experts , although details are not public other countries , including france , have successfully made reactor fuel out of plutonium for years , which was one reason that policy makers in the administrations of presidents bill clinton and george w bush liked the idea but officials now acknowledge that they did not have an accurate idea of the cost with the new price estimate which could go higher because the plant is only about 60 percent complete the idea of making reactor fuel may be unaffordable , the summary also cited the tight budget environment the plant has also faced a host of technical problems just about everything is going wrong , said edwin lyman , a physicist at the , a group that has consistently opposed the plant because it would introduce into the commercial world a material that can be purified to make bombs what finally caught the attention of the administration was the massive increase in the projected capital cost of the plant , and the overall cost of the program the plant would blend the plutonium with uranium and transform it into a new fuel called mixed oxide , or mox experts offer many explanations of what went awry an executive at areva , the french company that owns 30 percent of the partnership that contracted to build the factory , said one problem has been the dearth of parts manufacturers and skilled workers on nuclear projects in the united states , where work has only recently begun on four new reactors  the problem is getting a welder on site , qualified , trained , up to speed , and all of a sudden he s off to a higherpaying job , at vogtle , said david c jones , a senior vice president of areva , referring to , near waynesboro , ga kelly trice , the president and chief operating officer of shawareva mox services , , blamed construction at vogtle and another civilian reactor project for driving up construction costs at the south carolina factory robert alvarez , a former special assistant to the energy secretary in the clinton administration , said there was a gap at the top , too a problem facing the us more than france is we are losing the capability to design and construct these large nuclear material facilities , he said despite the problems with the mox plant , the obama administration cannot simply drop the plant because it has promised the russians that it will disposition a term meaning to render the plutonium beyond practical retrieval 34 tons of former weapons plutonium the russians are supposed to do the same , although their schedule has also stretched out any solutions are unattractive , said neile l miller , the acting administrator of the the choices are not fabulous , none of them one of those options initially favored by the clinton administration but dropped during mr bush s presidency as too expensive would be to move the plutonium to a nearby factory that takes highlevel radioactive liquid wastes from underground tanks and blends them with molten glass to solidify them for burial mixed with the highly radioactive wastes , which were a byproduct of plutonium production , the plutonium would be very hard to recover , some experts argue , and thus unavailable for weapons use the russians have never agreed to this option because they say it would not constitute disposition the plant still has supporters , including lawmakers from the area , where the project promises many highpaying jobs senator lindsey graham , republican of south carolina , briefly put a hold on the nomination of ernest moniz as energy secretary to try to keep the project alive mr graham said on the senate floor that although dr moniz was a wonderful fellow , there was no alternative to finishing the plant the plant also has opponents , who say that the russians plan to disposition their plutonium in reactors that could be used to make more plutonium the factory , that included sending plutonium samples to france for conversion to reactor fuel  but the plutonium used in french reactors begins in a different physical form from the weapons plutonium the french material starts in an acid solution that is used to dissolve used fuel and separate the elements to recover the plutonium the american plutonium begins as a metal that has been alloyed with another element , gallium , and other materials , that are added to stabilize it in the warhead it also contains trace amounts of an element called americium , which is created when plutonium decays all of that must be removed before the plutonium can go into reactor fuel , and then the material must be burned in a furnace to turn it into an oxide instead of a metal planners who made the original cost estimates appear not to have appreciated the expense of those steps in addition , the plant s design was changed after concrete had been poured , which some experts said added significantly to the expense changes during construction have been a perennial problem for energy department projects another problem arose with the energy

washington by midfebruary or early march , the united states could face an unprecedented default unless it raises its , the treasury department said this week some legislators have theorized that a quick breach in the debt ceiling might cause only a minor disruption to government finances and some commentators have suggested that the united states could pass legislation to prioritize or guarantee payments to bondholders , thus erasing what they describe as the worst of the financial market reaction and removing the threat of technical default but experts in government finance and markets described running up against the debt ceiling as an event that might quickly precipitate a financial crisis and eventually lead to a recession an event with far greater disruptive potential than the package of tax increases and spending cuts , a government shutdown or even the collapse of lehman brothers a debtceiling crisis would be at its heart a cashmanagement problem every day the government receives millions of bills to pay , to its employees , older americans , soldiers , bondholders and contractors , among others under normal circumstances , it makes payments with new revenue as well as with the proceeds from bond sales but the country has already run out of authority to issue new debt , as of dec 31 , and congress has not yet raised the statutory debt ceiling , currently around 164 trillion the treasury department is undertaking , like suspending the reinvestment of certain government retirement funds , to leave it with more cash on hand but such measures buy the country only so much time , and in a matter of weeks outflows will overwhelm inflows that day might be feb 15 , for instance according to a bipartisan policy center analysis , the government expects about 9 billion in revenue to arrive in its coffers that day but it has 52 billion in committed spending on that day 30 billion in interest payments , 68 billion in tax refunds , 35 billion in federal salaries , 27 billion in military pay , 23 billion in and payments , 15 billion owed to military contractors and a smattering of other commitments the treasury would be confronted with paying doctors but not soldiers , chinese bondholders but not defense companies worse , it is not clear whether the treasury secretary would have the legal latitude or even the technical ability to prioritize some payments over others every day the country remained in breach of the ceiling , the problems would be compounded the treasury department has shed little light on what actions it would take if the country breached the ceiling but there are a few clues as to how the obama administration might react a treasury inspector general s report from last year described some of the planning for the debt ceiling standoff in 2011 , which caused a broad slump in the market and raised the country s borrowing costs by about 13 billion in that fiscal year treasury considered asset sales imposing acrosstheboard payment reductions various ways of attempting to prioritize payments and various ways of delaying payments ,  it determined that delaying payments might be the least harmful option , but made no decisions about the best route forward moreover , treasury reached the same conclusion that other administrations had reached about these options none of them could reasonably protect the full faith and credit of the us , the american economy , or individual citizens from very serious harm , the report said some republican lawmakers have suggested giving the treasury more guidance for instance , representative daniel webster of florida has ordering the treasury to pay obligations to bondholders , followed by troops , national security priorities , and then medicare but organized chaos would still be chaos , analysts said consider again the day of feb 15 the country would not have enough money to pay its bondholders , let alone anyone else moreover , analysts have raised questions about whether the treasury would be able to reprogram its automated payment systems to prioritize some payments over others with bills stacking up day by day , the government would be able to make only about 60 percent of its payments over time businesses and individuals would be left without expected funds from the government , and a tremendous financial crisis might ensue we 're the reserve currency of the entire world , said steve bell of the bipartisan policy center , in washington there s trillions of dollars of our debt sliced and diced into all sorts of financial instruments around the world if you 're a 28yearold bond trader for nomura in tokyo , and someone says , hey , we just heard a rumor treasury is n't making all its payments , ' what do you do \? you panic and you sell for that reason , 84 percent of the surveyed by the university of chicago s booth school of business this week said the debt ceiling periodically creates unneeded uncertainty and can potentially lead to worse fiscal outcomes for the country deciding whether or not to pay the debts incurred to fund the previously approved tax and spending is nuts , responded anil k kashyap of the university of chicago richard h thaler , also of chicago , said , the debt ceiling is a dumb idea with no benefits and potentially catastrophic costs if ever used a standoff in the debt ceiling even a brief one , with bondholders paid on time might also raise the country s borrowing costs permanently it is not assured that the treasury would or legally could prioritize debt service over its myriad other obligations , including social security payments , tax rebates and payments to contractors and employees , said on tuesday arrears on such obligations would not constitute a default event from a sovereign rating perspective but very likely prompt a downgrade even as debt obligations continued to be met for that reason , some republicans are shying away from using the debt ceiling as leverage with some quietly suggesting that a forthcoming debate over the continuing spending resolution necessary to finance the government might be a better time to wrangle for budget cuts in an , speaker described the debt ceiling as one point of leverage but not the ultimate leverage the white house has refused to negotiate any budget cuts as part of talks over the ceiling , and has suggested that congress give up most its authority over the debt ceiling to begin with
by the time i arrived in south africa in 2008 , a frail and declining nelson mandela was rarely seen in public anymore , and yet his presence was everywhere , his name on every set of lips and his face never far from any mind s eye he was the living symbol of the nation s liberation , and people spoke of him as if he were the beloved grandfather always found at the head of the family dinner table as if he were still somehow presiding over the future i felt his hovering presence most greatly in april 2009 , on election day it was a chilly morning , and i waited with people preparing to vote in diepsloot , a massive and impoverished squatter camp north of johannesburg they were celebrating their citizenship with patience many had begun their wait in the predawn , their shoulders covered with heavy jackets and blankets one line pushed past minguni s butchery all the way to the gang star hair salon it then turned the corner for a distance at the offices of dr dungu , the traditional herbal healer some people would wait for seven uncomfortable hours these people were most certainly not voting their pocketbooks most were desperately poor , living in flimsy shacks without electricity or running water their prospects were dreary they complained with anger at their government they wanted change and yet they were proudly loyal to the african national congress , the same political party that had run that troubled government for the previous 15 years it was , after all , the party of nelson mandela the great man was president only from 1994 to 1999 , and the position at the top had since gone to anc leaders with haunting and shameful flaws but voters in a young democracy were still consecrating the memory of those who had sacrificed so much in the cause of freedom they were beholden i always vote anc because of nelson mandela , and all he did for the struggle , a young woman named mary jane tyutula told me i won t let him down mr mandela , however addled and ailing , was an incomparable political card to play , none as high or wild just days before the election , the anc brought its whitehaired icon to a rally in johannesburg s largest rugby stadium he was chauffeured around the field in a golf cart , and then helped up the steps to a temporary stage , younger men using their hands as hoists under his arms after each step , the old man paused to summon enough strength to attempt the next he was taken to a sofa , and sat wordlessly through the rally , shaking hands with those who greeted him but otherwise barely moving except to sip water on occasion , his face was displayed on a huge screen everyone understood the moment this was among the final glances they would ever get some wept some cheered and all tried to hold on forever to a hero vanishing into time barry bearak was johannesburg bureau chief from 2008 to 2011
we come at journalism from different traditions i 've spent a life working at newspapers that put a premium on aggressive but impartial reporting , that expect reporters and editors to keep their opinions to themselves unless they relocate \( as i have done \) to the pages clearly identified as the home of opinion you come from a more activist tradition first as a lawyer , then as a blogger and columnist , and soon as part of a new , independent journalistic venture financed by the ebay founder pierre omidyar your writing proceeds from a clearly stated point of view in a on reuters this summer , media critic jack shafer celebrated the tradition of partisan journalism from tom paine to glenn greenwald and contrasted it with what he called the corporatist ideal he did n't explain the phrase , but i do n't think he meant it in a nice way henry farrell , who blogs for the washington post , more recently that publications like the new york times and the guardian have political relationships with governments , which make them nervous about publishing \( and hence validating \) certain kinds of information , and he suggested that your new project with omidyar would represent a welcome escape from such relationships i find much to admire in america s history of crusading journalists , from the pamphleteers to the muckrakers to the new journalism of the '60s to the best of today s activist bloggers at their best , their fortitude and passion have stimulated genuine reforms \( often , as in the progressive era , thanks to the journalists' political relationships with governments \) i hope the coverage you led of the national security agency s hyperactive surveillance will lead to some overdue accountability but the kind of journalism the times and other mainstream news organizations practice at their best includes an awful lot to be proud of , too , revelations from watergate to torture and secret prisons to the malfeasance of the financial industry , and including some presnowden revelations about the nsa s abuse of its authority those are highlights that leap to mind , but you 'll find examples in just about every day s report journalists in this tradition have plenty of opinions , but by setting them aside to follow the facts as a judge in court is supposed to set aside prejudices to follow the law and the evidence they can often produce results that are more substantial and more credible the mainstream press has had its failures episodes of credulousness , false equivalency , sensationalism and inattention for which we have been deservedly flogged i expect you 'll say , not flogged enough so i pass you the lash there s no question that journalists at establishment media venues , certainly including the new york times , have produced some superb reporting over the last couple of decades i do n't think anyone contends that what has become \( rather recently \) the standard model for a reporter concealing one s subjective perspectives or what appears to be opinions precludes good journalism but this model has also produced lots of atrocious journalism and some toxic habits that are weakening the profession a journalist who is petrified of appearing to express any opinions will often steer clear of declarative sentences about what is true , opting instead for a cowardly and unhelpful here swhatbothsidessayandiwo n'tresolvetheconflicts formulation that rewards dishonesty on the part of political and corporate officials who know they can rely on objective reporters to amplify their falsehoods without challenge \( ie , reporting is reduced to x says y rather than x says y and that s false \) worse still , this suffocating constraint on how reporters are permitted to express themselves produces a selfneutering form of journalism that becomes as ineffectual as it is boring a failure to call torture torture because government officials demand that a more pleasant euphemism be used , or lazily equating a demonstrably true assertion with a demonstrably false one , drains journalism of its passion , vibrancy , vitality and soul worst of all , this model rests on a false conceit human beings are not objectivitydriven machines we all intrinsically perceive and process the world through subjective prisms what is the value in pretending otherwise \? the relevant distinction is not between journalists who have opinions and those who do not , because the latter category is mythical the relevant distinction is between journalists who honestly disclose their subjective assumptions and political values and those who dishonestly pretend they have none or conceal them from their readers moreover , all journalism is a form of activism every journalistic choice necessarily embraces highly subjective assumptions cultural , political or nationalistic and serves the interests of one faction or another former bush doj lawyer jack goldsmith in 2011 praised what he the patriotism of the american press , meaning their allegiance to protecting the interests and policies of the us government that may \( or may not \) be a noble thing to do , but it most definitely is not objective it is quite subjective and classically activist but ultimately , the only real metric of journalism that should matter is accuracy and reliability i personally think honestly disclosing rather than hiding one s subjective values makes for more honest and trustworthy journalism but no journalism from the most stylistically objective to the most brazenly opinionated has any real value unless it is grounded in facts , evidence , and verifiable data the claim that overtly opinionated journalists cannot produce good journalism is every bit as invalid as the claim that the contrived form of perspectivefree journalism cannot i do n't think of it as reporters pretending they have no opinions i think of it as reporters , as an occupational discipline , suspending their opinions and letting the evidence speak for itself and it matters that this is not just an individual exercise , but an institutional discipline , with editors who are tasked to challenge writers if they have given short shrift to contrary facts or arguments readers might want to know the thing is , once you have publicly declared your subjective assumptions and political values , it s human nature to want to defend them , and it becomes tempting to omit or minimize facts , or frame the argument , in ways that support your declared viewpoint and some readers , knowing that you write from the left or right , will view your reporting with justified suspicion of course , they may do that anyway discounting whatever they read because it appeared in the liberal new york times but i think most readers trust us more because they sense that we have done due diligence , not just made a case \( i once saw some opinion research in which times readers were asked whether they regarded the times as liberal a majority said yes they were then asked whether the times was fair a larger majority said yes i guess i can live with that \) i work now in the realm of opinion , but as a news reporter and editor i defined my job not as telling readers what i think , or telling them what they ought to think , but telling them what they needed to know to decide for themselves you are right , of course , that sometimes the results of that process are less exciting than a hearty polemic sometimes fair play becomes false equivalence , or feels like euphemism but it s simplistic to say , for example , unless you use the word torture you are failing a test of courage , or covering up evil of course , i regard waterboarding as torture but if a journalist gives me a vivid description of waterboarding , notes the long line of monstrous regimes that have practiced it , and then lays out the legal debate over whether it violates a specific statute or international accord , i do n't care whether he uses the word or not i'm happy and fully equipped to draw my own conclusion if jack goldsmith , the former bush administration lawyer , had praised the american press for , in your words , their allegiance to protecting the interests and policies of the us government then i would strongly disagree with him we have published many stories that challenged the policies and professed interests of the government but that s not quite what goldsmith says he says that the times and other major news outlets give serious consideration to arguments that publishing something will endanger national security that is , might get someone killed that is true we listen respectfully to such claims , and then we make our own decision if we are not convinced , we publish , sometimes over the fierce objections of the government if we are convinced , we wait , or withhold details the first time i ever faced such a decision was in 1997 when i was foreign editor , and a reporter learned of a dispute between russia and georgia , the former soviet republic , over what to do with a cache of highly enriched uranium left behind after the breakup of the soviet union the dispute was interesting news but when the reporter checked , it turned out the stockpile was completely unsecured , available to any terrorist interested in constructing a dirty bomb we were asked to hold the story until the material was fenced and guarded and we did so it was not a hard call so what would your policy be on publishing information that some would argue jeopardizes national security \? \( i realize this is not an entirely hypothetical question \) would you even let them try to make the case \? , why would reporters who hide their opinions be less tempted by human nature to manipulate their reporting than those who are honest about their opinions \? if anything , hiding one s views gives a reporter more latitude to manipulate their reporting because the reader is unaware of those hidden views and thus unable to take them into account for instance , i did not know until well after the fact that times correspondent john burns harbored some quite favorable views about the attack on iraq he not only admitted in and that he failed to anticipate the massive carnage and destruction the invasion would wreak but also viewed the invading us soldiers as ministering angels and liberators does that make him an activist rather than a journalist \? i do n't think so but as a reader , i really wish i would have known his hidden views at the time he was reporting on the war so that i could have taken them into account it is , i believe , very hard to argue that the ostensibly objective tone required by large media outlets builds public trust , given the very low esteem with which the public regards those media institutions far more than concerns about ideological bias , the collapse of media credibility stems from things like helping the us government disseminate falsehoods that led to the iraq war and , more generally , a glaring subservience to political power pathologies exacerbated by the reportorial ban on any making clear , declarative statements about the words and actions of political officials out of fear that one will be accused of bias as for taking into account dangers posed to innocent life before publishing nobody disputes that journalists should do this but i do n't give added weight to the lives of innocent americans as compared to the lives of innocent nonamericans , nor would i feel any special fealty to the us government as opposed to other governments when deciding what to publish when goldsmith praised the patriotism of the american media , he meant that us media outlets give special allegiance to the views and interests of the us government one can , i guess , argue that this is how it should be but whatever that mindset is , it is most certainly not objective it is nationalistic , subjective and activist , which is my primary point all journalism is subjective and a form of activism even if an attempt is made to pretend that this is n't so i have no objection to the process whereby the white house is permitted to give input prior to the publication of sensitive secrets indeed , wikileaks , advocates of radical transparency , went to the white house and sought guidance before publishing the iraq and afghanistan war logs , but the white house to respond , then had the temerity to criticize wikileaks for publishing material that it said should have been withheld that prepublication process is both journalistically sensible \( journalists should get as much relevant information as they can before making publication decisions \) and legally wise \( every espionage act lawyer will say that such consultation can help prove journalistic intent when publishing such material \) for all the nsa reporting i 've done not just at the guardian but with media outlets around the world the white house was notified by editors before the fact of publication \( though in the vast , vast majority of cases , their demands that information be suppressed were disregarded due to lack of specific reasons in favor of suppression \) my objection is not to that process itself but to specific instances where it leads to the suppression of information that ought to be public without intended rancor , i believe that the 2004 decision of the times to the risen lichtblau nsa story at the request of the bush white house was one of the most egregious of such instances , but there are plenty of  in essence , i see the value of journalism as resting in a twofold mission informing the public of accurate and vital information , and its unique ability to provide a truly adversarial check on those in power any unwritten rules that interfere with either of those two prongs are ones i see as antithetical to real journalism and ought to be disregarded nationalistic , your word for the mindset of the american press , is a label that carries some nasty freight it is the dark side of the \( equally facile \) patriotic it suggests blind allegiance and chauvinism i assume you do not use it casually and i ca n't casually let it stand the new york times is global in its newsgathering \( 31 bureaus outside the us \) , in its staffing \( for starters , our chief executive is british \) and especially in its audience but it is , from its roots , an american enterprise that identity comes with benefits and obligations the benefits include a constitution and culture that , compared with most of the world , favor press freedom \( that is why your editors at the guardian have more than once sought us as partners in sensitive journalistic ventures seeking shelter under our first amendment from britain s official secrets act \) the obligations include , above all , holding the government accountable when it violates our laws , betrays our values , or fails to live up to its responsibilities we have spent considerable journalistic energy exposing corruption and oppression in other countries , but accountability begins at home like any endeavor run by human beings , ours is imperfect , and sometimes we disappoint critics on the left , including you , were indignant to learn that we held the nsa eavesdropping story for more than a year , until i was satisfied that the public interest outweighed any potential damage to national security critics on the right were even more furious when , in 2005 , we published honorable people may disagree with such decisions , to publish or not to publish but those judgments were the result of long , hard and independent calculation , a weighing of risks and responsibilities , not fealty to the us government by the way , since you mention wikileaks , one of our principal concerns in turning those documents into news stories in 2010 was to avoid endangering innocent informants not americans , but dissidents , scholars , human rights advocates or ordinary civilians whose names were mentioned in the classified cables from foreign outposts wikileaks' attitude on that issue was callous indifference according to david leigh , the guardian s lead investigator on that story , julian assange said , if they get killed , they 've got it coming to them \( assange denies saying this , but david leigh s track record earns him considerable credibility \) google executive eric schmidt says assange told him he would have preferred no redactions on several occasions i 've said that julian assange and wikileaks should be entitled to the same press freedoms as the new york times but let s not pretend they have the same sense of responsibility new subject \? pierre omidyar , your new employer , thinks he has seen the future of journalism , and it looks like you in an , omidyar said that trust in institutions is going down and now audiences want to connect with personalities so he is building a constellation of stars , passionfueled soloists , crusading investigators i know you do n't speak for omidyar , but i have some questions about how you see this new world first , it has become a clich of our business profession craft that journalists are supposed to build themselves as individual brands but journalism especially the hardest stuff , like investigative journalism benefits immensely from institutional support , including a technical staff that knows how to make the most of a database , editors and factcheckers who fortify the stories , graphic designers who help make complicated subjects comprehensible and , not least , lawyers who are steeped in freedomofinformation and first amendment law in the snowden coverage , you worked within the institutional structure of the guardian and , for a little while , the times so what s so different about the new venture \? is it just a journalistic institution by another name \? second , in an with my old friend david cay johnston you said coverage of governments and other big institutions is about to be radically changed because of the pervasiveness of digital content governments and businesses depend on vast troves of information all it takes , you said , is access and a troubled conscience to create an edward snowden or a bradley manning but it seems to me it takes one other thing a willingness to risk everything manning is serving a 35year prison sentence for the wikileaks disclosures , and snowden faces a life in exile the same digital tools that make it easy to leak also make it hard to avoid getting caught that s one reason , i think , the overwhelming preponderance of investigative reporting still comes for reporters who cultivate trusted sources over months or years , not from insiders who suddenly decide to entrust someone they 've never met with a thumb drive full of secrets do you really think snowden and manning represent the future of investigative journalism \? and , third , will pierre omidyar s new thing be a political monoculture , or do you expect there will be rightwing glenn greenwalds on board \? back to you to understand what i mean by nationalistic , let s examine the example we 've discussed the nyt s nonuse of the word torture to describe bushera interrogation techniques you say that the use of this word was unnecessary because you described the techniques in detail that s fine but the \( along with other media outlets \) use the word torture without reservation for the same techniques when used by countries that are adversaries of the us that s what i mean by nationalism making journalistic choices to comport with and advance the interests of the us government i do n't mean the term pejoratively \( at least not entirely \) , just descriptively it demonstrates that all journalism has a point of view and a set of interests it advances , even if efforts are made to conceal it on the difference between wikileaks and the nyt the guardian \( along with the nyt \) has a bitter and protracted feud with assange \( now that they 're done benefiting from his documents \) , so i personally would not assume their inherent credibility in disputes over what was or was not said in private from everything i 've seen , neither assange nor wikileaks has any remote desire to endanger innocent people quite the opposite they have diligently attempted to redact names of innocents , and sought white house input before publishing \( which was inexcusably denied \) also , the only time a huge trove of unredacted documents was released was , ironically , when the journalist you mentioned \( not one associated with wikileaks \) the archive password in his book but to the broader point even if one were to assume for the sake of argument that wikileaks' more aggressive transparency may occasionally result in excess disclosures \( a proposition i reject \) , the more governmentfriendly posture of the nyt and similar outlets often produces quite harmful journalism of its own it was n't wikileaks that laundered false official claims about saddam s wmd s and alliance with al qaeda on its front page under the guise of news to help start a heinous war it is n't wikileaks that routinely gives to us officials to allow them to spread leaderglorifying mythologies or quite toxic of government critics without any accountability it is n't wikileaks that incredibly incendiary accusations about american whistleblowers without a shred of evidence and it was n't wikileaks that allowed the american people to reelect george bush while knowing , but concealing , that he was eavesdropping on them in exactly the way the criminal law prohibited as for the new venture we 're building with pierre omidyar we 're still developing what it will look like , how it will be structured and the like , so my ability to answer some of your questions is limited but i can address a few of the questions you raise we absolutely believe that strong , experienced editors are vital to good journalism , and intend to have plenty of those editors are needed to ensure the highest level of factual accuracy , to verify key claims , and to help journalists make choices that avoid harm to innocents but they are not needed to impose obsolete stylistic rules , or to snuff out the unique voice and passion of the journalists , or to bar any sort of declarative statements when highlevel officials prevaricate , or to mandate governmentrequested euphemisms in lieu of factually clear terms , or to vest official statements or official demands for suppression with superior status in sum , editors should be there to empower and enable strong , highly factual , aggressive adversarial journalism , not to serve as roadblocks to neuter or suppress the journalism we intend to treat claims from the most powerful factions with skepticism , not reverence official assertions are our stating point to investigate \( official a said x , y and z today now let s see if that s true \) , not the gospel around which we build our narratives \( x , y and z , official a says \) with regard to sources , i really do n't understand the distinction you think you 're drawing between snowden and more traditional sources snowden came to journalists who work with newspapers that are among the most respected in the world we did n't just have thumb drives dumped in our laps we worked for quite a long time to build a relationship of trust and to develop a framework to enable us to report these materials how is that any different from daniel ellsberg s decision to take the pentagon papers to the times in the early 1970s \? all that said , you raise an interesting and important point about the dangers posed to sources but it is n't just people like manning and snowden who face prosecution and long prison terms american whistleblowers who went to more traditional media outlets such as tom drake and jeffery sterling also face serious felony charges from an administration which , as your paper s former general counsel , james goodale , has has been more vindictive in attacking the newsgathering process than any since richard nixon and even journalists in this process , such as your paper s pulitzer prizewinning jim risen , face the very real threat of prison the climate of fear that has been deliberately cultivated means that , as the new yorker s jane mayer put it , the newsgathering process has come to a standstill many times national security reporters , such as scott shane , have been issuing similar warnings that sources are now afraid to use the traditional means of working with reporters because of the obama administration s aggression ubiquitous surveillance obviously compounds this problem greatly , since the collection of all metadata makes it almost impossible for a source and journalist to communicate without the government s knowledge so yes along with new privacyenhancing technologies , i do think that brave , innovative whistleblowers like manning and snowden are crucial to opening up some of this darkness and providing some sunlight it should n't take extreme courage and a willingness to go to prison for decades or even life to blow the whistle on bad government acts done in secret but it does and that is an immense problem for democracy , one that all journalists should be united in fighting reclaiming basic press freedoms in the us is an important impetus for our new venture as for whether our new venture will be ideologically homogenized the answer is definitely not we welcome and want anyone devoted to true adversarial journalism regardless of where they fall on the political spectrum , and have already been speaking with conservatives journalists like that real conservatives , not the east coast rendition of conservatives such as david brooks our driving ideology is accountability journalism grounded in rigorous factual accuracy your apparent contempt for david brooks is revealing presumably what disqualifies him from your category of real conservatives is that he puts reason over passion and sometimes finds a middle ground as lenin despised liberals , as the tea party loathes moderate republicans , you seem to reserve your sharpest scorn for moderation , for compromise look at today s washington and tell me how that s working out we agree , of course , that the current administration s affection for the espionage act and readiness to jail reporters who protect their sources have created a hostile climate for investigative reporting of all kinds we agree that is deplorable and bad for democracy there are other things we agree on , too , but this exchange was n't meant to be a search for common ground , so before signing off , i 'd like to return once more to what i think is our most essential disagreement you insist that all journalism has a point of view and a set of interests it advances , even if efforts are made to conceal it and therefore there s no point in attempting to be impartial \( i avoid the word objective , which suggests a mythical perfect state of truth \) moreover , in case after case , where the mainstream media are involved , you are convinced that you , glenn greenwald , know what that controlling set of interests is it s never anything as innocent as a sense of fair play or a determination to let the reader decide it must be some slavish fealty to powerful political forces i believe that impartiality is a worthwhile aspiration in journalism , even if it is not perfectly achieved i believe that in most cases it gets you closer to the truth , because it imposes a discipline of testing all assumptions , very much including your own that discipline does not come naturally i believe journalism that starts from a publicly declared predisposition is less likely to get to the truth , and less likely to be convincing to those who are not already convinced \( exhibit a fox news \) and yes , writers are more likely to manipulate the evidence to support a declared point of view than one that is privately held , because pride is on the line you rightly point out that this pursuit of fairness is a relatively new standard in american journalism a reader does n't have to go back very far in the archives including the archives of this paper to find the kind of openly opinionated journalism you endorse it has the soul you crave but to a modern ear it often feels preachy , and suspect i believe the need for impartial journalism is greater than it has ever been , because we live now in a world of affinitybased media , where citizens can and do construct echo chambers of their own beliefs it is altogether too easy to feel informed without ever encountering information that challenges our prejudices a few volleys back , you pointed out that polls show the american public has a low opinion of the news media you declared based on no evidence i can find that this declining esteem is a result of glaring subservience to political power really \? it seems more plausible to me that the erosion of respect for american media a category that includes everything from my paper to usa today to rush limbaugh to the national enquirer to ifitbleedsitleads local newscasts can be explained by the fact that so much of it is trivial , shallow , sensational , redundant and , yes , ideological and polemical i 'll offer you the last word , and then we can leave the field to commenters , if any have made it this far glenn , i wish you luck in the new venture , and i hope it inspires more billionaires to put money into journalism i 'll offer one unsolicited piece of advice there s very little you 've said about the times in this exchange that has n't been said before in the pages of the times , albeit in less loaded language selfcriticism and correction , and i 've had considerable experience of both , are no fun , but they are as healthy for journalism as independence and a reverence for the truth humility is as dear as passion so my advice is learn to say , we were wrong i have just a couple of last , quick points my contempt for david brooks is grounded in his years of extreme war cheerleading and veneration of an elite political class that has produced little beyond abject failure and corruption i do n't see anything moderate about him at all i was just simply pointing out that if you want to pride yourself on hiring conservatives to write for your paper , he is hardly representative of that movement i think there s some semantic gameplaying in how you chose to summarize our debate my view of journalism absolutely requires both fairness and rigorous adherence to facts but i think those values are promoted by being honest about one s perspectives and subjective assumptions rather than donning a voiceofgod , viewfromnowhere tone that falsely implies that journalists reside above the normal viewpoints and factionloyalties that plague the nonjournalist and the dreaded activist embedded in the new york times s institutional perspective and reporting methodologies are all sorts of quite debatable and subjective political and cultural assumptions about the world and with some

there is hardly one single type of logic to how a manager scribbles out a lineup some make decisions based on hunches some use advanced statistics and then there is terry collins , who has inherited a mets offense so unreliable that his changes are often acts of desperation ideally , a lineup should be the easiest part of a manager s job , as long as he has the right players to fill each spot collins does not for collins , filling out a lineup is like facing a 110mileperhour fastball collins s latest revamped lineup kept the mets close against the cincinnati reds at citi field on monday , but they still lost , it was a night indicative of collins s seasonlong attempt to find a strong lineup the mets have had 34 starting lineups in 42 games i 've told the other coaches , collins said , i'm not comfortable to keep looking up every day and we have guys moving all over the lineup i think it makes it uneasy for major league players to come in each day and not knowing where you 're hitting we are trying to do something consistently collins is not usually one to rely heavily on statistics , but some numbers are difficult to ignore , even in a small sample size entering monday , rick ankiel and marlon byrd had had success \( a combined 13 for 28 \) against johnny cueto , who was making his first start since april 13 after being on the disabled list with a strained back so collins slid both into the lineup , ankiel in the no 2 spot and byrd fifth , after lucas duda in the first , ankiel and byrd both walked although the mets did not score , ankiel and byrd helped force cueto to throw 28 pitches in the inning in the third , with the mets trailing , 30 , ankiel reached on a single after david wright walked and duda struck out , byrd crushed an 86mph slider over the leftfield wall for a gametying home run jay bruce s solo homer to lead off the sixth against mets starter shaun marcum proved the difference the inclusion of ankiel and byrd was not the only quirk in the lineup , although none of the others worked out as well each and every day we put in a lot of thought to where they should go , collins said some days it works , some days it does n't a few days ago in chicago , mets coaches sought to solve the problem of the leadoff spot the mets had been unable to find someone to do what leadoff hitters are supposed to do get on base entering monday s game , their leadoff hitters had posted a 255 onbase percentage , second worst in the majors behind the minnesota twins mets leadoff hitters' 186 batting average was the worst in baseball collins had tried six batters at the top of the order , and none seemed to work bob geren , the bench coach , made a simple suggestion maybe we ought to lead murphy off so , on monday , for the second consecutive game , daniel murphy led off but he went 0 for 4 also , collins , a week after saying ike davis would be his cleanup hitter , slid him back to the sixth spot after he went 1 for 24 on the recent trip it did not help davis was 0 for 3 with two strikeouts he was taken out of the game in the seventh on a double switch after the game , collins said the mets had considered sending davis to the minors davis said this game is built on confidence and i have n't had a lot of things go right for me to take off despite all the changes , the mets continue to struggle offensively for the 11th time in 13 games they failed to score more than three runs you hope to have two or three guys going hot at the same time in a lineup , byrd said it just has n't happened less than an hour after the end of monday s game , collins was already thinking about tuesday s lineup he knew that outfielder mike baxter had relative success against the reds scheduled starter mike leake \( 3 for 7 \) collins just was not sure where he would put him in the lineup regardless of where baxter ends up , collins will most likely be filling out the mets' 35th lineup in 43 games

katonah , ny ah , the great outdoors ! it was a lovely idea by the pianist to open his beethoven recital in the spanish courtyard at here on friday evening with the pastoral sonata , presumably named \( though not by beethoven \) for its rustic drones in the first and last movements but for those of us not under the tent covers , shielded from the steady rain only \( and inadequately \) by umbrellas , nature was already in oppressive evidence and that was before a nearby skunk announced its presence near the end of the program you knew , when mr biss went public with his current preoccupation with beethoven a year and a half ago , that he was going to dig deep he not only released four sonatas on an onyx cd , the first volume of a promised complete set \( for which he writes his own booklet notes \) , but he also published an ebook , from rosettabooks but even then , you did n't know how deep now onyx has released a second volume of sonatas and mr biss , who teaches at the curtis institute of music in philadelphia , has been recording lectures for an online fiveweek to be presented by curtis in collaboration with beginning in september it is open to all , and more than 20 , 000 people have already enrolled for his caramoor program , mr biss took one sonata from his current cd no 24 in f sharp and added three , to be recorded in late july for release next year the pastoral , no 15 in d no 16 in g and the waldstein , no 21 in c these made for good variety of structure , with works of two , three and four movements , and of mood , with an arc from the calm , relaxed opening of the pastoral through the mercurial activity of the slighter works \( nos 16 and 24 \) to the expansive , soaring exhalation at the close of the waldstein mr biss s style in general seemed calculated to bring out the works' drama and excitement , the sudden harmonic and dynamic contrasts , the pauses and changes of direction that must have jolted listeners in beethoven s time mr biss favored fleetness over power , often letting tempos nudge ahead , with fingers barely depressing the keys , a penchant that worked particularly well in the lighter works but also resulted in an occasional missed note or smudge in passagework none of that mattered much in light of mr biss s ability to convey his deep understanding of these works and to give each a distinctive character the waldstein in particular was shaping up to be something special , with the jangling nervous energy mr biss imparted to the first movement giving way to a suitably grand and sober adagio then on to that glorious ringing melody in the finale here , though , mr biss showed understandable signs of fatigue in the passagework he will undoubtedly be fresh for the recording , and it should be a beauty , blessedly free of damping humidity and unwelcome odors
las vegas it was billed as one of the biggest fights in boxing history , with the promoters promising to break payperview and revenue records it was touted as perhaps the best chance to blemish s unrivaled sprint through the sport but from the time mayweather threw a punch against sa l lvarez on saturday night , it was clear that the competition would not match the hype mayweather danced , dodged and repeatedly snapped lvarez s head and spirit to its breaking point , as he easily improved his record to 450 with a majority decision victory by the time the sweat was wiped from lvarez s reddened face , the only question that remained was whether there was truly anyone in the sport who could give mayweather a challenge worthy of the hoopla although lvarez , who lost for the first time in 44 professional fights , was the bigger fighter , he withered under the bright lights and was backpedaling for much of the fight he began stalking forward only after the result was no longer in doubt but even then , he was greeted by flashes of mayweather s electric blue gloves at every turn the only surprise was that one of the judges , c j ross , scored the bout even at 114114 mayweather won easily on the other two cards even before throwing a single punch saturday night , mayweather already had flexed his dominance as the sport s premier attraction and hype man together with s golden boy promotions , mayweather and his team turned this bout into one of the biggest boxing events in recent memory so much so that it seemed hard to imagine that the public ever yearned for a mayweathermanny pacquiao superfight this fight sold out within 24 hours , with the cheapest tickets selling for 350 as of saturday night , the asking price for the most expensive tickets on stubhub was more than 14 , 000 on friday , the mgm grand garden arena was packed for the weighin as the fighters made long , elaborate walks to the scale with music bumping , akin to their fight night ring walks \( lvarez weighed in at the 152pound limit , while mayweather was at 150 \) many boxing observers said the event was shaping up to be even bigger than the mayweatherde la hoya matchup lvarez , 23 , is not nearly as accomplished as de la hoya was when he fought mayweather , but he presented an intriguing matchup for the potential he possesses although mayweather has made arrogance an art form , even he has agreed that the fight offered some mystery he s a good , strong , solid boxer , and i mean it s a very intriguing matchup , he said before the fight lvarez s youth and power stoked the hope among his supporters that he could catch the 36yearold mayweather with a heavy punch and tarnish his unblemished record he has the good looks and charisma to make him a marketable figure , especially among the fans in his home country , mexico , similar to his mentor and promoter , de la hoya he also brought into the fight an unbeaten record , with 42 victories and one draw well , i know why it s caught on so big is because people have hope and people strongly feel that mayweather is going to get beat , de la hoya said during a conference call days before the fight you know , that s why i feel this fight is catching fire de la hoya was in some ways living vicariously through lvarez de la hoya insisted that he had offered a blueprint on how to beat mayweather , with constant aggression , and the hope was that lvarez would have the physical tools to carry out that plan but in a bizarre turn , de la hoya was not around to see his prot g fight saturday night because he checked into rehab tuesday , continuing his long battle with alcoholism lvarez , whose red hair earned him his nickname canelo , which means cinnamon , entered the fight vowing to find that balance that all of mayweather s opponents look for , but none of them are able to execute successfully being aggressive yet cautious mayweather uses his lightningquick hands and deft footwork to put up some of the best defense and counterpunching in the sport , a code that no one has been able to crack so far pressure is going to help me in the fight , but , you know , smart pressure , lvarez said in the days leading to the fight but such pressure never came from lvarez , who appeared to lose his cool at several moments throughout the fight by the sixth round , lvarez appeared winded and disheveled his face was red mayweather peppered him with several right hooks at one point during the round , lvarez showed frustration while he was tangled with mayweather thinking that mayweather was flailing his left elbow , lvarez threw his own left forearm toward mayweather as the two fighters broke apart lvarez then pointed his fist toward mayweather and stared sternly in the eighth , lvarez had mayweather backed up on the ropes and seemed to be giving his fans a reason to cheer , but mayweather responded to his opponent s twopunch combination with a blistering right hand that twisted lvarez the other way mayweather then calmly stepped up and landed three jabs a few seconds apart the typically brash mayweather refused to give himself too much credit after the fight it was cool today , he said i got the job done
about a year ago the manhattan artist t j wilcox moved his studio from the lower floor of a union square building to its penthouse , where he suddenly had 360degree views at first i spent weeks just staring out of the window , he said i pretty much thought it was the end of my art making but as his new views became more familiar , mr wilcox was reminded of places from 20 years ago , when he first came to new york from los angeles when we are looking at the present , we are simultaneously looking across time , he said the combination of the sights outside his windows and the memories they conjured inspired his most ambitious project in the air , a panoramic film chronicling a single september day it s a portrait of new york from the 18th floor of the building , he said i had become fascinated with panoramic films because that was the way , in the early 19thcentury , people first saw film the work is composed of six short films that unfold in the round as viewers stand surrounded by a giant circular screen each film is inspired by an image that mr wilcox took in from his new perch , in real time or in memories sights like andy warhol s factory and the empire state building , or stories about sept 11 chrissie iles , a senior curator at the whitney museum of american art , saw the work in mr wilcox s studio during its creation and persuaded him to show it at her museum none of my galleries have that much contiguous space , mr wilcox said so from sept 19 to feb 9 , 2014 , in the air will occupy nearly all of the whitney s second floor mr wilcox has chosen artworks and videos from the whitney s collection that relate to new york and the experience of living in the city , also for viewing on the floor new york is like an endlessly unfolding movie , ms iles said and t j has created a unique way of understanding how we experience the city and how we view film , taking it back to its 19thcentury roots mr wilcox said he decided to shoot the film on a clear september day , the same kind of day that it was on sept 11 when , after a rainstorm , the air becomes so clean and clear that it almost has a surreal quality to it , the kind of day i heard a weatherman once describe as severe clear , ' he said the exhibition will be among the whitney s last in its landmark on madison avenue , before the museum decamps to its new building , designed by renzo piano , under construction in manhattan s meatpacking district and scheduled to open in 2015 my work has always been about history , mr wilcox said , and to be one of the last shows in the breuer building was also important to me this may have been the busiest week of the spring art season in new york , but in london experts at sotheby s , christie s and phillips are in the final throes of preparing for their big june sales this week sotheby s said it had won a collection of artworks from the estate of branco weiss , a prominent scientist and philanthropist who lived in zurich and died in 2010 on june 19 , before its big evening impressionist and modern art sale begins , sotheby s will auction 33 works from the weiss collection \( the rest will be offered the next day in a number of other sales , including one devoted to 20thcentury british art and another to russian art \) experts at the auction house estimate the entire collection will sell for about 19 million proceeds will go to the and its branco weiss fellowship , at the swiss federal institute of technology in zurich weiss , who started collecting in the mid1970s and stopped around 2000 , was fascinated with abstract art he also bought the work of artists from different geographies , said helena newman , chairwoman of sotheby s impressionist and modern art department in europe and as a research scientist he had a taste for color as well as abstraction among the highlights are la bonne aventure , a 1937 painting by magritte that depicts a giant nose set against a surrealist backdrop , which includes a seascape , cloudy skies and , in the distance , a tiny tree it is estimated to sell for 15 million to 23 million also up for sale will be intermingling , a 1928 watercolor of geometric abstract forms by kandinsky that is expected to sell for 920 , 000 to 12 million there will be sculpture too , including untitled \( tuning forks \) , a 1939 calder mobile estimated to fetch 18 million to 276 million not only will the collection be shown before the auctions at sotheby s in london , but highlights are also on view from friday to monday in moscow they will then travel to hong kong , where they will be shown from may 29 to 31 this month the museum of modern art announced that connie butler , its chief curator of drawings , was leaving the museum and moving to los angeles to become cocurator of the 2014 made in

the attemptedderailing of the nomination process for the two most important national security posts in the government , which started with petulant timewasting , has mushroomed into yet another republicancreated checksandbalances crisis earlier this month , lindsey graham of south carolina announced that he was going to block chuck hagel for secretary of defense and john brennan for head of central intelligence until president obama accounted for his actions on the night of the benghazi killings it was pure partisan grandstanding mr graham was followed by senator james inhofe , who said he was going to block mr hagel until he proved that he supports israel since mr hagel , like every other member of congress i can think of , actually supports israel , i don t know what he can do to satisfy mr inhofe besides swear unquestioning fealty to prime minister netanyahu s settlement policies and his saber rattling on iran day by day , the delaytoobstruct crowd has gotten bigger and the reasons for blocking the nominations more ridiculous senator roy blunt of missouri announced in a politico interview that he thought the republicans had enough votes to keep mr hagel s nomination bottled up for some time senator rand paul said he was considering adding his own hold on mr brennan until he tells mr paul whether the white house thinks the president has the power to kill suspected terrorist in the united states and not just overseas \( attorney general eric holder , who outlined the targeted killing policy last march without acknowledging that anyone had actually been killed , framed it entirely in terms of americans living overseas so the white house should be able to answer that one easily right \? \) on wednesday , senator john cornyn of texas declared that now there is a 60vote threshold for every nomination so much for the days when the senate took its advise and consent role seriously and all it took was a simple majority to confirm a presidential appointment senator harry reid said this is the first time in the history of our country that a nomination for secretary of defense has been filibustered what a shame indeed today s times article on the subject , citing the senate historian donald ritchie , states that only 5 percent of presidential cabinet nominees have been blocked or rejected by the senate only twice since 1917 , when the senate s modern filibuster rules were created , has a cabinetlevel nominee been subject to a supermajority vote of 60 the republicans responded that their actions against mr hagel don t amount to a filibuster , they re just extending debate and slowing the confirmation process if you want to know what they claim the difference is , read this or let me save you the time there is none i sympathize with mr reid s indignation but he neglected to mention that he passed up a few chances to substantively amend the filibuster rules and possibly avoid the very problem we are having now
i think we need to challenge the national rifle association at its own game we need an antinra organization with 10 million members , each contributing startup money \( an initial war chest of several million dollars \) and annual dues obviously members of congress are being bought by the nra , so we need to pay more , as disgusting as this sounds it s going to take money to get the attention of some lawmakers , not just our passions and deep concerns we have to pay for votes to get automatic weapons off the streets we need lobbyists ! petitions alone are not likely to do the job this can take years how does one get started \? harold bauer evanston , ill , jan 16 , 2013 re \( editorial , jan 15 \) none of the current federal or new york state gun control proposals would have prevented the newtown killings the weak link in the chain is the failure to require gun owners to lock and safeguard all weapons and ammunition to require responsible behavior , dram shop laws impose liability for serving a drunk person who causes harm to others should n't we impose liability for damage caused when a gun owner leaves guns or ammunition unlocked and a family member commits murder or other crimes \? requiring guns and ammunition to be kept locked by their owners when not in use would not be a violation of the second amendment , so why this glaring omission \? richard s bashner new york , jan 15 , 2013 when a gun or rifle is placed in my hands , i am anxious i sweat i feel fear and anxiety when a hunter or gun advocate finds a weapon in his hands , he feels content , secure , perhaps serene or excited these contrasting temperamental responses are the emotional basis for this debate it can be resolved only when people like me fully acknowledge the right of other healthy and commonsense citizens to own weapons , and when those people respect my fears by ceasing opposition to sensible controls john guy indianapolis , jan 15 , 2013
boulder , colo on june 25 , i sat with my mother and sister in the gallery of the texas state senate to support wendy davis , a democratic senator , in her filibuster against legislation that would limit abortions after 20 weeks and impose new regulations that would leave just a few abortion clinics open we were part of the crowd who raised our voices in anger as the republicans who control the legislature tried to shut down ms davis , who spoke continuously for about 11 hours unable to eat , drink , sit , lean or use the bathroom to run out the clock on the session we remained in the gallery until 1 30 am on june 26 , when state troopers finally made us leave an hour and a half later , celebration erupted when we learned that the filibuster had succeeded sadly , the victory was fleeting , as gov rick perry , a republican , has summoned the legislature back into special session to take up the issue again this week the legislation comes on top of texas' sonogram law , which mr perry signed in 2011 it requires a doctor to conduct a sonogram at least 24 hours before an abortion and to give the woman the opportunity to see the results and hear the heartbeat of the fetus though she can choose not to view the images and hear the heartbeat , the doctor must describe what the sonogram shows my mother , sherry matusoff merfish , sat and yelled in indignation beside my sister and me in the senate gallery she has two graduate degrees and has built an immensely satisfying career as a political fundraiser devoted to the election of women who support abortion rights she also embodies maternal warmth my mother chose to abort her first pregnancy , in 1972 she and my father , who celebrated 40 years of marriage on jan 6 this year , met as undergraduates at the university of texas , austin they got engaged then my mother became pregnant she was 20 , and he was 21 they knew they were thoroughly unprepared to be parents , but abortion was illegal in texas at the time \( unless a woman s life was at risk \) this was the year before the united states supreme court , in roe v wade , a case originating in texas , affirmed a woman s right to have an abortion until the fetus was viable fearing the stigma that would result if their families knew they had engaged in premarital sex and not used contraception , my parents did not tell their parents when they traveled to albuquerque to end the pregnancy my mother remembers , vividly , that the doctor who performed the procedure treated her as though she was a criminal a few months later , they were married in san antonio until recently , fear of shame has kept her quiet about her experience , even as she passionately , publicly supported reproductive freedom this is the first time we 've discussed her abortion in public my mother waited until the evening before i began my first year at wellesley college , in 2001 , to tell me about her abortion her voice shook but never broke as she described her fear and her decision she ended by reiterating that her choice was the right one and that her love for my sister and me was unequivocal \( she had told my sister , who is two years older , before she began college \) i was shocked at 18 , i na vely believed that only other women not family and certainly not mother needed this right that our family had long supported we had volunteered at planned parenthood and canvassed for candidates who supported abortion rights my mother said she wanted to reassure me that i had no reason to doubt her support in any situation i might face in my own life although it took a few years for the shock to wear off , knowing made me even more proud of her and more determined to defend reproductive rights recently , i heard my mother reveal her experience to four friends who are devoted to protecting women s right to choose strikingly , two of them revealed that they had had an abortion , and the other two had close friends who 'd had an abortion none had told my mother before what the movement for reproductive rights needs is for the faces of freedom to emerge from the captivity of shame to my mother s generation , i ask speak openly about the choices you have made to all women ask your mothers , grandmothers , godmothers , aunts , sisters , daughters and partners about their reproductive histories show that abortion has myriad faces those of women we love , respect and cherish you have the power to cement in the minds of your communities and families the importance of reproductive freedom you have made decisions that are private , even anguishing , but the weight of this political moment demands that you shed light on those decisions the opposition is frightening , as more states try to restrict abortion , but there is tremendous power and safety in numbers you are part of a society of women who have been incredibly courageous i ask humbly for yet another show of that bravery
jerusalem a lawyer representing government agencies sent letters this week to an american sneaker company and an international hotel chain threatening a boycott and legal action if they did not withdraw their sponsorship of the , which the palestinians say violates international law the letters to new balance , a footwear company based in boston , and the intercontinental hotel group , which includes the crowne plaza hotel in jerusalem , say that the marathon , scheduled for march 1 , is a serious breach of international law because it runs through east jerusalem , territory that captured during the 1967 war and later annexed the palestinians , and much of the world , consider east jerusalem occupied territory , but the israelis see it as part of their capital city as the marathon neither caters to the needs of palestinian civilians nor serves any genuine military purpose , the marathon constitutes an illegal activity in occupied east jerusalem under international humanitarian law , read the letters , sent on behalf of the palestinian olympic committee , athletics federation and higher council of youth and sport citing united nations resolutions , the fourth and an international court of justice ruling , the letters warn if your company does not immediately withdraw sponsorship of this illegal activity , my clients will be forced to pursue this matter legally the letters do not specifically mention the that , but a senior palestinian official said the companies could be targets if palestinians leaders decide to use the new status to pursue claims in international courts another possibility is action by the arab league , whose 22 member states called for a over its sponsorship of the jerusalem marathon last year the mayor of jerusalem , nir barkat , has described the marathon , in its third year , as an effort to make his bitterly divided and contested city normal but normalcy is a challenge in a city that both israelis and palestinians see as their capital , a place that jews , muslims and christians worldwide all revere as holy , a sprawling 48 square miles where 500 , 000 israelis and 300 , 000 palestinians live mostly in separate neighborhoods virtually none of those palestinians vote in municipal elections , for fear of normalization , and many palestinians in recent years have refused to attend meetings or hold official events in parts of jerusalem for the same reason this week , senator marco rubio , republican of florida , during a visit here for an offhand reference to jerusalem as israel s capital , which washington generally avoids american consular officials joke that part of their job is to make sure the mail is addressed simply to jerusalem , not jerusalem , israel asked about the letters to new balance and crowne plaza , a spokesman for mr barkat said on friday that the palestinians were trying to drag the marathon into a political cause this is not politics , this is sport , this is culture , said the spokesman , barak cohen this is a major international event in a major international city , he added , noting that 2 , 000 of the more than 18 , 000 registered runners were from 52 countries arab residents and jewish residents are welcome to participate and celebrate together , he added a spokeswoman for new balance , whose logo is at the top of the marathon s web site next to the slogan , let s make excellent happen , did not respond to inquiries on friday a spokeswoman for the intercontinental hotel group said the company was unaware of the marathon sponsorship , which she said was by the jerusalem crowne plaza , a franchisee she said the hotel s manager could not be reached for comment because of the jewish sabbath

backboard at the buzzer to give secondseeded duke a 2923 lead over seventhseeded creighton in the midwest region doug mcdermott has 13 points and four rebounds for creighton , but only three other bluejays have scored duke s ryan kelly has zero points but three fouls , and blue devils center mason plumlee has two fouls creighton is 0of8 from 3point range and that must change if the bluejays want to pull the upset  mike huguenin no 7 seed illinois has fought its way to a onepoint lead over secondseeded miami with about 12 minutes left in the east region game neither team looks good on offense , and illinois physical nature is causing some problems for miami both teams have suffered with inconsistent offenses this season can either team get hot \?  mike huguenin tyrone garland hits a layup with 25 seconds left to propel 13thseeded la salle to a 7674 victory over 12thseeded ole miss the explorers move on to a west region sweet 16 matchup with ninthseeded wichita state the other half of the south bracket arizona and ohio state la salle was relentless in trying to get into the lane all game with its fourguard offense , and the explorers quickness bothered ole miss , which doesn t exactly lack for athletes la salle is the second team to be involved in a playin game and advance to the sweet 16 vcu did it in 2011 , when it also made it to the final four the rams were a no 11 seed that season  mike huguenin there s 1 23 left and ole miss has the ball and leads by two its big men are weak from the line , so why not foul one of them \? la salle certainly doesn t want a marshall henderson 3pointer at this point  mike huguenin will the marshall henderson show continue \? henderson and ole miss lead la salle 7170 at the final tv timeout henderson has 21 points and has been ably assisted by big man murphy holloway \( 14 points , 14 boards \)  mike huguenin miami s defense has done its job and the secondseeded hurricanes lead seventhseeded illinois 2926 at halftime illinois has hit just 39 percent from the field , and forward tyler griffey has three of the illini s four 3pointers illinois surprisingly is winning the battle of the boards , thanks to griffey s seven rebounds the winner gets marquette in the sweet 16  mike huguenin no 13 seed la salle is getting a big game from senior ramon galloway and leads 12thseeded ole miss by three at the second tv timeout of the second half of their west region game galloway , who began his career at south carolina , has 22 points and has helped hold ole miss guard marshall henderson to 13 points on 5of14 shooting la salle is doing an ok job on the boards , which was a huge question coming into the game indeed , a case can be made that ole miss is not pounding the ball inside often enough against the smallish explorers  mike huguenin the final game of the day will tip at 9 47 pm eastern in philly , with no 2 seed duke taking on no 7 creighton in a midwest region contest two of the best bigshooting big men in the nation will be on view with creighton s doug mcdermott and duke s ryan kelly kelly teams with center mason plumlee for an effective frontcourt duo , and creighton needs a big game from its center , gregory echenique , who began his career at rutgers before moving west plumlee is an athletic big guy echenique \? well , he s not an athletic big guy , instead using his ample size to carve out space in the lane duke has the better backcourt , so creighton needs mcdermott and echenique to produce big numbers mcdermott is a special talent , and lest you think a nonpower conference school can t beat duke relying on just one player , remember what lehigh s cj mccollum did to the blue devils last season  mike huguenin ok , so how in the world has 15thseeded florida gulf coast \( 2510 \) a team that lost five games in the lowrent atlantic sun conference to finish second in the league in the regular season , then had to upset regularseason champ mercer on its home court to win the conference tourney advanced to the sweet 16 \? the main reason is that the eagles have torched two of the top 10 defenses in the nation florida gulf coast scored 78 points on 76 possessions to shock secondseeded georgetown in the first round going into the tourney , georgetown had allowed just 564 points per game and only 085 points per possession the hoyas ranked fourth nationally in defensive efficiency in the regular season , as measured by stats guru ken pomeroy at his aweinspiring kenpomcom website tonight , fgcu scored 81 points on 70 possessions , shooting 56 percent from the field going into the game , san diego state had allowed just 611 points per game just 091 points per possession the aztecs were 10th nationally in defensive efficiency in the regular season , as measured by pomeroy florida awaits in the sweet 16 a team with the no 2 defense as measured by pomeroy  mike huguenin let the celebration continue for florida gulf coast , which beat san diego state by 10 points to become the first no 15 seed to advance to the sweet 16 and let the andy enfield job watch begin enfield is in his second season as coach at fgcu , and his coaching star is whitehot right now enfield has majorcollege coaching experience as an assistant at florida state and also has been an nba assistant which school calls him first \?  mike huguenin it looks to be over in philly , as 15thseeded florida gulf coast is up by 19 over san diego state with four minutes left that means the eagles would be the firstever no 15 to get to the sweet 16 san diego state s offense , as it were , has degenerated into taking contested 3piointer after contested 3pointer , and fgcu has taken advantage  mike huguenin the seventh game of the day tips off at about 9 04 pm eastern , with secondseeded miami facing seventhseeded illinois in an east region game in austin , texas while miami has had some offensive issues at times , its defense has been a constant the outcome of this one should come down to one thing can miami s defense keep the illini from lighting it up from 3point range \? if the illini don t hit at least 10 3pointers , they don t win  mike huguenin we re at the under8minute tv timeout , and florida gulf coast leads san diego state by 10 yep , 10 so let s think about the mindsets for both does fgcu realize it is eight minutes from the sweet 16 and tighten up \? or do the eagles continue to play loose \? and does san diego state bear down on defense the aztecs have been lax on that end of the court in the past few minutes and claw back into it \? or do they panic , not run their offense and take stupid chances on defense \? fgcu is the seventh no 15 seed to win a game in the tourney none of their predecessors have won twice awaiting the winner is florida florida and fgcu never have met in men s basketball , though the eagles recently swept a threegame series from the gators in baseball in gainesville what fgcu is doing is insane in the college game the eagles take dunks , layups or open 3s , the most efficient shots in basketball  nate taylor \( bynatetaylor \) 25 mar 13  mike huguenin florida looks to have weathered the storm the gators have used a 72 run to increase their lead back to 15 minnesota has struggled to score of late the fourth foul on guard andre hollins may have doomed minnesota , as he went to the bench for about five minutes and the gophers bogged down  mike huguenin florida s offense has sputtered to a halt and the gators lead by just eight at the third tv timeout of the second half the gators led by 21 at halftime but have scored just 12 secondhalf points to hold a 6052 advantage erik murphy has four fouls , which hurts the gators andre hollins has four fouls , too , and that hurts minnesota , as he is the gophers leading scorer  mike huguenin no no 15 seed ever has gone to the sweet 16 , but florida gulf coast is doing its best to get there the eagles trail seventhseeded san diego state , 3534 , at halftime  mike huguenin it will be all about the guards in the day s sixth game 12thseeded ole miss vs 13thseeded la salle in a west region game in kansas city it tips at 8 09 pm eastern the winner moves on to play ninthseeded wichita state in a sweet 16 game thursday la salle uses a fourguard offense extensively , and senior ramon galloway who began his career at south carolina and has scored 43 points in three career games against ole miss is the key guy la salle also needs some inside production from forward jerrell wright , the explorers only big man of note junior guard marshall henderson has become the face of ole miss basketball , which isn t always a good thing his coaches and teammates talk about henderson s passion and enthusiasm his detractors throw around words like punk and loudmouth and ballhog henderson has range to 25 or 26 feet and never met a shot he didn t want to take missing four or five or eight or nine in a row doesn t bother henderson he will keep firing away he is seventh nationally in fieldgoal attempts \( no 1 in that category \? ohio state s deshaun thomas \) but ole miss would be bestserved to work from the inside out today murphy holloway and reginald buckner are physical big guys who should get a lot of good looks in the paint against the small explorers  mike huguenin that coughing sound you hear coming from austin , texas \? that s the sound of florida gagging the gators have had issues at times this season with uninspired play early in the second half and it has hit again minnesota has cut florida s 21point halftime lead to seven with 12 minutes to go  mike huguenin minnesota has opened the second half with a vengeance , using a 132 run to cut florida s lead to 10 with a bit more than four minutes gone the gators had seemed in complete control , but now things have gotten interesting the gators have been sloppy offensively and it has cost them  mike huguenin maybe the dunk of the tourney comes from florida gulf coast s eric mcknight , a thunderous onehanded tomahawk off an alleyoop pass that gave the eagles a twopoint lead over san diego state  mike huguenin the florida gult coastsan diego state game certainly is a freeflowing affair early both teams are getting up and down the court , and it s san diego state with the first alleyoop dunk it s tied at 77 with 15 minutes left  mike huguenin there s still about threeandahalf minutes left , but go ahead and mark in kansas for the sweet 16 the jayhawks have torched north carolina in the second half and lead by 16 kansas will meet michigan on friday night the key guy for michigan \? how about freshman big man mitch mcgary he has to give the wolverines some kind of inside presence against kansas jeff withey , who has been a oneman zone in the first two rounds  mike huguenin thirdseeded florida has played a tremendous first half and topseeded kansas is playing a tremendous second half , and it s hard to fathom either of them losing in their south region games the gators lead minnesota , 4827 , at halftime , and kansas has blown open its game against north carolina , leading by 14 with eight minutes left in the game  mike huguenin everybody s favorite bracketbuster will be the focal point of the fifth game of the day , and we don t mean san diego state the seventhseeded aztecs meet 15thseeded florida gulf coast in a south region game in philly the game tips off at 7 10 pm eastern florida gulf coast , which didn t even exist until 1997 , is in just its second season as a fullfledged division i member , but the eagles pulled the tourney s biggest upset by running past secondseeded georgetown they impressed everyone with their demeanor and freeflowing offense against the hoyas \( who lost to a doubledigit seed for the fourth consecutive time \) as with georgetown , san diego state prefers a bumpandgird affair where defense rules but florida gulf coast was able to play at a fast pace , its favorite tempo , and needs to do so again today the eagles are athletic extremely athletic , in fact , for a lowmajor school and won t be overmatched physically by the aztecs the higher the point total , the better it is for fgcu san diego state wants to make this a game in the 60s florida gulf coast \( the alma mater of chicago white sox pitcher chris sale \) is the seventh no 15 seed to win a game in the tourney none won its second game  mike huguenin kansas is playing with much more energy and now leads north carolina by five ku is running more in this half , and big man jeff withey is making like a volleyball player and spiking everything in sight in the paint  mike huguenin man , florida looks tremendous the gators are hitting their shots , flustering minnesota with their defense and also controlling the boards in leading by 18 with a bit more than four minutes to go in the first half  mike huguenin kansas seems much more focused and has trimmed north carolina s ninepoint halftime lead to one less than four minutes into the second half  mike huguenin thirdseeded florida continues to be redhot and has opened a 3015 lead over minnesota with a bit less than eight minutes left in the first half of a south region game the gators are 10of13 from the field and getting open looks everywhere  mike huguenin thirdseeded florida is sharp offensively early and leads 11thseeded minnesota 2112 at the second tv timeout the gators are 8of11 from the floor and doing what they want inside and outside while minnesota has more bulk , florida looks way more athletic and much quicker  mike huguenin topseeded kansas managed just 21 firsthalf points and trails eighthseeded north carolina by nine kansas coach bill self needs to be worried north carolina never will be confused with a lockdown defensive team , yet has stymied the jayhawks kansas is 7of28 from the field , including 0of6 from 3point range that means that in three halves of ncaa tourney action , the jayhawks are 0of12 from beyond the arc unc also is doing a good job on the boards though the heels are smaller , ku has outrebounded unc by only one  mike huguenin georgetown s stunning loss has opened up the bottom half of the south region bracket , and thirdseeded florida hopes it is in position to take advantage the gators meet 11thseeded minnesota in austin , texas , in the day s fourth game and the contest tips at 6 10 pm eastern time florida is 277 this season , and each win has come by at least 10 points the gators blowout of northwestern state \( la \) on friday was their 16th by at least 20 points but the gators are 06 in games decided by single digits while minnesota is one game away from the sweet 16 , the golden gophers have underachieved a bit relative to their talent level they opened the season 151 , but are just 611 since minnesota s win over ucla on friday was just its fourth in its past 11 games florida is known for its stingy defense this season , and minnesota s offense was inconsistent in big ten play but minnesota looks to have an advantage on the boards , and if florida center patric young doesn t get some early baskets , the gators could become strictly a perimeter team  mike huguenin we re at the third tv timeout in kansasnorth carolina , and it s 1411 , heels there hasn t been a lack of offense there just has been a lack of made shots the teams have combined to put up 49 shots but have made just nine there have been enough bricks tossed up to build an addition to the sprint center in kansas city  mike huguenin james michael mcadoo has picked up his second foul for north carolina , which is incredibly bad news for the heels he is the only big man who can score for the heels does roy williams keep him out for the rest of the half \? willliams probably won t have that luxury  mike huguenin kansas is off to an incredibly slow start offensively just six points in the first 8 40 but north carolina is struggling as well the heels lead 146 unc is 5of20 from the field , kansas 2of14 at least early , the tar heels quickness seems bothersome to the jayhawks the problem for the heels they re not hitting their open looks  mike huguenin oladipo is an announcer s dream you can emphasize any of his four syllables in exultation  jay busbee \( jaybusbee \) 24 mar 13 unfortunately for kansas , it has picked up where if left off friday , when it looked bad for most of the game against western kentucky north carolina has jumped out to a 92 lead at the first tv timeout kansas already has two turnovers and has hit just one of its first seven shots  mike huguenin indiana is in the round of 16 for the second consecutive season the hoosiers haven t advanced to the round of eight , though , since 2002 the season in which they lost in the national title game to maryland before that , iu hadn t been to the round of eight since 1993  mike huguenin while wyatt certainly won the oneonone contest , it was victor deepo with four consecutive points , including the dagger 3pointer , that put indiana up for good after trailing for most of the second half wyatt took a horrible shot , and still looked very much on tilt from the previous foul that was called on him indiana survives the scare , despite scoring over twenty fewer points than they re accustomed to christian watford was huge down the stretch , as was oladipo it s too bad that wyatt can t advance as well he d be a fun player to watch in the round of 16 and beyond i think teams should be allowed to pick one player from each team they beat in the postseason the big ten continues its dominance of this tournament for those keeping track , that s four big ten teams that have already reserved their table in the round of sixteen , with two more looking to do so tonight \( illinois and minnesota \) a potential round of sixteen with six big ten teams \? i can t remember the last time a conference performed this well collectively one thing is for sure , and it s that the regular season really prepared these kids for playing in closely contested games cooler heads always prevail , and the big ten has been the coolest  zach hillesland worst part for temple calling timeout when wyatt had ball oneonone , only to let iubb double him out of timeout  eric crawford \( ericcrawford \) 24 mar 13 topseeded kansas needs to play better today than it did friday , when it slogged past 16thseeded western kentucky in the first round and didn t put the contest away until late the jayhawks meet eighthseeded north carolina in a south regional game in kansas city in a game that tips at 5 15 pm eastern unc went to a smaller lineup at midseason and it has paid off with better offensive efficiency but its lack of size could be a problem today against kansas 7footer jeff withey , who can be dominant in the paint , especially on defense keep an eye on unc forward james michael mcadoo if he can hit some perimeter shots , the tar heels chances for an upset increase greatly this will be the third time unc coach roy williams has guided his tar heels against his previous employer the previous meetings also came in the ncaa tourney , and kansas won both  mike huguenin indiana s watford just had a momentum saving monster block that prevented temple from going up four with two minutes left wyatt drew the double team and was able to find an open man under the basket , but watford erased it emphatically a foul was just called on wyatt that was an absolute joke oladipo was pushing the ball in transition and wyatt perfectly anticipated his move and jumped the ball there was very little contact but a lot of anticipation from the refs and a foul was called , which caused wyatt to explode in a number of colorful epithets he has a right to be mad he s being punished for knowing the future oladipo only hit one of the free throws and indiana clings to a onepoint lead with less than a minute to play maybe wyatt can calm himself down enough to hit another game winner deep breaths , deep breaths  zach hillesland i m glad there s nothing better than hd , because i m pretty sure i d be able to see khalif wyatt drooling he s already crossed the 30point threshold and is likely going to have the ball in his hands every possession down the stretch wyatt can t be stopped he is , however , working harder for his points today he s only been to the line twice , and you wonder if he could really be dominating this game if he would make the conscious decision to draw contact and fouls indiana is doing its best to hang around , but still need someone to step up i nominate yogi ferrell yogi had such strong start in indiana s first round game , but has been nonexistent thus far , and it s thrown indiana s offense off balance and every time indiana actually does throw some heat at temple , khalif wyatt is right there with a flamethrower ready to burn the place down like i said , if this one stays close down the stretch , and i think it will , temple has the advantage wyatt wanted this game , he wants to ball , he wants to win , and he s playing loose and carefree , a luxury indiana apparently couldn t afford  zach hillesland  the new york times there s nothing quite like the look of relief on a mother s face when her son makes important free throws it s like she s seeing her son again for the first time , deciding not to hate him despite all the pain that he s caused i was a free poor free throw shooter sorry , madre  zach hillesland both sides are playing with a sense of urgency and this entire second half is going to have the intensity and character of a game with four minutes left it s as if every player is keenly aware of just how delicate this balance has already become indiana is down five but they re playing with the urgency of being down 20 , which you think would pay dividends if they can do so in a loose and semirelaxed fashion right now , they seem a little too tense , and it s forcing them to rush plays the good news for the hoosiers is that both zeller and hulls are back on the floor the bad news is that they ve already let khalif wyatt score again  zach hillesland jordan hulls threepoint stroke looks fine during warmups going to be a matter of shaking temple defenders 2926 temple  rickbozich \( rickrack \) 24 mar 13 starting guard jordan hulls has left the game with an injured shooting shoulder , zeller is in foul trouble , and indiana is starting to look a bit nervous on the floor while temple continues to gain confidence through the play of khalif wyatt if temple can get at least one more player in an active flow , that would be two more than indiana has right now and would put the hoosiers in a very precarious situation in the second half halftime adjustments are going to be huge again , and it ll be interesting to see what types of changes these coaches try to implement if you re indiana , you need to get some clean rebounds and get out in transition , and let guys like zeller stretch his stems temple , again , needs to find some other players to contribute offensively , but i think that s primarily the responsibility of wyatt he s clearly the general and he s going to be drawing hordes of attention he needs to find ways to get others involved and make them better too many pullup jumpers will kill his momentum at the half , temple up on indiana , 2926  zach hillesland  the new york times wyatt continues his hot streak , cody zeller has two fouls , and indiana has gone cold on the strength of 20 wyatt points , temple has this game all knotted up at 24 apiece wyatt has shown an almost kobelike arsenal with his offensive attack he s shooting from deep , attacking off the dribble , and finishing on crafty upandunders you certainly aren t feeling all that comfortable if you re an indiana fan right now if temple can keep this one close , they might have the advantage down the stretch based solely on wyatt s ability to score  zach hillesland well , that theory didn t last long seconds after doubting wyatt s ability to go off , he rattles off a quick six points and looks untouchable i still think tom crean will make adjustments , and you d think he has the athletic horses to do what he wants but whatever , wyatt already has 13 points and is on pace for 43 , and is keeping temple alive in this one those rudimentary calculations never work  zach hillesland what an asset indiana s will sheehey has been for tom crean sheehey is basically deepo light he s athletic , energetic , active , and can shoot , all traits of oladipo as well being able to bring a consistent scorer off the bench is one of the many reasons why indiana is the favorite to win this tournament for a lot of people having five players that average double figures is so rare meanwhile , temple is looking like too much khalif wyatt and not enough anything else wyatt is going to really have to go off , something that i don t see tom crean allowing  zach hillesland i have no problem saying that indiana s victor oladipo is one of my favorite players in recent college basketball memory he s an absolutely freak specimen of an athlete , can shoot , can fly , can dribble , can defend he can do it all from now on i ll be referring to him as deepo , partly because he has a deep offensive arsenal , but mostly because i don t care to keep checking the spelling , but also because i hope charles barkley picks it up so he doesn t have to try and pronounce it ever again i love you , chuck deepo has indiana s first and only four points , as does khalif wyatt for his temple owls wyatt , fresh off his tournamenthigh 31 against nc state , looks primed and primped to continue from where he left off this could be a good headtohead match up all game long  zach hillesland i desperately want an indianasyracuse match up in the sweet sixteen partly because i think those teams match up really well together , and partly because i have syracuse beating the hoosiers , and that is the absolute make break game for my bracket some might think that s a bit of a risk , but when the pot is only 10 and you still haven t paid your cousin , you have a little bit more freedom and obviously a bit more cash i played with a zeller at notre dame luke was huge and athletic , but i ve never seen anyone run like younger brother cody he covers so much ground in such little time that i \( perhaps idiotically \) start thinking of him as a centerversion of lebron james in terms of runningthefloor ability that is truly a skill , and it opens so many different avenues for indiana , and is a big reason why cody is going to be a high draft pick whenever he decides to enter next week in los angeles it ll be a reunion for xavier coaches thad matta and sean miller sean coached under thad before he took over after thad s departure \( vague pronoun usage anyone \? \) for those who know the intimate details of the coaches systems and strategies , this game will take on a whole nother level the gamesmanship has already started in his postgame interview , thad couldn t keep himself from repeatedly saying arizona is the best team on the west coast that could very much be true , but i just find it fascinating that he s already got his baster out to butter his former assistant next week s match up is an absolute mustwatch  zach hillesland i still can t get over what aaron craft just did what an unbelievable play that s the kind of shot that secures you employment forever and i m not talking about the nba , i m talking about every ohio state fan everywhere wanting to have aaron craft in their stable rosy cheeks , man brain , and heart of a lion ! the big ten continues to dominate this tournament  zach hillesland craft mans ship , shows unbelievable craftsmanship , and absolutely steals the buzzer butter from deshaun thomas , who absolutely doesn t care because ohio state is undoubtedly going to advance after that last second shot from aaron craft aaron craft had the audacity to wave off deshaun thomas i was about to throw all of the things on my table at my tv how do you wave off deshaun thomas \? \? \? ! ! oh , by hitting a three to win it i ve never seen a more confident play , maybe in my entire life that s like rajon rondo waving off kobe for a jumper i never thought i d see that unbelievable one of the coolest plays i ve ever seen  zach hillesland is the deshaun thomas buzzer butter on its way \? i think it certainly might be there s just under 30 seconds and the buckeyes have the ball and no shot clock the butter is coming get your toast toasted  zach hillesland this is so out of hand the charge is the worst thing in sports a perfectly legal and athletic drive by iowa state negated and penalized ohio state rewarded for garbage defense bad karma for the buckeyes on that one  zach hillesland iowa state is heating up while ohio state is melting down , and the result has been a 152 run that has the cyclones on top for the first time since anyone can remember \( but probably not that long ago \) aaron craft had a rough go of it during that stretch , but has just responded with a driving and1 basket and free throw to put the buckeyes back up 1 with just around three minutes left this one is officially heading to the wire , as thad matta s chewing gum can certainly attest to  zach hillesland  the new york times why can t we just get rid of fouling out and the block charge \? would it be so hard \? certainly we can think of some solution not only do these two rules wreak havoc in basketball games , i don t think they send good life messages to our children ! our children s children ! five semiarbitrary and subjective infractions are levied upon you and you are done forever what a disheartening reality there s a good chance i m mad because i nearly fouled out every game i ve ever played \( livin on the edge , man \) i don t know what it is about referees and why i innately don t like them , and they immediately hate me i think a lot of it has to do with their oppressive stripes can t there be a better uniform than that \? current referee dress code 1 wear a shirt that looks like bars of a jail cell , with proper fit , and always tucked into the pantaloons 2 go to zapposcom and just type in ugliest shoes in the world , select black , and ship zapposcom has a great return policy no wonder they re so mad all the time oh and the charge \? we might as well get rid of the scoreboard and not keep count because all the charge is is a move of surrender the only way i can beat you is to stand like an inanimate object i win what a bunch of bologna , the g is not silent changing these two things would improve actual defense and increase aggressiveness going to the basket it s a winwin  zach hillesland buckeye xfactor laquinton ross just finished his second personal minirun of the game , this time a five point flurry capped by another threepointer that s given ohio state its biggest lead of the afternoon this is how ohio state beats you deshaun thomas does the consistent heavy lifting , but then his contract killers come out of the woodwork to deliver dagger after dagger at just the right moments the result is a collective swell of momentum that s hard for any team to combat we pretty much know thomas is always going to show up , but when you can start counting on the likes of laquinton ross and shannon scott \? spells trouble for buckeye opponents ross has his personally tally all the way up to seventeen , and his personal minirun up to ten , and is looking more and more confident each possession heading down the stretch , it s the buckeyes up nine with seven minutes to go  zach hillesland wondering why fred hoiberg is so calm on the sidelines \? it might have something to do with his heart http tco usndiodxqi  zach schonbrun \( zschonbrun \) 24 mar 13 so far it seems like deshaun thomas tweaked ankle it doing just fine , much as expected he s already taken four shots , so he clearly hasn t found any bashfulness , which is a good thing for a player of his skill set i feel like thomas could get grazed , possibly even hit , by a school bus \( or any other type of bus i suppose \) and still be fine he appears to have old man strength at the ripe old age of twentyone i can only imagine what he ll be like when he s fifty and has a couple ales in him iowa state doesn t seem to care about thomas old man strength as much as i do , and are still in lockstep with the buckeyes , despite 20 points from deshaun this one is likely going to come down to end of game situations , and i have this feeling like ohio state is going to get bitten by one last offensive rebound perhaps only to be saved by a deshaun thomas buzzer beater wouldn t be a bad way to enter the sweet sixteen , a little buzzer butter  zach hillesland iowa state has completely dominated the buckeyes on the glass , outrebounding ohio state 2312 if ohio state can even reduce that discrepancy , they should be able to build a little bit of a cushion on a number of possessions , the buckeyes showed no interest in finding a man or boxing out , opting instead to lazily head to the boards , hands on their sides , and let rebounds bounce over and past them , creating second and third chance opportunities for the cyclones it ll be interesting to see how well thad matta can adjust his players behavior and focus if this were michigan state , you know tom izzo would have his guys all over every rebound in the first five minutes ohio state needs to show some urgency on the glass two words to describe their strategy glass urgency  zach hillesland entertaining first half in dayton 10 lead changes and 7 ties largest lead 6 points isu osu marchmadness  zach schonbrun \( zschonbrun \) 24 mar 13  the new york

ohio state s deshaun thomas tweaked his ankle and had to leave the court , a potentially huge development if he s not able to return in all my experience playing sports , i ve noticed that there are two types of athletes those who are affected my ankle sprains and those who are not some guys can roll an ankle three times in a possession and still be fine to go others can roll their ankle while laying down on a couch and miss 34 weeks i think a lot of it boils down to pain threshold and toughness , and if i had to guess , deshaun thomas will be on the court to start the second half this isn t the time of the year to be one of those guys , not that he s ever one of those anyway  zach hillesland this tournament has featured some of the worst shooting i ve ever seen , and that s coming from a guy who had a solid fifteen foot cushion every time i had the ball \( no range , no change \) the thing that troubles me isn t necessarily that there are so many misses , but there are so many bad misses , or bricks as the kids used to say when both teams shoot in the 30 percent range , the game really starts to drag hopefully this will be a tale of the first half , and both teams will sharpen up after some half time coffee speaking of getting sharp , laquinton ross has already started to flash some of his xfactor ability the buckeyes were in a bit of an offensive lull , but ross has been extremely aggressive off the bench , has hit a three , and gotten to the rim for another bucket my cousin , ohio state alum and buckeye fan nerd , was moved to say , he s a less talented kevin durant and he didn t mean that as a slight , but as a compliment that s akin to saying you re a less rich warren buffett you re still rich , just not omaha rich  zach hillesland maybe it s because i ve seen more ohio state basketball this year than anything else \( thanks , roommates \) , but they seem to have the right collection of personalities and role players to advance deep into the bracket we ve already mentioned deshaun thomas , the obvious buckeye goto guy but then there s aaron craft , the rosycheeked toddler with the icy demeanor of a seasoned professional , who s done a fabulous job of keeping ohio state even keeled all year i m also very high on laquinton ross the lanky sophomore has perhaps the most potential of any buckeye , and has been the xfactor in a number of games this year he can shoot from deep , has become more and more comfortable attacking the basket , and always has tremendous length at his disposal on the boards and at the defensive end aside from committing one of the most idiotic plays of the tournament thus far \( a truly unnecessary technical foul for taunting \) , i really enjoy the game of shannon scott he s on the short list for tournament s best defender he s the type of defender that s so consistently effective that you forget about any and all offensive deficiencies his quick and active hands routinely lead to fast break opportunities for the buckeyes we haven t even mentioned sam thompson or lenzelle smith , jr but you get the idea the buckeyes have a wellrounded roster , one capable of matching up with any team in the tournament they lack a little bit of size up front , but they make up for it in toughness with that all being said , iowa state has been performing much better than a ten seed all tournament after destroying notre dame , they re again ready for business , relentlessly crashing the boards on both ends and currently sporting a sevenrebound advantage on ohio state iowa state coach fredrick kristian hoiberg , according to my grandfather , has done a fantastic job with this team all year , and this tournament has been no different these past four days have shown that the teams with the most discipline and focus are the ones that advance i still think ohio state has the advantage in this game and are more battletested , but if they re going to advance , it s not going to be easy  zach hillesland ohio state s deshaun thomas has to be one of the most fun players to watch in the tournament this year he s an interesting blend of paul pierce and zach randolph , the result being a dude s dude who has an innate ability to score having a player who can create offense out of thin air is such an incredible asset in this tournament , and it s a big reason i have ohio state advancing to the final four and with gonzaga s early exit last night , the path for the buckeye s is wide open with that being said , the buckeyes are off to a bit of a slow start here against iowa state , but i don t really pay any mind to what happens in games before 1 pm eastern these kids are still waking up i m still waking up  zach hillesland
doral , fla the featured group at the cadillac championship on thursday was like a marquee with one light burned out and another flickering in a grouping of the top three players in the world , only one posted a luminous score it was not the world no 1 , rory mcilroy , whose struggles continued in the first round of this world golf championships event as he needed a late surge to negotiate the doral resort s blue monster in a oneover 73 it was not the world no 3 , luke donald , who plunked his opening shot into the water and struggled with his distance control on his irons before rallying on the second nine for a 70 , the world no 2 , accounted for most of the group s electricity with a sixunder 66 in perfect scoring conditions ample sunshine and negligible wind to move into a fiveway tie for first with fredrik jacobson , sergio garc a , graeme mcdowell and bubba watson it was certainly a day that could have been a little bit lower , said woods , who birdied five of his last nine holes after starting out birdie , birdie , bogey , bogey woods said he enjoyed the illustrious grouping , describing it as fun for us , never mind that for the first nine holes , none of the players looked happy a day after receiving a tutorial on the green from his good friend steve stricker , who adjusted his posture , woods oneputted 12 greens and finished with 23 putts whatever he says , i'm going to do , woods said he s one of the best putters that s ever lived mcilroy , playing for the first time since he withdrew in the middle of the second round of last week s honda classic because of a painful wisdom tooth and abscesses in his game , hit three fairways and had 31 putts on the eve of the tournament , mcilroy had vowed to focus on the fun of competing instead of the stresses of performing the people around him did their best to keep the mood lighthearted one of his managers , colin morrissey , remained rooted to the range as mcilroy made his way to the 10th tee enjoy , he said as mcilroy walked past him was he not going to follow him \? morrissey said he planned to catch up to mcilroy when he was through i told him i 'd meet him on the sixth hole , he said , joking despite their efforts , mcilroy s face for most of the round was longer than a belly putter it was a bit of a struggle , to be honest , mcilroy said hit some good shots , hit some notsogood shots as i 've been saying all week , this is a work in progress between shots , mcilroy was often seen mimicking his takeaway the motion he made with his right arm was not unlike the half wave that players muster to acknowledge the cheers and support of fans throughout the day , the spectators tried to lift mcilroy s spirits with voices dripping with sympathy , they yelled encouragement like stay positive , rory and feel better , rory mcilroy s tribulations were magnified by the sharp play down the stretch of his playing partners both donald and woods played the front nine in fourunder 32 i could have shot 29 if i 'd made a couple putts , donald said i'm excited about that especially given his start my very first hole was just a duck hook , just a terrible shot , he said at no 7 , a 454yard par4 , mcilroy hit his best shot of the day and covered the flag with his approach they were the first two solid shots he had strung together , and he made them count by draining the birdie putt mcilroy hit solid shots on the next two holes , finishing birdiepar to take away some positives from the round it s something to build on , said his caddie , j p fitzgerald what people remember from last year is that mcilroy was second , first and third in his first three tour starts and piled up three victories , including a runaway win at the pga championship , in a span of less than a month to finish the season what woods reminded everybody on thursday is that mcilroy endured a stretch in june and july when his best finish was a tie for seventh i do n't think he s quite drawing the ball like he used to , like he wants , woods said maybe just a little bit defensive out there woods said he had talked a little bit to mcilroy , coming to his aid , similar to the way stricker came to him on the practice green did he care to share any of what he said \? no , woods said with a laugh we have all gone through stretches like this , he said it happens and it happened to him last year in the middle of the year , and ended up all right at the end of the year woods added when you play golf and you play for a very long time , you 're going to have spells like this you ca n't play well every week , even though you try before he left the interview area , mcilroy told fitzgerald to meet him on the range he knows there are no short cuts to regaining his form all he can do is work on it , and work on it some more
mike rice was brusque , shorttempered and intense , but former basketball players at robert morris did not recognize him in the video of his outbursts at rutgers they remembered him grabbing players , cursing and throwing basketballs across the gym but never aiming the ball at a player they said his behavior never resembled abuse , and his coarse language and acerbic behavior were hardly out of line with what was expected at toplevel college basketball programs i did n't like him all the time i was there , said fred harris , who played for rice during the 20078 season , but once i left , i really learned and appreciated what he taught me five former players and staff members from robert morris , where rice coached from 2007 to 2010 , spoke positively during interviews about their time with him the interviews presented a far different picture of rice from the man in the video , the one who cursed and kicked his players , the one whom gov chris christie of new jersey called an animal they said he built a familial environment in the program he let them call him by his college nickname , mike nice a reference to his playing days at fordham from 1987 to '91 took them to expensive steak restaurants on the road and urged them to broaden their horizons by trying different foods , like calamari he 'd tell me , fred , i do n't know what you 're going to do in the future , but i just want you to experience these things , ' harris said he would invite the team to his home in a pittsburgh suburb , fox chapel , pa , for cookouts with his wife , kerry , and their children , katie and michael in the basement , the players would engage rice in heated pingpong matches after a big win by his team , rice might push back curfew , like the time he rented a bus and took the players on a tour of south beach in miami after a victory over florida international early in his first season the fact that coach rice let us have some fun shows me how much trust he had in us as a team and how much of a family we really were , bas rozendaal said in an email from the netherlands , where he played professionally justin haas , a former student manager with the robert morris basketball team , worked with rice for three years if i had a son playing collegiate basketball , i would be 100 percent satisfied if mike rice was his coach because i know he will be pushed to his limits and become a better player because of it , he said the five former players and officials interviewed for this article were among dozens of people , including many former rutgers players , that the new york times attempted to reach the team rice inherited at robert morris in 2007 went 162 in the northeast conference and 268 over all , with a complex motion offense and a hardnosed halfcourt defense the regular afternoon practices at charles l sewall center were scheduled for 90 minutes and rarely ran over in that hour and a half , though , much needed to be done , and rice made sure his team practiced hard harris described rice s coaching style as up close and personal he was really loud and up in your face , and you 'd know where he wanted you to go , harris said if rice wanted to position a player in a certain spot , he might grab the player s shoulders and direct him but that was where the line was drawn , harris said i never saw any pushing , shoving , hitting rice might fling a basketball across the court in frustration , but rozendaal said he never saw it hurled at a player and if players did not appreciate rice s behavior , they might even snap back at him nobody was afraid of him , harris said if it got to the point where he was saying something you really did n't like , he was open to you coming back at him it was n't like it was a slave ship or something if you had something to say , he gave you an opportunity to say it eric murdock , the former rutgers assistant who released the footage of rice s practices that cost rice his job last week , said that there had been as many as five fights between robert morris s players and coaches during rice s tenure an internal investigation conducted by robert morris s senior athletics staff found no evidence of any altercations , the university said tuesday players did remember rice sometimes using boorish language , although none recalled him saying anything homophobic or egregiously offensive harris said rice would refer to him being from alabama and would harp on him for being overweight , which sometime stung but never caused friction i might have a problem with what he said , but there 'd be truth to it , harris said i hate it , but now he had to learn the hard way that you just ca n't say everything you want to say he always would say what he wanted to say if he felt it , he let it out will royal , a forward for robert morris from 2007 to '09 , said he never saw rice act as he did on the rutgers tape , but he thought certain similar behavior was conducted in gyms across the country , behind closed doors , without video evidence i really feel bad for him , royal said he s probably the only coach that s been caught on tape doing this stuff or saying this stuff i'm pretty sure once this video leaked , there were coaches saying , go find this tape , ' and burning tapes now as we speak
loi , vietnam they had no plan to break barriers or cause trouble but 30 years ago in this bucolic village in northern vietnam , the fierce determination of one group of women to become mothers upended centuriesold gender rules and may have helped open the door for a nation to redefine parenthood one recent morning in loi , as farmers in conical straw hats waded quietly through rice paddies , a small group of women played with their grandchildren near a stream their husbands were nowhere to be found , not because they perished in the war , but because the women decided to have children without husbands the women s story began during the american war , as it is called here , when many put the revolution before their families as peace settled more than a decade later , it became clear that they like so many of their generation had sacrificed their marriageable years to the war at that time vietnamese women traditionally married around 16 , and those still single at 20 would often be considered qua lua , or past the marriageable age when single men who survived the war returned home , they often preferred younger brides , exacerbating the effects of a sex ratio already skewed by male mortality in the war according to the vietnam population and housing census of 2009 , after reunification in 1979 there were on average only about 88 men for every 100 women between 20 and 44 unlike previous generations of unwanted vietnamese women who dutifully accepted the so , or destiny , of living a solitary life , a group of women in loi decided to take motherhood into their own hands they had endured the war , developed a new strength and were determined not to die alone one by one they asked men whom they would never interact with afterward to help them conceive a child the practice became known as xin con , or asking for a child , and it meant breaking with tradition , facing discrimination and enduring the hardships of raising a child alone it was unusual , and quite remarkable , said harriet phinney , an assistant professor of anthropology at seattle university who is writing a book on the practice of xin con in vietnam purposely conceiving a child out of wedlock , she said , was unheardof before the revolutionary era it was a product of the mothers' bravery , said ms phinney , but also of a postwar society that acknowledged the unique situation of women across vietnam , including thousands of widows , who were raising children alone some of the women in loi were willing to share their stories , though they always kept the names of the fathers a tightly held secret one of the first women in loi to ask for a child was nguyen thi nhan , now 58 ms nhan had led a platoon of women during the war , and though she never saw battle , was awarded a medal for her exemplary leadership her husband , with whom she had a daughter , abandoned her after the war ms nhan moved to the cheapest land she could find , a field near the stream on the outskirts of loi , where a few refugees from bombing nearby still lived she then asked for a second child , ending up with the son she wished for her first several years were hard despite her best efforts , food and money were scarce the villagers eventually set aside prejudices and accepted her choice , offering to share the little food they could spare eventually , ms nhan was joined by more than a dozen other women among them was nguyen thi luu , 63 she had fallen in love with a soldier who was killed in battle in 1972 i was 26 when the war ended , ms luu said that was considered too old for marriage , in those times i did not want to marry a bad , older man , and no single men came to me but ms luu wanted to become a mother , not least so she would have support in her old age in vietnam , nursing homes are scarce , and care for the elderly is considered a filial duty i was afraid to die alone , ms luu said i wanted someone to lean on in my old age i wanted a child of my own although her decision at first angered her parents and brother , they soon accepted it and embraced her two daughters her parents bought her a plot of the only land they could afford here in loi , in what had by then become known as the community of single women it was comforting to be in a group with other women in a similar situation , she said outside of loi , many women across vietnam had made the same decision the growing number of single mothers , especially those who had fought for the revolution , at length caught the attention of the women s union , the government agency that oversees programs for women many women gave everything in the war , and it was important to recognize their sacrifice , said tran thi ngoi , head of the women s union in the soc son district of hanoi although the plight of the war generation single mothers was only one factor , in 1986 the government passed the marriage and family law , which for the first time recognized single mothers and their children as legally legitimate it was a victory for the mothers in loi , and for others like them every woman has the right to be a wife and a mother , and if she cannot find a husband , she should still have the right to her own child , ms ngoi said since then , the government , working with international organizations , has continued to push for equal rights for women and to improve their health and education today single mothers in the countryside still face hardship , discrimination and shame , but benefit from government initiatives that started with the older generation in loi only four of the 17 women who founded the community are left three have died , some have gone to live with their children in other villages and others married men who were widowers later in their lives those who remain have upgraded their huts to real homes , with small gardens their children , now grown , send a portion of their small salaries to support their mothers none of the women see themselves as pioneers , nor do they dwell on the impact of the choices they made i do n't know if i ever served as inspiration , said one , who did not want to be identified to preserve her privacy and that of her son i just worked on my own decisions i just wanted to be a mother no one could change my mind
cambridge , mass on april 9 , 2003 , baghdad fell to an americanled coalition the removal of saddam hussein and the toppling of a whole succession of other arab dictators in 2011 were closely connected a fact that has been overlooked largely because of the hostility that the iraq war engendered few of the brave young men and women behind the arab spring have been willing to publicly admit the possibility of a link between their revolutions and the end of mr hussein s bloody reign 10 years ago these activists have for the most part vigorously denied that their own demands for freedom and democracy , which were organic and homegrown , had anything to do with a war they saw as illegitimate and imperialistic to see the connection between the overthrow of mr hussein in 2003 and the overthrow of hosni mubarak in 2011 , one must go back to 1990 , when iraq s army marched into kuwait the first gulf war in which an americanled coalition ousted iraq s occupying army enjoyed the support of most arab governments , but not of their populations mr hussein s invasion of kuwait threatened the order that had kept authoritarian regimes in power for decades and arab leaders were willing to fight to restore it citizens tend to rally around their leaders when faced with external attacks but iraqis did n't millions of iraqis rose up against mr hussein following the 1991 war , and did what was then unthinkable they called upon the foreign forces that had been bombing them to help rid them of their own dictator mr hussein s brutal response to the 1991 uprising killed tens of thousands of iraqis for the first time , the rhetoric used by mr hussein s socalled secular nationalist regime turned explicitly sectarian , a forerunner of what we see in syria today no more shias after today , was the slogan painted on the tanks that rolled over najaf and fired at shiite protesters the western and arab armies that had come to liberate kuwait simply stood by and watched as shiites and kurds who rose up were massacred the overthrow of mr hussein was deemed to be beyond the war s mandate and so ordinary iraqis had to die in droves as the arab state system was restored by force of western arms those iraqi deaths were a dress rehearsal for what is going on in other parts of the middle east today the first gulf war achieved america s goals , but the people of iraq paid the price for that success they were left with international sanctions for another 12 years under a brutal and bitter dictator itching for vengeance against those who had dared to rise up against him , including kurds in the north and shiites in the south by the time of the american invasion in 2003 , the iraqi middle class had been decimated , state institutions had been gutted and mistrust and hostility toward america abounded both the george w bush administration and the iraqi expatriate opposition to mr hussein myself included grossly underestimated those costs in the runup to the 2003 war the iraqi state , we failed to realize , had become a house of cards none of these errors of judgment were necessarily an argument against going to war if you believed , as i do , that overthrowing mr hussein was in the best interests of the iraqi people the calculus looks different today if one s starting point is american national interest i could not in good conscience tell an american family grieving for a son killed in iraq that the war was worth it we did n't know then what we know today some , including many of my friends , warned of the dangers of american hubris i did not heed them in 2003 but the greater hubris is to think that what america does or does n't do is all that matters the blame for the catastrophe of post2003 iraq must be placed on the new iraqi political elite the shiite political class , put in power by the united states , preached a politics of victimhood and leveraged the state to enrich itself these leaders falsely identified all sunni iraqis with baathists , forgetting how heavily all iraqis , including some shiites , were implicated in the criminality of mr hussein s regime although i always feared , and , that the emergence of sectarian strife was a risk after mr hussein s fall , my greatest misjudgment was in hoping that iraq s new leaders would act for the collective iraqi good for all its bungling , the bush administration s invasion of iraq exposed a fundamental truth of modern arab politics washington s longstanding support for autocracy and dictatorship in the middle east , a core principle of american foreign policy for decades , had helped stoke a deepseated political malaise in the region that produced both saddam hussein and al qaeda by 2003 , american support for arab autocrats was no longer politically sustainable the system of beliefs mr hussein represented had ossified and lost the ability to inspire anyone long before 2003 and yet he was still there , in power , the great survivor of so many terrible wars and revolutions before the american invasion , it was impossible for iraqis to see beyond him there was hardly any war to speak of in 2003 mr hussein s whole terrible edifice just came crashing down under its own weight the army dismantled itself , before l paul bremer , the american proconsul , even issued his infamous and unnecessary order to purge baath party members from the military toppling mr hussein put the system of which he was such an integral part under newfound scrutiny if the 1991 war was about the restoration of the arab state system , the 2003 war called into question that system s very legitimacy that s why support from arab monarchies was not forthcoming in 2003 , when a new , more equitable order was on the agenda in iraq after 2003 , the edifice of the arab state system began to crack elsewhere in 2005 , thousands of lebanese marched in the streets to boot out the occupying syrian army palestinians tasted their first real elections american officials twisted the arm of hosni mubarak to allow egyptians a slightly less rigged election in 2006 and a new kind of critical writing began to spread online and in fiction the arab political psyche began to change as well the legitimating ideas of post1967 arab politics panarabism , armed struggle , antiimperialism and antizionism ideas that undergirded the regimes in both iraq and syria , were rubbing up against the realities of life under mr hussein no arab spring protester , however much he or she might identify with the plight of the palestinians or decry the cruel policies of israeli occupation in the west bank \( as i do \) , would think today to attribute all the ills of arab polities to empty abstractions like imperialism and zionism they understand in their bones that those phrases were tools of a language designed to prop up nasty regimes and distract people like them from the struggle for a better life generations of arabs have paid with their lives and their futures because of a set of illusions that had nothing to do with israel these illusions come from deep within the world that we arabs have constructed for ourselves , a world built upon denial , bombast and imagined past glories , ideas that have since been exposed as bankrupt and dangerous to the future of the young arab men and women who set out in 2011 , against all odds , to build a new order in the place of these illusions , the young revolutionaries made the struggle against their own dictatorships their political priority , just as their iraqi counterparts had done in vain 20 years earlier after the first gulf war ideas are not constrained by frontiers or borders young people in the arab world are not constrained by the prejudices of old men , by my generation s acquiescence to and compromises with dictatorships and so in tunisia , egypt , libya , yemen , bahrain and syria , a new movement that is still in the making has demanded a political order that derives its legitimacy from genuine citizenship it envisions new forms of community not based on a suffocating nationalist embrace supposedly designed to hold in check the avaricious intentions of america and israel all the tunisian fruit vendor was asking for in december 2010 was dignity and respect that is how the arab spring began , and the toppling of the first arab dictator , saddam hussein , paved the way for young arabs to imagine it the arab spring is now turning into an arab winter the old rules that governed arab politics have been turned completely upside down here , too , iraq offers lessons mr hussein used sectarianism and nationalism as tools against his internal enemies when he was weak today s iraqi shiite parties are doing worse they are legitimizing their rule on a sectarian basis the idea of iraq as a multiethnic country is being abandoned , and the same dynamic is at work in syria the support that several key arab monarchies are providing to syrian resistance forces fighting against president bashar alassad is further undermining the legitimacy of the whole arab state system the war will go on until mr assad is gone and perhaps the state we know as syria is , too the only success story seems to be the kurds the great losers of the postworld war i order who have built a thriving semiautonomous region in northern iraq that might eventually require independence to sustain its success our species , at least in its modern garb , needs states , even imperfect ones states are still the cornerstones of our security as individuals , and provide at least the possibility of a civilized way of life traditionally conservative arab monarchies are now doing the unthinkable and risking total state collapse in syria they are opposing mr assad s arab nationalist regime in an attempt to dictate the kind of country that will emerge from the chaos and to ensure some form of influence over the new syria that is the only way to salvage something of the old arab order that they feel shifting under their feet and against these kinds of forces , unfortunately , the young revolutionaries of the arab spring are helpless
kelar , odisha ahalya kandapan , a proud member of the tea party , has never heard of the american politicians michele bachmann or rand paul but like these standard bearers of the tea party movement in the united states , mrs kandapan rails against wasted government funds and wants to shake up the status quo of the political establishment mrs kandapan s tea party is a onewoman show based in kelar , a small village with about 700 residents in odisha , india s leastdeveloped state according to a ministry of finance report released in september always an active community member , she entered local politics 12 years ago and has been making her way up the ladder of india s threetiered system of local governance , known as the panchayati raj after serving two fiveyear terms as a member of the gram panchayat , the local body that administers kelar and seven nearby villages , mrs kandapan , 47 , was elected last year to sit on the panchayat samiti , a council that oversees 13 gram panchayats we have not always had good leaders here , mrs kandapan said in desiya , a local dialect of oriya , the most widely spoken language of odisha i am trying my best to improve daily life in the village posters with mrs kandapan s face and her symbol , a tea kettle , dot the winding roadside in this remote , mountainous section of southwestern odisha , a largely rural state about the size of wisconsin she said she selected the tea kettle because it is a symbol of everyday life i represent common people and common people drink tea , she said mrs kandapan chose the kettle from a list of 19 symbols suggested by the state election commission , which included a pineapple , a baby doll and an airplane a mode of transportation not commonly used by local residents ajit kumar tripathy , odisha s state election commissioner , said there was no significance to the symbols as long as they do not preach violence or affect religious sentiments , the candidates can use whatever symbol they like , he said from his office in bhubaneshwar , odisha s state capital , a 10hour drive from kelar local governance is particularly important to residents in this isolated and often underrepresented area of odisha , where the central and state governments have struggled to deliver basic services in 1993 , an amendment to india s constitution formally established the panchayati raj , a threetiered structure of local governance at the village , block and district levels , to provide representation for small rural communities it has been billed in a united nations publication as the world s largest experiment in grassroots democracy but 20 years later , most local government bodies do not have adequate fiscal or administrative authority to be effective , according to a committee s report commissioned by the central government while 99 percent of the mandatory provisions of the panchayati raj have been implemented by the state governments , the actual empowerment of these panchayati raj institutions has not taken place at all , the committee s chairman , mani shankar aiyar , who is also the first panchayati raj minister , said in an interview with the newsmagazine tehelka indeed , mrs kandapan said she had limited power to carry out the infrastructure projects her village needs most we have been trying to build a bridge over a nearby river , she said , noting that several residents died recently while trying to cross with their livestock we have submitted our application to the authorities in bhubaneshwar , but no response has come this part of odisha has presented challenges to the state and central governments the majority of residents are adivasis , members of india s indigenous tribal groups some feel they have been marginalized by india s industrialization , which has encroached on their land and changed their way of life this sentiment has provided ripe ground for maoist insurgents , known as naxalites , who last year abducted the local representative to the state legislature , holding him captive for 33 days acknowledging the challenging circumstances , mrs kandapan said she had been able to improve life in kelar through efforts that included arranging government loans for poor families and coordinating road repairs she said she is most proud of helping the community s elderly receive government pensions people were not receiving the funds they were supposed to , so i made a list of everyone who was eligible and fought to make sure they all got what they deserved , she said many indian women have entered politics through the panchayati raj system , which mandates that onethird of local government seats go to women in 2011 , odisha raised the female quota to onehalf but local residents said mrs kandapan , the first woman in her family to stand for office , would have been elected without the quotas she is a natural leader , and she is more trustworthy than men , said dilip kumar turuk , mrs kandapan s soninlaw , noting that she defeated five male opponents in her recent race many men here drink all day indeed , one male villager s struggle with alcohol was on display during a recent visit to kelar the man had attempted to take one of his family s pigs to sell for alcohol his wife threw him to the ground , took hold of the piglet and walloped her husband s face with it as an interested crowd gathered to watch mrs kandapan said that since it was the job of women to maintain order in the village , she was happy that girls today have greater educational opportunities than she did i left school after fifth grade , she said now everyone goes to school , and girls even go to university one of those local girls who eventually attended university , sujata shetty , credited mrs kandapan for the improvements in the village look at the paved road leading to the village , ms shetty said she brought that she brought the electricity she brought the water pipes for a well none of that was here 15 years ago mrs kandapan said she hoped that this record will help her win a seat on the zila parishad , or district council , the highest level of local government in the election , she will use the same tea kettle

the '60s came to an end , and so , after the seventh and final season , will and that makes season 6 , which begins on sunday night on amc , feel a little like an office retirement party life is n't over , by any means new paths can form but character and destiny are set death , meanwhile , is creeping up don draper \( \) has n't changed his ways the last sight viewers had of him at the end of season 5 was much like the very first one the ad man was drinking alone in a smoky bar he was divorced from the first wife and married to a new one , but his modus operandi was intact when a pretty woman sidled up to ask if he was unaccompanied , the episode closed on don s silent , wolfish stare as he put it himself on a different occasion what is happiness \? it s a moment before you need more happiness on sunday s twohour premiere audiences can see don surrender to just such a moment , and then once again shake it off and move on and his bad behavior is the constant in a world that keeps rushing to embrace the next new thing it s now the late '60s at the advertising agency sterling cooper draper pryce secretaries dress like on laughin , the men in creative are growing mustaches , and the stiffs in accounts have longer sideburns the pleasure of mad men is not in discovery anymore it s in the affirmation that there is still some invention left in a series that took audiences by surprise and then kept them hooked even when the novelty wore off most dramas that last more than a few years have difficulty keeping up with the times mad men is defined by its period , and each tremor in that convulsive decade the kennedy assassination , civil rights , vietnam , drugs has shaped a season and helped drive the narrative so it s a tribute to the writers and the show s creator , matthew weiner , that most characters are so well imagined and enigmatic that they never seem like mere caricatures of the period even when gray flannel suits and skinny ties give way to paisley ties , vests and gogo boots there s been an amazing amount of soap opera in mad men affairs , abortions , divorces , suicide , heroin addiction , even a hare krishna conversion but the series has not yet become laughable , mostly because it has never lost its dark sense of humor but the women of the show , more than the men , are the ones who defy expectations and break ground the show about socalled mad men was always a paean to the sane women who serve them as the series prepares to shut down , the men seem spent and preoccupied by death it s the women who keep us wanting just a little bit more time is on their side , and so are the writers peggy \( \) and joan \( \) began as secretaries and fought their way out of the steno pool and into careers of their own , a step ahead of the mainstream women s movement and here , at least , there is no backlash on mad men it s been the stayathome mothers who seem distracted and neglectful , while the working mothers like joan , handing off her baby to her mother to race out the door and back to the office , seem nurturing peggy , who put her unwanted infant up for adoption in the first season , is n't very maternal with her subordinates , but she does seem happily married to her work it s betty \( \) , raising her three children with a loving new husband , who appears childless barren in feeling if not in fact when megan \( jessica par \) filled in as a baby sitter , she was more loving to betty s children than betty , though she lost a little of her sound of music sweetness once she became their stepmother megan s mother , marie \( julia ormond \) , so glamorous and well mannered , has turned out to be as cool and exacting as a casting director when megan took to her bed , defeated and depressed , marie was not surprised when you have the artistic temperament but you are not an artist , she told don trudy \( alison brie \) is a devoted mother who also babies her husband , pete \( vincent kartheiser \) , a man so bored by his wife that he was driven to an affair and the edge of despair speaking for all men , it seems , pete described his family life last season as a temporary bandage on a permanent wound none of these imperfect mothers are as repellent as pauline \( pamela dunlap \) , betty s motherinlaw in the premiere pauline has a chance to display her special , incongruous blend of neurotic neediness and deadpan cruelty particularly when measured against all these unusual , undefinable women , the men of mad men conform to type and the biases of the era brits are polite and unknowable wasps are snobs and heavy drinkers jews are smart , brash and pushy and blacks barely visible don has fewer ethnic tells than most because his whole persona is an invention in the season premiere a young man in a bar ca n't peg this stranger who is handsome and dapper but square , not hip he asks don , you some kind of astronaut \? identity is n't just a theme of mad men , it s one of the series s recurring jokes we know who don is by now , and where he is most likely headed it s the women in his life who keep us guessing
they headed to radio city music hall in manhattan last year bearing posters labeled hope , with the face of the president of the united states replaced by that of a quarterback a cluster of fans who would start chanting robert griffin iii s name well before the washington redskins were even on the clock they got their man , right after the indianapolis colts selected andrew luck , who had been the subject of so much ardor that there had been campaigns from miami to minnesota in which fans urged their teams to lose games so they could draft him there are no tanking crusades for offensive linemen fans do not make posters for defensive tackles luke joeckel is the face a baby face in his case , and a relatively anonymous one of this draft , which starts thursday night an offensive tackle from texas am , joeckel could be the first pick wherever he goes whether to kansas city at no 1 or somewhere else a few minutes later he is the sort of rare talent expected to be the cornerstone of a team for at least a decade the same as luck and griffin were except not really it s not as pretty as years past , because there s not a goodlooking quarterback or anything like that , joeckel said it s three mauling , ugly tackles at the top and all three of us want to go first this , then , is the disrespect draft , a class so maligned that estimates of how many players truly deserve to be selected in the first round have ranged from 10 courtesy of espn s bill polian , a former colts president to , well , a number definitely less than 32 gil brandt , a former dallas cowboys personnel executive who analyzes the draft for , called this a class of complementary players a diplomatic way of describing the kind of picks who fill in the holes around stars like luck and griffin each year , as the hours left before the draft dwindle , damaging whispers about players circulate as some teams try to disguise their intentions it can be a fun parlor game to try to see through those smoke screens but this year , the smoke seems to have engulfed the entire class , making it seem as if team executives will be holding their noses as they turn in their draft cards at his predraft news conference this week , denver s john elway a member of what might have been the nfl s most heralded draft class , the one from 1983 that inspired was asked about this year s quarterbacks he said i'm just glad we 're not in that market let s put it that way it is enough to hurt a guy , even one as big as oklahoma s lane johnson , another offensive tackle who is likely to be one of the top 10 selections is he ready for the criticism of his class to stop \? pretty much , he said the truth , which is harder to divine the closer the draft gets , is that this is a strong draft for offensive and defensive linemen , and it is a very deep class at defensive back , especially safety so deep that baltimore general manager ozzie newsome said he could probably find a safety in every round that is good news for teams that need to protect the quarterback , to rush the quarterback or generally to try to stop the quarterback it is not such good news for teams that need a quarterback none are rated highly enough to be in the luckgriffin stratosphere , and it is hard to discern whether there is even a russell wilson , who was selected by seattle in the third round last year , became the starter almost immediately and led the seahawks to the playoffs elway said that if brock osweiler , whom the broncos selected in the second round last year to back up peyton manning , had been in this class , he might have been the first quarterback taken forecasts for this draft have ranged from predictions of a run on quarterbacks in the top half of the first round to expectations of no quarterback selections in the first round at all west virginia s geno smith , who could be the first quarterback taken and seems likely to go in the first round , summed up his feelings on twitter this week just want to thank all those so called experts' who say i ca n't be an nfl qb , thursday will be a special day but the work has only begun the lack of a breakout quarterback has cast a shadow on the entire draft yet new orleans general manager mickey loomis said this week that while the saints did not give firstround grades to 32 players , they did have secondround grades for 45 to 50 players , indicating a deep class the nfl network draft analyst mike mayock acknowledged that there had been a lot of complaining about the lack of pizazz at the top , but he said that this was the deepest draft he could remember , with 25 to 35 more players worthy of being drafted than there were last year that is essentially an entire round s worth of players who mayock believes belong in the nfl , even if few are likely to be allpros i 've heard this a lot , barkevious mingo , a linebacker from louisiana state , said when they say if the draft class is good or not , they judge it on quarterbacks we might not have a lot of those , but we have everything else it is what it is i'm just in it to hear my name called mingo conceded that he did not know when he would be selected , and the lack of surefire top10 quarterbacks let alone a surefire no 1 pick has thrown the rest of the draft into flux and has made predictions much more difficult except for this almost every team in the top part of the first round would probably like to move down , because there are so few players compelling enough to spend a top pick and all that money on that could make for plenty of televised drama , if not for many super bowl runs my guess is , if you polled all 10 general managers of the teams drafting in the top 10 , all 10 of them privately would say , i 'd love to move back , ' the espn draft analyst todd mcshay said i do n't know that there are many teams from 11 to 32 that really want to move up
washington it reads like a who s who of the next generation of leaders , ,  but what is bringing all these marquee political names together is not the iowa state fair or a rally on the national mall rather , they are all talking discreetly about how to advance a bill in the senate to ban at 20 weeks after fertilization a similar ban passed the house last month , and senate democrats quickly pronounced it doomed to fail in their chamber it is almost certain to be defeated there , and even if it were not , president obama would veto it but backers of the ban are eager to bring to the floor of the senate the same impassioned debate over abortion that has been taking place in state legislatures around the country plans under discussion among the staff members of a handful of republican senators and antiabortion groups would involve bringing the measure up for a vote , probably as part of debate over a spending measure , sometime after congress returns from its august recess because of the senate s porous rules for introducing amendments , people on both sides of the issue say they believe a vote is more than likely if the legislation comes together i think there s significant support across the country for the idea that after 20 weeks , abortion should be significantly limited , said mr rubio , who has taken a leading role in trying to generate support for the bill irrespective of how people may feel about the issue , he added , we 're talking about five months into a people certainly feel there should be significant restrictions on that republicans are hardly unanimous about the wisdom of entangling themselves in a national battle over abortion rights many believe that the party should remain focused on addressing economic issues and fighting mr obama s  i'm focused on energy , the economy and what s happening with the president s health care law , said senator john barrasso of wyoming , a member of the republican leadership asked whether he thought abortion was a distraction for his party , he stuck to a popular republican refrain i'm completely focused on jobs , the economy , the health care law democrats , meanwhile , are wary of the damage that a no vote on secondtrimester abortion restrictions could inflict on some of their more vulnerable senators up for reelection in 2014 , particularly in arkansas , louisiana and north carolina , where legislatures have recently imposed strict limits on friday , the governor of north carolina said he would sign into law new regulations on abortion clinics look , i 've taken a lot of tough votes , said senator mary l landrieu , democrat of louisiana , who added that she doubted she could support a ban at 20 weeks that s what i'm here for , to take votes and if we have to take it , we take it the success of new limits on when , how and where abortions can be done has invigorated the republican base like few other issues this year because of such intensity , antiabortion groups say they have found interest among the newer generation of republican senators , especially those seeking to build up , or in some cases repair , their standing with conservative voters some see even broader appeal though the issue of reproductive rights has been problematic for republicans who have been embarrassed by comments like those of todd akin , the missouri senate candidate who said that women s bodies blocked pregnancy in cases of rape those supporting 20week bans say the dynamics of this debate are less alienating to swing voters than fights over  and some conservatives see this as the only winning social issue they have left in their political arsenal unlike , which has steadily gained support , recent polls have shown that the public believes that abortions later in pregnancy should be restricted a last week found that 56 percent of americans said they would prefer to impose limits on abortions after 20 weeks rather than the 24week standard established by the supreme court in roe v wade antiabortion activists said that after the recently approved house measure and success in states like texas , which approved a 20week ban this month , they saw an opportunity they could not pass up we really thought it was a moment to be very ambitious , said marjorie dannenfelser , the president of the , one of the groups pushing for the senate to take up the 20week ban abortion rights groups say the real goal of these laws , all of which challenge supreme court precedent , is to get another case before the court in the hopes that the justices will further restrict abortion rights these bills are not happenstance , said donna crane , policy director of naral prochoice america these bills are a calculated , cold strategy mr cruz of texas , for his part , is trying to build a larger following among republicans beyond his home state he visited iowa last weekend to meet with evangelical pastors and other members of the state s conservative establishment joining him was senator rand paul of kentucky , who has also expressed interest in signing onto a 20week bill , according to ms dannenfelser and a spokeswoman for the senator mr rubio of florida , who has been discussing for months how to introduce this issue into the senate , is also eager to raise his national profile but he must first overcome some of the doubts conservatives have about him for his pivotal role in helping the senate pass an bill with a provision to eventually grant citizenship to immigrants here illegally mr portman of ohio , who was on mitt romney s short list to become the republican vicepresidential nominee last year and who has told his colleagues that he would like to be deeply involved in the 20week legislation , is trying to rebuild conservative support that he lost back home in march after he spoke out in favor of samesex marriage \( one republican who saw internal poll numbers after mr portman s announcement said the senator s unfavorable ratings jumped by double digits and were especially high in the southern part of ohio , where his core support is \) drafting a bill , however , will require conservatives to resolve a fundamental disagreement how to find constitutional justification for a nationwide ban despite their reservations about giving the government broad regulatory powers this has been especially challenging for senator mike lee of utah , one of the senate s leading antiabortion voices he strongly opposes a bill that uses as its legal rationale the commerce clause of the constitution , which many conservatives consider a violation of their principles some in the republican leadership express similar doubts , including senator john cornyn of texas , the no 2 leader he said he supported the 20week ban that passed in his home state this month , but added i think that this can adequately be taken care of at the state level and so there may not be a need for the federal government to get involved then there is the issue of how new abortion regulations might be perceived among women so far , none of the four republican women in the senate have stepped forward to get involved senator deb fischer of nebraska , who has a solidly antiabortion voting record , said , i'm focused on a lot of other issues now senator lisa murkowski of alaska said , it s not something that is really on my priority list

tehran in a room in which journalists were outnumbered by security agents and paramilitary fighters , the tall iranian commander stood and issued his judgment our ideology will not be undermined by some negotiations , mohammad reza naqdi , the hardline head of the paramilitary basij force , told the selected group of reporters in a gathering days before iran signed an with the united states and other world powers that pact , in which iran s moderate government agreed to freeze parts of its nuclear program for six months in exchange for limited relief from crippling economic sanctions , was a conspicuous exception , however , were iran s hardliners , who mostly maintained a studied silence , unwilling to risk a public confrontation with their patron over the years the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , who has cautiously welcomed the deal but that silence may not last , experts say at the slightest signal from the supreme leader , they say , the hardliners could unleash protests by hundreds of thousands on the streets along with an outpouring of criticism from staterun news media they are biding their time , watching from the sidelines , eager to pounce on any perceived signs of backtracking , weakness or capitulation , said farshad ghorbanpour , an iranian journalist close to the government of president hassan rouhani when the opportunity arises they will strike back , searching for pretexts and playing into possible snags during the negotiations , he said this is in no way a done deal iran and the united states face a host of obstacles on the treacherous path to a final agreement on tehran s nuclear program a saudi arabia , israel and the united states congress , among others have already condemned the deal \( curiously enough , helping mr rouhani by making the pact look better for iran \) perhaps none of those critics have as much at stake , however , as iran s hardliners , whose very claim to power rests on implacable opposition to what they depict as the decadent , immoral west , and especially to the great satan , the united states for over a decade , iran s hardline clerics and revolutionary guards commanders have controlled important levers of power the military and intelligence services , the judiciary , staterun news media , friday prayer venues and a wide circle of staterun businesses working closely with ayatollah khamenei , they have enforced a worldview of confrontation with the west , sending the country lurching from crisis to crisis they prospered under the bombastic presidency of mahmoud ahmadinejad , who made an art form of roiling western sensibilities , particularly concerning israel on state television and during rallies , they tirelessly propagated the idea that iran would eternally resist the west no matter the consequences in the process , they grew richer and more powerful , even as the country was increasingly impoverished by the sanctions but as cheerful ordinary iranians , particularly younger ones , welcomed the news of the nuclear deal as a first step toward a brighter future , the hardliners went silent publicly , at least , they pretend as if nothing has happened , taking to the friendly airwaves of staterun news media to reiterate their rigid antiwestern ideology and assure the public that nothing will come of the negotiations the islamic republic is fundamentally against the arrogance , mr naqdi said of the united states a day after the deal we will never reach a compromise with them some experts have said the hardliners have been muted in their criticism because they are quietly pleased with the agreement , in that it concedes their fundamental , nonnegotiable demand that iran be allowed to continue to enrich uranium but equally , if not more , important is their relationship to ayatollah khamenei , without whose blessings no deal would have been possible a tehranbased analyst with ties to the senior leadership , amir mohebbian , has said that with the idea of shifting course from the ahmadinejad years and testing president obama s sincerity about reaching a nuclear deal having now seen the ayatollah praise the nuclear deal as it was presented to him a deliberate ambiguity that will enable him to shift course again , should he so decide the hardliners have been guarded in their remarks one theme that is emerging clearly from the hardline camp is that iran has already compromised as much as it can we have shown flexibility , now all sanctions should be lifted , said gen hossein salami , a revolutionary guards commander otherwise , the interim nuclear deal is a reversible path be sure that mr rouhani will come under lots of pressure inside iran , said ahmad bakhshayesh , a hardline member of parliament if sanctions are not fully lifted , this temporary deal can be canceled easily on wednesday , the committee to protect iranian interests , a hardline group whose members , after his september phone call with mr obama , issued a statement saying much the same thing , that iran s negotiators burned all our winning cards in the first phase this deal is like the one iraq got oil for food we are giving a lot and are gaining a little , said ali reza matachi , a member of the group we reserve the right to protest against this agreement in all likelihood , they will begin to protest only if given a signal by ayatollah khamenei or one of his surrogates in the news media or at the friday prayer venues but that may not be forthcoming in the near future he is leaving his options open and can always ask the hardliners to step in if he does n't like the way the talks develop , said one analyst who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak openly about the motives of the supreme leader few of iran s concessions in the temporary agreement with world powers are permanent , he noted if needed , everything can be restarted , nothing is being dismantled for now but if they do receive such a signal , the hardliners have the money and means to mobilize a formidable opposition through their networks the hardliners have the ability to mobilize forces , said mr ghorbanpour , pointing to statecondoned rallies of hundreds of thousands of people mr rouhani will not be allowed to organize such gatherings , he said , as the organizations signing off on public events are all beyond his control for instance , mr rouhani s failure to unblock facebook , a major promise during his campaign , illustrates the sway the hardliners still exercise over the public domain if the social media site were freely accessible in iran , his supporters would use it as an open stage to organize and set demands , analysts say instead of being able to put political muscle on the streets , his only chance of survival is to improve the economy , mr ghorbanpour said of mr rouhani but even there , the hardliners play a critical role there is a group of nouveaux riches who found wealth in the sanctions , said saeed laylaz , an economist with close ties to the rouhani government for years , the new porsches , maseratis and ferraris snaking their way through the narrow alleys of upscale north tehran were among the most visible effects of the sanctions the drivers of these luxury cars , mostly young men in their 20s , are commonly referred to here as aghazadehs , the children of those with connections to power according to mr laylaz , instead of trying to take their wealth , mr rouhani will ask them to invest it into the economy a shift of economic power to those close to mr rouhani is possible , mr laylaz insisted but do n't expect the uturn towards transparency , enhancement of the private sector and the erosion of nepotism and corruption to happen in a very short time
greenburgh , ny the nhl got back to business sunday , which for the meant that john tortorella , their ingenious and volatile coach , was back in charge , damning by faint praise and praising by faint damns it was good at first , but it tailed off pretty quickly , tortorella said about the first practice he was allowed to lead after the lockout ended late saturday night but that s to be expected like all nhl coaches , tortorella faces a difficult task run a sixday training camp with no exhibition games to prepare for a 48game , 99day regular season adjustments must be made customarily , a tortorella camp opens with two straight days of grueling endurance and sprint skating , no sticks or pucks on the ice but this year there is no time for that tortorella ran his players through passing drills , line rushes and controlled scrimmaging we do n't want to injure them if we did the amount of work that we did in a regular camp on the first day , we would n't be able to play , tortorella said it s a different dynamic this year tortorella was not the only one returning to business sunday the 22yearold defenseman michael del zotto was back on the rangers' blue line , having signed a twoyear , 51 million contract extension in the morning that ended his restricted free agency and enabled him to practice with the team at such a young age , you miss a minute of camp , it s a bad thing , tortorella said we 're very happy he has n't missed a minute marian gaborik , who scored 41 goals last season and another 5 in the rangers' march to the eastern conference finals , skated hard and said he was fully recovered from surgery in june to repair his right shoulder the first year he was here , it was like pulling teeth to get him on the ice at certain times to practice , tortorella said of gaborik , who joined the rangers in 2009 he has grown mentally the year that he had last year the playoffs he had last year and going through the injuries he had to me he s still growing as a player rick nash , the 30goal scorer skating officially with the rangers for the first time after being acquired from columbus in a trade last summer , barged in on goalie henrik lundqvist and roofed a shot just under the crossbar stu bickel , a pugnacious defenseman , practiced as a forward in anticipation of the season opener saturday in boston arron asham , an enforcer new to the rangers , will miss that game because of a suspension carried over from last season bickel will take his place if tortorella feels that muscle is needed against the aggressive bruins there were a lot of smiles the rangers often practiced together informally during the lockout , but they clearly enjoyed being back for their first true practice since last may we all missed this it s our lives , said lundqvist , who won the vezina trophy last season i missed everything about it not only being on the ice i missed being in here , on the road , in the room before the games it s a part of our life that s been missing the past few months tortorella ran the show on the ice , a stick in his hands , shouting directions , but with none of the tempestuous outbursts that sometimes mark his practices i'm sure we 'll be seeing that soon , gaborik said with a smile nash said he enjoyed his first practice under tortorella he s really intense , nash said you can tell how much he loves the game matt gilroy also signed with the rangers on sunday as a depth defenseman , his second stint with the team in 2011 , the rangers did not resign him on sunday , tortorella praised gilroy , sort of i do n't think he s great , quite honestly , and i 've said it no , there s no sense in me going there , tortorella said , catching himself he was n't bad at times we need depth on our blue line quite honestly , when he left us , i thought he was really beginning to understand what we wanted out of him , and he started to understand the coaching staff i guess he did n't really like it too much he took off for a while i'm happy he s back tortorella said that no injuries showed up during the players' physicals sunday morning he said there was no blueprint for the condensed season , other than making sure his players would have sufficient recovery time to rest and stay healthy he leapt nimbly from subject to subject , remaining characteristically edgy the whole time he was asked how he felt about those of his players who skated in europe during the lockout i'm not being negative toward europe , he said , but i like them under my thumb , and how we play the nhl is back in business , and so is tortorella
beijing officials at one of china s most respected universities have reportedly fired an outspoken legal scholar for advocating free speech and for repeatedly calling on the government to abide by its own constitution zhang xuezhong , who teaches at the east china university of political science and law in shanghai , said administrators notified him on monday that he would be dismissed after he refused to apologize for writings that championed the protections guaranteed by china s constitution professor zhang s teaching privileges were temporarily suspended in august after the publication of an article detailing the communist party s growing hostility toward the nation s legal system i told them i had made no mistakes whatsoever , he said in a phone interview on tuesday i'm just a university faculty member who expresses his own opinions , thoughts and proposals , which is absolutely my right this is an outandout witch hunt university officials did not respond to telephone calls and a fax seeking comment but in an internal school memo that professor zhang obtained and circulated online tuesday , officials also cited an ebook he wrote this year called new common sense the nature and consequences of oneparty dictatorship according to the notice , mr zhang violated university rules by forcibly disseminating his political views among the faculty and using his status as a teacher to spread his political views among students the dismissal is sure to send a chill through chinese academia , which has come under increasing pressure amid an ideological campaign that seeks to rein in liberalism and promote obedience to the ruling communist party at a time when american educational institutions are rushing to open chinese branches and build partnerships with local universities , professor zhang s removal is also likely to draw renewed attention to the political constraints that hamper open discourse at even the most respected chinese schools in october , peking university who is a critic of singleparty rule administrators claimed that their refusal to renew the was based on poor teaching and his failure to keep up with the school s publishing requirements mr xia , a vocal champion of multiparty elections , said he had been repeatedly warned to tamp down his politically charged words and activism mr xia s dismissal reverberated well beyond china , especially on american and european campuses that share academic programs with peking university , considered one of the nation s preeminent educational institutions despite some initial handwringing , notably at wellesley college and the london school of economics , none of the schools altered their relationship with peking university on its website , commonly known as hua zheng , boasts of nearly three dozen international partnerships , including an exchange program with and another with the , which offers a joint executive master s of law program with the school professor zhang has had runins with school administrators over his writings , but their unhappiness with him deepened in may after he publicized the contents of a secret document , produced by the central government , detailing seven subjects that are not allowed to be discussed in chinese classrooms the topics included democracy , freedom of speech and past mistakes of the communist party but it was his defense of china s 1982 constitution that ran headon into a campaign by the chinese leadership that seeks to bolster the supremacy of the party after assuming power in november 2012 , president xi jinping initially expressed support for the rule of law , but in recent months the staterun news media has sought to demonize constitutionalism as a western plot to overthrow the party professor zhang s undoing appears to be an article he published online in june titled a few days later , he said , four school officials summoned him for a meeting to warn him that the article violated both the nation s code of teaching ethics and the chinese constitution professor zhang appears to have been a fairly popular lecturer at the school on pinglaoshi , a website where students can anonymously evaluate their teachers , professor zhang received a rating of 46 on a scale of 5 , with most of the 21 posts favorable we admire and respect you , said one post from september you are china s backbone a post from august said , you are a true warrior with integrity during his meeting with school officials on monday , professor zhang , who is also a practicing rights lawyer , said he did not put up much of a fight instead , he warned the dean of the law school that his dismissal would do lasting harm to the school s image the impacts to me will be shortlived because i can find another job , but the stain on the school s reputation will be permanent , he said he told the dean you can never wipe it clean
eight teams remain undefeated in ncaa division i men s college basketball , the least known of which is set to take the court monday against kansas toledo s 120 start would be noteworthy under most circumstances but is potentially transformative given the length and depth of the program s previous struggles when the former coach gene cross resigned in march 2010 after the athletic department received a lurid letter detailing claims of a series of relationships between cross and local women , athletic director mike o'brien concluded that toledo s program had problems that went beyond basketball o'brien s coaching search focused as much on candidates' ability to change the culture as to win games he hired tod kowalczyk , a littleknown coach who had taken wisconsingreen bay from mediocrity to chasing perennial power butler at the top of the horizon league green bay s best freshman , rian pearson , followed kowalczyk out of a goodbye meeting with his former team , hugged him and said , i'm coming with you , coach another productive freshman , forward matt smith , joined them close to four years later , pearson , smith and kowalczyk are set to take the court together monday at allen fieldhouse after winning 22 games in their last season at green bay , this is the type of game they expected a rebuilt toledo to play in the journey since then has proved a lesson in turning expectations into reality it was humbling , said pearson , a 6foot4 guard and a preseason allmidamerican conference firstteam selection who is on schedule to graduate this spring when we came here , i had three years left , and i thought that was time for us to get the program up and running at times , though , i did question that the rockets went 428 in kowalczyk s first season , playing seven scholarship players as pearson and smith sat out under ncaa transfer rules there were 14 players on the roster with eligibility remaining when cross resigned none made it to kowalczyk s second season some guys wanted a fresh start , said kowalczyk , a college basketball lifer who at 47 has already put in 14 seasons as an assistant and 12 as a division i head coach there were guys who just did n't want to be committed and others that we did n't feel fit the culture of our program those are not easy decisions to make having matt and rian was a differencemaker for us i would tell recruits' parents , you know if we were bad guys , those guys would not have come with us with the transfers eligible and joined by the midamerican rookie of the year julius brown at point guard , toledo won 19 games the next season , the secondlargest improvement in division i that season after manhattan and nevada , who tied for the lead just as fans began to contemplate toledo s first ncaa tournament bid since 1980 , the program received a oneyear postseason ban for failing to meet minimum academic standards during cross s tenure an appeal documenting marked improvement under kowalczyk failed it was another annoyingslashfrustrating thing , smith said we had no control over what had happened years before , but we had to pay the price for it after a 26 start , the rockets tied for first place in the midamerican west division , a recovery that smith sees as laying the groundwork for this year s fast start we got a little taste of what it felt like to be successful , just a taste , said smith , who has already completed a bachelor s degree in business management and now comes off the bench as one of the mac s best 3point shooters now we have so much bigger expectations toledo s best start since 1967 has only fueled those expectations kowalczyk goes nine deep into his bench , blending a veteran core with two transfers and three freshmen all five starters average double figures in points , and brown ties it together , averaging 73 assists , fifth nationally , and pushing the offense to 863 points per game , tied with oklahoma for ninth nationally with their best win having come at boston college , the rockets are relatively untested beating kansas could push kowalczyk s team into the top 25 and provide a signature upset for a stillrebuilding program with little national profile brown , who will be in charge of handling 16thranked kansas' pressure defense , most likely holds the key to what could turn out to be one of the biggest upsets of the nonconference college basketball season game and season outcomes aside , there is already satisfaction for kowalczyk in seeing pearson and smith forge a legacy that shows up in practices and the classroom as much as in games we had a lot of pain together we had a lot of failures together , kowalczyk said what makes it most interesting is they came in while we were having success at green bay they were n't the reason for that success there but when we came here , they came and helped us develop the same kind of culture we had at green bay so it s very gratifying for all three of us being together as long as we have been
those who view fixing immigration as simply a matter of getting tougher on lawbreakers tend to overlook how tough the system already is , an evergrowing web of agents , cops , courts and prisons whose cruelty and deficiencies are appalling much attention has focused on the excesses of local law enforcement , exemplified by selfappointed immigration enforcers like sheriff joe arpaio of maricopa county , ariz , on friday of violating the constitutional rights of latinos for years through racially biased crime sweeps , arrests , detention and harassment but the abuses of local officials like sheriff arpaio are well matched by the federal government , which is guilty of its own overreach in the hunt to prosecute illegal immigration a new from human rights watch examines many of these problems in detail , with prescriptions lawmakers should not ignore while immigration enforcement used to be mainly a civil matter , the federal government has devoted vast criminal lawenforcement resources to immigration violators particularly for the felony of illegal reentry ensnaring thousands of people who do n't fit any reasonable definition of criminal prosecutions at the border have exploded in the last decade in 2002 , there were 3 , 000 prosecutions for illegal entry and 8 , 000 for illegal reentry by 2012 , the numbers were 48 , 000 and 37 , 000 the department of homeland security refers more cases to the justice department for prosecution than all the other main federal crimefighting agencies , like the federal bureau of investigation and the drug enforcement administration , combined the federal government has said for years that its goal is to stop dangerous criminals at the border and deter migrants from trying to cross illegally this would be understandable if the defendants were primarily a flood of dangerous criminals , but they are n't many have minor criminal histories or none at all many are deportees trying to return to their families and jobs the system needs to be recalibrated to spare noncriminal migrants the harshest consequences the human rights watch report recommends revising immigration law to impose only civil , not criminal , penalties , for illegal entry and reentry or , at the very least , it says illegal entry should be punishable by two years in federal prison , not 20 the immigration bill that passed the senate judiciary committee last week would improve the system in many ways , like providing a path to citizenship for millions and allowing some deportees to apply to return to their families in the united states but it makes some things worse for instance , it expands operation streamline , a program in borderstate federal courts where defendants have little access to lawyers and barely any chance to fight the charges it was designed for the mass production of guilty pleas and should be abolished the bill has bipartisan support , but it also has many opponents who see immigration through sheriff arpaio s eyes the challenge in the coming congressional debate will be to preserve the elements that make the system fairer and more rational

the margin of error for the , in the midst of an offensive slumber , is minuscule the slightest misstep an uncharacteristic inning from their ace , matt harvey , or a badly placed pitch by the usually reliable closer bobby parnell , or an unlucky bounce to a infielder can spell disaster a 32 loss to the pittsburgh pirates on sunday was partly the fault of harvey , who was erratic early , and parnell , who gave up the deciding single in the eighth inning to pedro alvarez , but the mets' offense was the main culprit in yet another underwhelming performance , the mets managed just four hits and struck out 12 times in their last two games , the mets have struck out 28 times certainly something we 've tried to address and we 've continued to try to address , collins said if we 're going to live by the long ball , sometimes we 're going to get bit by what happens when you try to hit homers , which is strike out the mets have now scored one run or none against starting pitchers in the last six games after trailing early , the mets tied the game at 22 in the seventh inning after john buck walked , moved to second base on a wild pitch and scored on mike baxter s single to left field baxter had been the mets' lone offensive highlight last week , producing gamewinning singles on tuesday and thursday the mets threatened again in the eighth when they had two runners on base against reliever mark melancon but struck out and lucas duda hit a ground ball that bounced high off the first base bag and right to second baseman brandon inge , who threw to melancon , covering first , for the out in the dugout , collins said his first instinct was to think his team was snakebit that s how it goes right now , baxter said davis s strikeout was especially costly even a fly ball would have given the mets a chance to tie the game on a sacrifice fly but the slumping davis , who had been moved back to the cleanup spot by collins , could not make contact and chased a curveball in the dirt for the final strike davis s average dipped to 180 , with only four home runs he has yet to crack 200 at any point in the year last year , davis had a similar slump to start the season but hit well in the second half , finishing with 32 home runs at this point last year , he was hitting 175 with five home runs i have to produce more or i wo n't play at this level , davis said i was slotted in the four hole for a reason , because of the type of player i can be , but i have n't done it this year so far it s also a sign that they do believe in me collins challenged davis when he told him about the lineup move he s the guy , collins said that s why he had the big year that s why he got paid the way he got paid he s going to have to reach down inside and grind out atbats it may take a nearperfect game from harvey for the mets to win these days but he was hardly perfect on sunday still , despite his early struggles , he allowed just two runs and five hits in seven innings so while he was not at his best , he was still pretty good , and certainly good enough to win instead , he remained 40 he ca n't do all the hitting for us , collins said matt did exactly what we wanted inside pitch the mets placed reliever jeurys familia on the 15day disabled list with right biceps tendinitis familia complained of discomfort after wednesday s outing against the chicago white sox he still has symptoms of tendinitis , terry collins said i told him he needs to slow down collins said familia might not have been placed on the disabled had the mets not had an overused bullpen with so many tired relievers , collins said the mets desperately needed a fresh arm to replace familia , the mets called up greg burke from class aaa las vegas reliever frank francisco , on the disabled list with elbow inflammation , experienced a setback in his rehabilitation francisco , who had pitched five scoreless innings for class a port st lucie , was unable to throw a bullpen session after complaining of soreness
cambridge , mass victims often absorb the shame that should belong to the perpetrators for most of her 62 years , sarah collins rudolph has confronted that misplaced emotion every time she looks in the mirror at a glass substitute for the eye , when members of the ku klux klan bombed the 16th street baptist church in birmingham , ala the same ambulance \( colored \) that took young sarah to the hospital subsequently transported the corpse of her 14yearold sister , addie mae collins , who perished along with three other girls the morning s sunday school lesson was on  this anniversary year could have been an opportunity for birmingham to practice some rigorous truth and painful reconciliation it has ended up being a balkanized , largely ceremonial affair the city s , an underpublicized festival of imported panelists and celebrities concluding today , exemplified the crux of the mission s flaw why is it so difficult to extend the notion of empowerment to include the powerless \? we are more comfortable devoting civic resources to media events and monuments , like the lifesize sculpture of the girls unveiled in birmingham this week , than addressing the persistent casualties of the history being commemorated the sometimes impressive anniversary tributes stand in contrast to how little glory the bombing victims themselves caught over the years carole robertson s first name was misspelled on a marker at the church addie s remains from her grave so when congress awarded the girls its highest civilian honor , the congressional gold medal , earlier this year , it was something of a shock that ms rudolph responded , no thanks i'm letting the world know , my sister did n't die for freedom , she told the press my sister died because they put a bomb in that church and they murdered her declining to attend president obama s signing of the resolution in may , she stated her preference for compensation in the millions ms rudolph to the formal medal ceremony at the capitol on tuesday what changed my mind is that i love my sister , she explained to me she ca n't talk for herself , but i can also among the guests was the elderly father of another honoree , denise mcnair chris mcnair , a once popular politician imprisoned on public corruption charges , had just been freed under new justice department guidelines for compassionate release the congressional leaders' bipartisan homage to the four little girls could not overcome the unintentional theme of this anniversary year half a century after the prime of the civil rights movement , why does so much of its promise remain unfulfilled , the sacrifice unrequited \?

chicago the want to play rough , and they have made no secret of it they have turned their secondround eastern conference playoff series against the into a blackandblue affair , defined by bumps , bruises , elbows and shoves but if the series is to become a war of attrition , as the bulls seem to hope it will , there is a key tactical advantage enjoyed by the heat reinforcements the heat have a roster chockfull of allstars and a rotation that goes nine deep the bulls , depleted by injury and illness , are surviving with their bench players from the regular season playing the roles of starters and reserves the bulls swingman jimmy butler understands what his team is up against , and he is the most extreme example of the task facing chicago trying to stave off the heat , as well as exhaustion butler , who started only 20 games during the regular season , is the only player to have played an entire game this postseason he has done it four times , including the bulls' final two games against the nets in the first round and game 1 against the heat after getting to rest in game 2 , he was back on the court for 48 minutes in friday s game 3 , a heat victory that gave them a 21 series lead the bulls appear to have little choice , with coach tom thibodeau being forced to lean heavily on whatever healthy bodies he has he did not expect to have more options for monday night s game 4 at united center it makes it a lot easier to do it whenever you know you got guys that are supporting you , said butler , who is averaging 129 points during the playoffs like , it s ok that you 're tired we know you 're going to fight through it' luol deng , recovering from complications from a spinal tap , has missed the last five games , and kirk hinrich , sidelined with a left calf injury , has missed the last six before going down , they were leading the bulls in playoff minutes deng , at 448 per game , remains the league leader in the playoffs in the five games without deng and hinrich , center joakim noah has posted minutes totals of 43 , 41 , 39 , 32 and 42 marco belinelli , who averaged 258 minutes during the regular season , is up to 43 against miami nate robinson has made a similar jump , to 383 from 254 by contrast , the heat s stars are carrying playoff workloads consistent with their minutes in the regular season lebron james \( 383 minutes per game in the playoffs \) , dwyane wade \( 330 \) and chris bosh \( 317 \) are each within two minutes of their regularseason averages wade and bosh are even playing slightly fewer minutes in the playoffs the situation was never more dire for the bulls than in game 3 , when four of their starters eclipsed 40 minutes after nazr mohammed was ejected for shoving james the bench was essentially reduced to one player , taj gibson , who played 22 minutes the rest of the reserves played a total of 14 \( 3 minutes for mohammed and 11 for marquis teague \) the heat outscored the bulls by 10 points in the fourth quarter in their 10494 win thibodeau put the heavy workloads in the context of the quest for a championship that s normally what happens in the playoffs , he said guys play extended minutes most rotations are short to his point , 11 players are averaging more than 40 minutes in the postseason while none eclipsed that mark during the regular season still , the bulls' case is different because thibodeau was already predisposed to riding his top contributors deng led the league in minutes per game in each of the past two seasons noah was averaging around 40 minutes per game before he was told he had plantar fasciitis earlier this season against the heat , the big minutes and the big defensive assignments have fallen to butler he has guarded james , making butler s playing time that much more grueling he does so much , and he has the ball in his hands a lot , butler said he plays every position on the floor , to tell you the truth back to the basket , dribbling the ball up the floor it s tough it s fun james , who scored 12 points in the fourth quarter of game 3 , said we 're a deep team , and everyone is healthy whether they 're playing 10 guys or 6 , we feel like we continue to wear on teams on sunday afternoon , reports from the league office said mohammed would not be suspended for his shove but the league did fine thibodeau 35 , 000 for his comments after friday s game , in which he said he felt james flopped on the play it was a rare moment this postseason when chicago received good news on the availability of a player with or without mohammed , though , the bulls' message remains the same we have more than enough , thibodeau said
as of 3 30 pm wednesday , senator rand paul of kentucky has been speaking on the senate floor for about threeandahalf hours , selfindulging in an oldschool filibuster against john brennan , president obama s choice to run the cia at 3 pm , senator mike lee of utah jumped in to help him , asking mr paul questions so he could keep the floor then ted cruz of texas and jerry moran of kansas joined in the tirade it s a cspan spectacle , but make no mistake this isn t the real filibuster of mr brennan the real filibuster will happen after mr paul gets tired and quits , at which point mr brennan s supporters will be forced to muster 60 votes to end the republican debate in this case , that shouldn t be too difficult , and mr brennan will finally receive a simplemajority vote on his confirmation but earlier in the day , caitlin halligan wasn t so lucky she is mr obama s nominee for a seat on the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit , and republicans prevented her from getting an upordown vote by demanding the same 60vote threshold to end debate though 51 senators supported breaking the filibuster , her nomination failed , and for the second time there was no need for a moby dicklength speech she was blocked for all the usual reasons republicans said she was an activist an even worse pejorative than liberal because she committed the unforgivable sin of suing the gun industry on behalf of new york state , where she served as solicitor general none dare violate the demands of the national rifle association , which vehemently opposed her nomination republicans will delay and grumble but eventually approve highlevel nominees like mr brennan the real damage is just beneath , where judges and regulators are routinely blocked , in some cases to prevent agencies from doing their jobs , or in this case to keep liberals off the important dc circuit , a traditional launching pad to the supreme court keeping the courts and federal agencies functioning properly is more important than preserving the senate s hoary antidemocratic prerogatives that s why all 60vote requirements for presidential nominees have to end , no matter which party holds the white house if truebelievers like mr paul want to delay votes with endless speeches , they are free to do so until they go hoarse but when the speeches end , the simplemajority votes should begin
cairo american commandos carried out raids on saturday in two farflung african countries in a powerful flex of military muscle aimed at capturing fugitive terrorist suspects american troops assisted by and agents seized a suspected leader of on the streets of tripoli , , while raided the seaside villa of a militant leader in a predawn firefight on the coast of  in tripoli , american forces captured a libyan militant who had been indicted in 2000 for his role in the 1998 bombings of the united states embassies in and the militant , born nazih abdulhamed alruqai and known by his nom de guerre , abu anas allibi , had a 5 million bounty on his head his capture at dawn ended a 15year manhunt in somalia , the navy seal team emerged before sunrise from the indian ocean and exchanged gunfire with militants at the home of a senior leader of the , the somali militant group the raid was planned more than a week ago , officials said , after a massacre by the shabab at a nairobi shopping mall that killed more than 60 people two weeks ago the seal team was forced to withdraw before it could confirm that it had killed the shabab leader , a senior american security official said officials declined to identify the target officials said the timing of the two raids was coincidental but occurring on the same day , they underscored the rise of northern africa as a haven for international terrorists libya has collapsed into the control of a patchwork of militias since the ouster of the qaddafi government in 2011 somalia , the birthplace of the shabab , has lacked an effective central government for more than two decades with president obama locked in a standoff with congressional republicans and his leadership criticized for a policy reversal in syria , the raids could fuel accusations among his critics that the administration was eager for a showy foreign policy victory abu anas , the libyan qaeda leader , was considered a major prize , and officials said he was alive in united states custody while the details about his capture were sketchy , an american official said saturday night that he appeared to have been taken peacefully and that he was no longer in libya his capture was the latest blow to what remains of the original qaeda organization after a 12year american campaign to capture or kill its leadership , including the killing two years ago of its founder , osama bin laden , in pakistan despite his presence in libya , abu anas was not believed to have played any role in the 2012 attack on the united states diplomatic mission in benghazi , libya , senior officials briefed on that investigation have said , but he may have sought to build networks connecting what remains of the qaeda organization to likeminded militants in libya his brother nabih told the associated press that just after dawn prayers , three vehicles full of armed men had approached abu anas s home and surrounded him as he parked his car the men smashed his window , seized his gun and sped away with him , the brother said a senior american official said the libyan government had been apprised of the operation and provided assistance , but it was unclear in what capacity an assistant to the prime minister of the libyan transitional government said the government had been unaware of any operation or of abu anas s capture asked if american forces had ever conducted raids inside libya or collaborated with libyan forces , mehmoud abu bahia , assistant to the defense minister , replied , absolutely not disclosure of the raid is likely to inflame anxieties among many libyans about their national sovereignty , putting a new strain on the transitional government s fragile authority many libyan islamists already accuse their interim prime minister , ali zeidan , who previously lived in geneva as part of the exiled opposition to col muammar elqaddafi , of collaborating too closely with the west abu anas , 49 , was born in tripoli and joined bin laden s organization as early as the early 1990s , when it was based in sudan he later moved to britain , where he was granted political asylum as a libyan dissident united states prosecutors in new york charged him in a 2000 with helping to conduct visual and photographic surveillance of the united states embassy in nairobi in 1993 and again in 1995 prosecutors said in the indictment that abu anas had discussed with another senior qaeda figure the idea of attacking an american target in retaliation for the united states peacekeeping operation in somalia after the 1998 bombing , the british police raided his apartment and found an 18chapter terrorist training manual written in arabic and titled military studies in the jihad against the tyrants , it included advice on car bombing , torture , sabotage and disguise since the overthrow of colonel qaddafi , tripoli has slid steadily into lawlessness , with no strong central government or police presence it has become a safe haven for militants seeking to avoid detection elsewhere , and united states government officials , speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information , have acknowledged in recent months that abu anas and other wanted terrorists had been seen moving freely around the capital the operation to capture abu anas was several weeks in the making , a united states official said , and president obama was regularly briefed as the suspect was tracked in tripoli mr obama had to approve the capture he had often promised there would be no boots on the ground in libya when the united states intervened there in march 2011 , so the decision to send in special operations forces was a risky one american officials said they would want to question abu anas for several weeks but they did not dispute that new york , where an indictment is pending against him , was most likely his ultimate destination mr obama has been loath to add to the prisoner count at the american military facility at guant namo bay , and there is precedent for delivering those suspected of terrorism to new york if they are under indictment there the operation will do nothing to quell the continuing questions about the events in benghazi 13 months ago that led to the deaths of four americans but officials say the operation was a product of the decision after benghazi to bolster the counterterrorism effort in libya , especially as tripoli became a safe haven for qaeda leadership the capture of abu anas also coincided with a fierce gunfight that killed 15 libyan soldiers at a checkpoint in a neighborhood southeast of tripoli , near the traditional home of abu anas s clan a spokesman for the libyan army general staff , col ali sheikhi , said five cars full of armed men in masks pulled up at the army checkpoint at 6 15 am and opened fire at pointblank range it was not clear if the assault at the checkpoint was related to the capture of abu anas or his removal from libya the raid in somalia was the most significant raid by american troops in that lawless country since commandos , a qaeda mastermind , near the same coastal town four years ago the town , baraawe , a small port south of mogadishu , is known as a gathering place for the shabab s foreign fighters witnesses described a firefight lasting over an hour , with helicopters called in for air support a senior somali government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said , the attack was carried out by the american forces , and the somali government was preinformed about the attack a spokesman for the shabab said that one of their fighters had been killed in an exchange of gunfire but that the group had beaten back the assault american officials initially reported that they had seized the shabab leader , but later backed off that account a united states official said that no americans had been killed or wounded and that the americans disengaged after inflicting some shabab casualties we are not in a position to identify those casualties , the official said the fbi sent dozens of agents to nairobi after the siege of the westgate shopping mall to help the kenyan authorities with the investigation united states officials on american soil , perhaps employing somaliamerican recruits a witness in baraawe said the house was known as a place where senior foreign commanders stayed he could not say whether they were there when the attack began , but he said 12 welltrained shabab fighters scheduled for a mission abroad were staying there at the time of the assault it was not clear what role if any the target of the american assault had played in the attack on the nairobi mall one united states official said it was still unclear whether any americans had been involved in the westgate siege , though several kenyan officials said they now believed that there had been as few as four attackers far fewer than the 10 to 15 the government had previously reported a spokesman for the kenyan military said saturday that it had identified four of the attackers from surveillance footage as abu baara alsudani , omar nabhan , khattab alkene and a man known only as umayr the spokesman , maj emmanuel chirchir , said none of the militants had escaped the mall they 're all dead , he said the footage , broadcast on kenyan television on friday night , showed four attackers moving about the mall with cool nonchalance at least one of the four men , mr nabhan , was kenyan , officials said , and believed to be a younger relative of saleh ali saleh nabhan , the qaeda operative killed four years ago near baraawe , the site of saturday s raid the elder mr nabhan was a suspect in the bombing of an israeli hotel on the kenyan coast in 2002 and the attacks on the american embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 matt bryden , a former head of the united nations monitoring group on somalia and eritrea , said the tactics used in the westgate attack were similar to those used by the shabab in a number of operations in somalia this year but he also said that local help had been needed to pull off an attack on that scale , and that several of the men identified as taking part in the attack had been connected to the group s kenyan affiliate , known as al hijra we should certainly expect al hijra and al shabab to try again , mr bryden said and we should expect them to have the capacity to do so
in his book the good soldiers , david finkel , a pulitzer prizewinning reporter for the washington post , vividly recounted the experience of a united states army battalion in baghdad in 2007 and 2008 in the new york times book review , doug stanton called it a ferociously reported , darkly humorous and spellbinding book now , in thank you for your service , mr finkel follows several of those same soldiers back home in the united states , where they struggle with their memories of the war and the transition back to domestic life in a recent email interview , mr finkel discussed his reporting methods , the military s suicide rate , how being so close to the suffering of soldiers has changed him and more below are edited excerpts from the conversation did some of your subjects not want you to follow their progress or lack thereof \? was it difficult to convince the people who did agree to be involved with the new project \? no , it wasn t difficult , in large part because of the first book , which gave me some credibility with them with the first book , it was difficult soldiers didn t trust me they didn t know what a journalist does there were a lot of false rumors about what i was up to but the longer i stuck around , the better it got , and when bad things happened such as explosions , and i was present for those things , and instead of becoming a problem i was the guy at the edge quietly watching and taking notes , that helped , too did you know while reporting the good soldiers that you wanted to write this followup in this way \? i didn t the truth is i came back from my time in baghdad a little rattled when i finished writing the good soldiers , i thought i was done but as i kept in touch with some of the soldiers , and so many of them told me how they were turning anxious and depressed and sometimes suicidal , i realized that a second volume could be done about their coming home in hindsight , this seems like a pretty obvious thing , but it wasn t obvious to me in the beginning what finally got me going was a conversation i was having one day with one of the soldiers , who said , i was a normal guy who got sent to iraq and became crazy , so they sent me back to america to become sane , and now it s america that s driving me crazy he said that , and i remember thinking , well , i don t know what that means , but i want to find out and off i went how has the suicide rate among the military changed in recent years \? and historically has it risen a great deal over time \? it s difficult to chart historically because serious efforts by the military to track suicides began in earnest only a decade ago in that time , the number has risen steadily to last year s record level of nearly one suicide a day lots of journalists have written great stories about this , but let me cite the work of james dao and andrew lehren , who wrote earlier this year in the new york times even with the withdrawal from iraq and the pullback in afghanistan , the rate of suicide within the military has continued to rise significantly faster than within the general population , where it is also rising in 2002 , the military s suicide rate was 103 per 100 , 000 troops , well below the comparable civilian rate but today the rates are nearly the same , above 18 per 100 , 000 people they also had a fascinating piece about the difficulties of calculating the rate one key character in your book is peter chiarelli , who was the united states army vice chief of staff at the time you were reporting he s since retired he said he needed to change the culture of the military how much did he succeed in doing that \? and are there people actively continuing his mission now \? i think chiarelli would agree that he did not change the culture of the military , but that he did have an effect on certain people in the military serving under him , who may have had an effect on people serving under them , who may have well , you get the point how much did he succeed \? it s impossible to know since he moved on , the suicide meetings he threw himself into obsessively have continued but over time have become more sporadic to me , that suggests a onceactive mission has become less so at this point , how much do you think the stigma soldiers feel about admitting they re in psychological pain is due to the shaming done by other people and how much is due to internalized ideas they have about what it means to be a strong soldier and a strong man \? they seem so entwined , those two things but your question makes me think of a day in the war when adam schumann had to stay on base during a mission , and the guy who took his spot didn t see the hidden roadside bomb that exploded and killed a soldier , after which one of the surviving soldiers said to adam , none of this would have happened if you were there as i write in the book it was said as a soldier s compliment adam had the sharpest eyes , adam always found the hidden bombs , everyone relied on adam but that wasn t how he heard it then or hears it now it might as well have been shrapnel , the way those words cut him apart it was his fault it is his fault the guilt runs so deep it defines him now in other words , at the end of any day , there s no shame like your own shame how much psychological distress does someone have to exhibit in order to be sent home from war \? it depends on the unit , the commander , the signals being sent down the line some seem more tuned in to psychological distress , some less so the unit i was with seemed good on this , or maybe i should say pretty good no one objected to adam schumann leaving the war because of severe ptsd he was on his third deployment to iraq he had served a thousand days in combat he was regarded as a great soldier , and there was unmitigated compassion for him when he broke but then there was the murkier case of another soldier , unproven in combat , who one day climbed onto the roof of an iraqi police station , stripped , scrambled up a ladder to the top of a guard tower , and then in full view of the iraqi neighborhood below him began hollering at the top of his lungs and groping himself afterward , there were several discussions about whether it was an act of mental instability or the calculated act of someone pretending to be unstable in order to be sent home the unit commander couldn t get past the fact that the soldier had paused in the midst of his supposed meltdown to remove sixty pounds of gear and clothing before climbing the ladder ultimately to the commander , that suggested deliberateness to the soldier s thinking , and in the end , he was sent home not with a recommendation for treatment but for possible court martial you were deeply embedded in these people s domestic lives how and when did you spend time with them \? and over time , what balance did you feel between being a reporter on the scene and being an intimate part of their everyday \? i ve been in their company in one form or another with them , thinking about them , writing about them every day since the beginning of 2007 i was on the ground with them in baghdad for the bulk of their fifteenmonth deployment , and i was with them for a year and half after they came home , began to deteriorate , and set about trying to recover maybe you ll believe this , maybe not , but balance was never a problem for me i ve been doing this work for a long time i made sure when i was with them that there was always some signal of our relationship a notebook , a tape recorder to remind them that yes i wanted to be present for whatever was happening to them , but that i was a journalist at work , not their confessor there are people who appear in the book who fought in vietnam and world war ii do you have a sense from meeting them that today s soldiers are damaged in a distinct way , or that the emotional scars inflicted by warfare have remained similar in nature over time \? if one day can provide an answer , there was a day in my reporting that i talked to a guy who had fought in world war two , a guy who had fought in the korean war , guys who had fought in vietnam , a guy who had removed bodies after the jonestown massacre in guyana , guys who had fought in iraq , and guys who had fought in afghanistan all were psychologically wounded by their individual experiences , but as they described what they had been through and were feeling now , they all could have been describing each other i guess what i m saying is whether the damage is due to a particular war , or to something other than war such as an assault of some type , there s a commonality in what people become when they are shaken to their bones i found the book deeply troubling and affecting , and i was left wondering how the prolonged proximity to all this suffering affected you on an emotional level so this is a question i ve done my best to avoid over the years , but i ve been trying recently to take a swing at it the fact that i m nearly seven years older than when i started these books means these changes might have happened anyway , but i m a little sadder than i used to be , more grateful , less funny , more private , more in need of doing things in a linear way , worse at typing , and happier than ever to end a day with a drink on my front porch i think of war now not only intellectually but viscerally , and i dream about it , too , often , but not as much as i did a few years ago i m glad my friends now include soldiers , and that their friends now include someone like me are you still in touch with any or all of the subjects in the book \? have they read it and reacted to it \? i m in touch with all of them , and i hope to remain in touch with them i sent each a copy of the book a couple of weeks ago one just wrote back to say he was on chapter one and was laughing and crying and feeling so messed up by what he was reading that he didn t know if he d make it to chapter two i m waiting to hear more from him , and from the rest
while listening to the mezzosoprano pour her heart and soul into songs associated with kate smith at the allen room on saturday evening , i wondered if it were possible for any contemporary singer to embody the nation s optimistic , cando spirit with the force and purity that smith brought to to what degree does such a feeling even exist anymore \? optimism and togetherness mainstream cultural values that persisted through the 1950s were embodied in smith s plain , sturdy , upbeat alto as she delivered anthems celebrating resilience , faith and hope from a '60s perspective smith , who raised 600 million in war bonds , was beyond square \( she died in 1986 \) ms blythe first performed this thoroughly researched and annotated recital , we 'll meet again the songs of kate smith , two years ago at the same hall with the same pianist , craig terry the concert , which was taped for a future live from lincoln center telecast , was not merely a tribute to an indomitable woman who was the strong , reassuring female voice of america during world war ii it revealed ms blythe s passionate identification , spiritually as well as musically , with her subject radio , smith s medium , was the first social network , ms blythe said , and went on to suggest the profound impact that a single beloved radio personality could have on the anxious mood of the body politic in a sparser media climate inspirational voices today have their constituencies , but none symbolizes a nation s collective determination during hard times the way smith s did in the '30s and '40s ms blythe mentioned vera lynn , who was smith s british moraleboosting counterpart in her personification of stalwart courage during wartime the two women sang some of the same numbers , including \( there 'll be bluebirds over \) the white cliffs of dover and we 'll meet again the show , part of the american songbook series , began with smith s longtime radio theme , , introduced in 1931 , a song that distilled the themes of memory and belief in a better future that ran through smith s repertory listening to wrap your troubles in dreams , when you wish upon a star \( sung slowly and softly \) and we 'll meet again , which promises an ultimate reunion someday , somewhere \( the hereafter \? \) , i reflected on how comforting these songs must have been in an era before selfgratification became the cultural default attitude there were a couple of novel twists ms blythe cited lovely night , a song smith performed but never recorded , as an example of an operatic tune \( from the tales of hoffman \) with a horrendous english translation late in the show she sang gordon jenkins s this is all i ask , which smith recorded on a 1963 live album from carnegie hall the words beautiful girls , walk a little slower when you walk by me were revised to softspoken men , speak a little softer when you speak to me ms blythe rarely pushed herself to operatic declamation she did n't have to the strength required was already there

would like , hauls away the darkness in his ambulance when they met , mccue had been at the track for 11 years miller was going to work for the trainer richard delp mccue would give miller photographs

ecstatic about the race they just won he added i am at the best end of the business i'm at the happy end miller does not see happy faces he sees injured animals , distraught owners and shattered dreams he watches each race from the superintendent s office , a shack a quartermile from the winner s circle between the onequarter and the threesixteenths poles the cumulative effect of transporting injured horses has made miller distance himself emotionally from the thoroughbreds for whom he once cared it might be a horse i 've hauled off for whatever reason , he said a couple months later , or six months later , he comes back and runs and wins i do n't pay attention to them if he s going to take the last ride , i do n't want to know who he is miller attended elementary school in fork , md ,

after a semester and a half but after seven years at the track , the long hours were wearing on miller i got tired of working seven days a week , he said i wanted a job where i could do the things i wanted to do when miller heard there might be an opening for an equine ambulance driver , he left delp s stable as a hot walker , a groom , a stable foreman and an assistant trainer , miller had been involved with horses at the most intimate level as an ambulance driver , he has gone further , seeing them frightened and vulnerable while mccue regularly captures the good times , the joys and the

industry illustrate the glory of racing , mccue has also seen racing s brutal side i 've seen horses die , and i 've seen a few jockeys from time to time die out here , he said it s horrible , and it happens every once in a while it s a rough game miller and mccue were at the preakness on may 20 , 2006 , when the kentucky derby winner barbaro seconds into the race mccue was at his accustomed position at the wire preparing to record the triumph of racing s next superhorse i looked at the number , then looked at program and said , oh , my god , ' mccue recalled he quickly made his way to the area where barbaro was being treated and began shooting pictures but i never showed anybody any of them , he said that s something i would never do i would never show those images to anybody else they are in the archives right now , and i 'll probably never look at them miller went into action with the rescue team in the 2007 he can be seen helping situate barbaro in the ambulance with one look at the injury , miller said , he knew that fate had given barbaro a death sentence most horses would have been euthanized on the spot if he was n't a kentucky derby winner , it would have been a done deal , miller said he rode in the back of the ambulance from pimlico to new bolton center at the university of pennsylvania school of veterinary medicine after an eightmonth effort to save barbaro ,  during a recent phone conversation , mccue was asked to name the most difficult part of his work he paused and said , there is none he added i love photography , i love horses , and i love the racetrack i can truly say i love my job miller s relationship with his work is far more complicated he loves the track and the racing community but he acknowledged that driving the ambulance had taken an emotional toll if i knew then what i know now , i may not have taken the job , he said you really would n't believe some of the things you see mccue sees happy endings , smiling faces and winner s circles miller sees the price often paid to get there they are horse racing lifers , on opposite sides of the track
atlanta as midnight approached , geno smith buttoned his blue dress shirt , knotted a red tie and slipped into dark slacks before reaching for the blue sport coat in his locker , smith , the jets' firstyear quarterback , sat on a stool and covered his feet with sweat socks and white athletic shoes odd as this ensemble seemed , it was appropriate for the occasion he had just displayed a combination of corner office executive leadership and football player s physical dynamism against the atlanta falcons of all the major contributors to at the georgia dome , none was as captivating as the player who was a tiedye headband away from looking as if he were undergoing a rookie hazing just regular geno , said wide receiver stephen hill , an atlanta native who had a sweet homecoming we saw it in him in the first game they did not see it in every game , however , which prompted coach rex ryan to consider a peculiar item for smith to wear a colorcoded wristband as a guide to how much risk he should assume on a given play ryan abandoned the notion , and smith fulfilled his trust with a turnoverfree command performance monday night after 12 interceptions and lost fumbles by the jets before monday , ball security was a big emphasis for us , smith said we 've been moving the ball pretty well , and we 've been in situations where we just kill ourselves we just tried to eliminate that until six seconds past the twominute warning , when the falcons eked ahead , 2827 , smith had been merely efficient , if unspectacular , with 12 completions and 3 touchdowns in 16 throws aiding and abetting him was a ground game that averaged more than 5 yards a carry as three tailbacks shared the load with the debut of mike goodson , who had just completed a fourgame suspension imposed by the nfl for an offseason arrest it felt great , man , goodson said we are real talented in the backfield , so it s better to spread the wealth another helping hand came from tight end jeff cumberland , who played in the opening half as if he had exchanged uniforms with atlanta s tony gonzalez , the most productive receiving tight end in nfl annals in fact , upon scoring a 20yard touchdown , cumberland broke into the dirty bird , an end zone dance with arms flapping that once was a trademark of falcons players , mainly in the late 1990s i planned it all the way , cumberland said the defense did its part , at least through three quarters , primarily with a goalline stand that maintained the jets' 177 lead at halftime after the falcons were given a reprieve by drawing a penalty on an incomplete pass , they were stuffed on a run from inside the 1 by tackle sheldon richardson they felt like their offensive line was better than our line and tried to punch it in , richardson said that time , we showed that our line was better than theirs but the defense yielded two touchdowns in the fourth quarter , leaving smith scarce time to counter in the huddle at the start of the final series , hill said , smith told the team , we 're about ready to go right down here and get us at least 3 points cumberland said afterward you never lose faith rex always says to us that you 've got 60 minutes smith , who said he had felt serene in such situations since childhood , connected twice with hill and once with jeremy kerley on the first three snaps , advancing the jets from their 20 to the falcons' 46 the next play , intended as a pass , was improvised into an 8yard scramble by smith after a 4yard gain by bilal powell and a 6yard completion to clyde gates , smith ordered a pass play from the atlanta 31 , which was still too far for a comfortable nick folk fieldgoal attempt at the line of scrimmage , smith sensed some risk even without a multihued wristband in the falcons' alignment and used an audible to change the play to a handoff powell spun off left tackle for 6 yards , and folk handled the remaining distance with ease tailback chris ivory dismissed the notion that the drive imbued smith with a newfound confidence he always has had it in him , ivory said he was already a confident guy ryan , careful not to heap too much praise on smith , cast the victory in a teamwide context i'm glad we won this way , ryan said , because it took every one of us it was n't that you leaned on one side or the other still , ryan could not help but notice smith s glittery quarterback rating of 1477 for the game , which is higher than peyton manning s figure for the season i'm proud of geno , ryan said of the rookie who , in his blend of business and athletic garb , left the visitors' locker room dressed , however strangely , for success
washington just a few years ago , the tax deal pushed through congress on tuesday would have been a republican fiscal fantasy , a sweeping bill that locks in virtually all of the , exempts almost all estates from taxation , and enshrines the former president s credo that dividends and capital gains should be taxed equally and gently but times have changed , president is gone , and before the bill s final passage late tuesday , house republican leaders struggled all day to quell a revolt among caucus members who threatened to blow up a hardfought compromise that they could have easily framed as a victory many house republicans seemed determined to put themselves in a position to be blamed for sending the nation s economy into a potential tailspin under the weight of automatic tax increases and spending cuts the latest internal party struggle on capitol hill surprised even senate republicans , who had voted overwhelmingly for a deal largely hashed out by their leader , of kentucky the bill passed the senate , 89 to 8 , at 2 am on tuesday , with only 5 of the chamber s 47 republicans voting no twentyone hours later , the same measure was opposed by 151 of the 236 republicans voting in the house it was further proof that house republicans are a new breed , less enamored of tax cuts per se than they are driven to shrink government through steep spending cuts protecting nearly 99 percent of the nation s households from an income tax increase was not enough if taxes rose on some and government spending was untouched a party that once disputed that there was any real cost of tax cuts encountered sticker shock when the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated that enacting them in place of the provisions would cost  i personally hate it , representative john campbell , a republican from california , said of the bill the speaker the day after the election said we would give on taxes , and we have , but we wanted spending cuts this bill has spending increases are you kidding me \? by all accounts , the tax deal negotiated by mr mcconnell and vice president is one of the most sweeping fiscal policy changes in a decade , a measure that would bring a certainty to the tax code long demanded by the financial community and taxpayers the bill s heft was confirmed on tuesday by the congressional budget office , which said the income and business tax cut extensions new capital gains , dividend and rates and unemployment compensation would add an estimated 4 trillion to the federal deficit compared with where the government would be if congress did nothing to halt the tax increases and spending cuts that were triggered at the start of the year the independent said that measured against extending all 2012 policies , the deal would cut the deficit by 650 billion over 10 years the group said the biggest cost , a patch to the to prevent it from suddenly affecting much of the middle class , should not be considered a cost at all because congress has adjusted it each year anyway but the congressional budget office s estimate gave even some democrats pause , especially since the bill would make permanent virtually all of the bush tax cuts a goal that mr bush chased through the rest of his presidency for four years in my town hall meetings across the state , coloradans have told me they want a plan that materially reduces the deficit , said senator michael bennet , one of three democrats who voted against the bill this proposal does not meet that standard and does not put in place a real process to reduce the debt down the road the bill would do much more than head off the automatic tax increases and spending cuts it would fix in place a tax code that for more than a decade has caused struggles over regular sunset provisions , temporary solutions and fleeting incentives the bill would finally make permanent five of the six income tax rates created in 2001 by the first bush tax cut it would codify mr bush s successful push , in 2003 , to make tax rates on dividends and capital gains equal so that one form of investment income is not favored over the other but it would let lapse a twopercentagepoint cut in the , one of the recent tax policy changes most squarely aimed at the working class , meaning takehome pay may be less even if higher income taxes are headed off the a nonpartisan research group in washington , estimated that 77 percent of americans could pay more over all to the federal government this year for me , this is very much an on the one hand , on the other hand' thing , said ari fleischer , the white house press secretary in the years of mr bush s tax fights as a bush loyalist , it s fantastic that the bush tax cuts , which now have to be seen inarguably as overwhelmingly for the middle class , are being made permanent on the other hand , it s inarguable that this adds 4 trillion to the federal debt the 10year price includes 762 billion to lock in the bush tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent , 28 percent and 33 percent , along with some of the bushera 35 percent bracket 354 billion to continue mr bush s expanded child credit and 339 billion to secure mr bush s 15 percent capital gains and dividend rates for families earning less than 450 , 000 fixing the alternative minimum tax would cost the treasury 18 trillion , according to the bipartisan  democrats say they had little choice the bush white house and republican congresses structured the tax cuts so that letting them expire would be politically difficult add the acrosstheboard spending cuts if congress did nothing , and president obama felt he had to extend most of the tax cuts or watch the economy sink back into recession new occasions make for new truths , said representative danny k davis , a democrat from illinois and a veteran of the partisan wars over the bush tax cuts new situations make ancient remedies uncouth most galling for republicans are provisions projected to add 330 billion in spending over 10 years , including 30 billion in unemployment compensation and 21 billion in payments to health providers none of those provisions are objectionable on their own , but collectively they almost proved impossible for republicans to accept even one of the chief architects of the bush tax cuts , r glenn hubbard , a columbia university economist , was not crowing about their potential enshrinement he said some bushera policies were no longer relevant to the task of tailoring a tax code to a properly sized government the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are not the best anchoring point for that debate , he said we need a tax system that can promote economic growth and raise the revenue the american people want to devote to government
d sseldorf , germany praised by her party as a stroke of luck for germany but warning that her rivals could still unseat her as chancellor , angela merkel on sunday fired up her supporters for the last two weeks of a campaign she is widely expected to win ms merkel , 59 , who is seeking a third fouryear term as chancellor in federal elections on sept 22 , seemed in good humor on sunday in front of some 7 , 000 supporters in a sports and convention center on the outskirts of d sseldorf , one of the main cities in the crucial state of north rhinewestphalia the most populous state in germany , and traditionally a stronghold of ms merkel s social democratic rivals , this is where the election can be won or lost ms merkel had just returned from the group of 20 meeting in st petersburg , russia asked by a female presenter , how she managed to stay fresh , ms merkel quipped , well , the german cosmetics industry is in quite good shape in st petersburg , ms merkel caused some diplomatic consternation when she did not follow other european countries present britain , france , italy and spain in signing on to a statement about syria while not mentioning the criticism , ms merkel deviated from her usual stump speech on sunday to note that she wanted to see a response after the terrible deaths in the aug 21 chemical weapons attack in syria she had hesitated in russia , she said , only because the 28 foreign ministers of the european union were meeting the next day in lithuania , and she did not want to speak on their behalf germany joined the european union call for united nations action , which was missing from the statement in russia , and then belatedly signed on to the st petersburg statement ms merkel s critics accuse her of not being resolute enough in foreign policy there is no support in germany for participating in any military action against syria , and none of the parties would like to see the issue loom large in a domestically focused and somewhat lackluster campaign the chancellor s high popularity almost certainly will not translate into an overwhelming victory on sept 22 because of the german electoral system , and the mathematics of forming coalitions the d sseldorf rally was clearly intended to fire up the conservatives for the final two weeks ms merkel s christian democratic union hopes for a big lift next sunday in the conservative state of bavaria , which is voting for a regional parliament and where the christian democratic union s sister party , the christian social union , is aiming high , hoping to win more than 50 percent of the seats horst seehofer , the leader of the christian social union , was among those appearing on sunday ms merkel , he said to warm applause , is a stroke of luck for germany , and should stay chancellor
cairo the sounds made lately by curfew violators here are mostly not shouts or gunshots , but the clacking of dice on wooden backgammon boards , the clicking of dominoes on cafe tables crowded with hookahs and grumbling fueled by years of upheaval when the conversation turns to politics , the predominant topic is a surprise to american ears the conspiracy between the united states and the muslim brotherhood to destroy egypt however crackpot that view may sound , it is widespread among supporters of the military , which ousted the muslim brotherhood s elected president , mohamed morsi , last month for journalists who ventured out saturday night in violation of the curfew , the biggest danger was not from police officers and soldiers at checkpoints , but from angry men with a chip on their shoulders and a grudge against al jazeera , the western press and america the sprung up in egyptian neighborhoods as a counterweight to the muslim brotherhood , in theory were disbanded last week but that did not stop selfappointed guardians in the zaki street market of the maadi neighborhood from repeatedly demanding identity documents , letters of permission and , especially , proof of not being affiliated with al jazeera , the panarab news network , which is reviled because it is owned by qatar , a strong supporter of the muslim brotherhood as patrons of the red apple cafe ignored the new 9 pm curfew , the presence of an american elicited bountiful conspiracy theories , all of them involving america s plan to destroy egypt through its paid brotherhood confederates even innocuous questions about the curfew , which on saturday was shortened two hours , became ideologically fraught what are you doing , why are you asking about curfew \? yelled one man it is something internal a group of other men surrounding an interpreter , their faces only inches from his , introduced themselves by saying , we are not thugs , before proceeding to threaten and berate their interlocutors egyptians have always shrugged off curfews cairo s night life continues pretty much as normal in places like maadi and especially in poor and workingclass areas , where street life provides some relief to people who live in hot apartments on zaki street , the cafes were full of smokers of shisha , the flavored tobacco burned in water pipes , and of backgammon players outside , the driver of a horsedrawn cart full of canisters of cooking gas clanged his cans to announce his presence , and farouq , a middleaged man making deliveries to supermarkets with a motorcycledrawn cart , stopped to talk americans are with the muslim brotherhood , farouq stated in a tone suggesting that it was common knowledge ok , you did something good when you killed osama bin laden , but now you are with al qaeda you support the terrorists a strong antiamerican undercurrent has always existed in egypt , but such views are more normally associated with radicals and islamists , and in reaction to american support for israel but now antiamerican sentiment is being stoked by an outpouring of dubious pronouncements from both state and private news media antiamericanism has even been given the ultimate imprimatur of state tolerance billboards one next door to the ministry of foreign affairs , for instance , shows president obama with a beard like those worn by the brotherhood , alongside a more flattering picture of the cleanshaven military leader , gen abdulfattah elsisi youm 7 , which claims to be the arab world s biggest recently invited reader reactions to a forum titled one hand against egypt hundreds responded maybe it s insane , allowed khaled salah , youm 7 s editor in chief , but we are in a time when crazy things are happening egypt s leaders have carefully avoided antiamerican rhetoric , mr salah said after a time , rationality will return the origin of the idea of a terroristfriendly america is opaque many cite money given to the brotherhood , but what they are referring to is the 15 billion in american aid to the government of egypt , which flowed to mr morsi s government as it did to the government before it , and as it continues to do since the military takeover most of that , 12 billion , goes to the egyptian military , and none of it goes to the brotherhood in fact , mr obama has taken a great deal of criticism for not cutting off aid to egypt after the military crackdown killed more than 1 , 100 people , most of them brotherhood protesters we 've been blamed by supporters of morsi we 've been blamed by the other side as if we are supporters of morsi , mr obama said on aug 15 when he announced the only real american sanction so far in response to the violence , the cancellation of a joint military exercise that kind of approach will do nothing to help egyptians achieve the future that they deserve many egyptians refer to youtube clips , quoting representative louie gohmert , republican of texas , who recently equated giving 15 billion in aid to the morsi government with support for terrorists back in the maadi neighborhood , supporters of the military offered similar theories the american and muslim brotherhood project is to separate egypt into different parts , shouted yahyeh , a builder , his face contorted with hatred ahmed , an engineer who said he had worked 22 years for xerox in cairo , was only slightly less hostile egyptians have always liked america , but now they do n't understand how it has changed , he said but a few contrary voices could be heard on saturday night show me any evidence that america supports the brotherhood , said ahmed abdullah wahed , a driver , after listening to others in the crowd general sisi was even trained in america where is the evidence \?

oakland , calif the kitchen counter in the home of the hayes family is scattered with the inhalers , sprays and bottles of pills that have allowed hannah , 13 , and her sister , abby , 10 , to excel at dance and gymnastics despite a horrific pollen season that has set off asthma attacks , leaving the girls struggling to breathe asthma the most common chronic disease that affects americans of all ages , about 40 million people can usually be well controlled with drugs but being able to afford prescription medications in the united states often requires topnotch insurance or plenty of disposable income , and time to hunt for deals and bargains the arsenal of medicines in the hayeses kitchen helps explain why pulmicort , a steroid inhaler , generally retails for over 175 in the united states , while pharmacists in britain buy the identical product for about 20 and dispense it free of charge to asthma patients albuterol , one of the oldest asthma medicines , typically costs 50 to 100 per inhaler in the united states , but it was less than 15 a decade ago , before it was repatented the one that really blew my mind was the nasal spray , said robin levi , hannah and abby s mother , referring to her 80 copayment for rhinocort aqua , a prescription drug that was selling for more than 250 a month in oakland pharmacies last year but costs under 7 in europe , where it is available over the counter the centers for disease control and prevention puts the annual cost of asthma in the united states at more than 56 billion , including millions of potentially avoidable hospital visits and more than 3 , 300 deaths , many involving patients who skimped on medicines or did without the thing is that asthma is so fixable , said dr elaine davenport , who works in oakland s breathmobile , a mobile asthma clinic whose patients often cannot afford high prescription costs all people need is medicine and education with its high prescription prices , the united states spends far more per capita on medicines than other developed countries drugs account for 10 percent of the country s 27 trillion annual health bill , even though the average american takes fewer prescription medicines than people in france or canada , said gerard anderson , who studies medical pricing at the bloomberg school of public health at johns hopkins university americans also use more generic medications than patients in any other developed country the growth of generics has led to cheap pharmacy specials under 7 a month for some treatments for high cholesterol and high blood pressure , as well as the popular sleeping pill ambien but many generics are still expensive , even if insurers are paying the bulk of the bill generic augmentin , one of the most common antibiotics , retails for 80 to 120 for a 10day prescription \( 400 for the brandname version \) generic concerta , a mainstay of treating attention deficit disorder , retails for 75 to 150 per month , even with pharmacy discount coupons for some conditions , including asthma , there are few generics available while the united states is famous for breakthebank cancer drugs , the high price of many commonly used medications contributes heavily to health care costs and certainly causes more widespread anguish , since many insurance policies offer only partial coverage for medicines in 2012 , generics increased in price an average of 53 percent , and brandname medicines by more than 25 percent , according to a recent study by the health care cost institute , reflecting the skyhigh prices of some newer drugs for cancer and immune diseases while prescription drug spending fell slightly last year , in part because of the recession , it is expected to rise sharply as the economy recovers and as millions of americans become insured under the affordable care act , said murray aitken , the executive director of ims health , a leading tracker of pharmaceutical trends unlike other countries , where the government directly or indirectly sets an allowed national wholesale price for each drug , the united states leaves prices to market competition among pharmaceutical companies , including generic drug makers but competition is often a mirage in today s health care arena a surprising number of lifesaving drugs are made by only one manufacturer and businesses often successfully blunt market forces asthma inhalers , for example , are protected by strings of patents for pumps , delivery systems and production processes that are hard to skirt to make generic alternatives , even when the medicines they contain are old , as they almost all are the repatenting of older drugs like some birth control pills , insulin and colchicine , the primary treatment for gout , has rendered medicines that once cost pennies many times more expensive the increases are stunning , and it s very injurious to patients , said dr robert morrow , a family practitioner in the bronx colchicine is a drug you could find in egyptian mummies pharmaceutical companies also buttress high prices by choosing to sell a medicine by prescription , rather than over the counter , so that insurers cover a price tag that would be unacceptable to consumers paying full freight they even pay generic drug makers not to produce cutrate competitors in a controversial scheme called pay for delay  thanks in part to the 250 million last year spent on lobbying for pharmaceutical and health products more than even the defense industry the government allows such practices lawmakers in washington have forbidden medicare , the largest government purchaser of health care , to negotiate drug prices unlike its counterparts in other countries , the united states patientcentered outcomes research institute , which evaluates treatments for coverage by federal programs , is not allowed to consider cost comparisons or costeffectiveness in its recommendations and importation of prescription medicines from abroad is illegal , even personal purchases from mailorder pharmacies our regulatory and approval system seems constructed to achieve highpriced outcomes , said dr peter bach , the director of the center for health policy and outcomes at memorial sloankettering cancer center we don t give any reason for drug makers to charge less and taxpayers and patients bear the consequences california s medicaid program spent 61 million on asthma medicines last year , paying more than 200 not far from full retail price for many inhalers at the breathmobile clinic in oakland , the parents of bella buyanurt , 7 , fretted about how they would buy her medications since the family lost medicaid coverage barbara wolf , 73 , a retired oakland school administrator covered by medicare , said she used her inhaler sparingly , adding , i minimize puffs to minimize cost hannah and abby hayes were admitted to the hospital on separate occasions in 2005 with severe shortness of breath oakland , a city subject to pollution from its freeways and a busy seaport , has four times the hospital admission rate for asthma as elsewhere in california the asthma rate nationwide among africanamericans and people of mixed racial backgrounds is about 20 percent higher than the average robin levi , a stanfordtrained lawyer who works for students rising above , a group that helps lowincome students attend college , is black her husband , john hayes , an economist , is white their daughters have allergic asthma that is set off by animals , grass and weeds , but they also get wheezy when they have a cold that first year , i had to take a lot of time from my job to deal with the asthma drugs , the prices , arguing with insurers it was a frustrating saga , ms levi said for decades , the backbone of treatment for asthma has centered on inhaled medicines the first step is a bronchodilator , which relaxes the muscles surrounding small airways to open them for people who use this type of rescue inhaler frequently , doctors add an inhaled steroid as a maintenance drug to prevent inflammation and ward off attacks the two medicines are often mixed in a single combination inhaler for adults , and these products are especially pricey in addition , many patients , particularly children , take pills as well as nasal sprays that calm allergies that set off the condition while on medication , neither hayes girl has been in the hospital since her initial diagnosis their mother tweaks dosing , adding extra medicine if they have a cold or plan to ride horses for most patients , asthma medicines are lifechanging in economic terms , that means demand for the medicines is inelastic unlike a treatment for acne that a patient might drop if the price became too high , asthma patients will go to great lengths to obtain their drugs for pharmaceutical companies , that has made these respiratory medicines blockbusters the two bestselling combination inhalers , advair and symbicort , had global sales of 8 billion and 3 billion last year each inhaler , typically lasting a month , retails for 250 to 350 in the united states asked to explain the high price of inhalers , the two major manufacturers say the calculus is complicated our pricing is competitive with other asthma treatments currently on the market , michele meixell , the united states spokeswoman for astrazeneca , which makes symbicort and other asthma drugs , said in an email she added that lowincome patients without insurance could apply for free drugs from the company juan carlos molina , the director of external communication for glaxosmithkline , which makes advair , said in an email that the price of medicines was closely linked to this country s model for delivery of care , which assumes that health insurance will pick up a significant part of the cost an average copayment for advair for commercially insured patients is 30 to 45 a month , he added even with good insurance , the hayeses expect to spend nearly 1 , 000 this year on their daughters asthma medicines their insurer spent much more than that the total would have been more than 4 , 000 if the insurer had paid retail prices in oakland , but the final tally is not clear because the insurer contracts with medco , a prescription benefits company that negotiates with drug makers for undisclosed discounts dr dana goldman , the director of the leonard d schaeffer center for health policy and economics at the university of southern california , said producing these drugs is cheap and yet we are paying very high prices he added that because inhalers were so effective at keeping patients out of hospitals , most national health systems made sure they were free or inexpensive but in the united states , even people with insurance coverage struggle lisa solod , 57 , a freelance writer in georgia , uses her inhaler once a day , instead of twice , as usually prescribed , since her insurance does not cover her asthma medicines john aravosis , 49 , a political blogger in washington , buys a few advair inhalers at 45 each during vacations in paris , since his insurance caps prescription coverage at 1 , 500 per year sharon bondroff , 68 , an antiques dealer in maine on medicare , scrounges samples of advair from local doctors ms bondroff remembers a time , not so long ago , when inhalers were really cheap the sticker shock for asthma patients began several years back when the federal government announced that it would require manufacturers of spray products to remove chlorofluorocarbon propellants because they harmed the environment that meant new inhaler designs and new patents and skyrocketing prices that decision bumped out the generics , said dr peter norman , a pharmaceutical consultant based in britain who specializes in respiratory drugs suddenly sales of the branded products went right back up , and since then it has not been a very competitive market the chlorofluorocarbon ban even eliminated primatene mist inhalers , a cheap overthecounter spray of epinephrine that had many unpleasant side effects but was at least an effective remedy for those who could not afford prescription treatments as drugs age and lose patent protection , the costs of treatment can fall significantly because of generic competition particularly if a pill has only one active ingredient and is simple to replicate when singulair , a pill the hayes girls take daily to block allergic reactions in the lungs , lost its patent protection last year , generics rapidly entered the market the price of the drug has already dropped from 180 per month to as low as 15 to 20 with pharmacy coupons but sprays , creams , patches , gels and combination medicines are more difficult to copy exactly to make a generic that meets food and drug administration standards each time a molecule is put in a new inhaler or combined with another medicine , the amount delivered into the lungs or through the skin may change , even though that often has an imperceptible effect on patients drug companies can switch devices and use different combinations , and it becomes quite difficult to demonstrate equivalence , dr norman said , adding that inhaler makers have exploited such barriers to increase sales of medicines long after the scientific novelty has passed a result is that there are no generic asthma inhalers available in the united states but they are available in europe , where health regulators have been more flexible about mixing drugs and devices and where courts have been quicker to overturn drug patent protection the high prices in the us are because the fda has set the bar so high that there is no clear pathway for generics , said lisa urquhart of evaluatepharma , a consulting firm based in london that provides drug and biotech analysis i m sure the brands are thrilled the fda acknowledges that the lack of inhaled generic medicines , as well as topical creams , has been costly for patients , but it attributes that to difficult , longstanding scientific challenges , since measuring drug activity deep into the lung is complicated , said sandy walsh , a spokeswoman for the agency dr robert lionberger , the agency s acting deputy director in the office of generic drugs , said that research into the development of generic inhaled medicines was the agency s highest priority but that the effort had been stalled because of budget cuts imposed by congress even so , experts say , a significant problem is that none of the agencies that determine whether medicines come to market in the united states are required to consider patient access , affordability or need the food and drug administration has handed out patents to reward drug makers for conducting formal safety and efficacy studies on old drugs that had not been so scrutinized that transformed cheap mainstays of treatment like colchicine for gout and intravenous hydroxyprogesterone for preterm labor into highpriced branded products , costing 5 a pill and 1 , 500 per dose for its part , the united states patent office grants new protections for tweaks to drugs without weighing the financial impact on patients for example , with the patent for the older oral contraceptive loestrin 24fe about to expire , the company warner chilcott stopped making the pill this year and introduced a chewable version with a new patent and an expensive promotional campaign urging patients and doctors to switch while many insurance plans covered the popular older drug with little or no copayment , they often exclude the new pills , leaving patients covering the full monthly cost of about 100 patients complained that the new pills tasted awful and were confused about whether they could just be swallowed drug patents are easy to get , and the patent office is deluged , said dr aaron kesselheim , a pharmaceutical policy expert at harvard medical school the fda approves based on safety and efficacy it doesn t see its role as policing this process for asthma patients in the united states , the best the market has yielded are a few faux generics that are often only marginally cheaper than the brandname versions astrazeneca , for example , has an agreement with teva pharmaceuticals , a generic manufacturer , to make an approved generic version of its pulmicort respules , an asthma medicine for home inhalation treatments teva paid astrazeneca more than 250 million last year in royalties to make a generic , which sells for about 200 for a typical monthly dose , compared with close to 300 for the branded product there are good reasons drug companies are feeling threatened in the last several years , some bestselling medicines , like lipitor for high cholesterol and plavix for blood thinning , have been largely replaced by cheap generics in a very competitive market in 2012 , that led to 29 billion in savings for patients , said mr aitken of ims , or 29 billion in lost revenues for drug makers eightyfour percent of prescriptions dispensed last year were for generic medications while drug companies generally remain highly profitable , recent trends have meant tough times for some companies , including merck , whose profits crashed 50 percent this year primarily because the patent expired on its bestselling asthma pill , singulair so astrazeneca has recently spent millions of dollars in court pursuing several small drug companies for patent infringement after they announced a plan to make a true cheap generic version of pulmicort respules though a new jersey judge sided with the generic manufacturers this spring , legal appeals by astrazeneca will keep the generics off the market for the near future as insurance policies require patients to contribute more out of pocket for medicines , public pressure to curb prices has grown this year , more than 100 top cancer specialists protested the rising prices of cancer treatments drug companies have long argued that pharmaceutical pricing reflects the cost of developing and testing innovative new drugs , many of which do not pan out or make it to market when there s a really innovative product , you might be able to justify the price , dr kesselheim said but this is not generally the case critics counter that drug companies spend far more on marketing and sales than the 15 percent and 20 percent of their revenues that they devote to research and development in the united states , one of the few western countries that allows advertising of prescription drugs to consumers , glaxosmithkline spent 99 million in advertising for advair in 2012 despite its financial woes , merck spent 463 million to advertise its steroid spray , nasonex , according to fiercepharmacom , a web site that tracks the industry s advertising also , the focus of much pharmaceutical research in recent years has shifted from simple drugs for common diseases that would have widespread use to complicated molecules that would most likely benefit fewer patients but carry far higher price tags , in the realm of tens of thousands of dollars the newest offering for asthma is novartis s xolair , which is given by injection in a doctor s office every two weeks at a cost of up to 1 , 500 , depending on the dose because the drug is so expensive and was deemed to have little or no benefit over inhalers for a vast majority of patients , the british government last year announced that it would not make it available through the national health service it relented this year , agreeing to stock it for limited use , after the manufacturer offered a confidential discount in all other developed countries , governments similarly use a variety of tools to make sure that drug manufacturers sell their products at affordable prices in germany , regulators set drug wholesale and retail prices across europe , national health authorities refuse to pay more than their neighbors for any drug in japan , the price of a drug must go down every two years drug prices in the united states are instead set in hundreds of negotiations by hospitals , insurers and pharmacies with drug manufacturers , with deals often brokered by powerful middlemen called group purchasing organizations and pharmacy benefit managers , who leverage their huge size to demand discounts the process can get nasty if mediators offer too little for a given product , manufacturers may decide not to produce it or permanently drop out of the market , reducing competition with such jockeying determining supply , products can simply disappear and prices for vital medicines can fluctuate far more than they do for a carton of milk after the price of abby hayes s rhinocort aqua nasal spray rose abruptly , it was unavailable for many months that sent her family scrambling to find other prescription sprays , each with a price tag over 150 this year the price of advair dropped 10 percent in france , but in pharmacies in the bronx , it has doubled in the last two years in georgia , ms solod , the freelance writer , found the same thing every time i get advair , the price is different , she said and the price always goes up it never comes down twenty years ago , drugs that could safely be sold directly to patients typically moved off the prescription model as their patent life ended that brought valuable medicines like nondrowsy antihistamines and acid reducers to drugstore shelves but with profitable prescription products now selling for 100 per tiny bottle , there is little incentive to make the switch , since overthecounter drugs rarely succeed if they cost more than 20 as a result , a number of products that are sold directly to patients in other countries remain available only by prescription in the united states that includes a version of the popular but expensive steroid nasal spray used by abby hayes , which is available over the counter in london for under 15 at the boots pharmacy chain not only is the cost cheaper , but it doesn t require a doctor s visit to get it , said dr jan lotvall , a professor of allergy and immunology at the university of gothenburg in sweden , where steroid nasal sprays are also available over the counter during this high pollen season , abby had to cut short a gymnastics practice , and her sister , hannah , missed one day of school because of breathing problems , the first time in many years but with parents who can afford to get the medicine they require , both are now doing fine that is not true of two other sisters from oakland whom their mother mentors with treatment hard to access and drug prices high , kemonni and donzahnya pitre , 19 and 17 , simply suffer and struggle to breathe as donzahnya , a high school senior , looked through the fiske guide to colleges at the hayeses kitchen table one day , she had an unusual selection criterion i worry about going to a college that s surrounded by a lot of grass
boston has been at odds with major league baseball and the ' front office for weeks , but until sunday night his battles were waged strictly off the field then came ryan dempster , who injected himself into the narrative with a 92mileperhour fastball to rodriguez s rib cage in what appeared to be a blatantly intentional act , in the second inning of the yankees' 96 victory over the , prompting a wild outburst by manager in support of rodriguez and a comeback by the yankees that seemed to signal that , no matter what rodriguez may or may not have done off the field , his teammates support him on it but rodriguez s response was by far the most compelling four innings after he was plunked and girardi was ejected for arguing the fact that dempster was not ejected rodriguez shrugged off the thunderous booing and drove a ball about 10 rows into the centerfield bleachers , the deepest part of fenway park , to initiate a fourrun sixth inning that gave the yankees the lead for good even as rodriguez wages an ugly and public legal war against the yankees , he is helping them win games , none more emotionally charged than this one , which moved them seven and a half games behind boston in the american league east as the ball landed , rodriguez slapped his hands together while rounding first base when he stepped on home plate , he stopped and pointed to the sky with both hands , a semiprovocative act by a wholly provocative player it was awesome , he said i was pretty excited it was the ultimate payback five batters later , brett gardner , who ran onto the field after rodriguez was hit and had to be held back by robinson cano , hit a basesclearing triple to center to give the yankees the lead , 76 rodriguez went 3 for 4 with two runs batted in and two runs scored and raised his batting average to 319 after the game , he and his manager and some teammates were fuming about dempster girardi called the pitch intentional and said dempster deserved a suspension long enough to ensure he missed at least one start rodriguez , who is facing a 211game suspension for his suspected involvement with an antiaging clinic that dispensed performanceenhancing drugs , was asked if he thought dempster deserved to be suspended i'm the wrong guy to be asking about a suspension , he said with a laugh when asked if dempster should appeal a possible suspension , rodriguez joked , i 've got an attorney i can recommend , referring to any one of the highprofile lawyers who are currently representing him rodriguez is appealing his suspension and is permitted to continue to play pending a hearing some players , including members of the red sox , have said that is unfair , and girardi felt that sentiment led dempster to hit rodriguez ryan dempster has been a player rep and he s been very involved in the union , and he knows this is what they decided to do , girardi said you ca n't change it and just take your potshots and you 'd have to have your head in the sand with the comments that have come from the other side not to know that something might be up dempster s first pitch to rodriguez went behind his legs his next two were also inside , making the count 30 , and the fourth pitch glanced off rodriguez s left elbow pad and hit his side whether you like me or hate me , that was unprofessional and silly , said rodriguez , who came around to score the yankees' first run dempster denied throwing at rodriguez no , he said i was trying pitch inside when the first pitch went behind rodriguez , girardi moved to the top step of the dugout , ready for action by the time the pitch that hit rodriguez had made its mark in his flesh and the home plate umpire brian o'nora had signaled warnings to dempster and both benches , girardi went berserk he charged out of the dugout , screaming that dempster should have been tossed when girardi threw his cap , he was the one who was tossed , then he turned his invective toward dempster and , in the most uncharacteristically profane terms , called him a coward although girardi has a temper , it is rare for him to resort to vulgarity everyone knows it s intentional , girardi said , and i do n't understand why he s left in the game and then to give us a warning \? along with girardi , several yankee players , most notably gardner , stormed the field gardner came all the way onto the grass to yell at dempster , and both bullpens emptied , although no opposing players came into contact with one another it fired us up , gardner said rodriguez took his base peacefully , but he wore an expression of anger and said he was pleased to see the reaction from girardi and his teammates that today brought us together , he said joe s reaction was amazing every single one of my teammates came up to me and said hit a bomb to walk it off while rodriguez s teammates have demonstrated tepid support for him , some members of the opposition , including pitcher john lackey and outfielder jonny gomes of the red sox , have publicly complained that he should not be allowed to play during the appeal , even though the rules , approved by the players union , permit it dempster was not previously vocal about it , although his pitches seemed to send an unmistakable message four innings later sent one back after rodriguez addressed questions about the pitch to the ribs and his home run , the discussion turned to comments that one of his lawyers , joseph tacopina , made to a new york times reporter on saturday in that interview , tacopina accused the yankees of hiding vital medical information from rodriguez and charged major league baseball investigators with misconduct rodriguez said he stood by the comments he s my lawyer , so yeah , he said he was asked about one of the charges , that dr bryan kelly , who performed the operation on his left hip in january , informed rodriguez that the yankees' president , randy levine , told the doctor in a phone conversation that he did not want rodriguez to play again rodriguez was asked who told him about the comments , which levine and general manager brian cashman deny occurred i'm going to reserve comment , he said , but immediately added , i did have a conversation with dr kelly the furor and legal disputes between rodriguez and the yankees are not over , but rodriguez did express the desire for a reconciliation , even with levine and cashman , with whom he has exchanged serious charges in public i hope so , rodriguez said i think we have the same goal that goal is to win inside pitch mariano rivera , in his first action since he blew three consecutive saves , pitched the ninth to earn his 36th save eduardo nunez felt tightness in his hamstring and had to leave the game ichiro suzuki had two singles , leaving him with 3 , 997 hits combined between japan \( 1 , 278 \) and the united states \( 2 , 719 \)
tuscaloosa , ala the college students began arriving a little before lunch at calvary baptist church , far more than usual for a local election the poll workers knew immediately the machine was here the school year at the university of alabama has barely gotten started , and already the campus has found itself in a charged selfexamination on issues of politics , power and race , with the exposure of tenacious segregation among fraternities and sororities drawing national attention but the turmoil began some weeks earlier it raised the specter of the machine , a secret society representing a league of select and almost exclusively white fraternities and sororities , which has been around for a century or more once a breeding ground for state political leaders , the machine \( it has long been known by that nickname \) today maintains a solid hold on student government through an effective , and critics say coercive , brand of oldfashioned organization politics but the machine s apparent involvement in an august school board election , a rare appearance in municipal politics , has prompted a lawsuit , accusations of voter fraud and an outcry that in many ways primed the campus for the larger storm over inclusion and tradition that is now taking place the race for the tuscaloosa city was already atypical business interests had announced a desire to remake the board , saying the rate of progress had been insufficient in a system of 10 , 000 students , most of them lowincome fueled by businessfinanced political action committees , the challengers outraised the incumbents 10 to 1 , reporting by far the most money raised in a tuscaloosa school board race most of the challengers nonetheless lost in district 4 , however , the challenger was cason kirby , a 26yearold former student government president one year out of law school i really decided it was someplace i could make a difference , mr kirby said in an interview he acknowledged that he had never been to a school board meeting before his campaign , but said he had growing concerns about the state of the city s schools and was encouraged by civic and business leaders to run he also had a natural base of support the limos and party bus are running constantly , read one of numerous similar emails circulated around machineaffiliated sororities on election day free drinks were promised at local bars for those wearing i voted stickers sorority leaders were careful to emphasize that they were not endorsing a particular candidate but encouraged members to wear cason kirby tshirts to the polls the numbers bear out their influence of the 369 voters registered in the district this year , 269 registered during one week in midaugust , and 94 percent of those newly registered voters were 21 or younger mr kirby won the race by 416 to 329 votes his opponent , kelly horwitz , filed suit this month , claiming that many of the voters were ineligible , including 11 unrelated people who listed the same residence a small , singlefamily house near the football stadium the university president , judy l bonner , said in a statement that after the courts and appropriate state and or local agencies have completed their investigation , the university might conduct its own inquiry mr kirby denied condoning or knowing firsthand of any voting improprieties , saying ms horwitz had also campaigned on campus college students have a right to participate in local elections , he said legal issues aside , faculty members and others expressed outrage that an exclusive campus group like the machine appeared to have brought its wellknown tactics to bear in an election concerning a school system with a lee garrison , the newly elected chairman of the school board , whose name reportedly showed up in some of the sorority emails , called such outrage the height of hypocrisy mr garrison ran for tuscaloosa city council as a college senior in 1997 , and he , too , won with the support of hundreds of fraternity and sorority members \( his election was also challenged , unsuccessfully \) he described organized greeksystem voting as simply a kind of party politics and , more pointedly , questioned why the mobilization of sororities and fraternities was being challenged and not the getoutthevote operations of the teachers' union and black political organizations in tuscaloosa there is no difference , he said a possible distinction with the machine is that its members refrain from discussing it explicitly or even acknowledging that it exists founded around 1905 as a chapter of theta nu epsilon , a national fraternity , the group described itself in a 1989 statement in the university archives as a brotherhood pledged to assist the business world , with members who go on to become lawyers , attorney generals , governors and senators this kind of influence is what prompts critics to take it more seriously than just any secret campus group the university administration did not respond to repeated inquiries about its view of the machine s role on campus steve flowers , a political columnist , former state legislator and university of alabama graduate , said the machine s political influence had waned when i was growing up , that was the way to go to congress , he said you went to the university of alabama , got into student government , got involved in the machine , practiced law a little bit in your hometown , and you went to washington nowadays , mr flowers said , there are not many machine alumni in the state legislature and almost none in washington according to current and former members of machineaffiliated greek organizations , each of the 28 fraternities and sororities associated with the machine \( many greek organizations on campus are not \) sends a pair of representatives to a secret group , often referred to as going downstairs , because the group meets in the basement of a fraternity house members decide which candidates to back for student government , homecoming queen and several honor societies the fraternityandsorority rank and file are informed of the choices and put into action on election day their choices rarely lose accounts of intimidation tactics attributed to the machine over the decades include , and , although students these days speak mostly of , both implicit and overt and at times intense despite changes that the university has made to student government like expanding polling days and switching to online voting and despite the fact that machineaffiliated organizations account for less than onethird of alabama s student population , its candidates have continued to win , if not as decisively as in the past there is a lot of apathy , said kendra key , who in 2009 came within a few hundred votes of being the first black woman to be student government president students , she said , feel the greek system is going to dominate the elections , so why even waste the effort \? when the machine has faltered , it has adjusted cleophus thomas jr beat a machine candidate to become alabama s first black student government president in 1976 , in large part because of the votes of sorority members not long after , sororities were allowed into the machine for the first time there have been few nonmachine presidents , and no black presidents , since the intersection between the machine and race is complicated ms key suggested that the marginalization of black student representation was largely a byproduct the machine represents a white bloc in a historically segregated greek system , so its success inevitably means white control but others say race is more central to the machine and have tied the election controversy to the storm that arose last week when the crimson white , the student newspaper , reported that a superbly qualified black woman had failed to receive a single bid from alabama s traditionally white sororities they all seem of a piece to me , said stacy morgan , an american studies professor who has begun pushing , with other faculty members , for comprehensive changes to address campuselection procedures and the segregation of student organizations it s a kind of exclusiveness , a kind of insularity mr thomas , now a lawyer in anniston , ala , and a former university trustee , agrees like many alumni , he was not surprised by the revelations about segregation on campus but he found the machine s troubled run in municipal politics remarkable indeed they 're usually much more sophisticated than that , he said this may be the ineptness that results from having no real competition
i'm all in or as all in as a lifelong , deeply wounded , probably singed knicks fan can be , which is to say , we will trash the celtics , toss the pacers and so on until the eastern conference finals at which point we will hit the steelreinforcedconcrete wall called the miami heat basta let me indulge my entirely unfamiliar sense of optimism about this team we 're peaking point guard raymond felton is less butterfingered the tattooed sixth man j r smith has come into sudden possession of court sense , not to mention common sense and the shootfirst , shootalways forward carmelo anthony has embraced the balm of passing , spacing and occasional defense the spring has returned to the surgically repaired knee of iman shumpert , our defensive stalwart in the knicks assisted living division , jason kidd possesses more smarts than entire nba squads do i have worries \? please every optimistic word i type is a triumph of hope over angstridden , edvard munch the scream style anxiety our center , tyson chandler , rebounds , sets pick and tosses down alleyoops with the grace of a balanchine star he has a bulging disk in his neck , and call me crazy but i suspect no doctor would prescribe a playoff gantlet as a cure kenyon martin , the other illustrated man , injects bounce , rebounds and crazy tude , but he is 35 and his knees are sore i plan to light a votive candle still , the hated celtics \? be serious the pacers play tough defense but shoot like shotputters we win , and win , and play the heat at which point i 'll stupidly convince myself the impossible happens this is not a prediction for a knicks championship it s a summary blueprint for how they might get there they will , in all probability , not have to play chicago or brooklyn \( with a resurgent deron williams \) , both of which would match up to be the most dangerous eastern conference teams , outside of miami the celtics will give their most inspired effort , hoping to distract their heartbroken city but courtney lee is not ray allen avery bradley is not rajon rondo the frontline is small knicks in five next the pacers the play of indiana s budding star , paul george , has fallen off danny granger is out the big , rugged pacers are a threat if tyson chandler is limited , but they are scoring impaired knicks in six now , miami the heat finished the season 12 games ahead of the knicks usually a telling barometer but if dwyane wade s knees become a factor by the conference finals \( along with iman shumpert s onball pressure \) , j r smith continues to take and make good shots and chandler is himself , the argument could be made that the knicks would have the second , third and fourthmost impactful players in the series a tough chore , even for lebron knicks in seven the finals we know the west is a better conference , but that is because it is so much deeper there is no team out there you would say the knicks have no shot against with james harden , the thunder got one game off miami in the 2012 finals the spurs' vets are banged up and their young players are unproven the impressive nuggets have lost danilo gallinari any team capable of beating miami might even be considered a favorite , so there you go after 40 years , the knicks finally win it all get a parade float ready for , no longer singing the blues they 've had a fantastic year mike woodson has done a fabulous job the best decision that was made all year was to put carmelo anthony at the power forward position and surround him with three 3point shooters that took basketball courage on his part because that meant sitting amar'e stoudemire and how stoudemire handled that showed true basketball character , a selfless act on his part they will be in the eastern conference finals the regular season has very little to do with what happens in the playoffs the regular season is not telling the regular season is for one thing playoff positioning and carmelo anthony continues to get better he s impossible to guard oneonone he s too big , too strong and too skilled miami is the heavy favorite in the eastern conference i do n't know who will give them a challenge , but it s highly unlikely that they 're not challenged as for the knicks' age , this thing is basically a myth of the media their four most important players raymond felton , j r smith , carmelo anthony and tyson chandler are not old j r smith has been on a terrific tear he s obviously an explosive scorer who rebounds better than he s given credit for , and he s a much improved passer he s found a good spot for himself in new york , and mike woodson has brought out the best of him do i think they can win it all \? yeah ! if you get to the conference finals , then you can win it all some things would have to happen in that series for them to beat miami , but a lot can happen between now and then my prediction oklahoma city is going to win the championship this year this knicks team is not built to win with defense , though it uses some clever tactics to overcome certain players' deficiencies if the knicks make a run , it will be on the strength of hot shooting and precise offensive execution the knicks can count on carmelo anthony to deliver against almost any individual defender the question is when anthony sits or the knicks need a bucket from someone else , can they find another way to pressure the defense consistently \? that responsibility will fall to raymond felton and j r smith , two of the team s most enigmatic players felton s struggles are well cataloged , but many forget that until recently smith had also played his share of clunkers the shift for smith came when the knicks began to spread the floor more with the second unit and he responded with aggressive dribble drives they will need more of that in the playoffs or risk relying on felton s sometimesshaky playmaking the felton assist has become a euphemism for the shots felton misses and another knick , usually tyson chandler , rebounds and finishes the term speaks to the positive impact felton can have even when he misses , just by being aggressive but relying on misses hardly seems like a strategy for the knicks' role players to thrive on 3 s , felton and smith must get to the middle of the floor off the bounce what they do when they get there is likely to determine if the knicks can live up to their seeding , let alone test the mighty heat there is a misconception out there that new york is a baseball town maybe that is true in october , but when the knicks are making a run in may , the city is all basketball , all the time remember in 1993 \? what about standing on the scorer s table , arms raised , after the knicks beat the pacers to go to the 1994 nba finals \? remember when the garden went bananas over larry johnson s in 1999 \? please tell me that somebody remembers the nba on nbc written by john tesh \? well , if you moved to new york over the last 13 years or are under age 30 , you can be forgiven for not remembering new york s love affair with the knickerbockers \( or who john tesh is , for that matter \) the nba is on abc now , and new yorkers' recent basketball memories are dominated by prechina starbury , jerome james , isiah thomas and eddy curry can the knicks recapture the city s imagination \? winning their first division title in 19 years is a start , but simply making the playoffs is not enough even winning a firstround series will only begin to get the city s juices flowing it will take a trip to the eastern conference finals , perhaps to face the heat , to reignite this city s passion for pro basketball and if that happens , the subways will be packed with newly bought knicks hats and jerseys everyone will suddenly have an opinion about j r smith s tattoos and tyson chandler s fashion sense video of jeff van gundy latched onto alonzo mourning s leg like a dietcolafueled koala bear will be shown on an endless loop baseball will be forgotten and 2013 will be remembered as the year that new york rekindled its springtime love affair with hoops here s to hoping the optimistic sports clich for a group like this is battletested and heading into the playoffs , it is easy to take comfort in the long and decorated r sum s of jason kidd , marcus cambyand kenyon martin but the knicks' fortunes obviously depend on the thinner ranks of players still in their prime the most obvious are the duo of offensive and defensive savants carmelo anthony , the nba s leading scorer , and tyson chandler , whose talent on the other end has revitalized a franchise that had all but surrendered the opposing basket but the team s very identity and its hope for playoff success is perhaps best embodied by j r smith , a statement that begs to be followed with for better or worse his entire career every stepback jumper and whiteknuckle drive has mocked the very notion of dependable he is great or terrible , rarely anything in between that neatly captures a knicks team that has gone from dominant to forgettable to dominant in the course of a single season when the team is hitting 3 s , it is hard to beat when the players' shots are clanking off the rim , it is hard to imagine how they ever win the knicks have overspent and underachieved for more than a decade without winning a playoff series now they are expected , at least according to the seedings , to win two but this is a team that is not built for meeting expectations and it is far easier to imagine disappointment than its long forgotten alternative the temptation is to get caught up in the pyrotechnics carmelo anthony s swift turnaround jumpers , j r smith s impossible fadeaways and the hailstorms of 3pointers oh , those 3pointers the knicks' offense is a joy to behold , as entertaining as it is potent it s the defense that should concern them the knicks finished the season tied for 16th in defensive efficiency , allowing 1035 points per 100 possessions they finished behind denver , golden state and milwaukee , none of whom are regarded as defensive stalwarts recent history suggests this is a problem of the 20 teams to make the nba finals since 2003 , all but one had a top10 defensive rating the majority \( 13 \) had a rating of 101 or better eight of the last 10 champions ranked in the top five defensively the knicks have been consistently average all season , even during their 185 start and their 162 finish their rating since march 18 1044 do the knicks have another defensive gear \? perhaps , now that tyson chandler and kenyon martin are relatively healthy at the same time a freakishly efficient offense has been enough to this point but the playoffs are different , and the scoring will not come as easily against the boston celtics , the indiana pacers and , ultimately , the miami heat how far can the knicks go \? only as far as their defense will take them the knicks are entirely capable of winning the 2013 nba title that opinion is not offered lightly , or in jest , or with the requisite delusion that comes with new york sports fandom instead , it is with the knowledge that talent generally wins in the regular season while chemistry is usually the decisionmaker in the playoffs for the first time in a decade , chemistry is not an issue with new york the playoffs are more about plodding , halfcourt sets , and the knicks have two effective distributors \( jason kidd and raymond felton \) , two topshelf finishers \( j r smith and carmelo anthony \) , along with grit and size \( tyson chandler and kenyon martin \) the knicks are not a dominant team , as evidenced by their roller coaster season they are ancient and defenseless against a swift point guard , and could probably be outrebounded by the 199394 knicks team today and that is why the prevailing wisdom is the knicks' playoff run will last until they meet the heat , whom they have beaten in three of four games this season still , it might simply be too farfetched to accept that an aging roster of kidd , chandler , a handful of plucky role players , even with one top scorer , can beat the heat in the playoffs , and go on to win an nba title perfectly understandable but someone should probably tell that to the 2011 nba champion dallas mavericks  when you bleed nyc round ball , you have to embrace glasshalffull fanhood how else can you be a knickerbockers fan at all \? throughout this strange season , the knicks have been a puzzle , with a roster split between guys with grandchildren and those who had teammates with surnames in flemish or cantonese on their jerseys last year somehow , we ground out that second seed and obviously obviously ! we land the celtics in the first round it s a matchup that was always in that big , clunky deck of blue and orange knickerbockers cards that dolan keeps in the delta club miniature fridge next to anthony mason s jar of gogetemjuice i preached all season about being satisfied with small victories , but i secretly harbored fantasies of the second round now i'm openly discussing the knicks' giving miami a serious run in the conference finals we will put the boston dinosaurs in the ground with a convincing 41 romp , thanks to melo s ohsounseemly ballhogging we 'll win , 42 , over indiana if kmart and chandler can bring the hurt on their big men can we pull off four perfect games against the kings of miami \? we are old and we are weird and we have j r smith and his tatmagic , but could we grind this thing out in true new york fashion \? this is melo s time , and i feel that he will do what it takes the first round is on me at clyde frazier s wine and dine when our nyc brawlers head west to play oklahoma city the knicks have the nba s scoring leader in carmelo anthony and one of the greatest point guards in basketball history in jason kidd they have the reigning defensive player of the year in tyson chandler and one of the game s best 3point specialists in steve novak but when the game is on the line , there is only one knick j r smith players often talk about shooters who have no conscience the knicks , having sat through years of watching jamal crawford shoot the second his hands touched the ball , are certainly familiar with the concept smith , however , is in a league of his own he not only does not have a conscience , he seemingly has no connection to reality from anywhere inside 35 feet , guarded or not , smith believes the gamewinner is in his hands and he just needs to release it time and again he has been right time and again he has been wrong the knicks have enough pieces to get through the first two rounds unscathed , but should they wind up facing the miami heat in the eastern conference finals , they will need something similar to a miracle for knicks fans , the best bet for a miracle is to embrace a somewhat uncomfortable bargain live by j r , die by j r the knicks' season was actually three separate seasons first , they were the hottest team in the league then , there was a drought during which haters said the knicks would not make the playoffs finally , there was a 162 run and the clinching of the atlantic division sure , every team has hiccups when things do not go right , but the knicks played themselves out of it i have been a knicks fan living in brooklyn for years i live a block from barclays center , in fact and i did not fall for the publicrelations hype by jayz and the brooklyn nets i always felt the knicks would go deeper into the playoffs than their new crosstown rivals and their success there will depend on coach mike woodson you have to admire that he has never made excuses , despite all of the team s injuries this year he believes the team he takes to the court should be ready to play it helps when you have carmelo anthony , the first knick since bernard king to be the nba scoring champion they will have to cut down on turnovers , concentrate on shooting and stay healthy if that happens , i see the knicks in the nba finals go new york , go new york , go !  the knicks' chances depend on three factors health , composure and luck tyson chandler has to be 100 percent his presence in the middle and his maturity matter boston will work the psychological angles hard enough to make reggie miller s mouth look angelic j r smith , carmelo anthony and chandler need to resist reacting to trashtalking and bad calls , and stay away from bad shots and lazy fouls anthony will face double teams , so he will need to play the box more and hit the cutters the floor needs to be spread so steve novak becomes a factor and gets the ball the team s big weakness is its inability to stop penetration in the paint therefore james dolan and charles oakley need to kiss and make up maybe oak has a really mean nephew hanging out in the pool hall ready to belt someone with a healthy chandler , the knicks beat the celtics and indiana , and make the city proud by winning two against the heat
bad news knows no borders in the age of wifi my family and i were nearly half a world away from our boston home when the bombers struck the on april 15 , but we were soon informed gently of the tragedy by the proprietors of our guest house in the sri lankan hill town of ella it seemed quite a role reversal for sri lankans to be offering condolences to foreigners in a country once devastated by civil war and the 2004 tsunami but in that enduring , lovely place of undulating green , the news was delivered with more tenderness than dread , more hopefulness than resignation at year s end , that resilient tone sounds just right boston and the sports world have absorbed the latest attack on the right to play in peace and have since moved on with energy and optimism nicole gross , an american triathlete whose legs were badly injured in that attack , which killed three and wounded more than 100 , returned to the pool in october and returned to a race course last month to watch the thunder road marathon in charlotte , north carolina , with her sister and husband , who were also injured in boston we 're here to tell the world that we 're not scared to be at a finish line again , gross told the runners in that race we will embrace the finish line one more time that spirit also infused the , one of the symbols of the city , who regrouped quite literally after an abysmal 2012 season and rode their new lineup and underdog attitude all the way to victory in major league baseball s world series in october title in hand and scraggly playoff beards still in place , the team paraded through the streets of boston , with the players jarrod saltalamacchia and jonny gomes placing the world series trophy on the marathon finish line it was a year of bouncebacks , and although , who was finally and definitively unmasked as a cheater , has done no favors to comebacks , the athletes of the world seemed to pick up the pace when it came to staring down deficits that should have been decisive and shaking off rust that should have been restrictive and the miami heat were down by 5 points in the sixth game of the national basketball association finals in june with less than 30 seconds left in regulation and still found a way to grab enough offensive rebounds and sink enough 3pointers to beat the san antonio spurs and force a seventh game which the heat would win to secure their second straight title across the atlantic , franck rib ry and the french national soccer team were down and very likely out of next year s world cup finals after losing the opening leg of their playoff against ukraine , 20 , in kiev but then les bleus roared back to win at home , 30 , book their againsttheodds spot in brazil and give their downbeat country a big lift in the champions league , borussia dortmund , on the brink of elimination in the quarterfinals , got goals in added time from marco reus and felipe santana to somehow defeat malaga , 32 , and eventually advanced to the final in may , when bayern munich was good enough to be immune to comebacks but others were not in the first round of the stanley cup playoffs in may , the were down , 41 , with 11 minutes left in the decisive game 7 in boston no team in national hockey league history had won a game 7 from three goals down in the final period the bruins soon became the first anything can happen , and that s exactly what happened , said milan lucic of the bruins so it seemed fitting when six weeks later , in the same arena , the chicago blackhawks pulled their goalkeeper and scored twice in the final 76 seconds to snatch victory and the trophy from those same bruins all of a sudden , it felt like you had so much weight on your back , said the boston forward david krejci you could n't move , could n't think , and just could n't get it done some of the same mysterious forces appeared to be at work last month in auburn , alabama with the two american college football powerhouses alabama and auburn tied , 2828 , the alabama kicker adam griffith lined up for what would have been a long , gamewinning 57yard field goal griffith missed short , and the ball was fielded by auburn s chris davis in his own end zone in normal circumstances , davis would have been tackled in a matter of moments deep in his own territory in unusual circumstances , he would have made it to midfield before being taken down or pushed out of bounds in absolutely extraordinary circumstances , he would have done exactly what he did head left , dodge heavy traffic , barely manage to stay inbounds along the sideline and run the ball all the blessed way back for a gamewinning touchdown that put his team , not alabama , into the bowl championship series title game wow ! auburn just broke twitter and the internet ! tweeted an american fan , nick mckenna , perhaps unaware that the overwhelming majority of internauts \( and luddites \) outside of the united states follow college football about as closely as americans follow team handball or sepaktakraw other great comebacks in 2013 were more global in appeal , none more so than s return to the tennis summit after missing seven months , including the australian open , with chronic knee problems nadal lost his first tournament , falling to the 73rdranked horacio zeballos in the final in vina del mar , chile but that was about it for vulnerability as nadal preceded to win 10 tournaments , including his eighth and second , and ultimately relieved himself of the tape around his knee and relieved his new archrival , novak djokovic , of the no1 ranking i was in new york when nadal outlasted djokovic in that brutal open final , which featured a 54shot rally and more sweat than roger federer has ever allowed to exit his pores i made it to muirfield in scotland where , a southern californian once allergic to links golf , started the final round five shots off the lead and proceeded to shoot one of the finest rounds in british open history to secure the claret jug i made it to moscow where britain s christine ohuruogu , far behind at the final turn , relentlessly ran down botswana s amantle montsho and then leaned as far forward as she could to win the women s 400 meters by just one hundredth of a second at the world track and field championships but above all , i made it to san francisco in september for what looked to be a lopsided america s cup as emirates team new zealand took an 81 lead over the defender , oracle team usa it s not over it s a long way from over , said the oracle skipper jimmy spithill in the postrace news conference at that point , as we reporters suppressed laughter behind our laptops eight straight victories and a lot of revised travel plans and kiwi angst later , spithill and oracle had pulled off the undisputed comeback of the year in the year of the comeback the yachstmen , like the marathoners , had been compelled to deal with tragedy of their own when the british olympic gold medalist andrew simpson died in a training accident in may in san francisco bay his death left the survivors reeling and forced major changes on the regatta , which was being contested in new highspeed , highrisk catamarans but sailors , like bostonians and so many other humans , are a plucky lot , and though bad news knows no borders , plenty of buoyant news traveled far and wide in 2013 , too
indianapolis it is tempting to view the eastern conference finals as an upstart , unafraid team versus the greatest player of this era , lebron james but dwyane wade , another superstar , is doing what he can to elbow his way onto james s stage the pacers may not fear wade s play , but they are certainly well aware of his history with elbows not always his own the nba allowed wade to play in game 3 here after issuing him a retroactive flagrant foul1 penalty sunday afternoon the ruling followed wade s elbow to the head of lance stephenson during the fourth quarter of indiana s game 2 victory friday at sunday s morning shootarounds , it was clear that the incident at midcourt , intentional or not , had kicked up a lot of dust around a growing rivalry for the remainder of this series , which will resume here with game 4 on tuesday , dealing with james will be job no 1 for the pacers inside bankers life fieldhouse , though , wade will be public enemy no 1 it was an uncalledfor play , pacers forward paul george told reporters before the nba issued its ruling whatever the league does about that situation , for what he did to lance , it s well deserved whatever the punishment is wade did not make himself available to the news media his coach , erik spoelstra , offered a notsostirring defense of a player who has often been accused of being dirty we think it was just a play that happens sometimes during a game , spoelstra said he was scrambling that was during a very competitive time of the game he added , it was just one of those inadvertent collisions wade has been at the center of several controversial plays the last three seasons in the 2011 playoffs , a twoman scrum with the boston celtics star rajon rondo resulted in a dislocated elbow for rondo wade broke kobe bryant s nose on a hard foul in the 2012 allstar game shortly after that , in a lateseason game against the chicago bulls , wade sent richard hamilton flailing out of bounds with a twohanded shove to the chest for that , wade blamed hamilton s active elbows in last year s eastern conference semifinals , wade charged into indiana s darren collison on the dead run , sending the much smaller collison sprawling wade has been banged up himself down the stretch of his 10th season in the league , no doubt affecting his production on the court and , perhaps , souring his mood game 3 was only the third time indiana had hosted a playoff game on the day of the indianapolis 500 it was the first such massive sports day in this city since may 30 , 2004 , when the pacers lost game 5 of the eastern conference finals to the detroit pistons after buddy rice s victory at indianapolis motor speedway on may 30 , 1999 , kenny brack s win at the brickyard was followed by the pacers' game 1 loss to the knicks in the conference finals indiana went on to lose both series with the san antonio spurs holding a threegamestonone lead in the western conference finals , pacers and heat players were asked about a potential championship matchup against the spurs predictably , none bit there is not much relevant history to consider between the heat and the spurs both teams rested key starters in matchups this season the pacers , on the other hand , have a history with san antonio , the west s no 2 seed , that they would love to forget the spurs have won 12 consecutive games against the pacers their last loss , by a single point , occurred here on april 1 , 2007 perhaps of more relevance , the spurs topped 100 points in both meetings this season that should be cause for some concern given indiana s secondranked defense , which allowed 907 points per game in the regular season and was at 906 for the playoffs heading into game 3
until joe flacco came along in 2008 , being the starting quarterback of the featured all the job security of a department store santa preceding him were the likes of scott mitchell , jeff blake and steve mcnair and elvis grbac , anthony wright and stoney case there also was , for one season , a 34yearold with an average arm and ferocious intensity whose mission on sunday in new orleans will be to stop his former team from winning xlvii his name is , and he coaches the  harbaugh fashioned a solid career in 14 nfl seasons , completing the secondmost passes in chicago bears history before heading to indianapolis , where the man known as captain comeback led the upstart colts to within one play of the super bowl and was later chosen for the team s ring of honor his next stop , in 1998 , was baltimore he played 14 games he lasted 13 months he threw 12 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions the ravens lost 10 times harbaugh s tenure in purple and black , brief and unproductive , was the opposite of his older brother john s experience while steering the ravens to three afc title games in five years it was one of those years that you wish you could forget , said peter boulware , a secondyear linebacker on that 1998 team we did the best we could do , but it just was n't a fun season the season was supposed to be more than just fun the ravens , despite finishing 691 in 1997 , began the year freighted with expectations their owner , art modell , promised an elite team for the franchise s first year at what is now mt bank stadium at quarterback , the ravens were interested in upgrading from vinny testaverde , so they pursued the former buffalo star jim kelly , who was considering a return to the nfl , and harbaugh deeming kelly s contract demands too high , baltimore traded two draft picks for harbaugh , who , as it happens , punched kelly a year earlier in response to accusations that he exaggerated his injuries the trade reunited harbaugh with his coach for two seasons in indianapolis , ted marchibroda , who was entering the final year of his contract with baltimore marchibroda admired him so much that , after harbaugh was drilled out of bounds during the ravenscolts game in indianapolis in 1996 , the coach said he was more concerned about harbaugh s wellbeing than about getting the 15yard penalty that s the only time i ever got into a situation like that , marchibroda said from his home in virginia but jim was a special guy harbaugh seemed a natural fit for marchibroda s offense , which he knew well the hope was that a revamped running game , buoyed by errict rhett , fullback roosevelt potts and a strong offensive line , would create opportunities for harbaugh , who liked to improvise and throw on the run we all respected what jim had done in the league , said kicker matt stover , who became a cofounder of the players' philanthropy fund , which streamlines the charitable donation process for athletes we knew there was a marriage there , a good relationship with ted and jim , and we thought we 'd have a really good offense instead , the ravens' first game , a 2013 loss to pittsburgh , served as a microcosm of their season harbaugh was pummeled by the blitzing carnell lake in the second quarter , hyperextended a finger on his right hand , and did not return he started the next two games but failed to make it to halftime in either , yanked because of injury or ineffectiveness marchibroda replaced him with eric zeier , whose strong arm was capable of stretching defenses zeier s spell as the starter lasted a month he struggled to cope with blitzes a thumb injury knocked him out in green bay in five of their first seven games , he and harbaugh shared time the ravens were 25 it probably was n't the ideal situation for either one of us , but the way we handled it together was , zeier said never was there animosity it was always supporting who was on the field and competing to see who could win the job outright harbaugh eventually did , his best game 27 for 34 with three touchdowns coming in a 26point defeat at jacksonville that prompted modell to tell the baltimore sun that he had never been as embarrassed or as disgraced as i was last night boulware and zeier remember harbaugh as a tireless worker with a fiery temperament who did not take losing well stover praised his acumen and his passion , saying that harbaugh fit in well with his new teammates , but added that not everybody bought in and that he was n't like the fullfledged leader he related well to everybody , encouraged everyone in practice and was a good teammate to have , boulware said the tough thing was just that it s one thing to have a peyton manning in your locker room , pumping everybody up , and you know he s going to go out onto the field and be an allstar with jim , it was n't like he was going on the field and saying , follow me and play as good as i'm playing' even with baltimore at 26 , a sliver of optimism existed harbaugh , his elbow and finger injuries healed , felt healthy again a 1413 loss at san diego , in which harbaugh was sacked six times , preceded a twogame winning streak capped by a victory against the colts in their first visit to baltimore since relocating 14 years earlier afterward , harbaugh presented the game ball to johnny unitas it was the ravens' final highlight they went on to lose three straight , sealing marchibroda s dismissal their power running game never materialized they finished the season with 269 points , the fifth fewest in the league , and ranked last in first downs there is something missing here , harbaugh told the sun after the third straight loss , at chicago something is not right something is very wrong i ca n't exactly put my finger on it harbaugh did not know it then , but the ravens already had the defensive foundation for their 2000 championship team ray lewis , rod woodson and tony siragusa , among others but harbaugh was not around to enjoy it two months after the 1998 season , he was traded to san diego because testaverde played for the franchise when it was based in cleveland , it was harbaugh , in a sense , who started the pattern of rotating quarterbacks mitchell , blake and mcnair grbac , wright and case all came after him , but none exacted revenge after all these years , harbaugh can by winning a super bowl
miami florida law enforcement officials , already embarrassed by the revelation that two convicted killers were released from a state prison after forging documents that allowed them to walk free , acknowledged tuesday that they had discovered at least five previous instances of such forgeries the two most recent escapees , joseph jenkins and charles walker , both 34 and serving life sentences , were recaptured at a motel in panama city , fla , on saturday mr jenkins had tried to escape once before , in 2011 , also using fake documents , officials said gerald m bailey , the commissioner of the florida department of law enforcement , told a news conference in tallahassee that investigators had pinpointed possible suspects who may have helped mr jenkins and mr walker execute their escape plan , but that no arrests were imminent there s still a lot that we do n't know , mr bailey told reporters the investigation is being hampered by a lack of cooperation from the two inmates , he said the inmates apparently used computers in the prison s library to create the forgeries , he said , adding that they looked authentic and included case numbers and a signature that appeared to be that of a judge of the five previous cases that involved fake documents , only one led to an escape , and then only for a few hours none of those cases had been disclosed before the department and the state attorney general , pamela jo bondi , have each offered a 10 , 000 reward for information about the walker and jenkins forgeries that leads to a conviction mr jenkins and mr walker , whose forged documents asserted that their sentences had been reduced to 15 years , are being held in the orange county jail it was not clear when or if they would be returned to the franklin correctional facility in carabelle , in the panhandle , from which they were improperly released mr jenkins on sept 27 and mr walker on oct 8 both were astute enough to subsequently register as felons with the authorities elsewhere , a requirement of released convicts , further cementing the impression that their freedom was legitimately obtained the first sense that something was awry emerged when a relative of roscoe pugh , an orlando man whom mr jenkins was convicted of killing in 1998 , was informed of the inmate s release and contacted the state attorney s office to ask about it prosecutors who looked into mr jenkins s file quickly determined that its latest entries were fraudulent there was little information about mr walker s case , or how authorities learned that the two were traveling together the judge whose signature was faked , belvin perry of florida s ninth judicial circuit , which covers orange and osceola counties , told a television reporter that the forgeries were a wakeup call for the judicial system judge perry on monday ordered that judicial assistants begin logging all demands for changes to inmates' sentences and that the clerk of the courts verify with the judge or his judicial assistant whether an order was issued legitimately at the news conference on tuesday , mr bailey said investigators were particularly interested in the activities and procedures in the orange county clerk of courts office , which received the forged documents for mr jenkins and mr walker in the mail and processed them we 're going to be camping out with the clerk s office , he said an inmate named nydeed nashaddai succeeded in getting out of a pinellas county jail in 2009 by using fake release forms he was captured 16 hours later and sentenced to 20 years for escape he was then sent to the same franklin county prison from which the two most recent escapes occurred mr bailey said he did not yet know whether mr nashaddai passed along his scheme to fellow inmates like mr walker and mr jenkins another escape was thwarted in 2011 when a former orange county sheriff s office homicide detective found that release documents filed with the county clerk contained inconsistencies the orlando sentinel reported that the inmate , jeffery forbes , 30 , was serving a life sentence for attempting to kill a deputy sheriff , who was paralyzed in the shooting mr forbes , who was trying to get out of the franklin correctional facility , was charged with forgery and escape on oct 8 , the same day that mr walker was released from the prison using similarly faked documents given that mr forbes s attempt had been investigated shortly before the two most recent escapes , mr bailey was asked whether there had been carelessness in the handling of such matters , and whether word should have gone out to prison authorities and others about additional potential forgeries there was no carelessness we talked about it with 20 state attorneys in the summer , he said we 're trying to confirm whether there are more out there as for the two inmates , he said , i do n't know what talents they had , but somewhere along the line some documents that looked good were produced
east rutherford , nj justin pugh was amazed how everyone reacted in the moment pugh , a right tackle who was the giants' firstround draft pick in april , noticed that none of his teammates hesitated after center jim cordle left sunday s game against the dallas cowboys in the second quarter with a knee injury they all knew who would take cordle s place kevin boothe he just comes in to work every day , and that s something that you admire , pugh said friday last week , he took snaps at center at the beginning of practice when play resumed , boothe showed why he has been so valuable to the giants being a backup center in the nfl can be a lonely feeling especially when there is a chance you can be the reason the offense malfunctions before a play even develops that did not happen sunday , when boothe , who switched from left guard to center , helped lead the giants to their best rushing performance of the season , 202 yards , while allowing the cowboys only two sacks against eli manning still , despite boothe s efforts , the giants lost , 2421 , and fell to 47 you want the only people to realize there was a switch to be the coaches and players , boothe said you do n't want anyone in the stands to realize the switch it was a step in the right direction for us boothe is likely to start on sunday night at center against the washington redskins the giants on tuesday placed cordle on injured reserve with an injury to his patella tendon cordle is the third offensive lineman along with center david baas \( knee \) and guard chris snee \( hip \) to be lost for the season against the cowboys , boothe played a nearly flawless game no fumbled snaps no botched snaps over manning s head in the shotgun formation no individual penalties recorded you hate to see a teammate get hurt , but when there s no glitch when you switch over , that was good for us to see , to know we have that versatility on the offense line , pugh said boothe began the season at center and moved from left guard to right guard when david diehl needed surgery to repair his thumb in previous seasons , boothe has played right tackle he also played left tackle at cornell sunday will be boothe s 85th game with the giants he was acquired from the oakland raiders in 2007 boothe s durability and reliability have been a godsend to the team , coach tom coughlin said kevin gilbride , the offensive coordinator , said people undervalue boothe s athleticism , which gives him the ability to play multiple positions he kind of goes unnoticed , gilbride said he just plays solid for us it helps that he s an extremely bright person so that he can make the adjustments that not everybody can make as easily as he can we 're fortunate to have him in a lot of ways boothe remembers what it was like to be a backup before he became a starter in 2011 coughlin would dress just two backup offensive linemen , and boothe needed to learn all five positions if you 're not a starter , you have to be able to play multiple positions , boothe said you ca n't be a person that plays just one position the more you can do , the more valuable you become to your team
el segundo , calif in preparation for a third playoff game in four days , monday was a day of rest first and reflection second for the , who trail the , 20 , in the western conference finals it s taxing on the guys , for sure , it is , with all the travel they have , kings coach darryl sutter said he noted that the team had returned from chicago in the middle of the night after sunday night s 42 today , you 're just trying to get it close to full again , he said it s hard although none of the kings' regulars skated in practice , they put in work off the ice they reviewed extensive game footage in an effort to surmount their deficit as well as the offensive struggles of their marquee players the top line of anze kopitar , dustin brown and justin williams has combined for just 18 points in 16 playoff games that relative lack of production has contributed to more than half of the kings' playoff games ending in 21 scores in game 2 , sutter s club had advantages in shots on goal , shots attempted , faceoffs won , penalties drawn and hits nevertheless , seemingly every error ended up in their net as they fell behind , 40 , on the way to losing , 42 sutter said a turnaround was a matter of making small adjustments , pushing through some nagging injuries and getting more from each individual player the situation , he said , is anything but daunting to the kings we 're not a team that gets ahead of ourselves or down on ourselves or up on ourselves or listens to what somebody else says , sutter said just keep it in there , stay among ourselves , and it does n't matter if we 're up two or down two brown and williams pointed to play in the neutral zone , where the kings have generally lacked speed and puck security against the positionally sound , opportunistic blackhawks brown said an emphasis on limiting transition opportunities for the swift chicago counterattack would be critical tuesday in game 3 making them go 200 feet for all their chances will go a long way , brown said on their path to the stanley cup last season , the kings encountered no significant injuries and had their full complement of players essentially throughout the playoffs this year , the kings spent much of the season filling the void left by injuries on defense before having their formidable depth up the middle tested by injuries in the playoffs center jarret stoll missed six games of a conference semifinal series with san jose after he sustained a concussion center mike richards , the nhl s leading playoff scorer over the past three postseasons , was sidelined for game 2 with a likely concussion regardless of the truth to murmurs about the diminished health of the kings' top center , kopitar , he has been mired in a scoring funk that has challenged the kings offensively there s a lot of good components that go into being a stanley cupwinning team , and the first one is being a healthy team , williams said but good teams find ways to win through adversity and build through that richards s status remained uncertain sutter said the same questions you have are the same ones i have it s not today , it s tomorrow , it s after activity , how he reacts taking richards s lineup spot is the rookie tyler toffoli , who won the american hockey league s rookie of the year award this season he has played right wing while jeff carter has moved to center their combination with dustin penner has been potent sutter called the makeshift second line the team s best line in game 2 and praised their handling of a difficult situation scored a powerplay goal late in game 2 , the first one scored against the blackhawks in chicago in this postseason the goal was the latest in a series of plays that clearly impressed toffoli s teammates and allowed sutter to trust him with an abruptly expanded role after richards was a late scratch during game 2 warmups the kings recovered from a 20 hole earlier in the playoffs , winning four straight against the st louis blues in the first round home ice has also afforded a significant advantage the kings are 70 at staples center in this postseason they will need that trend to persist in order to avoid a 30 disadvantage , which only three teams in nhl history have overcome to win a series it s not do or die tomorrow , but it is , williams said home ice has been something that we 've been able to rely on and have in our back pocket , even though we 've struggled on the road he added it s not a rite of passage that you 're going to win at home you need to earn it , especially against this team whether we get in there and grind out a 10 victory or win by more than one goal , at the end of the day , it just needs to get done
one is german , another a new yorker of egyptian descent others are cubanamerican , colombian , dominican and argentine these are the unlikely members of mariachi flor de toloache , a new york mariachi band even more unlikely all of the band s nine members are women , the pioneers of what they believe is the city s first allfemale mariachi ensemble in 21stcentury new york city , it may not be surprising to see women popping up in what are traditionally men s roles but despite a few notable female performers , mariachi has always been , and continues to be , maledominated , though a few allfemale mariachi groups have begun to gain prominence on the west coast and in the southwestern united states it s such a macho culture , said mireya ramos , 31 , flor de toloache s cofounder and lead singer , who is half dominican and half mexican , but grew up in puerto rico listening to her mexican father s mariachi recordings and performances she recalled giving voice lessons to mexican women whose husbands would not permit them to sing in public even in america , their husbands are really like , oh , you couldn t do these kinds of things , she said ms ramos founded the band about five years ago after joining another \( male \) mariachi band , then teaming up with a few female musicians she had met performing around the city none had much , if any , experience in mariachi for some of the band s members , performing mariachi for the first time required greater effort than simply learning new songs ms ramos s cofounder , shae fiol , 34 , a halfcuban singer from oregon whose premariachi accomplishments included an original album of soul music , had to learn how to play the vihuela , a small guitarlike instrument \( other mariachi instruments are more familiar , like the trumpet , flute and violin \) ms fiol could already play guitar , so the mechanics of the vihuela were not difficult to grasp , she said , but she is still getting used to the foreign rhythms of latinstyle music the learning curve had not deterred her from agreeing to join ms ramos s mariachi experiment i think i was feeling adventurous , she said with a laugh with no formal vihuela training , she would ask every vihuela player she came across during the band s early days for tips they , and their bandmates , were all male while those mariachis were generous with help , ms fiol and ms ramos said , flor de toloache has had some skeptics , most recently when ms fiol , ms ramos and the band s guitarron \( bass \) player , veronica medellin , filmed a chapstick commercial with a short , catchy song about the lip balm a few commenters on the youtube video of the commercial decried their performance as inauthentic , with one commenter posting , in spanish , that s not mariachi ! he said the commercial was disrespectful most of the criticism focuses on the fact that they are not all mexican , rather than on their gender ms medellin is the only full mexican ms ramos is half but the other players have quickly taken to mariachi eva lou , the band s german violinist , now writes original songs for the group despite having no background in latin music most often people look at us and make an assumption because of the way we look , and maybe they project some of that onto what we re about to play , ms fiol said but when they hear us playing it s like , oh , they definitely sound legitimate their performances a concert scheduled saturday at rockwood music hall is also a fundraiser for their forthcoming album do hew to tradition in other ways alongside jazz standards , brazilian songs , outkast riffs , an adele cover and other arrangements that nod to their diverse backgrounds , their repertoire includes mexican classics like la negra , el cascabel and el rey , and they play the same instruments as other mariachi groups they say it is important to them that whatever they perform , be it a classic or an original song , they respect traditional rhythms and styles but ms ramos founded the band to be innovative , and the musicians say their diversity , and the fact that they live in new york , gives them extra license to experiment ms fiol said she thought mariachi , like other musical genres that migrated north , was in the process of evolving we re surrounded by so many different cultures and so many different kinds of music , we just feel , culturally , like we can do it , she said we re a mix of backgrounds , musically and ethnically , nationally we like to display all that and why not \? and why not embrace their femininity , too , as with the name ms ramos chose \? toloache is a kind of poisonous night flower that , according to tradition , has been used in central america for love potions for centuries appropriate , ms ramos thought , since three of the band s original members were recovering from painful breakups at the time of the band s founding a friend suggested she add flor , flower , for a further feminine touch when it came to their costumes , however , ms ramos and ms fiol made a counterintuitive choice pants , the traditional male mariachi attire , black and ornamented with metallic hardware , which ms ramos s mother and the musicians sewed themselves their reasoning was not entirely what you might think they said they found the men s wear more flattering than the long skirts female mariachis normally wear still , ms ramos said she got a small , subversive thrill from donning a costume like the one her father used to wear wearing the suit , it s kind of empowering , she said you re like , i can wear this suit , too this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
april 8 is holocaust remembrance day \( yom hashoah \) , which marks the anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising on the hebrew calendar students and teachers will find many ideas for learning about the holocaust on our special resource page , which includes this year , the 70th anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising , we add one more idea to use contemporary reporting in the new york times itself as a lens for thinking about what the press was reporting at the time and why it was reporting it that way through this investigation , students can better understand the answers to some of the broader questions they so frequently ask during any study of the holocaust what did americans know about the holocaust while it was going on \? and why didn t the united states do more to end the holocaust , or at least to rescue its victims \? they can also learn about both the power and the limitations of journalism doing a search of holocaust coverage in the times is not an easy task after all , the term holocaust was not used by the press until later  as an alternative , start by having students read an article by max frankel , the executive editor of the times from 1986 to 1994 , published prominently in the the times s 150th anniversary edition on nov 14 , 2001 in 150th anniversary 18512001 turning away from the holocaust , mr frankel calls the holocaust reporting by the times and other media the century s bitterest journalistic failure here is an excerpt and then there was failure none greater than the staggering , staining failure of the new york times to depict hitler s methodical extermination of the jews of europe as a horror beyond all other horrors in world war ii a nazi war within the war crying out for illumination the annihilation of six million jews would not for many years become distinctively known as the holocaust but its essence became knowable fast enough , from ominous nazi threats and undisputed eyewitness reports collected by american correspondents , agents and informants indeed , a large number of those reports appeared in the times but they were mostly buried inside its gray and stolid pages , never featured , analyzed or rendered truly comprehensible yet what they printed made clear that the editors did not long mistrust the ghastly reports they presented them as true within months of hitler s secret resolve in 1941 to proceed to the final solution of his fantasized jewish problem why , then , were the terrifying tales almost hidden in the back pages \? like most though not all american media , and most of official washington , the times drowned its reports about the fate of jews in the flood of wartime news its neglect was far from unique and its reach was not then fully national , but as the premier american source of wartime news , it surely influenced the judgment of other news purveyors students should read the entire article then , if time allows , they should read some of the original articles that mr frankel discusses , like the one headlined extinction feared by jews in poland \( pdf \) on page 28 of the march 1 , 1942 , paper after the class finishes its investigation , students should discuss the following questions and to this day the failure of america s media to fasten upon hitler s mad atrocities stirs the conscience of succeeding generations of reporters and editors it has made them acutely alert to ethnic barbarities in faroff places like uganda , rwanda , bosnia and kosovo it leaves them obviously resolved that in the face of genocide , journalism shall not have failed in vain do you agree with this conclusion \? do you think the times and other media outlets are aggressively covering current human rights tragedies unfolding around the world \? how do you think the decline of print newspapers and the nightly national news broadcasts , along with the rise of digital media and 24hour news channels , might affect current and future coverage \? going further if students want to study the topic of holocaust coverage in the times in greater depth , they can read the following two pieces then , students can use these two sources to contribute additional insights to the above discussion questions
washington despite years of differences on how to approach the terrorist threat , obama administration officials said monday that the american authorities investigating the bombings were working effectively with their russian counterparts and that they hoped the experience would usher in a new era of cooperation on counterterrorism since the bombings three weeks ago , , the russian president , and have spoken twice on the phone and pledged deeper cooperation in a striking sign of collaboration on the investigation , russian intelligence officials have taken the extraordinary step of sharing secret transcripts of a phone call they intercepted in which they learned that tamerlan tsarnaev had extremist beliefs , according to united states law enforcement officials on the logistics and communications to facilitate what the fbi is doing , we have seen a very cooperative russian government , because they understand we have a common interest in getting the full details in this investigation , said a senior united states official like other officials , he would not speak on the record about the continuing criminal investigation relations between the countries have been strained over the sharply differing american and russian views on syria , whose embattled president , bashar alassad , has enjoyed support from moscow just days before the marathon bombings , the obama administration from traveling to the united states and froze any assets they had in the united states in response to perceived human rights violations , notably the treatment of sergei l magnitsky , a russian lawyer whose death in prison has been widely denounced in both countries and the cooperation on boston stands in contrast to the experience of the united states and russia in recent years on other counterterrorism matters , in which collaboration has often been hampered by miscommunication , sluggish bureaucracies and mistrust between intelligence services , which have prevented extensive information sharing in 2011 , the russian authorities provided a warning to the fbi and cia that mr tsarnaev had changed drastically , embraced radical islam and planned to travel to russia to join underground groups despite repeated requests from the bureau for more information , however , none was provided only after the bombings did russian officials inform the fbi about the phone calls and provide the transcripts because the 2011 warning concerned an ethnic chechen , american officials initially saw any possible threat as being directed at russia , which they said may have lent less urgency to the issue by many accounts , the russian authorities kept close tabs on mr tsarnaev when he spent six months in dagestan , and they knew he had been trying to meet with militants , but when he returned to the united states , the russians sent no new warning to their american counterparts there was no message or implication that this was our problem , one senior american law enforcement official said thomas de waal , an expert on the caucasus region at the , said that in addition to recent strains , we 're talking about russian security agencies that are the heirs of the kgb , whose whole existence was predicated on suspicion of the us he added , these are two of the world s largest security bureaucracies , each with its own internal feuds among agencies so it is unrealistic to expect them always to work seamlessly together against terrorism , he said the differing perspectives on the threat have been an obstacle to deeper cooperation we 're focused on pakistan , yemen , somalia and the sahel they 're focused on the north caucasus , one former american official said a few chechens and others have made it into in south asia , and we are always worried about the radicalizing churn in chechnya and dagestan but there is not much basis for a deeper collaboration , because much of that churn is caused by russian human rights violations of the local population such views have long infuriated mr putin , who considers the crushing of chechnya s independence movement in two wars since 1994 to be a victory over international terrorism , not against a people seeking the right to selfdetermination since mr putin came to power , the united states and many european countries have granted asylum to chechens who fled the wars i have always felt outraged when our western partners , as well as your colleagues from the western media , referred to our terrorists who committed brutal , bloody , appalling crimes on the territory of our country as insurgents , ' mr putin said in a televised town hall meeting on april 25 , in which he was asked about cooperation after the boston bombings they were hardly ever referred to as terrorists they provided assistance to them , information support , financial and political support sometimes directly and sometimes indirectly referring to his counterparts in the west , he added we always said that they should n't make empty declarations that terrorism is a common threat , but make real efforts and cooperate with each other more closely but now these two criminals have provided the best possible proof that we were right
london this month , johnson johnson is facing over an artificial hip that has been recalled because of a within five years mistakes happen in medicine , but internal documents showed that executives had known of flaws with the device for some time , but had failed to make them public it would be nice to imagine that this kind of behavior is exceptional , but in reality , the entire evidence base for medicine has been undermined by a casual lack of transparency sometimes this is through a failure to report concerns raised by doctors and internal analyses , as was the case with johnson johnson more commonly , it involves the suppression of clinical trial results , especially when they show a drug is no good these problems would be bad enough on their own , but they are compounded by a generation of fake fixes that have delivered false reassurance , and so prevent realistic public discussion the best evidence shows that half of all the clinical trials ever conducted and completed on the treatments in use today have never been published in academic journals trials with positive or flattering results , unsurprisingly , are about twice as likely to be published and this is true for both academic research and industry studies if i toss a coin , but hide the result every time it comes up tails , it looks as if i always throw heads you would n't tolerate that if we were choosing who should go first in a game of pocket billiards , but in medicine , it s accepted as the norm in the worst case , we can be misled into believing that ineffective treatments are worth using more commonly we are misled about the relative merits of competing treatments , exposing patients to inferior ones this problem has been documented for three decades , and many in the industry now claim it has been fixed but every intervention has been full of loopholes , none has been competently implemented and , lastly , with no routine public audit , flaws have taken years to emerge the is the most widely cited fix it required that new clinical trials conducted in the united states post summaries of their results at , or face a fine of but in 2012 , the published the , which found that four out of five trials covered by the legislation had ignored the reporting requirements amazingly , no fine has yet been levied an earlier fake fix dates from 2005 , when the international committee of medical journal editors their members would never again publish any clinical trial unless its existence had been declared on a publicly accessible registry before the trial began the reasoning was simple if everyone registered their trials at the beginning , we could easily spot which results were withheld and since everyone wants to publish in prominent academic journals , these editors had the perfect carrot once again , everyone assumed the problem had been fixed but four years later we discovered , in , that the editors had broken their promise more than half of all trials published in leading journals still were n't properly registered , and a quarter were n't registered at all even if these fixes had been successful , we would still be decades away from knowing the full truth about our medical treatments , because today s decisions are informed by the trials of the past , on drugs that were first researched and approved in 2007 , 2002 , 1998 and earlier none of the reforms has even tried to ensure public access for these results , and so they remain buried in dry storage archives , deep underground all of these problems are perhaps best illustrated by the case of tamiflu , which governments have spent billions of dollars stockpiling , in the belief that the drug will reduce the rate of complications from influenza but roughly half the trial results have never been published , and researchers trying to obtain the full clinical study reports have been by the manufacturer , roche this cannot be acceptable withholding data not only misleads doctors and patients it s an insult to the patients who have participated in clinical trials , believing that they were helping to improve medical knowledge medicine routinely overcomes enormous technical challenges , and there is nothing complicated about the changes needed to prevent johnson johnson , or roche or anybody from withholding information the fda has to its systems for assessing artificial hips and a campaign , supported by the national physicians alliance , has begun at demanding that results be publicly reported for all trials , dating back to at least the 1990s , on all treatments currently in use we need competent legislation , enforcement and leadership from medical academic bodies , all clearly stating that nonpublication of trial results is nothing less than research misconduct this will take place against a clamor from industry stakeholders they have worked hard to silence discussion on these problems , by pretending that the flaws have already been fixed why \? because this strategy is their only hope there is no defense for withholding information on treatments used by patients around the world
the blogospheric debate about microfoundations , saltwater freshwater and all that has , i think , been illuminating among other things it s serving almost as an oral history of what really happened minus the oral part , but not mediated by the usual slowness and overthinking of formal publication and i think the intellectual history is useful , because it gives you some idea of how people came to make the choice of which side to be on it s certainly possible to make the case for an eclectic , fairly salty approach on general principles , as simon wrenlewis , noah smith , and nick rowe do but the abstract logic gains force when you recall how it actually happened oh , and i was there not as a participant in the growing macro war , but as a student at the time the great divide was taking place i felt the seduction of the microfoundationsuberalles doctrine , but also got to watch as the demand for microfoundations , originally grounded in appeals to empirical power , became freefloating , a dogma to be defended in the teeth of the evidence so , if you had to choose a beginning , it would be the famous phelps volume the papers in that volume all started with two observations , of which the first was that there was overwhelming evidence for some kind of shortrun nonneutrality of money none of the papers in that volume questioned the proposition that nominal shocks had large real effects you can see why if you look at annual changes in nominal versus real gdp between 1950 and 1970 obviously there was a near onetoone correspondence obviously , too , it was really hard in that era , with its lack of major supply shocks , to tell a story in which real gdp was driving nominal spending rather than vice versa so the phelps volume began with the stylized fact that in the short run nominal demand , driven for example by changes in monetary policy , gets reflected largely in quantities rather than prices but as the papers also observed , it was hard to explain that fact in terms of standard microeconomics with everyone acting rationally , money should have been neutral even in the short run traditional keynesian analyses simply said that people aren t completely rational , that they have money illusion or maybe that contracts are focal points in which nominal wages or prices matter because of salience , even though they should be arbitrary but these were ex post rationalizations rather than being derived from some kind of fundamentals so the phelps crowd came up with a lovely story you see , it was all about information individuals and firms couldn t tell , in the very short run , whether a rise in the price they were being offered represented a shock specific to them people for some reason wanted more of their widgets or a general change in demand it was rational to respond to an idiosyncratic rise in demand by producing more , so confusion could explain why shortrun aggregate supply seemed upwardsloping as phelps and others \( including milton friedman , who was thinking along similar lines \) realized , this meant that the apparent tradeoff between unemployment and inflation would be unstable sustained inflation would get built into expectations , and would no longer produce low unemployment the stagflation of the 70s seemed to confirm this prediction , and brought the microfoundations project immense prestige encouraged by all this , freshwater economists gleefully proclaimed keynes dead , the subject of nothing but giggles and whispers but here s the thing after that initial success , phelpslucas type microfoundations quickly collapsed both intellectually and empirically intellectually , the problem was that rational individuals simply should not have been confused in the way the models demanded there s too much information out there , whether in newspapers or in asset prices you just couldn t get a lucas supply curve out of a model looking even vaguely like the real economy empirically , the problem was that slumps last too long even if you wave away the information problem , confusion about aggregate versus idiosyncratic shocks can last for quarters , maybe , but not years so the truth was that microfoundations in macroeconomics had its moment , but failed utterly at the one thing it was sold , above all , as being able to do namely , give a better explanation of why nominal shocks have real effects time , you might think , to reconsider the project and some did there was a revival of keynesian thinking in the late 70s and early 80s , albeit one that tried to cram as many microfoundations into the models as possible without being grossly unrealistic but many economists had so committed themselves to the idea that keynes was dead and rationality roolz that they simply dug in deeper rationalitybased microfoundations must be right if their microfoundations couldn t explain why nominal shocks have real effects , then nominal shocks must not have real effects it s all real shocks and so real business cycle theory was born so now we have people debating whether models with microfoundations lead to better predictions , both of the future and of policy impacts , than models with ad hoc elements as wrenlewis and smith say , this is by no means obvious if the microfoundations are wrong , as they often clearly are but what you want to realize is that this isn t going to convince the microfoundations crowd after all , more than thirty years ago they decided that the joy of microfoundations trumped the utter failure of microfounded models to work in practice , and they have now trained successive cohorts of students in this view there are , it s true , some hints of a guilty conscience as matt yglesias points out , there s the odd tendency of freshwater types to immediately accuse anyone with saltwater ideas of being dishonest \( i m not a nice guy , but if look at what i said about , say , cochrane , it was that he was ignorant , not corrupt \) oh , and the notion that there had been a convergence of views by 2007 , which was then ruptured by the crisis , was a saltwater delusion people like olivier blanchard convinced themselves that the other side was listening it wasn t the hysterical reaction to the notion that fiscal policy is effective at the zero lower bound demonstrated that the freshwater types had never bothered to learn the least thing about how new keynesian models worked so there s a lot of history here but the main driver behind this history was , i believe , the inability of many economists to accept the fact that they took a wrong turn

the choice is not between violence and nonviolence but between nonviolence and nonexistence martin luther king jr we are steeped in violence this past week was of course a searing reminder monday s bombing at the boston marathon and the ensuing manhunt that ended on friday with the death of one suspect and the capture of another , his brother , dominated the news but there were other troubling , if less traumatic reminders , too on tuesday , a 577page report by the constitution project concluded that the united states had engaged in torture after the sept 11 attacks on wednesday , a turning point in the heated national debate on gun control was reached when the united states senate dropped consideration of some minimal restrictions on the sale and distribution of guns looming above all this is the painful memory of the mass killing at sandy hook elementary school now is as good a time as any to reflect on our responses to the many recent horrors that seem to have engulfed us , and to consider whether we can hope to move from an ethos of violence to one nonviolence facing ourselves squarely at this difficult moment might provide a better lesson for the future than allowing ourselves to once again give in to blind fury we might begin by asking the question , who are we now \? clearly , we are a violent country our murder rate is three to five times that of most other industrialized countries the massacres that regularly take place here are predictable in their occurrence , if not in their time and place moreover , and more telling , our response to violence is typically more violence we display our might or what is left of it abroad in order to address perceived injustices or a threat to our interests we still have not rid ourselves of the death penalty , a fact that fills those in other countries with disbelief many of us , in response to the mindless gun violence around us , prescribe more guns as the solution , as the republicans sought to do during the gun debate and we torture people it is as though , in thinking that the world responds only to violence , we reveal ourselves rather than the world why is this \? how has the united states become so saturated in slaughter \? there are , of course , many reasons , but three stand out , one of which is deep and longstanding and the others of more recent vintage the deep reason lies in our competitive individualism americans are proud of our individualism , and indeed it is not entirely a curse to believe that one has a responsibility to create oneself rather than relying on others for sustenance has its virtues no doubt many of the advances scientific , technological and artistic that have emerged from the united states have their roots in the striving of individuals whose belief in themselves bolstered their commitment to their work however , the dark side of this individualism is a wariness of others and a rejection of the social solidarity characteristic of countries like denmark , sweden , new zealand and , at least to some extent , france we make it , if we do make it , but we do so alone our neighboring citizens are not so much our fellows as our competitors the second reason is the decline of our ability to control events in the world we might date this decline from our military failure in vietnam , or , if we prefer , more recently to the debacle in iraq in any event , it is clear that the united state cannot impose its will as it did during much of the 20 th century we live in a different world now , and this makes many of us insecure we long for a world more cooperative with our wishes than the one we now live in our insecurity , in turn , reinforces our desire to control , which reinforces violence if we cannot control events in the world , this must be a result not of our impotence or the complexity of the world s problems but of our unwillingness to man up and so we tell ourselves fairy tales about what would have happened if we had committed to victory in vietnam or bombed one or another country back to the stone age the third reason is economic the welfare state has been in decline for more than 30 years now the embrace of classical liberalism or neoliberalism erodes social solidarity each of us is an investor , seeking the best return on our money , our energies , our relationships , indeed our lives we no longer count on government , which is often perceived as the enemy and we no longer have obligations to those with whom we share the country , or the planet it is up to each of us to take our freedom and use it wisely those who do not are not unlucky or impoverished they are simply imprudent competitive individualism , insecurity , neoliberalism the triad undergirding our penchant for violence this , as much as anything else , is the current exceptionalism of america others are not our partners , nor even our colleagues they are our competitors or our enemies they are hardly to be recognized , much less embraced they are to be vanquished what would the alternative , nonviolence , look like \? and what does it require of us \? we must understand first that nonviolence is not passivity it is instead creative activity that activity takes place within particular limits to put the point a bit simply , those limits are the recognition of others as fellow human beings , even when they are our adversaries that recognition does not require that we acquiesce to the demands of others when we disagree rather , it requires that our action , even when it coerces the other \( as boycotts , strikes , sitins and human blockades often do \) , does not aim to destroy that other in his or her humanity it requires that we recognize others as fellow human beings , even when they are on the other side of the barricades this recognition limits what we can do , but at the same time it forces us to be inventive no longer is it a matter of bringing superior firepower to bear now we must think more rigorously about how to respond , how to make our voices heard and our aims prevail in a way it is like writing a shakespearean sonnet , where the 14line structure and iambic pentameter require thoughtful and creative work rather than immediate and overwhelming response to recognize someone s humanity is , in perhaps the most important way , to recognize him or her as an equal each of us , nonviolence teaches , carries our humanity within us that humanity cannot always be appealed to in some cases , as with the tragedy at sandy hook , it can even become nearly irrelevant however , in all but the most extreme cases nonviolence summons us to recognize that humanity even when it cannot serve as the basis for negotiation or resolution it demands that we who act do so with a firm gaze upon the face of the other it demands the acknowledgment that we are all fragile beings , nexuses of hope and fear , children of some mother and perhaps parents to others that is , no more and no less than fellow human beings in a world fraught with imponderables can we do this \? are we capable at this moment of taking on the mantle of nonviolence \? the lessons are already there in our history the civil rights movement is perhaps the most shining example of nonviolence in our human legacy after 9 11 , after hurricane katrina and hurricane sandy , and now , in the immediate ontheground responses to the boston bombing , americans pulled together with those they did not know in order to restore the web of our common existence we are indeed violent , but we have shown flashes of nonviolence , that is to say moments where our competitive individualism , our insecurity , our desire for the highest return on our investment of time and money , has been trumped by the vividness of the likeness of others granted , these are only moments they have not lasted but they teach us that when it comes to nonviolent relations with others , we are not entirely bereft what would it require for these lessons to be become sedimented in our collective soul \? there is much work to be done we must begin to see our fellow human beings as precisely that fellows they need not be friends , but they must be counted as worthy of our respect , bearers of dignity in their own right those who struggle must no longer be seen as failures , but more often as unlucky , and perhaps worthy of our extending a hand those who come to our shores , whatever our policy toward them , must be seen as human beings seeking to stitch together a decent life rather than as mere parasites upon our riches those who are unhealthy must be seen as more than drains upon our taxes but instead as peers that , but for good fortune , might have been us none of this requires that we allow others to abdicate responsibility for their lives nor does it require that we refuse , when no other means are available , to defend ourselves with force instead it calls upon us to recognize that we , too , have a responsibility to more than our own security and contentment it commands us to look to ourselves and at others before we start casting stones would this end all senseless killing \? no , it would not would it substitute for the limits on guns that are so urgently needed \? of course not while the recently rejected limits on guns , however timid , might have provided a first public step toward the recognition of the requirements of our situation , our task would remain to create a culture where violence is seen not as the first option but as the last , one that would allow us to gaze upon the breadth of space that lies between an unjust act and a violent response the philosopher immanuel kant said that the core of morality lay in treating others not simply as means but also as ends in themselves nonviolence teaches us nothing more than this it is a simple lesson , if difficult to practice especially so at a moment like this when our rage and grief are still raw but it is a lesson that has become buried under our ideology and our circumstances we need to learn it anew learning this lesson will not bring back the life of the martin richard , krystle campbell or the other murdered victims in boston it will not return to health those who were injured on that day it won t bring back trayvon martin or the children of sandy hook but it will , perhaps , point the way toward a future where , instead of recalling yet more victims of violence in anger and with vows of retribution , we find ourselves with fewer victims to recall todd may is class of 1941 memorial professor of the humanities at clemson university , and the author of , most recently , friendship in the age of economics he is currently working on a book on the philosophy of nonviolence
in its first month of business , california s insurance exchange enrolled more people than any other staterun exchange and more than the federal exchange serving 36 states , which has been paralyzed by technological failures about 2 , 000 people are enrolling in private health plans daily through california s exchange , officials there said , a rate that has picked up considerably over the last few weeks peter v lee , executive director of the exchange , said 30 , 830 people in california had enrolled in plans in october and 29 , 000 more enrolled through nov 9 in addition , mr lee said , more than 72 , 000 residents have been deemed eligible for medicaid under an expansion of the program that is taking place in california and many other states as part of the federal health care overhaul  we re very pleased with our numbers , mr lee said during a news conference in sacramento the word of a positive experience is quickly spreading in all , 26 , 794 people enrolled in private plans through the federal exchange between oct 1 and nov 2 , according to the obama administration in texas , which has a higher percentage of uninsured residents than any other state , only 2 , 991 people enrolled california was one of the first states to start building an exchange and has been aggressive in publicizing it to potential customers still , covered california , as the exchange is known , is far from its goal of signing up at least 500 , 000 people who qualify for federal subsidies to buy private coverage by march 31 , when the sixmonth open enrollment period ends of about 31 , 000 people who signed up for private plans in october , only about 4 , 850 , or 16 percent , qualified for subsidies to help with premium costs none of the enrollees have necessarily paid their first month s premium , which is not due until late december they could still change their minds and decide not to enroll after all coverage is to begin on jan 1 california did not release demographic details about the enrollees , like where they live and how old they are some demographic data will be announced at a meeting of the exchange board next week but mr lee acknowledged that so far , a disproportionate number of enrollees are older folks with health conditions we re going to see that shifting in dramatic ways as we go through november and december , he said , adding that as younger , healthier people understand how easy it is , when they understand the cost , they re also going to be signing up
brian c rosenberg is the president of , a private liberal arts institution in st paul as a college president and a college parent , i have become more than a little familiar with college visits i spend a lot of time thinking about how my own campus appears to prospective students and their families and , as a father who has shepherded two sons through the college search process , i have also learned to experience the campus visit as a potential customer all of this has taught me some important lessons about campus visits which i d like to share with you few people would even consider buying a house or a car sight unseen selecting a college is a financial decision of comparable or greater weight , and a life decision of far more consequence printed materials from colleges are more or less the equivalent of the glossy brochures prepared by car manufacturers , in which every vehicle is powerful , efficient and gorgeous rely on them exclusively at your own risk always check in at the admissions office , preferably to take part in a tour and information session your campus visit would be incomplete without it for colleges , a campus visit is the most important sign that an applicant is seriously interested , and there are times when that expression of interest can make the difference between acceptance and rejection all colleges prefer to admit students who are likely to accept their offers of admission one of the great frustrations to all of us who promote colleges and one of the dangers of which to be aware is the extent to which your campus experience can be shaped by a single person the student tour guide all of us want guides who are articulate , enthusiastic and charming an impressive guide can be an important indicator of the quality of a school just remember the guide is one student out of two or 10 or 30 , 000 you might get lucky and be led by a guide who shares your passions and clicks with your personality , or you might be a musician who gets a tour guide who is majoring in chemistry and who has never set foot in the fine arts building much of this is chance if your tour guide fails to impress , try talking with a few other students to determine if you were just unlucky only by asking questions during the tour and information session can you ensure that you will learn what you need to about the college you are visiting since most prospective students are horrified by the prospect of their parents speaking in public , one solution to this problem is for the student and the parent to join different tour groups that way , each can ask questions without fear of the other s judgment never leave a campus without answers to these two questions the single greatest inefficiency in the american higher education system is the percentage of students who never complete their degrees it would be best if you were not one of them if students are leaving after freshman year , or failing to graduate in large numbers , you should ask why and factor that knowledge into your college choice colleges will attempt to choreograph your visit carefully , highlighting the information , programs and locations that show the institution in the best possible light in addition to participating in the scripted tours and information sessions , you should try to experience life on a campus in its more natural form eat in a dining hall attend a class talk to students lounging on the grass most students are happy to talk about their college and if they are not , that should be a pretty serious warning sign if you are deeply serious about a college , see if you can arrange an overnight stay , which \( for better or worse \) allows for the most unscripted experience of all every prospective student who visits a campus should leave being able to identify at least two or three ways in which that college is different from the others they are considering those differences should go beyond the obvious things that can be learned from a college guide sometimes the difference will be made clear in an information session or tour sometimes you will have to dig deeper what departments are students genuinely excited about \? how does the college connect to the surrounding community \? are there programs that are not offered at other places \? from where do most of the students come \? the answers to questions like these will be the things that actually determine whether or not a college is the right fit for you none of these steps is an absolute prerequisite for making a good college choice , but each helps increase the likelihood that you will someday love your college enough to be well , perhaps , a tour guide
halle , germany when karamba diaby arrived in germany as a student from senegal he knew only two things in german bundesliga and bmw the professional soccer league and the automobile manufacturer the only hitch was that it was october 1985 and mr diaby had landed in east germany , where comrades frowned on both west german capitalist institutions they were n't too fond of hearing that in the east , said mr diaby , 51 they told me , we do n't say bmw here , we say trabi , ' the nickname for the rickety yet ubiquitous east german car , the trabant the bland , greasy food in east germany was a far cry from the spicy cuisine of his native senegal , where his sister used to cook his favorite dish , thiebou dien , a paellalike preparation made with fried okra , yams and fish but he stuck it out to the fall of the berlin wall and the reunification of germany , making a home for himself here in saxonyanhalt state and becoming a german citizen in 2001 now to make history himself he placed third in the social democrats' state primary in february to earn a coveted spot on the party s parliamentary list if mr diaby and the social democrats can defend the three seats they won here four years ago , he would become the first black member of the bundestag in german history around halle , a former hub for east germany s chemical industry , mr diaby is renowned for his extroverted personality , which bears no trace of teutonic reserve , and for his loquacity his loud , cackling laugh is immediately recognizable , and his accent blends both the regional dialect here and his francophone african roots people here like to joke that mr diaby takes five times as long as other people to get anywhere because he stops to talk to everyone he meets along the way an outdoor may day festival this year on halle s central square was no exception mr diaby was chatting with constituents in a long brown jacket buttoned all the way up , a red carnation pinned to his collar in one hand he held a chocolate chip muffin that remained halfeaten for hours , he was so absorbed in shaking hands and greeting voters the fact that germany has never voted a black man into parliament is an indication of the sometimes armslength relationship germany has with its minorities it was n't easy for him at the beginning , said klaus magyar , 77 , a retired hospital director from halle who spoke with mr diaby at the festival people were n't used to someone with a different skin color the former east germany is still at pains to shake its reputation for being a breeding ground for farright extremism the farright national democratic party has seats in two state legislatures in the former east and none in the former west in 2011 , an ultraconservative newspaper published a story accusing mr diaby of unilaterally calling for stricter laws against hate speech while he was the head of germany s federal council on migration and integration the report was inaccurate , but pictures of him in traditional senegalese garb known as a began circulating in internet forums along with the words the black dictator he received hundreds of angry emails and two death threats , including one over the phone he no longer wears his boubou out in public mr diaby grew up in a small town in southwest senegal called marsassoum where children played soccer on dirt roads and many of the town s 5 , 000 residents subsisted on raising livestock or harvesting crops , like peanuts and maize the youngest of four children , mr diaby had lost both of his parents by the time he was 7 , leaving his older sister , who is 17 years his elder , and her husband to raise him as a boy , mr diaby worked in his brotherinlaw s fields and rode his bike to neighboring towns to collect money that was owed to his family in 1974 , when he was 13 , he left home for boarding school in nearby s dhiou where he began the seventh grade four years later , he moved to kaolack to attend the lyc e gaston berger , a high school that , like many institutions in senegal in the 1970s , bore a french name by the time he got to college in the capital , dakar , in 1982 , the university students were pushing to rename many institutions after prominent senegalese who had fought for independence in 1960 we were the ones who were always trying something emancipatory , mr diaby said of himself and his university friends in an interview after the may day rally it was through his political engagement in dakar in the early '80s that he came into contact with a leftwing student organization in prague that encouraged young people from around the world to study behind the iron curtain mr diaby applied for a scholarship the application was divided into two columns , mr diaby recalled on the lefthand side he checked off desired destinations bulgaria , czechoslovakia , russia , hungary and east germany on the righthand side , subjects agriculture , hydrology , electrical engineering and chemistry then one day in 1985 , a telegram arrived karamba diaby accepted university stop , it read register herder institute , leipzig october 2 stop after mr diaby had completed nine months of language training in leipzig , he was to be sent to a less prestigious technical college while the other students , all of whom were from socialist countries , had secured spots at a nearby university that s unfair ! mr diaby complained to administrators there s no such thing as unfairness in socialism , an administrator told him you 'll have to call it something else mr diaby arrived in halle on july 6 , 1986 , to study chemistry at the university there but remained engaged in student politics as the head of the international student committee when a fellow exchange student was denied access to the student lounge because he was a foreigner , mr diaby again complained i told them that what they were doing was racist , mr diaby said they told me no there s no such thing as racism in socialism you 'll have to call it something else' the certainty of life behind the iron curtain gave way to widespread insecurity after the fall of the wall with so many people suddenly out of work , mr diaby was not even sure that he would be allowed to finish his studies but he found a topic for his phd , one that combined chemistry and advocacy a real estate investor from the west wanted to raze the small private gardens on the edge of town and develop the property the developer claimed the gardens were polluted , the soil too toxic for agriculture but mr diaby conducted his own chemical analyses of the earth , water and air he scraped together dirt samples and sopped up groundwater to take back to his lab while his outofwork neighbors were busy manicuring their small plots on the edge of town in the neat , green spaces , he met janitors and engineers , security guards and university professors there was even a former conductor with the old east german state railroad company , the reichsbahn that was when i gathered the most insights into their society , their conditions , mr diaby said mr diaby s work helped disprove the claims that the gardens were contaminated , shortcircuiting the developer s plans people here still remember how the young chemist from senegal tried to protect one of the few things that had survived the turbulent transition period it also set him on a path away from science and deeper into activism and politicstoday , mr diaby works in the state labor ministry and is a member of the city council in halle analysts say that the chances are good that mr diaby will represent the people of saxonyanhalt in the parliament in berlin , but he does not want to leave anything to chance that is why he was out on may day , talking to people he knew and introducing himself to people he did not not only voters in halle but all of germany , especially the african community , are watching me , mr diaby said they 'll ask , is he just here to have his picture taken or does he actually have something to say \? '
tampa , fla bumps and bruises are part of being a catcher , but the thing that really bothered the prospect austin romine last year , and left him a step behind francisco cervelli and chris stewart in the race to be the ' starting catcher , was not as noticeable two bulging disks in romine s back hampered him from late february until midjuly , when he began a rehabilitation assignment in tampa set to play his first full season for class aaa scrantonwilkes barre , romine instead appeared in only 31 games across three minor league stops , batting 243 with 4 home runs and 15 runs batted in considered the top defensive catching prospect in the yankees' farm system , romine has yet to prove he can hit well enough to hold a major league job although manager joe girardi and general manager brian cashman expect romine to begin the season in scranton , girardi said thursday that romine could still beat out cervelli and stewart , neither of whom is mike piazza , or even jorge posada , at the plate when you look at the two guys who are the frontrunners , none of them put up huge offensive numbers , girardi said so when you start comparing him to them , if his defense is as good as it s supposed to be , maybe there s not as big a gap offensively as you think whoever wins the job might wind up the yankees' weakesthitting opening day catcher since 1990 bob geren , now the mets' bench coach , batted 213 over 110 games that season although cervelli has batted 271 in parts of five major league seasons , his career has been strewn with bad timing and bad luck three times he sustained a significant injury in spring training a fractured left foot in 2011 , a concussion in 2010 and a broken right wrist in 2008 last year the yankees demoted cervelli to scranton out of camp because stewart , just acquired from san francisco , was out of minor league options cervelli stayed there until being called up in september cervelli spent the first day of workouts explaining how his name turned up on a document connected with an antiaging clinic near miami that is suspected of supplying performanceenhancing drugs to major league players cervelli said he consulted with the clinic director anthony bosch for his foot injury but received no treatments or supplements \( on thursday , cervelli clarified an earlier statement that suggested he purchased major league baseballapproved supplements from the clinic cervelli said he got them elsewhere \) i 've been with the yankees 10 years already , said cervelli , who signed with the yankees in 2003 this is my dream since day 1 , to be the starting catcher i'm doing what i know , having fun , doing things right , and then they decide what they have to do the defensiveminded stewart , 30 , is in his second tour with the yankees he is a career backup with a 217 lifetime average in six seasons last season , he batted 241 in 55 games behind russell martin barring a trade , stewart , with no options left , must stick after romine s abbreviated season , the yankees need him to play , so he probably cannot be the backup no doubt he got robbed of atbats , and we would like to make it whole , the yankees' assistant general manager , billy eppler , said so romine will either start or go back to class aaa i 've been coming from behind my whole career , said romine , who was stuck behind jesus montero , a more powerful hitter , until montero was traded to seattle last year there s always been somebody in front of me , and it always pushes me to work that much harder at least romine is healthy it took almost two months and a trip to the back specialist robert watkins in california before romine s condition was properly diagnosed in april watkins then sent romine to randy bauer , a wellregarded physical therapist in laguna hills , calif , whose clients have included the soccer star julie foudy , the olympic figure skating medalist sasha cohen , and the beach volleyball star karch kiraly bauer recommended an exercise and stretching program for romine s tight hamstrings and weak stomach muscles he s a magician , romine said i felt immediately better after seeing him for a month romine begins each day with a 45minute regimen to strengthen his core muscles he also changed his diet , dropping 13 pounds to 215 after swapping fast food for salads with chicken and other proteins vegetables he never liked much , like carrots , are now staples i 've got the salad down pat now , he said there s so much you can do , and it still tastes good to eat healthy i ate some foods that taste terrible , but i found some stuff that works for me girardi , a former catcher , has always liked romine s soft hands , ability to block balls in the dirt , and smart pitchcalling i think he is a better receiver than i was , he said , and i think he 'll hit more home runs than i did but how soon \? romine made up some missing atbats in the arizona fall league , although he hit only 222 with 6 rbi still , girardi is not disregarding him all of a sudden , sometimes , it just clicks and you think he s ready now , he said that is what romine is counting on i'm trying to tie their hands up here , like , we 've got to give this to romine , he had a great spring , and he worked hard , romine said that s my plan
the had logical reasons to pair the pieces it performed in its concert at carnegie hall on wednesday evening , symphony no 7 \( toltec \) and oceana both are substantial statements by wellknown , popular living composers both deal with latin american culture , though in disparate ways and , on the evidence offered here by the chorale with the conductor james bagwell , the american symphony orchestra and other guests , both works recall stronger efforts by these important , distinctive composers for those enamored of mr glass s iconoclastic formative years , and for those who think of him chiefly as a prolific writer of operas , the notion that he now has a historically resonant nine symphonies \( and counting \) to his credit might seem strange the point is also easily forgotten , since none of those symphonies have been encountered especially frequently after their initial spurt of performances his seventh commissioned by the national symphony orchestra as a 60thbirthday tribute to its music director at the time , leonard slatkin , who conducted its premiere in january 2005 reflects mr glass s interest in the toltecs , a mesoamerican culture that flourished in mexico between ad 700 and 1100 the work s three movements represent a trinity derived from toltec beliefs linking man , nature and spirit from the subtle , sighing melodic cells and bonedry percussive rattles that open the first movement , the corn , mr bagwell provided the rhythmic tautness that mr glass s orchestral music requires , and balanced elegant woodwind and brass exchanges carefully the chorus , added in the second movement , the sacred root , provided a voluptuousness akin to that heard in ravel s daphnis et chlo the finale , the blue deer , recycles upholstered with rhythmic choral lines and robust organ climaxes taken alone , this was stark , dramatic music , boldly punctuated with long , expressive silences in context , though , it felt like what it was a segment composed in an earlier style , awkwardly grafted and anticlimactic mr golijov , no stranger to , wrote oceana in 1996 for the oregon bach festival commissioned to write a work in the spirit of bach s cantatas , mr golijov selected texts from pablo neruda s cantos ceremoniales , setting them in an alternation of harmonically piquant choral passages and freer sections for a jazz vocalist , accompanied by the rhythms and instruments of latin american popular music if that formula sounds familiar , it s because mr golijov went on to apply much the same to his pasi n seg n san marcos , the still astonishing st mark s passion setting he wrote in 2000 \( , including new york student musicians , on march 10 , as part of mr golijov s current residency \) though revised by mr golijov in 2004 , oceana pales in comparison with its stronger successor , not least in a final chorus that outlasts its efficacy still , mr bagwell and his players did well by the piece , with stylish contributions from the solo vocalist , biella da costa , and fine work by the manhattan girls chorus

the world is full of roman catholics who long ago stopped following the dogma , doctrine and medieval sexual dictates of the church but they never lost faith in francesco , the merchant s son who spoke to wolves , slept on dirt floors and dined with lepers that the new pope would take the name of francis , in honor of the saint from the umbrian town of assisi , is the most radical first move by a pontiff in some time the 12th century mystic is the nature saint , patron of the environment , the poor , the dispossessed he did not believe in owning money or property , let alone shoes and for all of that , he was never a selfrighteous grump he was fun , a quality not always found in saints , as joan acocella wrote in the new yorker earlier this year secularists from san francisco \( yes , it s named for him \) to paris may shun everything that the church teaches but keep statues of francis in the garden , preaching to birds in a popular culture dominated by showy vulgarians like donald trump , granting a global stage to someone named for a halfstarved ascetic could be transformative and therein lies the conflict , and the potential for much positive power nearly half the world lives on less than 2 a day , and a billion people are without safe drinking water by the philosophy of st francis , the church of rome would not spend its days lecturing people about condoms and condemning homosexuals there would be no secretive obsession with protecting the organized crime network built around pedophile priests humility would be a guidepost the stories of the new pope cleaning the feet of aids patients in his native argentina and disparaging fellow clerics for refusing to baptize the children of unmarried mothers show just how much the energies of the vatican bully pulpit could be redirected in francis s day , the poor lived shunned lives in the malarial shadows below the sunwashed hill towns of italy , while bishops and cardinals resided in gaudy splendor at the same time , the church launched one of its violent purges of heretics in europe in a single day , 20 , 000 people were slaughtered what would jesus think \? francis knew violence , and he knew wealth he had gone to war with nearby perugia as a young man , a party animal with family money captured , he spent a year in a ratinfested cell after release , he was a changed person , stripping himself of his clothes at the feet of his father he was dutybound , he said , to follow the gospel of helping the least among them and he had that feel for nature , a view of the interconnectedness of all living things , similar to the spiritual world of many native american tribes fire was a brother , as was the moon , the stars and physical pain the many biographies tell of birdpreaching episodes and charming a wolf on wednesday this week , as birds alighted on the chimney of the sistine chapel just minutes before the white smoke appeared , many a catholic sensed a franciscan moment francis also reached out to the muslim world , traveling deep into north africa on a mission that should have gotten him killed and , in this day , would be condemned by conservatives of his own faith though francis of assisi is the most popular saint in a long history of tortured bodies and souls , the fact that no pope until cardinal jorge bergoglio would take his name says a lot about the timeless shadow from the 12th century to the 21st the legacy of the first francis is almost too much to bear today , on the spine of assisi , where pilgrims jostle with peddlers of all things francis , you see the extraordinary giotto frescoes inside the basilica , a narrative of the saint s life that such a magnificent structure was built over the bones \( interred beneath the floor of the lower church \) of a man who often slept without a roof over his head is a testament to how a powerful movement can be coopted but another legacy , far removed from marbled ostentation , can be found in the franciscan priests who try to follow the example of their founder when my young nephew was murdered by gunfire a few years ago , it was soothing that a man in the brown robes , sandals and roped belt of the franciscan order conducted the most humane of funeral masses pope francis is a jesuit , an order known for its rigorous intellectual tradition they were disbanded in 1773 by a pope who didn t like their politics and were restored by popular demand in 1814 the jesuit influence is another reason to hope that reform is in the early spring air of rome it may be too much to expect that this new francis will be devoutly inspired by the old francis he follows the repressive dogma on sex and gays , and there remain questions about his role during argentina s dirty war , a time of unholy alliances between the church and staterun terrorism joseph stalin famously wondered how many divisions the pope had none , of course the real power of the papacy is its moral force for good reason , the former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said pope john paul ii was instrumental in bringing an end to the cold war with a visit to a slum in rio de janeiro , a hospital in the south bronx or a stroll up an umbrian peak , pope francis can claim a mantle from a pauper who still changes lives , eight centuries after his death
gen richard s ewell of the confederate army was frustrated and angry on the afternoon of july 1 , 1863 , the first day of the battle of gettysburg the cause of his grief was robert e lee , who had just issued a confusing order that forced ewell to reconsider whether he should carry out an important attack what he did next may have arguably decided the battle , and certainly became one of the most controversial series of events of the entire war lee s army of northern virginia had unexpectedly encountered george meade s army of the potomac at gettysburg that morning , and a battle no one expected sucked in reinforcements from both sides ewell s corps , which consisted of two divisions under robert rodes and jubal early \( a third was on its way \) , had rushed in from the north , smashing the union s right flank and sending the enemy fleeing back through gettysburg at approximately 3 30 pm , the union survivors took refuge south of town on cemetery hill , where gen winfield scott hancock boldly decided to make a stand what happened next became one of the civil war s most enduring controversies gettysburg s first day marked the third consecutive victory ewell had enjoyed since taking over the corps from the fallen stonewall jackson a west point graduate , mexican war veteran and seasoned frontier officer , ewell was a bit eccentric , cursed liked a sailor and had recently married his first cousin \( for whom he had pined for decades \) he became one of the first confederate officers wounded in the war when he got shot in the shoulder in an early skirmish , and he lost a leg at the battle of groveton after a mini ball shattered the bone ewell s promotion to corps command was popular with the men , for he was a competent officer , and on july 1 he acted as stonewall jackson reincarnated , making bold that left the enemy broken and bewildered with hancock digging in , ewell had to consider a number of things before making his next move although victorious , his corps had suffered approximately 3 , 000 casualties , leaving him with about 8 , 000 men under arms the charge into gettysburg had also left ewell s two divisions badly disorganized , and there were thousands of prisoners that had to be rounded up and secured the third division , under edward johnson , was rushing to the scene , but no one knew when it would arrive weighing heavily on ewell s mind were orders issued by lee instructing his corps commanders not to bring on a general engagement in pennsylvania until his army , which was scattered across southcentral pennsylvania , had concentrated when ewell arrived at gettysburg , a p hill s corps was already fighting desperately , so these orders were a moot point but now the enemy was defeated and the battle was essentially over until he heard otherwise , ewell had to assume lee s original instructions were again in effect as ewell rode into gettysburg , one of lee s aides , maj walter h taylor , arrived with orders to take the high ground south of town if possible lee had seen the enemy reforming on cemetery hill and wanted them dispersed quickly before they fortified their position this message relieved ewell , because it seemed to supersede lee s previous order not to bring on a general engagement he met with generals rodes and early to discuss the situation both officers urged an immediate attack , but only if lee could provide infantry support on their right ewell agreed and dispatched capt james p smith to lee with their request while waiting for an answer , ewell and early rode out to get a closer look at cemetery hill what they saw was sobering at least one union brigade and 40 cannons were visible , and there could be more infantry and artillery positioned out of sight behind the hill s crest smith shocked ewell when he returned with lee s reply to the request for help lee informed him that he had no troops with which to support an attack on cemetery hill , and that ewell should use his own discretion he was to attack the high ground if it was practicable but then , to add to the confusion , lee reiterated his previous order not to bring on a general engagement until the rest of the army had arrived this contradiction put ewell in a dilemma based on what he had seen firsthand , cemetery hill could not be taken without serious fighting and a major commitment of troops to follow lee s first order to take the hill would require him to disobey the second not to bring on a general engagement frustrated , ewell decided that culp s hill might be a more suitable target reportedly undefended and situated just to the east of cemetery hill , its occupation would threaten the yankees flank and might force them to abandon cemetery hill without reigniting a major battle he decided to make the attempt as soon as johnson s fresh division arrived before long , general johnson rode into gettysburg and informed ewell that his men were only a mile away , but that it would take some time for them to reach town because a supply train was blocking the road unwilling to wait , ewell turned to early and asked if he could take culp s hill , but that usually combative general snapped that his command had been doing all the hard marching and fighting and was not in condition to make the move johnson took offense at this remark after all , his men had been marching for days and the two bickered until ewell told johnson to halt when he reached gettysburg and wait for further orders after an exhausting 25mile march , johnson s division staggered into gettysburg as the sun was setting instead of ordering johnson immediately to culp s hill , ewell asked rodes opinion of his plan rather oddly , rodes simply shrugged and said that johnson s men were tired and footsore and that he did not think it would result in anything one way or the other early , who seemed to have regained his fighting spirit , disagreed and advised ewell , if you do not go up there tonight , it will cost you 10 , 000 lives to get up there tomorrow ewell then ordered johnson to advance and take culp s hill if it was still unoccupied \( rebel scouts somehow failed to discover that union forces were already moving onto the hill \) sometime before daylight he sent an aide to johnson to repeat the order ewell retired that night believing that he controlled culp s hill , but he found out in the morning that johnson had stopped short and never occupied the crucial high ground fortune frowned on ewell from the moment he rode into gettysburg while he could have cut the discussion short by ordering his reluctant generals to advance immediately upon cemetery hill , it is questionable whether his few thousand exhausted and disorganized men could have dislodged hancock ewell realized the importance of the high ground , but he was not going to risk his men in a rash attack asking lee to provide infantry support was the prudent thing to do , but lee refused even though he had two divisions with him this , and lee s insistence that he not bring on a general engagement , forced ewell to focus on culp s hill , instead ewell acted somewhat indecisive once johnson arrived , but when neither rodes nor early seemed up to the task , he quickly sent johnson forward inexplicably , that general failed to carry out his orders none of these events received much attention during the war in his report of the battle , lee only briefly touched on the subject when he wrote , general ewell was instructed to carry the hill occupied by the enemy if he found it practicable , but to avoid a general engagement until the arrival of the other divisions of the army which were ordered to hasten forward he decided to await johnson s division but it did not reach gettysburg until a late hour it was not until after the war , and lee s death , that lost cause supporters sought to explain how the infallible general could have been defeated at gettysburg gettysburg was the largest battle of the war , and it came to be seen as the conflict s turning point in the minds of many , if lee had won at gettysburg , the south would have won the war confederate veterans like john b gordon , isaac trimble and randolph h mckim insinuated in their postwar writings that it was ewell s timidity that had cost lee the victory mckim s 1915 article in the southern historical society papers was particularly damning here then we find still another of general lee s lieutenants , the gallant and usually energetic ewell , failing at a critical moment to recognize what ought to be done , he wrote had the advance on cemetery hill been pushed forward promptly that afternoon we now know beyond any possible question that the hill was feebly occupied , and could have been easily taken , and meade would have been forced to retreat walter h taylor , lee s former aide , sided with the antiewell faction in his memoir four years with general lee taylor wrote that ewell voiced no objection to the order he brought from lee to take the high ground if possible , and that he returned to lee under the impression ewell would attack taylor also claimed that he asked general johnson after the war why ewell didn t press his advantage that afternoon johnson assured me there was no hinderance sic to his moving forward but that , after getting his command in line of battle , and before it became seriously engaged or had advanced any great distance , for some unexplained reason , he had received orders to halt not everyone sided against ewell maj campbell brown , ewell s stepson and aide , observed that the discovery that this lost us the battle is one of those frequentlyrecurring but tardy strokes of military genius of which one hears long after the minute circumstances that rendered them at the time impracticable , are forgotten and while taylor s story became an important part of the controversy , brown was adamant that he never brought such orders in an 1885 letter to gen henry jackson hunt , the former chief of artillery for the army of the potomac , brown wrote , i say broadly that col taylor s account of this battle is utterly worthless that he carried no such order to gen ewell and had no such conversation with gen edw d johnson i do not impugn his veracity but his memory has been trusted and has deceived him brown s claim to the contrary , taylor probably did deliver the order , but johnson s known activities that day contradict what he supposedly told taylor it was after dark when johnson moved toward culp s hill in his gettysburg report he simply said that he advanced northeast of town late that night , formed a line of battle and had the men sleep on their arms ewell did not order him to halt in fact , ewell went to bed thinking johnson had taken the hill for whatever reason , it was johnson who made the decision to stop short of his goal in his letter to hunt , brown also raised the most important question that no one wanted to consider if taylor was correct about lee urging ewell to take cemetery hill as soon as ewell rode into gettysburg , why didn t lee take action when ewell failed to do so \? lee was with a p hill s corps a short distance away and was within sight of the hill is it credible , brown asked , that lee would \( if he attached the importance that taylor seems to intimate , to the possession of cemetery hill \) halt the troops under his own eyes wait two or three hours in full sight of the troops of ewell hill both , while the former was disobeying a vital order , without taking steps to have himself obeyed \? no taylor carried no such order , ewell disobeyed none and evaded none brown asked hunt , is it not plain that if it was a mistake not to attempt cemetery hill that afternoon , the mistake was lee s rather than ewell s \? ewell was assuredly right not to try it with his command alone whether lee ought to have ordered all forward at once , is another question entirely , and one on which i do not feel competent to offer an opinion worth your reading while most of ewell s former colleagues were critical of him after the war , some officers left accounts of gettysburg that supported his decisions armistead l long , lee s military secretary , was one who believed ewell acted correctly lee sent long on a personal reconnaissance , and long claimed that he found cemetery hill occupied by a considerable force in my opinion , an attack at that time , with the troops then at hand , would have been hazardous and of very doubtful success after making my report , no mention was made of a renewal of the attack that evening gen winfield scott hancock , who commanded the union troops on cemetery hill , also believed his defenses would have held against any rebel attack that afternoon , he sat with gen carl schurz on a stone fence on cemetery hill watching the enemy through binoculars hancock told schurz that with the artillery he had on hand he was confident he could hold out until more help arrived he seemed even more confident when he sent a report to general meade at 5 25 pm we have now taken up a position in the cemetery , he wrote , and cannot well be taken whenever the ewell controversy is discussed today , it is popular to ponder the intriguing thought of stonewall jackson surviving chancellorsville and leading his corps at gettysburg some officers and men even speculated on it at the time it has been argued that the great stonewall would have stormed up cemetery hill , defeated the yankees and won confederate independence the problem with this scenario is that no one can predict which jackson would have ridden into gettysburg it is always assumed it would have been the brilliant stonewall of the shenandoah valley , but it could very well have been the jackson of kernstown in that battle , he rashly attacked a superior enemy force without proper reconnaissance and was defeated or it could have been the stonewall of the seven days , where he twice failed to carry out his orders and caused lee to miss opportunities to strike a decisive blow against the enemy it might even have been the jackson of fredericksburg , where he scouted out the enemy s position in preparation for a counterattack when jackson saw the large number of union cannons across the rappahannock on stafford heights , he changed his mind the sight of thousands of yankees and dozens of cannons on cemetery hill might well have led him to make the same decision at gettysburg if so , would jackson have been made a scapegoat for lee s defeat , instead of ewell \? follow

the start of training camps this week cannot come soon enough for the after last season was filled with compelling story lines like the return of peyton manning , and the emergence of robert griffin iii and colin kaepernick , the offseason has been marked by owners , frontoffice personnel and players having runins with the law the news included allegations of drunken driving , questionable business practices and , most infamously , murder it has highlighted not only the underside of the socalled nfl family , but also the intense scrutiny that comes with being the nation s largest and most popular sports league the offseason developments also reflect the unintended consequences of the league s push to become a 365day business with events spread throughout the year in years past , the news media might have been too distracted by basketball , hockey , baseball and golf to have spent much time writing about football in the spring and summer that seems like a distant memory when an array of sportsfocused news outlets make the nfl the subject of exhaustive coverage no matter the season i do n't think has had a quiet offseason , said robert a boland , who teaches sports management at new york university the more we know about pro athletes , the more we put them under a 365day microscope , the more misbehavior will be captured on a camera phone the nfl has dealt with negative stories before in 2007 , after a spate of highprofile incidents that included michael vick s pleading guilty to a federal felony charge stemming from his involvement in a ring , the league made a series of commercials highlighting the good citizenship of some of its players this year , however , the offthefield questions seemed to multiply take the most dramatic occurrence this offseason , the murder charges filed against aaron hernandez , the former new england patriots tight end his arrest in june prompted a number of other story lines , including whether nfl players were more prone to being arrested geraldo rivera speculated that the league essentially had a gang problem the patriots were criticized for not doing more to vet their players the team s efforts at damage control , including putting out a mea culpa by its owner and allowing fans to return hernandez jerseys they had purchased , were also widely reported it did not help when patriots defensive back alfonzo dennard was arrested and accused of driving drunk after he was sentenced to 30 days in jail and 2 years of probation for assaulting a police officer in april from the beginning of the summer and the start of training camp , there s a lot of down time , and there might be a tendency for more of the negative issues to crop up in the press , said bradley shear , who teaches sports management at george washington university and was a lawyer for the nfl players association the last five , six years , there are a lot of negative stories about the players it s the nature of the beast while acknowledging the seriousness of the hernandez case , the nfl , citing fbi statistics , said that only about 2 percent of the league s nearly 3 , 000 players have been arrested , compared with 10 percent for the general population of males 20 to 34 league officials and sports industry experts noted that the nfl had had its share of bad offseason stories before last year , it was the league s prosecution of the new orleans saints' bounty system , which began in march , a month after the super bowlsaints coach sean payton and the team s defensive coordinator , general manager and assistant head coach were suspended , as were four players appeals followed , and the players' suspensions were ultimately reduced , which had hosted the then the league locked out its officials for the start of the season , a move criticized by players , coaches and fans in the spring and summer of 2011 , the owners locked out the players , putting the season in jeopardy lawsuits were filed mediators intervened players were outraged fans chewed their nails ultimately , the season began on time the negative headlines this offseason have had the effect of crowding out notable business announcements in june , for instance , the league renewed its deal with verizon wireless , which will provide more game coverage and the red zone channel , as well as access to prime time sunday games starting in 2014 , to fans who subscribe to nfl mobile the deal is worth 1 billion the league also signed a 400 million deal with microsoft , which will develop technology that will allow coaches , players and referees to use tablets on the sidelines teams are also boosting wifi signals in their stadiums and putting cameras in locker rooms so fans at the game can have exclusive views not available on television underscoring the league s growing value , globally included 30 of the nfl s 32 teams there s never been a better time to be associated with the nfl if you 're a fan , a player or corporate america , brian mccarthy , a league spokesman , said rob tilliss , who brokers team sales at inner circle sports , said that just as stories about the business of the nfl were understandably overshadowed by more dramatic news this offseason , all of the news during the offseason will be overshadowed once the regular season begins since you 're the most popular sport in the country , you have incredible media attention , media exposure , voracious fans , he said you put all that in the mixer , there s a lot of interest while the hernandez case has been the league s biggest challenge , it has had to confront other thorny topics in april , agents from the fbi and the irs raided the headquarters of pilot flying j , the family business of truck stops and convenience stores run by jimmy haslam , the owner of the cleveland browns a month later , lawmakers in florida declined to vote on a series of tax breaks that would have helped the dolphins renovate their stadium , essentially scuttling miami s bid to host super bowl l or li a deal to refurbish the edward jones dome in st louis fell through , a blow to the rams in may , , the owner of the washington redskins , urging him to change the team s name and other leagues not to help the federal government publicize the affordable care act in court , a federal judge ordered a mediator to get the league and the more than 4 , 000 retirees who accuse the nfl of deliberately hiding information about the effects of concussions , to try to settle their differences given the potential damages that could result from an extended lawsuit , just getting the sides to talk across a conference table can be counted as a positive step for the nfl none of that is what the league wants to talk about instead , it wants to talk about

saratoga springs , ny the three ogden phippses wandered up and down the shedrow thursday , as they do most mornings the patriarch , ogden mills phipps , 72 , was steering a golf cart his 5yearold grandson and namesake , however , moved a whole lot quicker , allowing his grandfather to catch up only when he stopped to pet the nose of a racehorse the names were not only the same , but so was the scene this is what the phippses do on summer vacation in 1940 , the elder phipps , known as dinny , was the towheaded boy darting between impeccably bred thoroughbreds and a staff headed then by the trainer sunny jim fitzsimmons fortyfive years later , his son ogden , or little o , was the one who brought a little boy s frenetic energy to this serene corner of the oklahoma training track here but thursday was even more joyous than usual the phipps stable s big horse , orb , had galloped a strong mile and a quarter the news was not as good friday , as orb s rider , joel rosario , sustained a broken bone in his left foot in a spill his status for saturday is uncertain in may , rosario and orb gave the family its first kentucky derby victory , and on saturday , in the 144th running of the travers stakes , the phipps family is hopeful that orb can deliver the midsummer derby to them as well he s dead fit , dinny phipps said of the colt he bred and coowns with his cousin stuart janney iii he had worried that the rigors of the triple crown had taken too much out of orb the colt followed his derby victory with a disappointing fourthplace finish in the preakness and then staggered home third in the belmont instead of keeping the colt in new york , however , the family s trainer , shug mcgaughey , suggested they send him to fair hill in maryland , a leafy europeanstyle training center with some new age accouterments , like a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber and a cold saltwater spa he needed time to be a horse , phipps said , and he put about 80 pounds on and has come back looking great the family has won the travers before with buckpasser in 1966 , easy goer in 1989 and rhythm the following year but when you have spent nearly a century chasing bloodlines and trying to build a better racehorse , there is no such thing as too many trips to the winners' circle , especially in what has been the backyard of what is now four generations of phippses the more things have changed here , the more they have stayed the same the trees that sunny jim planted alongside the barn here when dinny was a boy now reach far above the rooftop and whistle in the wind the smell of bacon still wafts from the kitchen that looks out on the courtyard and has fed generations of phippses sunny jim may have been followed by shug , but the emphasis on patient horsemanship remains the grazing grounds are as manicured as the fairways of augusta national , and the lush blankets that the horses don when their work is finished look as if they came from bergdorf goodman but the family does not chase big races unless it believes it has a horse that can win that is the reason the family has saddled only 11 derby starters and why orb was its first since easy goer ran second to sunday silence in 1989 like his father , ogden phipps , and his grandmother , gladys mills phipps , dinny has bred and raced champions but what he is most proud of , he said , is how the love of horses has been passed down to another generation a phipps family summer is not complete without a pilgrimage here they all come back , said phipps of his 6 children and 24 grandchildren they appreciate all of this it is a family pastime that is run like a business , an expensive one that requires more than 4 million a year to maintain broodmares , raise the foals into racehorses and pay stud fees for the right to mate their mares to the finest stallions none of that mattered , however , when 5yearold ogden was on his hands and knees looking for the baby bird that had skittered under the golf cart it held his attention , until it did n't you ready for breakfast \? dinny phipps asked his grandson yes , said the boy what you want \? pancakes , he said , knowing it was one of his grandfather s favorites how many \? six , the boy said and bolted for the kitchen
ted cruz of texas has been in the senate for all of a month , but has already compiled an impressive voting record , according to the washington times he is the only senator who has been on the losing side of every vote he has taken this term , a zerofor11 record that means he s been against john kerry s confirmation as secretary of state , against suspending the debt ceiling for three months , and against modest changes to the senate s filibuster rules he even voted against aid to victims of hurricane sandy mr cruz s perfect record slightly surpasses those of three other tea party icons , who tied for second mike lee of utah , tim scott of south carolina , and marco rubio of florida \( they all voted to confirm mr kerry \) you might think he d feel a little embarrassed by this selfmarginalization , or worry that texas voters will start to realize how far out of the mainstream he really is but naturally , mr cruz is proud of himself senator cruz promised the voters of texas he would take principled stands when it comes to fiscal responsibility and protecting america s sovereignty , his spokesman , sean rushton , told the newspaper he didn t come to washington to make friends he came to help save the country senator cruz is proud of his votes and will continue to stand up for america and the constitution the trajectory for this kind of thinking , however , is pretty clear after a while , it s frustrating to find oneself on the losing side of every vote in 2011 , house members who felt as mr cruz does formed hardright coalitions to demonstrate their will , and pressured republican leaders to take harder stances on fiscal and social issues in the senate , members have a special power to hold things up , and the more frustrated they get , the more they start to use it so inevitably , mr cruz will start holding up bills , standing in the way of needed spending , and blocking nominations based on his churlish treatment of chuck hagel at last week s confirmation hearing for the top job at defense , mr cruz may try to filibuster mr hagel s nomination \( senators have tried to mount filibusters against cabinet nominees before , but none have succeeded \) individual senators can create a great deal of mischief if they believe they are destined to singlehandedly save the country it s a good thing he didn t come to washington to make friends
grand forks , nd late in his second practice with canada s women s hockey team thursday , coach kevin dineen gathered his players inside the blue line and introduced a contest the forward lines , the defensemen and the goalies nominated someone from each group to shoot at the opposite goal first group to miss had to skate a lap hard the point \? nothing more than a tension release it was one week after dan church had stunned the team by resigning as coach less than two months before the olympics , a development neither he nor hockey canada , the sport s national governing body , has fully explained dineen , a former nhl player and coach , sensed that his players , after a stressful week , could use a smile hence , the contest each group found the net until goaltender genevi ve lacasse fired wide , sending three chagrined goalies down the ice while their teammates laughed and howled dineen s debut behind the canada bench at ralph engelstad arena on friday did not go as well canada lost to the united states for the second time since church resigned , and the game ended with a melee ten fighting majors were issued , and six players from each team occupied the penalty box at the final horn the game , which ended 41 , was not the first time these neighbors and rivals had mixed it up a fight broke out during an october game after jocelyne lamoureux of the united states ran into canada s goalie shannon szabados although the players remain puzzled by church s departure , they embraced dineen , who brought instant credibility and calm to a reeling team i think it was a challenging week for us , probably more so than we realized it was going to be , said jayna hefford , a fourtime olympian and threetime gold medalist you have someone with you that s been with you for so long , invested so much in this process , was so passionate about what they 're doing when dan left , it was a shock to all of us there was n't a lot of closure there after a few days , once they named kevin as a new coach , for our team that was a chance to move forward now we 're excited we 're looking towards sochi we 're looking towards building over the next six weeks to being there church was coaching at york university in toronto when hockey canada entrusted him with the olympic team , two months after he directed canada to the 2012 world championship it is not a job for the timid canada had won the last three olympic tournaments after finishing second to the united states in 1998 the position comes with the understanding that any medal besides gold is a catastrophe i do n't miss it , said melody davidson , canada s coach through the previous two olympics cycles before stepping down to become general manager troublesome signs emerged as early as january , when church s father , david , died of liver cancer at 70 it shook church , but he continued canada lost to the americans , 32 , in the world championship final in april but bounced back to win the four nations cup in november and sweep the first three games of the sixgame united statescanada series that usually precedes the olympics canada traditionally plays up to 30 games against midget aaa boys' teams as part of its olympic preparation worn down by injuries and too many road games , canada struggled in the series , going 1214 and losing 6 of 7 in november that was the month church cut defenseman tessa bonhomme , a veteran of the 2010 games and four world championship tournaments , and forward jenelle kohanchuk , 23 , who scored twice against finland in the four nations title game we were very tired at that point in the season , said caroline ouellette , the team captain , who is a threetime gold medalist things were not going so well but in an amateur sport , you rarely see a coaching change we did n't expect it i think that was the most difficult thing , the shock of having to react and manage that , because we 're not used to that like the nhl players are church resigned dec 12 , hours before canada lost to the united states , 51 , in calgary , alberta , with the assistant coaches danielle goyette and lisa haley filling in several players said they never saw it coming on dec 10 , church wrote on twitter that to seeing the former york player kaylee black , a high school coach in moorhead , minn , at friday s game church told the toronto globe and mail that he was not forced out it came down to a confidence issue and if you do n't have the confidence of certain people , it s probably time to move on , he said , without identifying anyone davidson offered an equally murky explanation in the end , dan was presented a lot of different decisions and made a decision to leave , she said friday we moved forward from there asked what those decisions entailed , davidson said normal team things what direction you want to go , what do you want to do , how do you want to use players \? there was a lot of discussion around all of that ouellette said it was really a stressful time we did n't know who was going to step in and be our coach the players kicked around names but none thought of dineen , who was fired by the florida panthers in november dineen , a former center , played in the 1984 olympics for canada and went on to score 355 goals in 19 nhl seasons before turning to coaching he landed the florida job in 2011 after six seasons with portland in the american hockey league looking for work , dineen called bob nicholson , hockey canada s president , a few days before church quit , offering to coach the 2014 men s world championship team nicholson put dineen off when church left , nicholson thought of dineen , whose only experience coaching women came with his teenage daughter hannah s select team in maine several years earlier \( hannah is now a freshman hockey player at colby college \) i'm a product of hockey canada , said dineen , whose father , bill , coached in the world hockey association and the nhl i 've always felt very strongly about that maple leaf to be able to wear that on the front of the jersey , there ca n't be anything more special than that last tuesday , his first day on the job , the players tried to be helpful by taping their names to their helmets at practice at the team christmas party that night , to test him , several players suggested that he distribute the presents he got a little bit nervous because he realized he was n't going to be very good at giving out the gifts , hefford said we made him do the assistant coaches , which he got 100 percent on dineen must now make final cuts and tighten a lineup that has been outscored in its last two games against the united states by 92 missing from those games because of injury were hayley wickenheiser , a fourtime olympian , and mariephilip poulin , who scored both goals in canada s 20 victory over the united states in the 2010 olympic final the teams meet twice more before sochi , saturday in st paul and dec 30 in toronto we have some skill out there , dineen said it s a team that was up and down i'm looking for some more consistency out of this group there are some areas that we can address and kind of get more in sync than we are right now most of all , he must soothe concerns and find solutions with a gold medal at stake , smiles at practice go only so far
in our journalism and our conversations , we tend to talk about things in isolation , focusing on what s happening right now and failing to connect the dots the present outrage becomes our complete obsession the countless frustrations that telegraphed it fade from view so it is with the shutdown of the federal government , which we could and should have seen coming which we did see coming , more or less the shutdown is n't a new story it s the same story as the demise of sensible gun control legislation , even after newtown , which was supposed to change everything it s the same story as the stalling of immigration reform it s all one cancer , sprouting tumors of various sizes the mass we 've been staring at over the past week just happens to be bigger and uglier than the ones we beheld in the buildup our federal government does n't work , at least not the congress , not the way it should if we 're going to preserve and pass on the treasure and blessings that were bequeathed to us , not the way it should if we 're going to strut around ceaselessly congratulating ourselves on how exceptional we are we 're exceptional all right , in that we ca n't summon the will , discipline or character to fix even those problems that most of us would like to see addressed how many americans doubt that our infrastructure is inadequate and leaves us at a serious global disadvantage \? few , but for all our handwringing , little gets done we 're exceptional in the that we pour into elections all those commercials , air miles , speechifying and tweeting and for what \? we 've spent a fortune on sclerosis , a king s ransom on dysfunction then again , the money is a big part of the problem in america your hobbyhorse can be a lonely , mangy one finance it generously enough and it has secretariat s stride we 've let passion overtake reason the recipe for disaster in all the greek and shakespearean tragedies we read back in school the tragedy is now us it matters less in american politics today if your cause is just or your logic sound than if you can raise a telegenic ruckus , if you 're enamored enough of your own voice to say whatever brings a microphone its way that s the moral of ted cruz , who has behaved amorally here he was reportedly savaged in a meeting of senate republicans on wednesday at last , some hopeful news it s no wonder they got riled their party has become a big , hot , selfdestructive mess , and the chief reason is its inability to sideline the wacko birds , like cruz , who increasingly rule the roost the shutdown has merely added a new chapter to this narrative and raised a fascinating question by resorting to hardball and trickery to kill or maim obamacare , has the party given the program its best shot at survival \? obamacare made its debut last week with so many that portions of its federal web site were going to be closed for repairs for some of this weekend navigating it was like trying to score tickets to the stones , as jake tapper said late friday on cnn his comment joined a loudening drumbeat of complaints about the program s flaws i wonder whether it will attract as many healthy young americans as it must when they crunch the coverage numbers premiums and deductibles versus the penalty for not signing up some may take a pass and remain uninsured what s happening so far is unclear as the week ended , the administration was n't providing any meaningful numbers on enrollment , engendering suspicion in many observers but none of that was the big news that it might have been , because everybody was rightly thundering about the shutdown instead it was prompted , of course , by the cruzled demand that obamacare be defunded or delayed , which was never going to happen what was achieved instead was the diversion of public attention from the program s shortcomings you want to talk , senator cruz , in terms of seussian breakfast foods \? for your hammy 21hour soliloquy , you have egg on your face but regardless of how obamacare in its initial phase fares , and regardless of many voters' disappointment with the president s overall job performance , an american who wants to register his or her upset at the ballot box may feel that there s no attractive alternative to democrats , no palatable way to switch allegiance to the party that opposed the new health insurance because what that party did last week was affirm how thoroughly it had been hijacked by its extremist wing what that party did was further sully its brand polls show widespread misgivings about obamacare , but that a sizable majority of americans via shutdown or debtceiling threat polls also show that the current impasse is inflicting on the gop so what the republican party is doing with obamacare is turning a window of political opportunity into a grave , and the party s cooler heads know it as in the times , nearly a year after a second consecutive and decisive presidential loss , the rebranding effort that almost every top republican called crucial has been set aside or obscured by the wrangling with mr obama the elders are exasperated , but the toddlers run the show the party is in the same bind as the country , unable to overcome the obstructionists some reasons for that are n't easily tackled as cruz s reading of supportive tweets during his soliloquy demonstrated , social media can give politicians the impression of a bigger cheerleading section than actually exists , of more wind at their backs than they really have that s unlikely to change but the sort of gerrymandering that has created situations like pennsylvania s , where obama won 52 percent of the 2012 vote but the house delegation has 13 republicans to 5 democrats , can and must be eliminated through political reforms like the drawing of congressional districts by nonpartisan commissions , not by political hacks voters should take their disgust with this shutdown and turn it into a fierce , sustained push for a better , fairer system because the system s the problem the system s the illness we justly congratulate ourselves on what the framers of our constitution set up , but that does n't mean we 're set forevermore it definitely does n't mean we 're in a healthy place now and i worry that on top of everything else , we 're growing so accustomed to our sickly lot that we 're losing sight of its direness for all our recurrent brinkmanship , we have n't tumbled into any abyss so as we find ourselves on the next cliff , in the next crisis , we trust that john boehner will snap into action at the last minute that democrats will eventually cave that this , too , shall pass it might , because it s just a symptom the disease , though , does n't go away
there was a lot of sunny talk about common ground and shared goals when the four budget leaders of the house and senate met on thursday to prepare for the big negotiation to come a joint conference committee has until middecember to construct a 2014 budget and prevent another shutdown in january , and the leaders worked hard at sounding optimistic it s going to be a challenge but we believe we can find common ground , said patty murray , democrat of washington and chairwoman of the senate budget committee that hope isn t widely shared , however , and not just because of the miserable success rate of similar efforts one of the biggest problems is that two republican leaders of the joint conference paul ryan of wisconsin , chairman of the house budget committee , and jeff sessions of alabama , ranking member of the senate committee both voted against the deal that reopened government and prevented a default think about what that means a day later , the treasury would have run out of borrowing authority and the economy would have begun to collapse , but these two rejected a bipartisan agreement to stop that from happening the shutdown had already cost the country tens of billions of dollars , but the two highestranking fiscal planners in the republican party wanted to keep it going a few days earlier , mr ryan had been praised as a moderate for writing a wall street journal oped that didn t make the dismantling of health care reform one of the demands for ending the crisis instead , he wanted to use the extortion of a shutdown and default to cut spending even further than it has already fallen and when the final agreement achieved none of that because democrats refused to have a fiscal negotiation under a threat mr ryan sulked and walked away from the deal today s legislation won t help us reduce our fastgrowing debt , he said , explaining why he had broken away from other house republican leaders and voted no in my judgment , this isn t a breakthrough we re just kicking the can down the road actually , though , the agreement simply kicked the can where it belonged to the committee that should have started negotiating a budget agreement last spring mr ryan and mr sessions were essentially saying that they didn t trust the negotiating process , where they have starring roles , to produce anything of substance and that may be a pretty strong signal of how unseriously they take the important work of the next two months
, afghanistan within hours of the american military s formally transferring all but a small number of the afghan prisoners at the bagram prison to the afghan government , president held a friendly news conference with secretary of state on monday that stood in stark contrast to his recent acrimonious tone toward the united states the apparent rapprochement , which the americans worked hard to achieve , was a product in part of policy turnarounds on detention and on the deployment of special operations forces in a crucial province in both cases , the americans appeared to choose longterm influence in afghanistan over holding firm on thorny issues on detention , american officials had long feared that the afghans might release dangerous prisoners but the obama administration has made a priority of reaching an agreement on an american military presence here after 2014 that will allow the united states to keep tabs on iran and pakistan and contain extremists in pakistan s ungoverned tribal areas none of that marked mr karzai s recent meeting with defense secretary chuck hagel was on display monday evening two weeks ago , , and he and mr karzai had tense closeddoor discussions about the bagram prison handover and alleged abuses by special forces in wardak province this time , the news conference with mr kerry ran for nearly an hour as he and mr karzai lavished praise on each other mr karzai expressed his thanks both to the american people and the american government and he blamed the news media for misinterpreting his earlier inflammatory comments that the united states was supposedly colluding with the taliban to keep afghanistan weak in making those remarks , mr karzai asserted , he was speaking only to the taliban and telling them that their bomb attacks were merely giving the americans a reason to prolong their stay in afghanistan we talked about the ups and downs of our relationship , mr karzai said of his talks with mr kerry i am very happy about this transfer of bagram to afghan control it was very important for the people of afghanistan mr kerry , who has known mr karzai for years and met with him five times while he was a senator from massachusetts , even persuading him to , was equally effusive we are on the same page , mr kerry said i do n't think there is any disagreement between us , and i am very , very comfortable with the president s explanation mr kerry s unannounced visit to kabul was his first to the country as secretary of state mr kerry had initially wanted to also visit pakistan , whose cooperation is vital in any effort at stabilizing afghanistan , but he decided not to go now because of the elections there but mr kerry did meet pakistan s army chief , gen ashfaq parvez kayani , for dinner in amman , jordan , on sunday for mr karzai and mr kerry , it seemed doubtful the harmony would endure regaining full control of his country from the americans looms large for mr karzai , by his opponents the obama administration is prepared for further clashes ahead the process of winding down our current position and role in afghanistan and stepping into more of a support role is not going to be a smooth process at all times , said a senior state department official traveling with mr kerry issues of sovereignty and security are always going to be difficult bagram prison was the most flagrant symbol of mr karzai s lack of control americans detained several thousand afghans there , and mr karzai had no power to release them his effort to wrest the prison from the americans began in earnest more than year ago , and at least twice , most recently two weeks ago , a day before mr hagel s first visit each time , american military commanders backed out because of worries that the afghans might release taliban prisoners , who would return to the battlefield and endanger american soldiers this time , despite those concerns , the transfer went forward it s about a shift that s going on in how the us is looking at what s important , said one american official knowledgeable about detention issues we have to look at the larger picture what s the us strategic interest here \? the bagram commander , gen ghulam farouk barakzai , said monday that the americans had given the afghans control of a total of 4 , 000 prisoners in the last year since the transfer began but that a small number still remained in american custody he would not say how many were being held by the americans , or for how long if recent history is any guide , any decisions the afghans make on taliban releases after taking control are not likely to reassure the american military among those released in recent years by afghan officials or afghan courts were most of the 46 taliban prisoners who had been returned from the prison camp in guant namo bay , cuba one became the top insurgent commander in southern afghanistan maulavi abdul qayum zakir , whose real name is abdullah ghulam rasoul he was released from an afghan prison in late 2008 , just before the american troop surge was to start and the suicide bomber who in december nearly killed asadullah khalid , the head of the afghan intelligence service , had been freed by a presidential pardon , according to officials of that agency the americans also agreed with mr karzai s demands that they withdraw special operations forces from a district of wardak province , which abuts kabul , after accusations of abuse by the special operations troops even though the americans believe that the accusations were inaccurate the special operations forces are expected to leave in the next two to three weeks , military officials said the decision to hand over the bagram prison was said to have been eased in part by private assurances from afghan officials not to release enduring security threats , as officials call the most dangerous prisoners those highsecurity inmates are believed to number no more than 50 among the nearly 4 , 000 prisoners at bagram , which is connected to the american air base north of kabul since the transfer to the afghans began last spring , the afghans have released 1 , 376 prisoners , general barakzai said those releases occurred when the americans still had a veto and ran joint review boards with the afghans to determine who could be released even those earlier prison releases led to the return to the battlefield of some highlevel taliban figures , a senior afghan military official said among those confirmed to have returned to the fight , the official said , were maulavi said khail , who is now a taliban commander in wardak province maulavi shaheer , who turned formerly peaceful badakhshan province into a new war zone , where 17 afghan soldiers were killed in a single battle this month and 10 more were taken hostage on monday and maulavi raouf , who has become one of several new commanders in helmand province , where the insurgents are trying to regain control as american surge forces have pulled out an american military official in kabul insisted that the military had confidence that those insurgents whom the united states views as enduring security threats would not be released easily or quickly these people pose a threat to afghan soldiers and afghan civilians , too , the official said we 're confident they will have appropriate measures in place to ensure dangerous detainees do n't pose a threat to afghan and coalition forces critics of mr karzai were alarmed recently when he appointed a prominent cleric in kabul , maulavi enayatulah balegh , to review the cases of 700 mullahs and religious officials in afghan prisons , mostly because of suspected insurgent activity known for his antiamerican sentiments , mr balegh recommended the release of hundreds of taliban clerics this month
nested within the news about falling deficits is news about slowing health care cost inflation , which seems to be outlasting the recession and which is driving the longterm projections for medicare spending downward since one of the big questions in the great obamacare debate was whether the new health care law would accelerate cost growth \( as expanded subsidies and regulations often tend to do \) or reduce it \( thanks to the various costcontaining experiments and pilot programs embedded within the bill \) , the news that costs are falling in advance of the bill s implementation has some liberals crowing jonathan chait , in particular , has taken to explaining why the growing mass of evidence that the healthcarecost inflation problem is indeed solvable cuts the legs out from under the entire rightofcenter take on health care , deficits and entitlements , and puts the data squarely on the side of health care reform s proponents here s his elaboration on this theme the affordable care act created a wide slew of reforms intended to attack healthcare inflation from every possible angle the law created bundled payments , so that medicare would pay hospitals or groups of doctors based on quality , not quantity , of care it penalized hospitals that have to readmit patients owing to shoddy work \( they previously would enjoy a second payday for doing so \) , taxed highcost healthinsurance plans , encouraged electronic medical records and research on effective treatments , and many other things nobody believed every one of these experiments would work perfectly the idea was to try as many promising reforms as possible , and healthcare wonks expressed cautious optimism that the law contained a wide breadth of them over the last few years , healthcare inflation has indeed decelerated far more deeply than even the most optimistic backers of the law dare hoped at first , the sharp slowdown in healthcare costs was assumed to have happened because the recession is making people cut back on their medical care but as the trend has persisted , and undergone deeper study , a consensus is emerging that this is not the case at all several studies have found that the recession does not account for all , and possibly not even most , of the slowdown the trend precedes obamacare , too but the law can t be cleanly separated from the broad sentiment that the medical industry needed to overhaul its practices as matthew yglesias argues , if forwardlooking investors think that future increases in health care spending will be met with legislative efforts to curb health care spending , then investments that rely on future high levels of health care spending won t be made and the system will lack the capacity to deliver evergrowing levels of services in keeping with yglesias s premise , construction on hospitals cratered since 2009 and has not recovered even with the data on their side , none of the advocates of obamacare is nearly as certain the law will succeed as conservatives are that it will fail that is a testament only to the overweening ideological certainty that pervades the right but the mere fact that health care costs are slowing doesn t mean that the data is on liberals side , because nobody on the right argued that the health inflation problem wasn t solvable rather , conservatives argued that the best way to solve the problem was to change the way we provide insurance , so that ordinary health care consumption isn t so heavily subsidized , and market forces have more room to work hence the right s support for catastrophic coverage , health savings accounts , premium support for medicare , etc and the conservative fear was that by subsidizing comprehensive insurance plans and further regulating the insurance market , the new health care law would push the health care system in precisely the opposite direction swamping , in the process , any beneficial impact from the bill s various costcontrol measures the problem with obamacare , in other words , was that while it promised to attack healthcare inflation from as many angles as possible , it actually made it much harder to attack from the angle that rightofcenter wonks considered most likely to work now does the recent drop in health care inflation vitiate this argument \? well , not on the evidence of the studies that chait invokes , and which my colleague annie lowrey recently wrote up these studies tend to agree that the recession played a bigbutnotexclusive role in the recent slowdown in cost growth , while disagreeing on how much of this slowdown it explains \( one study says 77 percent , another 37 percent \) they also cite the slow shift away from feeforservice medicine that the health care law is designed to encourage \( which is a point in favor of the proobamacare argument , obviously \) , the slowing pace of medical innovation \( which is good news for budgets but not for actual human beings \) , and finally well , i ll just quote lowrey among other factors , the studies found that rising outofpocket payments had played a major role in the decline the proportion of workers with employersponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about threequarters in 2012 from about half in 2006 , the kaiser family foundation has found moreover , those deductibles the amount a person needs to pay before insurance steps in to cover claims have risen sharply that exposes workers to a larger share of their own health costs , and generally forces them to spend less in other words , health care costs are growing more slowly than many conservatives feared they would in part because conservatives preferred policy prescriptions are being taken up in the private sector , and having an effect ! this trend may be a case against the apocalyptic rightwing deficit panic that produced the debt ceiling debacle there i tend to agree with chait but in policy terms , it seems like it makes a better case for the paul ryanron wyden premium support proposal for medicare and the potential right0fcenter alternatives to obamacare than it does for obamacare itself not a dispositive case , obviously there are many forces at work here , and since evidence also shows positive results for some of the cost control measures that the health care law tries to promote , i understand why chait prefers to emphasize that part of the story , and hope for even slower cost growth once obamacare is fully operational but there isn t anything in the data to justify his claim that the health care bill as a whole is being vindicated by recessionera trends the question isn t whether some of the things that the law does could have a positive effect on cost inflation they clearly could ! it s whether the asyetunimplemented totality of the bill the 1 trillion in new spending and the thicket of new regulations as well as all the pilot programs and payment reforms will bend the cost curve up or down and there i think conservatives still have every reason to be skeptical
alexander guo had been waiting in the baking sun since 6 45 am nearly five and a half hours finally , ahead of him , people in line took three or four steps forward it s moving again ! mr guo , a 20yearold williams college junior , shouted on saturday morning it s a miracle ! since may 12 , mr guo and tens of thousands of others art lovers , technology buffs and the merely curious have trooped to the museum of modern art for a chance to experience rain room , a temporary installation in which water rains down except where sensors detect people , giving visitors the illusion of walking between the drops the work , by the littleknown art collective , received tepid reviews from art critics , ken johnson said , rain room , ' for all its entertaining ingenuity , seems little more than a gimmicky diversion but fueled by thousands of photos dramatically backlighted , hollywoodlike posted on social media , and by the increasing popularity of immersive art , people have been willing to stand for hours in 90plusdegree weather to snap their own pictures inside it s a new york thing fomo , said brianne chaionn , 34 , using the acronym for fear of missing out a lot of people have this syndrome , she said while waiting in line on saturday that s why we do n't sit in our apartments the average wait on weekdays , according to , has been four to five hours for nonmembers and two to three hours for members , who use a fasttrack line weekends are worse a nonmember can expect to wait more than five hours some visitors last weekend reported waiting nine hours , longer than a standard work day on sunday , the first people in line were admitted at precisely 9 30 am , when the museum opened but the line had been declared full and closed a halfhour earlier the wait is partly a result of the artists' decision to cap the exhibit s capacity to 10 at a time a mob would trigger the sensors into shutting off the rain entirely and by the many visitors who ignore the museum s polite request to limit visits to 10 minutes so far , roughly 55 , 000 visitors have passed through rain room , according to the modern the lines seem to defy rational explanation , even to those devoting their time to them there has to be a reason people are waiting this long , said sylvana fernandez , 24 , who lives in brooklyn , about four hours into her wait laurie garrett , 61 , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , waited for two hours last thursday morning her third attempt to see the show moma , she said , treated visitors like cattle in line i do n't understand why they did n't have a reservation system , said ms garrett , who lives in brooklyn and it s july ! there were people who were melting on the sidewalk afterward , she said that though she was impressed by the engineering , she was underwhelmed by the experience but at least four couples have become engaged surrounded by the rain , according to moma on monday , scott milam , a 27yearold wedding photographer , brought his girlfriend of 15 months , molly caldwell , all the way from phoenix , to ask her to marry him ms caldwell has always been convinced it would rain on her wedding day , mr milam said afterward when i saw rain room' on instagram , i was blown away and went , gosh , i ca n't make it rain on her wedding day , but i can on the day i propose to her she said yes with waits expected to lengthen as the july 28 closing date nears , two members of the random international studio , hannes koch and florian ortkrass , flew to new york from their london base last week to meet with moma officials the artists , wanting to preserve what mr koch called the meditative aspect of the piece , firmly opposed a mandatory time limit and in the end , moma did not make any official changes the queue should be part of the work it should be a social experience , mr koch said by telephone , but added , we have to make it not miserable to speed things up , the museum has created a viewingonly line , for people who want just to observe but not to frolic in the rain the weekend wait about 40 minutes anyone exceeding a 10minute visit gets a courtesy tap on the shoulder , said dave bennett , moma s lobby membership manager but several visitors said they felt hurried through the longer people wait , the longer they want to stay , mr bennett said it s a vicious cycle as if to illustrate his point , tanya maldonadotoomey , 28 , of manhattan , who had waited four hours and was still far from the entrance , declared , i'm going to be in there an hour moma had an inkling demand would be strong when rain room made its debut last fall in london , waiting times hit 12 hours still , mr koch said that was great britain people like queuing they have a special relationship with rain in london , where rain room was free , the average visit was seven minutes at moma , where admission is 25 , some linger for 45 minutes once viewed , the exhibition left many people scratching their heads kirsten thoft , a 48yearold architect , echoed the comments of many when she said , i'm not sure it s art , to which her husband , ted nadeau , 49 , a computer scientist , rejoined , it s facebookfriendly art rain room is the latest in a string of interactive , crowdpleasing art exhibitions in new york , including tatzu nishi s for which the monument in columbus circle was enclosed in a temporary apartment last winter with 42 swings at the park avenue armory and in 2011 at the new museum , where visitors were encouraged to float naked at moma in 2010 , people lined up for hours from across a table the phrase once in a lifetime' is bandied around in marketingspeak , but in this realm it tends to be true , said nicholas baume , director of the public art fund , which produced discovering columbus none of us will ever have that experience again last in line on saturday afternoon were thea killeen , 65 , and her 16yearold son , oliver , who had driven seven hours from their home south of buffalo they got into rain room just 15 minutes before the exhibit s closing time of 5 30 oliver reported that once inside , i got in trouble for doing a headstand
former president bill clinton , who signed the defense of marriage act in 1996 barring federal recognition of samesex weddings , called on the supreme court on thursday to overturn the law just weeks before the court takes up a case challenging the law , mr clinton said he had come to believe that the law is unconstitutional and contravenes the quintessential american values of freedom , equality and justice above all in doing so , he joined president obama in arguing that the law be overturned as the president who signed the act into law , i have come to believe that doma is contrary to those principles and , in fact , incompatible with our constitution , mr clinton wrote in an oped article posted on the web site of the washington post on thursday evening the former president s argument reflected a broader shift in societal attitudes in the 17 years since the law was enacted mr clinton was never enthusiastic about the measure , but he was not on record supporting samesex marriage at the time and , just weeks before his reelection , he felt he had no choice but to sign it still , to make the point that he considered it politically motivated , and to call as little attention to it as possible , he signed it after midnight it was an awkward moment for mr clinton , who had done more than any previous president to court the gay community and promote gay rights , but he believed that republicans were trying to steer him out of what was then the mainstream and damage his chances for a second term as more americans have come to accept samesex marriage , mr clinton has spent the intervening years trying to explain and distance himself from the law in 2011 , he supported a measure in new york legalizing samesex marriage the defense of marriage act defined marriage for federal purposes as the union of a man and woman it did not ban samesex marriage in the states , none of which then had made it legal but the law stipulated that should one or more states eventually authorize it , other states would not have to recognize the validity of such unions the supreme court will hear oral arguments against the law on march 27 in his oped piece , mr clinton cast the decision to sign the law in 1996 as a sign of the era although that was only 17 years ago , it was a very different time , he wrote in no state in the union was samesex marriage recognized , much less available as a legal right , but some were moving in that direction washington , as a result , was swirling with all manner of possible responses , some quite draconian he suggested that the measure might have headed off a constitutional amendment barring samesex marriage altogether and noted that only 81 of 535 members of congress opposed the law he pointed to a statement he issued when he signed it saying that the measure should not be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination reading those words today , mr clinton wrote , i know now that , even worse than providing an excuse for discrimination , the law is itself discriminatory it should be overturned
prato , italy dozens of bouquets block the entrance to the teresa moda outlet and factory where seven chinese workers died last sunday in a fire that swept through the establishment where they worked and lived enlarged photos of the seven victims , two women and five men , have been affixed to the door under a handwritten sign that reads sorrow has no color behind police barricades , in soggy piles , are charred bolts of cloth , mountains of plastic hangers and garbage bags full of newly cut garment pieces the building , which houses teresa moda , a wholesale distributor which also prepared clothing for assembly lines , did not have emergency exits , officials said windows were blocked by bars officials believe that a camp stove used for cooking probably caused the fire , in which two others were seriously hurt it took calamity to fan national outrage at the lowcost business model that took root here 20 years ago and that has transformed the economy of this tuscan town 12 miles north of florence but for officials who have tried to get a grip on the problem , a tragedy is always just around the corner , said stefano bellandi , the local secretary for the cisl , one of italy s main unions the fire at teresa moda , and the uproar that followed , exposed the complicated , and at times tense , cohabitation in prato of italian residents and chinese immigrants , who now own nearly 45 percent of the city s manufacturing businesses law enforcement officials have struggled for years to rein in illegal and unsafe practices here they say several factors hinder their efforts , including inadequate staffing to carry out checks on nearly 8 , 200 factories in the textile and garment manufacturing sectors , and the reluctance of chinese workers to cooperate with italian officials last week prato s prosecutor , piero tony , placed four chinese citizens under investigation for the fire on charges of multiple manslaughter , failure to uphold workplace safety measures and exploitation of illegal workers on thursday , prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 11 people , chinese and italian , including a city hall employee , on charges of procuring illegal residence permits for chinese immigrants who paid 820 to 2 , 050 for the papers several defendants remained at large italian news media reported friday that an italian man a partner in the company that owned the building was also under investigation there are nearly 16 , 000 legal chinese residents in prato , a city of 191 , 000 estimates for the number of chinese people living here illegally fluctuate from 15 , 000 to 25 , 000 , and the exact figure is unknowable , officials say law enforcement and health officials have carried out 1 , 571 checks on businesses in prato over the last two years , labor minister enrico giovannini told the italian parliament on tuesday more than half of those businesses belonged to chinese citizens the checks were part of italy s effort to confront conditions of unsustainable illegality and exploitation , he said more than 1 , 700 fines have been issued to companies for not paying social security contributions , while about 400 people living in the country illegally have been identified , mr giovannini said more than 350 companies were closed and production was halted for various violations in many cases , said aldo milone , the municipal council member responsible for the city s security , the situation inside the businesses we checked had the same characteristics as in teresa moda after the fire , several wholesale stores adjacent to the burned factory were shut down after firefighters found dormitories inside but the problems always seem to stay one step ahead of discovery officials say many businesses here open and close before health or fire inspectors , and even the tax police , can check them often they reopen with new tax code numbers and while in prato there is sympathy for the victims and outrage at the dickensian conditions under which they lived and worked , the fire in the outletturnedfactory also exemplified what some italians say angers them most chinese businesses , they say , have flourished while italian companies have failed because the chinese ones depend on poorly paid labor and have ignored workplace safety standards in the name of cutting costs they operate at the edge of legality in conditions that are more or less risky , mr bellandi , the union leader , said chinese businessmen affiliated with italian industrial organizations declined to comment last week the chinese consul general in florence , wang xinxia , met with representatives of chinese associations in prato and urged them to play an even more active role in the promotion of legality and security , to eliminate potential risks and put an end to fires and other tragedies , the consulate wrote in a statement labor leaders say they have tried , in vain , to convince factory workers that they must fight for better conditions if you want to build consensus , you have to offer them opportunities , residence permits , new jobs , show them it s better to be legal , said manuele marigolli , regional secretary of the cgil , another large labor union instead , when factories are raided , the workers are brought to the police station , fingerprinted and given a paper that tells them they have to leave italy the moribund italian economy , in its third year of recession , makes things only worse between the chinese immigrants and their italian hosts claudio bettazzi , president of the local chapter of a national group that represents artisans and small business , notes a growing climate of hate there are no official estimates for how much revenue prato s chinatown brings in because so much of the business is underground mr milone , the council member in charge of security , estimates that the losses to the state , just in terms of tax evasion , are more than 14 billion a year in prato others counter , however , that the local economy would sink even further were it not for the chinese many local property owners depend on rental income from the factories and warehouses built for italian companies and now used by chineseowned firms it s wrong to say that all chinese businesses are bad , said mr bettazzi , whose association has persuaded a few dozen chinese businesses to join there are also many opportunities it is a community that has been able to withstand the crisis and , in fact , italian companies use chineserun factories in prato to reduce their costs we ca n't pretend that only the foreigners are involved , said marco paggi , a lawyer in padua who works for an association that defends the rights of immigrants we ca n't resolve everything by criminalizing the chinese , because we end up criminalizing the victims , too prato s mayor , roberto cenni , called on business owners and homeowners to hang black banners from their windows as part of a day of mourning on wednesday , although none were in evidence in several streets in the city center a candlelight vigil that evening , however , drew several hundred people , both chinese and italian controls and crackdowns were contentiously stepped up in prato in 2009 after the city s centerright government was elected mr milone says he wishes only that he had the staff to redouble his security efforts maybe we could have avoided sunday s tragedy , he said

this was not the championship match that chelsea had in mind one year after winning the uefa champions league , the club will compete in the europa league final in amsterdam on wednesday the reigning european champions became the first holders of the european cup to fail to advance past the group stage of the tournament earlier this season that dropped chelsea into the europa league , considered the less prestigious of the two main club competitions in europe the blues will have the opportunity to claim some silverware when they take on portuguese side benfica in a match that they would love to win , but wish they had never reached by its lofty standards , chelsea has had a disappointing season it won none of the seven competitions in which it was scheduled to compete , including semifinals losses in both domestic cups and a likely thirdplace finish in the premier league the team s thirdplace finish in its champions league group last fall earned it a spot in an eighth tournament , the europa league it also led to the firing of champions leaguewinning coach roberto di matteo in november that began what has been a rollercoaster of a season for chelsea di matteo s replacement , interim coach rafa benitez , has been openly jeered by the team s fans the club has already competed in 66 games in eight competitions in 10 countries , the highest totals of any major european club so far , chelsea has zero trophies to show for it with just one week left in the season , benitez and the club are desperate to salvage something from an otherwise forgettable year which brings us back to the europa league final chelsea is in the unique position of desperately wanting a victory in a match it never wanted to play it is kentucky in the nit rather than the ncaa tournament , or brazil competing in the bronzemedal match at the world cup on wednesday , chelsea s players will be playing for a prize they feel is beneath them since we were out from the group in the champions league , every time i watch the games i think it s a shame , but on the other hand i would rather be positive and think we have a chance to win another trophy , midfielder juan mata said on chelsea s website for me , our aim is to win this trophy and to be in the champions league next season a 21 victory at aston villa on saturday all but assured chelsea of that against benfica , the club will attempt to become the first team ever to hold both major european club trophies at the same time \( this season s champions league final will not occur until may 25 \) it would be a fine accomplishment , but not one that chelsea wanted
one night s work 28 points , 13 rebounds , 6 assists , 3 blocks , 1 steal guesses at the nba player behind those numbers on wednesday night might include lebron james , kevin durant , kevin love or dwight howard none would be right that line belonged to tim duncan , who put up yet another vintage gem in san antonio s 117110 win over the bucks in milwaukee to say duncan s season has been something of a renaissance would be an understatement his 214 points per 36 minutes are on a pace to be the highest since 20045 his 116 rebounds would equal his output in 200910 and his overall player efficiency rating \( per \) of 255 would be tops since 20067 , the last season san antonio won the nba finals at the same time , calling it a bounceback year suggests a fluctuation in production wholly antithetical to what duncan is as a basketball player since entering the league as the no 1 pick in 1997 after a stellar fouryear collegiate career at wake forest , duncan has never had a per below 219 never marshaled a win shares per 48 \( an estimate of the number of wins contributed by a player per 48 minutes \) of 171 \( the league average is about 100 \) never dropstepped , babyhooked and banked his way to less than 171 points per 36 oh , and all of those numbers came from one season \( 201011 \) , when duncan was 34 years old take a quick scroll through his career stats , a few superlatives are bound to ring true consistent , steady , solid but seldom flashy duncan has never led the league in a major statistical category , and has seldom dunked his way onto a tv highlight reel labels like first ballot hall of famer might register equally quickly to those capable of contextualizing duncan s accomplishments , which include a pair of most valuable player awards \( in 2002 and 2003 \) and four championship rings but it s precisely because that statistical steadiness emanates from such a floorbound , workmanlike repertory that duncan somehow must always be appreciated anew like the binary code that makes reading this post possible , we take duncan s basketball dna for granted even his nickname , the big fundamental , paints a picture of vanilla plainness , particularly in an era when the truth , the answer and black mamba have all become calling cards but anyone who read chris ballard s engrossing profile of duncan understands that this is how he prefers it it s not that he thinks basketball should be all work and no play rather , it is only through work beyond camera and , as the years drag on , farther below the rim that the true joys and rewards of playing can be experienced on thursday night duncan will take the madison square garden floor for the 16th time in his nba career he will face a struggling knicks team learning how to reincorporate an allstar power forward amar e stoudemire back into the fold on the fly one team is 2110 their best start in over a decade and learning to cope with the bright lights and skyscraper expectations of being a good team playing for a titlestarved , painfully loyal fan base in the league s biggest market the other is 268 , positioning itself for yet another postseason run at a fifth title in 15 years , and vying for headlines in a market few outside of south texas can be bothered to care about particularly during the nba season s winter doldrums one team has struggled for years to regain relevance the other typifies it one team is learning how to mine wins from consistency the other defines it one team s star is a polarizing scorer who touts myriad endorsements and is using a career year to help erase a past checkered by oncourt drama the other is tim duncan
in case you were curious , the new ideal indian man is very fair , very handsome and works at a multi national company \( mnc \) in the national capital region \( ncr \) since we haven t yet had a timelier or more accurate monitor of the notoriously changeable indian society than the matrimonial pages in our sunday newspapers , it is with unquestioning awe that i receive revelations such as the above every week no , they haven t lost their edge in the face of what seems like an overwhelming threat from matrimonial websites instead , their reputation as a reliable source for cultural shifts is vindicated because of the inherent limitation of space \( 3 cm by 5 cm \) that makes people prioritize their biases , compelling them to choose between desired attributes such as , say , wealth and sophistication the 1 , 200 to 1 , 500 items that appear across 3 or 4 pages of the biggest indian newspapers , like the times of india , the hindustan times and dainik jagran , are categorized by caste , religion and profession \( well , in the case of doctors \) , and lately by the quality of being cosmopolitan the newspapers charge by the space used \( say , 3 , 200 rupees for 25 words \) naturally , a number of things have changed since entire families actually sat and waited for the sunday matrimonials to begin with , there s much new jargon including abbreviations for software \( sw \) , gurgaon \( ggn \) , and people from lucknow who are employed in bangalore \( wkg blr fr lko \) but first a quick , if not so reassuring , summary of what hasn t changed regarding what has changed , nothing seems more radical than the new template for the desirable man not only is the wellsettled boy in reputed family business trumped by the mnc executive from gurgaon \( overlooking the occasional two bajaj motorcycle dealerships one tata car dealership in moradabad \) , he is supposed to be as goodlooking as the girl he wants for himself , going by the proportion of brides wanted ads that now start with v fair v handsome one among the many columns of similar ads in last week s times of india went fair h some mglk boy 5 9 btech mba wkg in mnc ggn 7 lpa the mglk is for manglik , if you were wondering inspired , no doubt , by the very recent concept that regular men must be , well , fair and glowing sparked by india s leading fairness brands shifting their focus to men , with products such as emami s fair and handsome gel endorsed by none other than the ultimate male idol , shahrukh khan this level playing field marks a new chapter in the history of indian matchmaking what s even more fascinating is the mnc revolution in the indian matrimony , with even sample ads using the term to illustrate their formats it might mean a job at a corporation with operations in more than one country , but the threeletter acronym actually stands for a way of life that is most aspired to in new india , in which it is supposedly possible to marry into a home theaterfitted apartment next to a golf course \( or an f1 track \) and order mexican takeaway for dinner it also means that one could be a managing director in noida and the other a sales representative in ranchi but as long as they work for an mnc , any mnc , they are together in this extended fairytale speaking of aspiration , up there with the mnc worker is the nri groom , a phenomenon that many of us associated with the last millennium surprisingly , despite all the talk about reverse brain drain , a large section of indian men still settle in the west , and , worse , are still considered a catch brinda got married to a software engineer in california brinda is now happily married for seven years and residing in san francisco her children speak only english at home many of brinda s relatives residing in india are envious of her being an nri and ask her to sponsor her cousins to study abroad , gloats a success story on the nri matrimony page at www shaaditimes com  not every nri man inspires queues of women like the headlinemaking 69yearold parsi billionaire who flew himself to mumbai earlier this month to pick up an indian woman with a slim figure he bought an entire matrimonial page in the times of india s city edition , publishing photos of assets such as his twinengine plane but all of them must expect women to line up , as frequent announcements like boy will be coming to india on 14 april to meet interested girls in the nri ad section suggest of course , nri hunks visiting the homeland to choose desi bride are torn with anxiety , as the most basic research will confirm the boy will be thousands of miles away from home working for a foreign company , while parents look for a bride all the decisions are made fast after looking at a couple of photos or web cam chats , starts a post on jaanlocom , the howto site for indians worldwide , which is titled how to know if your indian wife is really beautiful divided into sections such as photographs lie and first meeting is not enough , it goes on to dispense sharp nuggets of advice meant to protect the nri groom from undeserving indian women the life you earned after years of struggle and hardworking \( sic \) she is going to get it

anna merz , who went to seeking a serene retirement but became so appalled by the slaughter of black rhinoceroses that she helped start a reserve to protect them , becoming a , died on april 4 in melkrivier , south africa she was 81 the lewa wildlife conservancy , the reserve she founded , announced her death she left no immediate survivors , but more than 70 black rhinos , including one born the day she died , continue to thrive in the sanctuary that she created to protect them from poachers , who kill the animals for their horns as a young woman , mrs merz roamed the world and ended up in ghana , where she married twice , ran an engineering firm and became active in wildlife conservation she and her husband went to kenya to retire , but her revulsion at seeing the carcasses of rhinos strewn about a national park , each missing its distinctive double horn , compelled her to change her plans she started looking for land to use as a rhino reserve and , after many rejections , found a patron , david craig , who with his wife , delia , owned a vast tract in the shadow of mount kenya they agreed to set aside 5 , 000 acres for the project , which opened in 1981 as the ngare sergoi rhino sanctuary it has since grown to 61 , 000 acres through more land donations and was renamed the in 1995 lewa s success helped the black rhino population double to 4 , 880 over the last decade , still a lewa is home to 10 percent of kenya s black rhinos , and its efforts have lent substance to the dream of returning the species to its former dominance in northern kenya lewa rhinos must be regularly resettled elsewhere because the success of the breeding program the reserve s numbers grow 10 percent a year has caused overcrowding and fights mrs merz s example has inspired other wildlife conservation efforts and has helped make the black rhino , which is still critically endangered , a global symbol of extinction prevention i have met many remarkable animal specialists during my life , but none as extraordinary as anna merz , desmond morris , the zoologist and author , wrote in the foreword to her 1991 book what joy adamson was to lions , dian fossey was to gorillas , and jane goodall is to chimpanzees , anna merz is to rhinos florence ann hepburn was born in radlett , england , on nov 17 , 1931 , and moved between london and cornwall as a child a formative experience was seeing a museum exhibit on the dodo , which is believed to have become extinct in the 17th century another was being on a beach at age 9 when a german fighter plane attacked a total stranger threw his body on top of hers and died saving her life she graduated from nottingham university , studied law and traveled to exotic places before settling in ghana there she married ernest kuhn , whom she divorced in 1969 , and karl merz , who died in 1988 both husbands were swiss in ghana she trained and rode racehorses , rescued chimpanzees and was named an honorary game warden by the nation s game department she and mr merz moved to kenya in 1976 after securing the first 5 , 000 acres for the reserve , mrs merz , using her inheritance , built an eightfoothigh fence , then began rounding up rhinos using helicopters and stun guns she hired more than 100 armed guards , bought a plane for surveillance and built a network of spies to inform on poachers poachers , also armed , sell the horns largely to asians , who grind them for folk medicine , and arabs , who carve them to use as dagger handles prices for rhino horns can run higher than those for gold these are very ruthless people , she said of poachers mrs merz herself carried a gun and knife deborah gage , a conservancy official in london , wrote in an email that about a year ago mrs merz heard a yelp and went into the nextdoor room to find that a python had taken her favorite dog , so she grabbed her pistol , shot the python in the head and gradually unraveled it off her dog at first mrs merz used her own money to finance the project , a total of more than 15 million , but she came to rely on donations the helped by raising millions for rhino preservation through its annual bowling for rhinos campaign winners spent a week with mrs merz at her reserve giving local people a stake in the reserve was crucial to its success she employed them , built schools and medical clinics for them and helped foster the tourist industry besides rhinos , of both the black and white species , visitors come to see lions , elephants and other animals prince william of britain and kate middleton became engaged in 2010 while staying at a cottage at the reserve in 1990 , the united nations environmental program named mrs merz to its to mrs merz , rhinos far from being the stupid , aggressive , illtempered sorts many suppose were , in her words , beautiful and elegant she blamed their bellicosity on their poor eyesight , leading them to charge first and ask questions later she found that rhinos have a sense of humor and that they communicate by altering their breathing rhythms she read them shakespeare to soothe them samia , an orphan rhino whom she raised from babyhood , even crawled into bed with mrs merz not entirely to her delight samia would follow her around like a dog , even after leaving mrs merz s immediate care and returning to the reserve , where she mated and had her own calf if mrs merz fell , samia would extend her tail to help her up not realizing how big she had grown , samia once tried to sneak back into the house where she had been nursed and became jammed in the dining room door mrs merz had to pour a gallon of cooking oil on her rough skin to ease her through
mexico city in trying times like these , when the anguish and uncertainty can be almost too much to bear , mexico turns to him , its philosopherfanatic , to make sense of the seemingly nonsensical with the nation s hopes for the world cup spiraling into doubt and chaos , juan villoro , one of mexico s most decorated and esteemed writers who also happens to be a leading soccer analyst comes charging down the metaphorical field to scold , explain and extract the lessons within mexico may miss the world cup for the first time in 24 years , a crushing possibility in a country that treats the game like a religion but this month , the americans of all people , the americans ! saved mexico s chances of qualifying for the 2014 world cup by , setting up a lastchance playoff next month after this sudden gift , from a superpower mexico has long felt is its inferior on the soccer field , mr villoro , 57 , took to the front page of reforma , one of the leading newspapers here , to wax apoplectic crimes can be redeemed , but nothing saves you from mediocrity , he wrote something about mexico s struggle , and the prospect of doom , seems to fit the general sense of fatalism often manifested here every world cup team reflects its country s social model , he said a few days after the column when spain won last time , it was about middleclass aspiration , a nation making it france s victorious team before that , in 1998 , reflected the multinational ideal it aspires to be and mexico now , he said , it s a combination of the nation that has been promised a lot , but the promises have not been fully fulfilled and there is a feeling like maybe they never will be it is a very mexican team in that regard many people watching a soccer game may see a bunch of players trying to kick a ball into a net for 90 minutes you could have a 00 tie , and everyone would be talking about what a wonderful game it was , said mr villoro , speaking in a cantina with a closely watched match on the bigscreen television that 90 minutes later , it so happened , ended up tied 11 but this match , between cruz azul and am rica , two of the most popular clubs here , was not so wonderful a cloudburst had soaked the field the play was erratic instead , mr villoro saw something else , a metaphor for society , as he does in the regular columns , television appearances and writings that have made him such a preeminent figure in the church of soccer here , including a book called god is round soccer has much less to do with sporting triumphs than with the desire to form an emotional community , he said after the game , reflecting on the comingtogether around pivotal matches , in the way the super bowl in the united states borders on a holiday for that reason , i wrote in god is round' that if there were a world cup of spectators , mexico could get to the final we celebrate the game , but above all we celebrate ourselves celebration is not the national mood these days around mexico s national team , which is stumbling through the world cup qualifying matches like an exhausted player with little left but blind luck to pull it through a quirk in the tournament point system meant that the united states soccer team s defeat of panama last week , even though it lost on that same night to costa rica unless it wins a playoff with new zealand next month , mexico will be ousted with the overwhelming demand for soccer commentary lately , it may be easy to overlook mr villoro s prolific career of letters it includes journalism , essays , short stories , children s literature , novels and even a few rock songs , dissecting and mulling contemporary and historical mexico , often with a darkly reflective eye in one of his betterknown works , the witness , the protagonist returns to mexico after its 2000 elections heralded a return to democracy to find a country slipping into social disintegration and disorder but he has also been a lifelong soccer fanatic , having even played briefly and unspectacularly for his college team none other than , a god in mexican letters whom mr villoro admires and is sometimes compared to , once told an interviewer asking him about soccer , if you want to talk about soccer , go talk to juan villoro mr villoro attributes his reflective tone and passion for the sport to youthful outings to games with his father , luis villoro , a wellknown philosopher here his parents divorced while he was young , so this is how we got to spend time together , going to soccer matches his team since childhood remains the necaxa club , which has seen better days but in his view you ca n't change teams changing teams would be like changing your childhood he absorbed stories his grandfather told him and read prodigiously , knowing early on he would be a chronicler , and with soccer so embedded in his formation , perhaps it was inevitable that his writings and his passion would intersect after a short story of his with a soccer theme was published , he was invited to write and provide analysis on the 1990 world cup for a newspaper his soccer writings grew as popular as his literature , and he covered every subsequent world cup , doing color commentary for espn in the last one in 2010 in south africa \( mexico lost to argentina in the round of 16 \) he also published a book last year with the argentine writer mart n caparr s , there and back , a collection of correspondence between the two about soccer during that world cup like others , he came to see analogies to life in the game the steady drone of striving , frustration and missed opportunities before , finally , maybe , success a goal the soccer field itself , he has written , is an allegory of space and time but more broadly , mr villoro sees how we entertain ourselves as essential to understanding who we are with cruz azul and am rica taking to the field on the television behind him at the cantina , mr villoro sought to put the game , a traditional matchup between dominant teams in the capital , in context this is the mexico city classic , he explained the game itself is one thing , who scores , who wins but cruz azul represents the working class here that is their following am rica is the upper class , the rich or wannabe rich so this condenses into the workers versus the wannabes he then took off for several minutes on an explanation of what ails mexican soccer , diving deeply into the corrupt buying and selling of club players to mint stars instead of solid teams , the exhausting schedule driven by television s demands for some sort of championship nearly every weekend , the instability of coaching the end result , he said , is a national team in which the players hardly know one another , let alone how to play well together it is , he said , something of a metaphor for contemporary mexico , rich in promise , yes , but still far from its ideal it s an illusion of a team but he is still rooting for it
rafael leonardo black s manhattan is a persuasive argument for the value of slowburning careers mr black , now 64 , grew up in aruba , where he started drawing early he moved to new york city in 1965 , went to columbia , hung out in museums and kept drawing , influenced by surrealist painting and psychedelic graphics , jimi hendrix s music and the writing of ishmael reed , to mention just a few of the sources that make the 16 imagepacked pencil drawings at francis m naumann repositories of personal taste and filtering systems of cultural history in them , high and low coexist , along with gravity and hilarity , the parnassian and the pornographic , but none of them as opposites mr black simply puts images side by side and lets them talk , probably saying something different to you than to me still , he does have some ground rules most of the drawing are dedicated to modern artists , some european , the majority latin american the earliest piece , oneirology from 1982 , pays homage to picasso with a thumbnail version of his weeping woman surrounded by two dozen different tiny images , like portraits of coco chanel , and queen ranavalona of madagascar , who was deposed by the french and mentioned by marcel proust make of their joint company what you will , but be prepared to find room in it also for adam and eve , latin american dictators , sigmund freud s consultation room and the singer grace jones s lips in an invaluable exhibition guide , mr black describes the drawing as being about the towering beauty as well as the horrors of the 20th century , without indicating which images fall into which category and that s just the start there s lots more dotconnecting ahead in work that comes up to 2011 and grows darker and denser and richer over time by current marketing conventions , the selftaught mr black is probably producing outsider art the gallery , sensibly , goes with the insider moniker for what emerges from deep within history , popular culture and a personal psyche , and stays in the mind long after you 've left the gallery

the length of two football fields for much of the past week , the mourning has gone on regardless of drizzling rain and winds from first light each day until past dusk , mourners of all ages , from a spectrum of ethnic and religious groups , have lingered beneath the gaze of uniformed police officers , honoring the memory of a man few of them knew it was here 11 days ago , outside the 200yearold woolwich barracks in this district along the thames in southeast london , that two assailants shouting allahu akbar , or god is great , , an army bandsman and machinegunner who had seen combat in afghanistan he had been returning to barracks , in a tshirt bearing the name of a soldiers' charity , help for heroes , after a day of recruiting at the tower of london , his in addition to the two suspects , both with family ties to nigeria , the police have arrested 10 other people on suspicion of conspiracy in the murder , releasing most of them on bail the killing has shocked britain as few things have in recent years , and the political reverberations have continued mostly , these have concerned the failure of the domestic security agency , mi5 , and the counterterrorist command at scotland yard to take preemptive action that might have averted the killing officials have said that in extremist groups for years but judged neither to pose a significant terrorist threat there has also been a dispute over whether the government has taken sufficient action to curb terrorism since the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks in the united states and especially since the in 2005 , in which 52 passengers and the 4 bombers were killed in particular , critics say that the government has not done enough to inhibit socalled hate preaching in mosques and muslim community centers , widely judged to be the source of radicalization among young muslim men there has also been argument over whether 100 million the government has given muslim community groups , in a , has ended up subsidizing extremist preachers and their jihadi recruits prime minister david cameron , a conservative , has been criticized for not pressing ahead , as he had promised , with a bill that would widen the government s counterterrorism powers , after criticism from human rights advocates and the conservatives' coalition partners , the liberal democrats the proposed law , derided by would give the police and security agencies tracking terrorism suspects the right under judicial supervision to monitor internet traffic in the same way that they can now monitor cellphone and landline telephone calls , a range of powers already available with a court order to investigators in the united states the new powers would allow the authorities to track internet use , including when and to whom emails were sent , but not the content of the messages the purpose , the bill s supporters say , would be to allow investigators to identify possible coconspirators in attacks without having to rely on other , more timeconsuming ways of detecting terrorist networks the bill was dropped from the current legislative agenda to avoid straining ties between the conservatives and the liberal democrats , who say the measure is too invasive in the meantime , efforts continue to untangle exactly what happened in the rigby killing , which the government is calling a terrorist attack , making it the first such fatality in britain since the 2005 transit bombings witness accounts , and cellphone video shot by bystanders , made the attack one of the most graphic ever recorded in britain but gave the police a head start initially , the government described the killing as a lone wolf attack of the kind advocated recently by a variety of web sites linked to al qaeda , but home secretary theresa may has said that the focus of police inquiries is now on a wider conspiracy the inquest into mr rigby s death , which opened for a few minutes at the southwark coroner s court on friday and was rapidly adjourned , served mostly to confirm what was already known that the assailants swerved their car across several lanes of traffic , knocking mr rigby down as they crashed into a traffic signpost on the sidewalk they then leapt out to inflict multiple incisive wounds with a cleaver and another bladed weapon that the police , quoting a postmortem finding , say killed the soldier , before dragging his body into the street a scotland yard counterterrorism commander who testified at the inquest , detective chief inspector grant mallon , said the two men had waited near the body encouraging bystanders to see what they had done , weapons still in their bloodied hands , and making no attempt to flee , before an armed police unit arrived and opened fire on the two suspects , wounding both with only summary details of the postmortem released so far , officials have refused to confirm what some witnesses said at the time , that mr rigby was beheaded at the inquest , the police said only that he had been identified by his dental records one of the two suspects , michael adebowale , 22 , was after his release from a hospital last week , appearing in court with his right hand heavily bandaged from what the police said was a misfire from his revolver at the time of his arrest the other , michael adebolajo , 28 , who remained in the hospital under armed guard , was charged with murder on saturday , and two counts of attempted murder in the wounding of two police officers who were trying to arrest him on friday , queen elizabeth ii toured the woolwich barracks on a visit that was organized before the killing , and organizers said she met privately with members of mr rigby s unit , the royal regiment of fusiliers , to express her condolences outside the barracks , mourners told television crews they were disappointed that the queen had not emerged from the barracks to lay her own bouquet at the memorial some bouquets were accompanied by cards heavy with anger toward islam , and toward mr rigby s killers , and the barracks fencing was emblazoned with union jacks , the british national flag , and with the redandwhite flags of st george , popular among antiimmigrant , antimuslim groups but most of the messages shunned invective and followed the line urged by mr cameron for all britons to unite in the face of the killing , to see it as a betrayal of islam , not a fulfillment of islamic dogma , and to focus their anger purely and solely at the sickening individuals who carried out this appalling act some notes were from african and muslim groups we unreservedly condemn this abhorrent , barbaric act terror ca n't divide us , said one card from a group calling itself africans for hero lee rigby we just want to extend our sincere regrets to all against this heinous attack on humanity , on behalf of all peaceloving muslims , read another message , signed by a group with names that included kamran , ayesha , nayel , fawad and faisal a mile away , at the greenwich islamic center , with a goldendomed mosque said to have been frequented by mr adebolajo and mr adebowale , a printed message taped to the entrance condemned the terrible crime , adding , we strongly suggest that both these men should be severely punished as criminals and not as socalled muslims
near dawn on march 24 , 1863 , maj gen ambrose e burnside stepped off a train in cincinnati the tall , bald , magnificently bewhiskered soldier arrived from washington to take command of the army s department of the ohio , an enormous command that encompassed ohio , indiana , michigan , illinois and most of kentucky his orders from the war department were to collect troops and prepare to lead an invasion of eastern tennessee in the meantime , though , he also had to deal with the roiling antiwar politics of the ohio valley burnside s new billet offered redemption after failure at the head of the army of the potomac during the winter the general had led the disastrous assaults on entrenched confederate troops at fredericksburg , va , in december later , the mud march fiasco , a failed attempt at a winter campaign , prompted feuding among the army of the potomac s top commanders president abraham lincoln finally removed him in late january 1863 but lincoln liked the unassuming and sincere indiana native and wanted him to have an active command this new assignment was another chance to serve his country burnside replaced brig gen horatio g wright , who had commanded the department of the ohio since its formation in august 1862 wright remained in cincinnati for several days to ease the new man into command and teach him the lay of the land the threat of a springtime confederate invasion of kentucky loomed , and the defense of the commonwealth took priority over offensive plans more to the point , the restive states north of the ohio river had to be quieted burnside learned from wright that ohio , indiana and illinois were cauldrons of violent resistance to the federal government just as galling to these soldiers , antiadministration speech throughout the region was commonplace democratic speakers and newspapers heaped torrents of abuse on lincoln , his policies and his generals the emancipation proclamation continued to be a lightning rod for protest the constant abuse , many officers and enlisted men believed , encouraged desertion and seriously weakened the armies in the field to put an end to it , burnside had a solution three weeks after arriving in cincinnati , on april 13 , he announced general orders 38 , applying military authority to the regulation of all speech and publication in the department it must be distinctly understood , he declared , that treason expressed or implied will not be tolerated burnside s order reflected the sentiments of many soldiers who blamed partisan ie , democratic speech for prolonging the war days before the order appeared , brig gen jacob d cox , commander of the district of ohio , noted in a speech that soldiers believed that these enemies at home are more dangerous than those they meet in the field as burnside himself publicly explained , his order was a declaration of military superiority over civil government in combatting disloyalty and policing the home front i am probably invested with a little more power than the majority of you in suppressing anything like treason , and acts that tend to create dissention burnside s military edict against treasonous speech was only the latest military measure to fight the growing problem of resistance to the government in the north wright , his predecessor , had created a spy bureau made up of civilian detectives and soldiers detailed to roam the landscape and sniff out disloyalty and conspiracy his army detectives spied on groups who aided deserters and vowed resistance to the newly passed enrollment act they also reported on sales of arms and ammunition to groups deemed disloyal and bent on violence wright also instituted a departmentwide ban on the sale of firearms and ammunition in order to keep guns out of the hands of traitors general orders 38 met with widespread approval from republicans who dearly wished to muzzle their political foes troops applauded the measure , none more so than brig gen milo s hascall , commander of the district of indiana , who promulgated \( with burnside s approval \) a similar order specifically for his state all newspapers and public speakers that counsel or encourage resistance to the conscription act , or any other law of congress passed as a war measure , or that endeavor to bring the war policy of the government into disrepute , would , he warned , be deemed violators of the order while republicans cheered the orders , democrats scolded the generals for unconstitutional infringements of the freedoms of speech and the press several indiana democratic editors mockingly wondered what burnside meant by implied treason in may , hascall proceeded to arrest editors , shutter several newspapers and threaten others in his state as a demonstration of the term s meaning many democratic speakers and newspaper editors held their tongues lest they be arrested and imprisoned by the army democratic indignation soared many democrats soon braved the threat of arrest and boldly criticized burnside s military edict speakers and editors lambasted the order as tyrannical , unconstitutional and merely the latest lincoln administration travesty the order quickly came to have the opposite effect from what burnside had hoped far from stifling dissent , burnside s order provided a rallying cry for antiwar partisans rallies throughout the region brought out thousands of energized democrats one democratic politician appears to have used his party s reaction to burnside s edict to revive his political fortunes former congressman clement l vallandigham of dayton , ohio , defeated in his 1862 congressional race , had plans to run for governor in the fall of 1863 he tapped democratic anger and attacked general orders 38 in public speeches army officers dressed in civilian clothes recorded one of his speeches shortly afterward , troops surrounded vallandigham s dayton house and battered down his door they arrested him and hauled him away to headquarters in cincinnati burnside promptly tried him by military commission for violation of the order while dayton dissolved in riot and half its downtown burned , the tribunal found vallandigham guilty and sentenced him to military imprisonment , which lincoln changed to exile in the confederacy vallandigham s arrest made him a martyr in the eyes of ohio democrats , who nominated him as their candidate for governor while most republicans took delight in military punishment for democratic speech , one important republican acted behind the scenes to put an end to burnside s order from the outset , indiana governor oliver p morton perceived both that enforcing the order was impractical and that democrats gained more from it politically than republicans the month before he had disposed of the dangerous problem raised by the military arrest of a sitting illinois democratic judge , charles h constable the generals by their heavyhanded tactics were again interfering with political matters for which they had little aptitude he traveled to washington and lobbied the lincoln administration to remove both burnside and hascall he failed to have burnside canned , but the war department soon replaced hascall morton s intervention with national authorities brought an end to burnside s policy of military arrests for speech at the beginning of the military commission trial of a democratic indiana state senator arrested for disloyal speech , a messenger from morton informed burnside that the president and his cabinet disapproved of burnside s arrest of vallandigham and the army s interference in political matters rattled by this startling news , burnside telegraphed the president to offer his resignation , which lincoln tersely declined , saying that the arrest had been foolish but the cabinet would back him the general promptly ended the policy of arrests and trials for disloyal speech , even freeing the indiana state senator after the commission found him guilty while he discontinued arrests for speech , burnside still aimed to silence critics on june 1 , he ordered the shutdown of the chicago times , the leading antiwar democratic newspaper in the west reacting to democratic clamor and protests from prominent republicans , lincoln initially ordered burnside to rescind the order but other republicans who approved of burnside s move intervened , prompting lincoln to waffle he flipflopped and ordered burnside to keep the paper under lock and key his message arrived too late burnside had already lifted the suppression order while the general did not rescind general orders 38 , the suppression of the chicago times was to be his last major attempt to curb democratic opposition in the department of the ohio burnside blamed governor morton for the demise of his program for rigorous military intervention into civil affairs , one of the most notorious efforts to suppress speech and press freedoms in american history the civil law is too slow , he groused privately the general , who saw himself as supreme military governor over five states , greater than a mere state governor , believed the power of the army should be employed to quell dissent but the capable indiana executive prevailed and kept the general at bay in july , morton again skillfully deflected burnside s efforts to declare martial law in indiana during an extensive confederate raid across the region in angry frustration , burnside s staff officers turned a portrait of the governor that hung in their cincinnati headquarters upside down the irony of their symbolic protest appears to have escaped them follow disunion at or join us  sources william marvel , burnside craig d tenney , to suppress or not to

miami the glitches in the new electronic health care signup system began almost immediately at the jessie trice community health center , in one of this city s poorest neighborhoods , and they never let up with a potential applicant by her side , linda j lott , a certified application counselor , stood at her computer terminal and typed the word florida into the insurance exchange network web site the system is down at the moment , it read she smiled at wesley trumpler , 47 , and explained , we 've had some slow times getting on , and we 're unable to get started an 800 number popped up people call this number , but they have had the same problem , she added with that , she walked mr trumpler over to a nearby chair , gave him a brief overview of the program this is obamacare , right \? he asked and asked if he wanted to come back then she gave mr trumpler , who is unemployed and is recovering from a gunshot wound , an appointment to come back next week to try again he was thankful , not a trace of frustration on his face he had heard about obamacare , but , until he walked into the clinic for a medical appointment , he did not realize he could sign up for it beginning tuesday i need insurance , he said , but it s too expensive all day , trained application counselors typed in florida , or got as far as entering some applicants' personal information , before the system crashed sometimes the crash came when it was time to answer a security question other times applicants put in their security question answers but could go no further out of nearly 72 applicants who sat down with counselors by noon , none were able to access the marketplace all of the applicants were given appointments to come back another week as with any system , there will be glitches in the first weeks and months , said annie neasman , the president and chief executive of the community health center , in liberty city , a predominantly black neighborhood , where seven counselors spent tuesday explaining the program and trying to sign people up at trice , counselors aimed to help fill out applications for most people who walked in to tend to their medical needs many of them were unemployed and unlikely to be eligible for the exchange , but counselors do not know that until the patients try to apply if they are rejected , they are given an exemption letter so they are not penalized for not having insurance in florida , which has the secondhighest rate of uninsured people , and where the state government has rebuffed the program , allowing the federal government to run it , applicants faced obstacles even before they arrived here on tuesday the state s health department opted not to allow counselors inside state health offices , although several south florida counties defied that ban only an estimated 35 navigators have been approved by the state so far to help answer applicants questions about the exchanges some nonprofit organizations , facing cumbersome rules and paperwork , decided to opt out of the navigator program instead , much of the work is being done by counselors at health clinics that are working to sign people up as they come through the doors their help is crucial to the program s success in communities like this several people did not have computers at home others said they would have a hard time wading through all the information some haitians and hispanics said they faced language barriers but there was no avoiding the delays on tuesday we 've been running into some glitches , ms lott explained to the next applicant i want to give you fair warning , but if it happens , no problem , i will give you an appointment and you can come back ms lott also stressed that the information was private it would either go directly into the web site or it would stay with the applicant gov rick scott has expressed concerns over privacy and has raised questions about the possibility of identity theft and fraud in a state that is awash with that kind of crime bertha stewart , 53 , who is unemployed , stood by ms lott s side ms lott asked her whether she wanted to type in the information herself , and she said no computers , she said , are not her thing after long pauses , there was a moment of euphoria when they actually got past the security questions screen success , ms lott said but the moment did not last long your account cannot be created at this time , the screen said wow , she said this is unbelievable ms stewart , who lost her housekeeping job three years ago , just smiled she took the appointment card and then waited to be seen by a doctor for her asthma she cannot afford insurance or her medications , so she is holding out hope that she will qualify for the exchanges or some sort of benefit i am patient , ms stewart said that s how you get stuff done you are patient sitting in an office , bleyette georges , 45 , chitchatted in haitian creole with another counselor ms georges , who has eight children , four of them grown , heard about obamacare on the news and decided to sign up her small store , which sold clothes , shoes and perfume , went under four years ago in the throes of the recession she tried a restaurant , but that too failed with no insurance , ms georges said she had nothing to lose i do n't know anything about it , she said , but i will apply and see money do n't come off trees , but there are no jobs out there her luck was no better she did not even get to the security question she was asked if she wanted an appointment i want to come back , ms georges said leave it an open appointment time for me her counselor , lexilia neptune , grinned and shrugged off yet another failed attempt that s ok , she said we can wait
new orleans when evaluating game film of prospective , the running backs coach wilbert montgomery abides by a singular philosophy you have to make me like you , montgomery said wait there is an addendum you have to make me like you fast his time is valuable , so after pressing play , montgomery needs to see tackles broken and linebackers fooled and yards after contact he needs to see acceleration and elusiveness and something special he needs to be given a reason to tell his boss , ozzie newsome , that baltimore must draft this running back even though the ravens start a pro bowler , ray rice this is how the team came to select bernard pierce last april , trading up in the third round to take him in montgomery s estimation , pierce was more explosive in the first 20 yards of runs than any other back he had seen since the twotime rushing champion edgerrin james , who was drafted in 1999 like james , pierce is 6 feet and about 220 sculptured pounds , and the comparisons do not end there pierce does not welcome contact as much as invite it , squaring his shoulders to barrel over defenders , then sprint past them his physical style , with a flourish of speed , serves as an ideal and , perhaps , necessary complement to the slippery , stockier rice , who understands the value of having a dynamic backup in the current nfl climate i do n't have to inflict that kind of pounding on my body when you 've got a guy who s 220 pounds or more and coming at you with downhill action , rice said , adding when you 're spelling yourself , one thing you 're afraid about is , is the offense going to run the same \? ' you have to play the baltimore ravens the same when bernard pierce comes into the game more than half of pierce s 135 rushing attempts during the regular season and the playoffs have come since jim caldwell replaced cam cameron as offensive coordinator in two of baltimore s three postseason victories against indianapolis and at new england pierce gained more yards , and on fewer carries , than rice pierce s 63 yards per rush ranks first this postseason among running backs we liked him a lot , ravens coach john harbaugh said , but i do n't think we thought he 'd be this good of a player harbaugh is seeing a more evolved version of the player and the person who at 16 was sent to glen mills , a residential school outside philadelphia for juveniles referred by courts pierce said he was young and immature then , with a coterie of troublemaking friends his role in a brawl at his high school , lower merion , landed him at glen mills , where students were held to a strict code of conduct the worst part \? no females , pierce said the acclimation was difficult he would skip class he would leave campus he trusted few but pierce bonded with kevin owens , his football coach , and rick badanjek , the running backs coach badanjek encouraged him to join the track team , to start power lifting badanjek said he felt , at times , like a surrogate father pierce , raised mostly by his mother and his grandmother , rarely saw his birth father , who died in a 2008 car accident whenever he flouted the rules , refused to behave , badanjek would call pierce s mother , tammy , in front of him you 're not listening to me you 've got to listen somebody , badanjek recalled telling him it took a long time of me just staying on him , telling him , this is the way it s got to be , this is the way it s going to be it ca n't be your way' he came to understand that owens said he detected a change in pierce when he opted to stay for a second year , his senior year , at glen mills that s very unusual , owens said we build a new football team every year pierce s decision , owens said , showed he realized how much he had benefited from glen mills s structure several colleges recruited pierce , but none harder , owens said , than temple , whose defensive coordinator at the time , mark d'onofrio , watched pierce as often as ncaa rules allowed at a county track meet during pierce s junior year , d'onofrio handtimed his 100meter dash in 106 seconds d'onofrio called al golden , temple s coach at the time , immediately for such a big guy , just the way he ran , to see that flatout breakaway speed on top of everything else that he had was unbelievable , said d'onofrio , who is now golden s defensive coordinator at the university of miami when you watch his football tape , he was a football player who ran track not the opposite in three seasons at temple , pierce rushed for 3 , 570 yards and 53 touchdowns , and staying close to home allowed him to maintain his relationships with badanjek and owens they communicate every so often now , mostly through text messages , but badanjek traveled to baltimore for the ravens' game dec 2 against pittsburgh pierce said badanjek rarely praised him , but that night badanjek told him how proud he was of him i said it s all coming true for you , is n't it \? ' badanjek said , recounting the conversation it s all coming together for you you 're where you want to be you always claimed you were a man , but you never were now you are' about twice a week , badanjek speaks with tammy pierce he said he always ends their conversation by asking her to pass along a message to her son run the way you know pierce has in baltimore , where he made montgomery and rice , and harbaugh like him , and fast
a generation ago , the smallmarket had to climb a figurative mountain inside madison square garden before realizing they had what it took to win a playoff series in the big , forbidding city they lost in the first round to the in 1993 and a year later wasted a chance to eliminate the knicks at home before losing game 7 on s putback it was the same situation in 1995 , except ewing s infamous game 7 fingerroll rimmed out , kissed the garden floor , and the team cast as hicks had the last laugh on the knicks i think the year we lost in seven we were pretty convinced that we could win , said but until you do , you do n't know for sure walsh who left the pacers in 2008 to deconstruct the knicks so they could be built into a supposed title contender was in his old pregame courtside perch sunday afternoon back at the garden , once again with the pacers , he was sitting as pretty as any 72yearold who has had multiple surgeries in recent years and has worked for an owner named dolan could possibly sit and that was before his pacers hung a 10295 loss on the knicks in game 1 of the eastern conference semifinals , foretelling a different series from the one the knicks concluded friday in boston whereas the pacers once needed miller to hit miracle shots to win in new york , these pacers snatched the knicks' homecourt advantage by hitting the boards the pacers are big and longlimbed , and they turned the lane into a forbidden zone for a knicks team that had enjoyed itself going inside against the celtics' comparatively puny front line that s what hit me when the game started and i was down by the bench , how big we are , walsh said afterward , noting how the pacers had outrebounded the knicks , 4430 , limited their secondchance opportunities and blocked eight shots to boot he especially liked the sight of lance stephenson , a 2010 secondround draft pick who played at brooklyn s lincoln high , filling up the stat line with 11 points , 13 rebounds , 3 assists and 3 steals stephenson said he did not go to the garden until he was playing in high school championship games but he and the emerging paul george are changing the pacers , the way tony parker and manu ginobili once transformed san antonio , from plodding to athletically unpredictable walsh could n't take credit for stephenson because was running the pacers at the time of that draft walsh could actually be blamed by the knicks for not taking stephenson his regime chose andy rautins and landry fields for the knicks with the 38th and 39th picks just before bird stole stephenson at no 40 too late for that , though dolan soured on walsh when he failed to land lebron james as a free agent walsh went home to indianapolis two summers ago and stepped back into the pacers' front office this season when bird took a sabbatical or early retirement the official nature of his decision still unknown a native new yorker , walsh is sweating none of it he s a caretaker in the catbird seat if the birdbuilt pacers beat the knicks , he will relive one of the grand highlights of his long career , when those millerled pacers brought the curtain down on the pat riley era in new york he will exact a measure of revenge on dolan , even if walsh , a dedicated high road walker , has never publicly uttered a disparaging word about his time in new york if the knicks beat the pacers , no big deal after all they are \( or were \) the favorite , and their clock is ticking , in part because they are built for now , as opposed to the young and stilldeveloping pacers we have a good young team that s going to get better , walsh said , referring mostly to george , 23 the fourthyear center roy hibbert , 26 and stephenson , 22 add the injured former allstar danny granger to the mix next season and it s fair to say the pacers are a team of the future walsh said he believed the knicks got enough right now to win , and if that should happen , it would also , in the long view , be a good reflection on him for cleaning up the mess made by isiah thomas and assembling the assets used to bring carmelo anthony in from denver it was widely believed that dolan forced walsh s hand to make the deal , surrendering to denver s demands when walsh was determined to call their bluff and not sacrifice as much as they did in players and draft picks all ancient history walsh is too practical a basketball lifer to worry about such conflict to the question of whether he would have preferred not to play the knicks on this highstakes stage , he sighed and asked if we thought the pacers would have been better off playing miami i got to tell you , as you get older all that stuff leaves you , it really does , he said of the inner conflict but using an unprintable word for stuff when he left the knicks and his luxury apartment on the upper west side , walsh returned to his less pretentious indiana digs , to his wife \( who had continued living there \) and this season to his professional family he moved back into his old office and acquainted himself with the pacers' coach , frank vogel , who had never been a head coach anywhere when he was handed the reins by bird during the 201011 season that once happened in normally starstruck new york , when jeff van gundy replaced don nelson , who had succeeded riley after miller and the pacers broke through in new york two decades later , there are recurring themes all over the place the names of the players have changed , but on a beautiful afternoon in new york , donnie walsh was still sitting pretty , a former knick and a victorious hick
a new federal assault weapons ban and background checks of all gun buyers , which president obama is expected to propose on wednesday , might have done little to prevent the massacre in newtown , conn , last month the semiautomatic rifle that adam lanza used to shoot 20 schoolchildren and 6 adults complied with connecticut s assault weapons ban , the police said , and he did not buy the gun himself but another proposal that mr obama is expected to make could well have slowed mr lanza s rampage banning highcapacity magazines , like the 30round magazines that the police said mr lanza used , which have been factors in several other recent mass shootings those shootings , whose victims have included a member of congress in arizona , moviegoers in colorado and first graders in connecticut , have horrified the country and inspired washington to embark on the most extensive reexamination of the nation s gun laws in a generation but some of the proposals that mr obama is expected to make at the white house on wednesday , which are likely to include a call for expanded background checks , a ban on assault weapons and limits on highcapacity clips , will be intended not only to prevent highprofile mass shootings , but also to curb the more commonplace gun violence that claims many thousands more lives every year the president has made clear that he intends to take a comprehensive approach , jay carney , the white house press secretary , said tuesday mr carney said the proposals were aimed , broadly , at what he called the scourge of gun violence in this country while semiautomatic rifles were used in several recent mass shootings , including those in newtown and in aurora , colo , where 12 people were killed at a movie theater in july , a vast majority of gun murders in the united states are committed with handguns in 2011 , 6 , 220 people were killed by handguns , and 323 by rifles , according to the so while the administration is expected to try to restrict some types of assault weapons , it is also focusing on ways to keep more commonly used firearms out of the hands of dangerous criminals and people with mental illness of course , the administration must keep political realities in mind as it drafts its proposals getting any new gun regulations through congress , particularly through the republicancontrolled house , is seen as difficult so the white house must not only weigh the effectiveness of its proposals , but also their political feasibility the top priority of many gun control groups is to expand the background checks so that they apply to all buyers all federally licensed firearms dealers are required to run background checks through the computerized databases that comprise the but the requirement does not cover guns that are sold by unlicensed sellers at gun shows and in other private sales , which account for about 40 percent of gun purchases in the country better background checks would have had little effect on several recent mass shootings both mr lanza , in connecticut , and jacob t roberts , who opened fire on a mall full of christmas shoppers a few days earlier in clackamas , ore , were using weapons that they did not buy but gun control groups say that expanded background checks would help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals and people with mental illness , and would go a long way toward increasing public safety and could help prevent mass shootings gun control groups have encouraged the administration to look beyond mass shootings when the brady campaign to prevent gun violence , a leading gun control group , issued its recommendations to vice president joseph r biden jr , who has been developing the administration s proposals , it urged him to develop ideas that could help curb everyday gun violence as well every death is a tragedy , whether in a mass shooting that horrifies our entire nation , or one of the 32 gun murders or 90 gun deaths in our communities and homes every day , it wrote with many of the proposals in washington expected to be somewhat limited in scope , some public health researchers and gun control advocates said it was difficult to know what impact the recommendations might have to have a huge , huge effect , we 're going to need a sea change in not just the laws but social norms , david hemenway , the director of the harvard injury control research center american civilians have 250 million to 300 million firearms , said dr garen j wintemute , the director of the violence prevention research program at the university of california , davis those firearms are not going to go away anytime soon , he said more serious steps like those taken by , which reacted to a 1996 mass shooting by banning the sale , importation and possession of semiautomatic rifles and by removing 700 , 000 guns from circulation are seen as politically untenable in the 18 years before the new gun laws , there were 13 mass shootings in australia , and in the decade afterward , there were none , according to a 2006 article in injury prevention , a journal but expanding background checks in the united states would help disrupt criminal gun markets , a crucial driver of urban gun violence , dr wintemute said while there has been a debate over how effective background checks have been , dr wintemute pointed to studies of prisoners incarcerated for crimes involving firearms that have found that at least 80 percent of them obtained their guns through private transfers if we eliminate those , i think it s completely reasonable to expect a substantial drop in crimes related to firearms , he said when a twoday meeting on reducing gun violence wrapped up at johns hopkins university on tuesday afternoon , researchers made some suggestions that have been the subject of relatively little public discussion in washington they called , for example , for expanding the categories of people who are prohibited from buying firearms to include those who have committed violent misdemeanors and they called for banning not just the sale of highcapacity magazines , but their possession as well other measures being discussed in washington include strengthening federal laws to combat gun trafficking gun control advocates argued that other steps were needed as well , like limiting the number of guns that can be bought by an individual every month if you want to dam the river , you have to address all the channels , said josh horwitz , the executive director of the coalition to stop gun violence you 're not going to stop it until you dam the whole river some people who met with mr biden as he developed his recommendations said that they hoped the final proposals would address gun violence in its many forms i think there was a recognition that we 're not going to stop every mass shooting or gun homicide , said hildy saizow , the president of arizonans for gun safety , who met with mr biden last week but we can go a long way to take action that would result in fewer gun deaths , fewer gun injuries this is not just a narrow perspective that the task force is addressing , not just mass shootings or school shootings
a couple of weeks ago , the conservative web site breitbartcom reported that former senator chuck hagel had received financing from a group called friends of hamas  senate sources told breitbart news exclusively that they have been informed that one of the reasons that president barack obama s nominee for secretary of defense , chuck hagel , has not turned over requested documents on his sources of foreign funding is that one of the names listed is a group purportedly called friends of hamas , the web site reported , noting a white house spokesman hung up , when asked about it the hangup was apparently enough of a confirmation to give the report ample attention , especially among conservative pundits there was a report that came out last week , not confirmed yet , andrew mccarthy , a national review contributing editor and former federal prosecutor , said on lou dobbs tonight on the fox business network , that one of the groups behind the speeches may have been an outfit called friends of hamas in the washington times , frank j gaffney jr acknowledged in a piece entitled obama s friends of hamas \? , at this writing and absent the requested disclosure , it cannot be determined whether mr hagel is literally associated with the friends of a designated terrorist organization but , he added , the mere fact , though , that it seems entirely plausible given the nominee s record of hostility toward israel and his affinity for its enemies \( including hamas longtime sponsor , iran \) , should be the last straw for senate republicans and democrats alike yet , there has been no evidence that any such group exists and on wednesday , a reporter with the new york daily news , dan friedman , said he believed he was the inadvertent source of the rumor , born of a joke he made while speaking with a republican aide on capitol hill hagel was in hot water for alleged hostility to israel so i asked my source , had hagel given a speech to , say , the junior league of hezbollah , in france \? and what about friends of hamas \? the names were so overthetop , so linked to terrorism in the middle east , that it was clear i was talking hypothetically and hyperbolically , mr friedman wrote  the breitbart report , he said , hit the following day , leading him to check back with his initial capitol hill contact the person denied sharing my query with breitbart but admitted the chance of having mentioned it to others , mr friedman wrote ben shapiro , who wrote the original breitbart post , is strenuously denying that his report came from a joke originated by mr friedman our senate source denies that friedman is the source of this information i have received this information from three separate sources , none of whom was friedman , the source said
no ballet ensemble has a soul more divided than that of american ballet theater some people think it s one of the world s greatest companies others think it s not really a company at all both arguments make sense , and they largely correspond to which side of lincoln center plaza the troupe is playing in terms of international prestige , its yearly climax is inevitably its eightweek maytojuly season at the metropolitan opera house , in which it relies heavily on visiting stars and fulllength war horses most of those productions come around year after year some of them do poor service to central ballet classics too many of them are formulaic , trite and stale , but offer predictable wow opportunities yet the true high point of ballet theater s year has been its fall season at the david h koch theater , which ended on sunday the troupe projected handsomely on the stage its orchestra sounded good in the pit and the pristine look of the firstfloor foyer uncluttered by any furniture or tacky sculpture with which new york city ballet has been spoiling it at other times was a pleasure ballet theater has usually been at its best in previous fall seasons , mostly occurring at city center but the koch is in most ways an improvement on that the two weeks of repertory were admirably balanced the season closed on sunday with the troupe s three oldest works , each an example of firstrate 20thcentury choreography michel fokine s les sylphides \( 1909 \) , frederick ashton s a month in the country \( 1976 \) and george balanchine s theme and variations \( 1947 \) well served in performance earlier programs had also included seven other works , six of them created for the company \( as was theme \) , five of them this century , three of them this year so we saw established masterworks and modern creations in this short season , several established stars \( notably marcelo gomes , julie kent , gillian murphy \) were at their finest a number of younger principals \( polina semionova and james whiteside \) and eminent soloists \( especially stella abrera , isabella boylston and sarah lane \) made important advances , deepening their artistry and several corps dancers \( above all , gemma bond , skylar brandt , joseph gorak , calvin royal iii , eric tamm and roman zhurbin \) made powerful impressions it was fascinating to watch and rewatch twyla tharp s bach partita \( 1983 \) and mark morris s gong \( 2001 \) , works in which it s fair to feel that the forms \( geometries , hierarchies , vocabulary \) of ballet choreography are being challengingly extended bach partita , in particular , abounded in exciting connections between the dancers and the dance ms semionova suddenly arching back toward the audience at an unusual but becoming angle in mr whiteside s arms , and mr gomes deepening the whole work with the mighty calm of a slow diagonal entry twothirds of the way into the piece are just two of many gleaming moments arguments rightly arose about the latest two pieces by alexei ratmansky for the company , piano concerto 1 and the tempest yes , he s the best fulltime choreographer in ballet today , and yet in these works he often looks as if he s the best of the bad choreographers or the best choreographer to come out of the soviet union his sibelius the tempest is by far the best of the five dance versions of this play i 've seen , but none of them add a jot to my sense of this play his shostakovich piano concerto 1 is a patchwork whose coded drama baffles at the end , two women support two men in pirouettes and then in sculptural attitude positions , with an emphasis that seems to means something but what \? much in these ratmansky works depends on casting the role of prospero in the tempest is n't much , but mr gomes \( first cast \) is not submerged by the longhaired fabio wig , whereas cory stearns \( second \) is ms murphy , ms brandt , mr royal and gabe stone shayer make a strong case for piano concerto 1 , whereas in the alternate cast \( saturday matinee \) , only christine shevchenko and mr tamm do xiomara reyes and daniil simkin , who shared that performance , were problematic presences in other works this season , too in month , there are several dramatic layers to the heroine natalia petrovna \( the chatelaine authority , the selfdramatization \) that elude ms reyes and both of them have technique without style in every role , mr whiteside was assertive and incisive , not only a source of energy but a dramatic presence as caliban \( the tempest \) , he was miscast but his every contribution to gong , bach partita and theme and variations had force the more experienced and handsome mr stearns often makes a milder impression he was finest intoxicating in beliaev s slavflavored dance soliloquy in month the first cast of month , led by ms kent and \( the season s only guest \) guillaume c t , was entirely excellent natalia petrovna is now ms kent s subtle , challenging and eloquent role , beautifully judged in many nuances mr c t proves the best of ballet theater s four beliaevs in terms of grace and skill as the boy kolia , mr simkin is at his best \( though i prefer the innocence and vigor of the secondcast arron scott \) , and ms bond is both touching and exquisite as the ward vera it s to be hoped that the sylphides revival is n't a oneoff fokine s choreography was alive here , not treated with too much reverence or sentimentality and you see what a marvelous training ballet this is , teaching its dancers volumes about line , phrasing and stillness it was especially fine with the propulsive tempos of the conductor david lamarche both ms semionova and veronika part are especially well suited to this ballet but it is ms boylston from the first cast whose spirited mazurka most stays with me which of the company s permanent dancers will make advances next spring at the met \? it s good to see that ms boylston is already announced for five roles it is frustrating that as yet ms brandt is announced for none but few of those fulllength ballets challenge artists in the same way as the best of the fall s oneacters you can best feel ballet theater s heartbeat in its fall seasons would that they were longer

richard gasquet and david ferrer won grueling matches in hot and humid conditions to reach the quarterfinals the difference \? gasquet looked physically and mentally drained ferrer , one of the fittest players on the tour , looked as if he could go another five sets that may be the difference wednesday as well ferrer , the no 4 seed , is the quintessential grinder , willing to run down balls as long as it takes to win he lacks the big weapons of the top players , but is as consistent as a brick wall and rarely loses focus or intensity on court in his match with janko tipsarevic on monday , ferrer found himself in trouble throughout the match but ferrer gave nothing away and worked his way to the win by forcing tipsarevic to go for bigger shots than he was comfortable hitting gasquet , the no 8 seed , improved his fitness dramatically this year , and it paid off against against the bigserving milos raonic but there s fit and there s ferrer , and that s where this match turns like many of the top players , gasquet has far more firepower than ferrer and may even race out to a quick lead the question is whether he can maintain that level of play through four or possibly five sets i don t think he can , and i see ferrer returning to his second straight united states open semifinal they play the second match of the day on arthur ashe stadium tommy robredo vs rafael nadal although it s always hard to see a great one like roger federer fall , give full credit to robredo , who played a smart , disciplined match to oust federer in straight sets monday after the match , federer said he had beaten himself , had made too many errors and hadn t converted opportunities when he had them he was right , which is why i have a hard time seeing wednesday s match with nadal as a competitive one in six previous meetings , robredo has but a single set on his side of the ledger granted , their last meeting was in 2009 , but based on what we ve seen to this point , it s hard to argue nadal isn t playing at or near the best he s played on the hard courts robredo will keep balls in play , and might even steal a set early like philipp kohlschreiber did monday night but nadal will win here in fairly convincing fashion they will play the second match of the night on arthur ashe stadium roberta vinci vs flavia pennetta vinci played like the veteran she is monday taking out the young and talented camila giorgi in straight sets vinci , the no 10 seed , found herself down a break at 41 in the first set , but did not panic or press she stuck to her game plan keeping balls in play , moving the 21yearold around the court and feeding her a steady diet of offspeed slices and it worked vinci broke back , and giorgi s game fell apart after that under a torrent of errors pennetta won t be quite as easy to figure out a former top 10 player herself and threetime quarterfinalist here , pennetta has a game based on quickness and defense to win , vinci will have to do a lot more than keep balls in play she will have to serve well and occasionally force the action at the net to keep pennetta off balance vinci is a terrific doubles player and is quite capable of doing both i see this one going three sets , with vinci squeaking out the win in the end they play the first match of the day on arthur ashe stadium daniela hantuchova vs victoria azarenka hantuchova has played some of her best tennis in years to get to the quarterfinals , her first since 2002 but it also must be noted that her path to this point has been relatively easy hantuchova has yet to play a seeded player , and two of her four opponents were qualifiers none were ranked higher than no 81 azarenka , the no 2 seed and last year s runnerup , had a bit of trouble with ana ivanovic in her fourthround match , dropping the first set before coming back to win in three but it s hard not to see this as the most lopsided of wednesday s matches they play the first match of the evening on arthur ashe stadium television coverage of the united states open kicks off at 11 am on the tennis channel espn2 will pick up coverage at noon and will have prime time coverage beginning at 7 pm action from all the show courts is as well
miami this week is the celebration of the 500th anniversary of juan ponce de le n s purported discovery of florida commemorations include the unveiling of the first landing , a largerthanlife statue of ponce in melbourne beach , as well as the introduction by the postal service of , a fourstamp series timed to honor what is being presented as the founding moment in our country s history these celebrations are a fiesta of illusion as spain s conquistadors discovered , and we too often forget , florida is like playdoh take the goo mold it to your dream then watch the dream ooze back into goo contrary to what our school books taught us , ponce did not discover florida he never did much of anything here except get himself killed florida probably was first sighted by portuguese navigators , or perhaps by the cabots sailing from england either way , it started appearing on maps as early as 1500 by 1510 , its distinctive peninsular shape had emerged clearly on maps in europe by 1513 , when ponce de l on first arrived , so many europeans had visited florida that some indians greeted him in spanish ponce never went anywhere near st augustine , the city where he is said to have discovered the fountain of youth he was not an old man that tale was concocted by washington irving more than 300 years later ponce was after gold , but florida had none to be found he left and might never have returned but for the news that cort s had found gold in mexico in 1521 ponce envious , vigorous , avaricious made the fatal mistake of trying his florida luck again on that second voyage he achieved one real florida first , albeit an inglorious one in a skirmish with native inhabitants , ponce fired the first shots in what would turn into a 300year war of ethnic cleansing more american soldiers would die trying to subdue florida than in all the indian battles in the west ponce himself was struck by an arrow the wound was n't serious , but the spaniards were as indifferent to sepsis as they were alert to heresy what if ponce had returned to spain with little vials that he claimed contained the elixir of immortality \? he would have been transferred expeditiously into the hands of the inquisition instead , he died of fever in havana , having discovered nothing , founded nothing and achieved nothing ponce was only the first dreamer to have florida swallow up his ambitions arriving in 1539 , hernando de soto wandered fruitlessly across the future southeast before dying mad and broke , having squandered his fortune in gold looted from peru he did leave one legacy his pigs , the ancestors of the feral pigs that today rummage around america in the millions de soto was the johnny appleseed of pigs that account of his explorations you were taught in school was made up by a congressional commission in the 1930s alarmed at how florida destroyed rather than created wealth , king philip ii banned further expeditions as one royal report pointed out , florida was too poor in resources , and her harbors too barred and shallow to permit practicable settlement that was until 1565 , when spanish spies discovered france had established a settlement near presentday jacksonville on the king s orders a ruthless henchman named pedro men ndez de avil s tore across the atlantic and brutally massacred the french it was men ndez who founded st augustine and established european rule for the first time in the future united states thanks to him , florida became the place where our country s first slaughter of white men by white men took place as we like to forget , america was forged in bloodshed the spanish never named anything after ponce de le n it was the plutocrat henry flagler raised , like every redblooded american boy back then , on the tales of washington irving who resurrected the explorer in the 1880s , naming his grandiose hotel in st augustine after him the ponce de l on hotel , like flagler s florida railroad , lost money from the start i would have been a rich man , the tycoon later remarked , if it had n't been for florida then , in the late 1920s , a georgia preacher s son named walter fraser bought some st augustine swampland at depressionera prices a pr genius , fraser turned a desecrated graveyard into the fountain of youth attraction so many of us visited as children to this day floridians keep trying to turn swampland into real estate , then act surprised when they sink in the muck if we took the trouble to understand the past , we might stop building our lives on top of sinkholes even the organizers of the festivities now admit the truth about ponce , but florida s true history wo n't keep them from celebrating this big quincentennial nonevent a companion to all those confederate victories that never happened , a prelude for the 200th anniversary celebrations of america s purchase of florida , which also never happened as men ndez showed , the pretense of the new world s moral exceptionalism was unfounded from the start violence and delusion made florida what it is today as the state s unceasing melodramas demonstrate , they stalk us still we fool ourselves and ill serve our children when we deny the true , often tragic nature of history
nitin grover , a 33yearold lawyer , has been dreaming of moving from his rented home to an apartment of his own in 2008 , mr grover and his wife , who were paying monthly rent of 30 , 000 rupees , or nearly 500 at the current exchange rate , surveyed the real estate landscape around new delhi , india s capital they decided to buy a place in gurgaon , on the outskirts of the city the grovers chose an apartment from delhi land and finance , or dlf , one of india s largest real estate companies they took a loan to buy an apartment worth 8 million rupees , and dlf promised to deliver it three years later , in february 2011 but more than two and a half years after the promised delivery date , dlf has yet to turn over the apartment to the grovers , who now have a 3yearold son i thought once i got the house in 2011 , we wouldn t need to pay for a rented apartment along with our loan repayments , mr grover said but dlf kept delaying the construction , and what was worse is that none of the buyers had any rights to take them to task for it mr grover said dlf had added more floors and towers to the complex , called new town heights , and altered the layout of the apartments these homes do not even have doors or toilets , he said , referring to stillincomplete apartments some people were given possession in underconstruction towers desperate buyers took it anyway in september , several of the project s home buyers protested near the indian parliament , burning effigies of dlf s owners , who include the billionaire kushal pal singh the real estate company s management admits its failure to deliver the homes on time but blames the global economic downturn and other factors for the delays there is no intention to deliberately cheat people or delay projects , said rajeev talwar , the company s executive group director dlf has faced problems after the 2008 global economic crisis there has been a general downturn in construction and financing the number of clearances required further complicate matters the cost of inputs like steel and cement has risen substantially and the government s rural employment guarantee scheme has led to a shortage in labor developers set their own deadlines in the agreements with home buyers , and most developers promise to deliver the houses within three years of inking the agreement as of this past july , according to data by propequity , a real estate research firm , builders around new delhi had delivered homes by the promised date to only 23 percent of purchasers in many instances , the developers missed their deadlines for the delivery date by years the real estate companies have also accumulated huge inventories , hoping to cash in on rising real estate prices in and around new delhi a report in the business standard newspaper estimated that 19 of india s top builders had unsold inventories , which includes stock that is not yet completed , worth 15 billion dlf contributed to almost a third of those projects , the paper said  over the last few years , developers have launched too many projects without completing existing ones , said ashutosh limaye , an analyst at jones lang lasalle , a global real estate consulting and property management firm handling several projects with limited cash flows leads to problems at the execution end a real estate analyst , who did not want to be identified for fear of damaging his business relationships , explained that whenever a developer faced low sales for a particular project , there was a temptation to start a new project , using money from the new project to finish the older one and if the market declines further , the developer might start a third project to raise money for the second one this practice has led to the delay or abandonment of many projects , insiders say middle class home buyers like mr grover have little political clout and usually lack the ability to sustain a protracted legal battle against a developer nevertheless , some are fighting back shailendra bais , a 38yearold management professional from delhi , is among the 896 home buyers trying to get delivery of their homes from the unitech group , another of india s biggest real estate companies from march 2009 to september 2011 , mr bais paid unitech 90 percent of the 4 million rupees owed for an apartment in gurgaon he had been promised possession in september 2011 construction had begun in 2009 it is not yet half complete , mr bais said of the project , called uniworld gardensii i have invested my life s savings into this unitech management told home buyers like mr bais that it was unable to complete the residential towers because unauthorized people had encroached upon the road leading to them that is a lie , said joginder singh , a 41yearold buyer from gurgaon who works for a recruiting firm all of us have paid 95 percent of the cost of the house mr singh said he believed that unitech had used the money from uniworld gardensii home buyers to start more lucrative projects and that it had abandoned the apartments last may , unitech announced a luxury apartment complex , the one , where apartments would come with outdoor jacuzzis and there would be bistros and concierge service an apartment at the one would cost 45 million rupees unitech completed onetenth of this new project even before announcing it , making home buyers like mr singh and mr bais suspicious unitech did not complete our homes , even after we had paid 95 percent of the cost , but they started work on upmarket houses for which they had not collected a single penny from rich buyers , mr bais said the developers also are accused by clients of pushing middleclass home buyers to sign abusive contracts the contracts say the developers must give the home buyers possession of the homes within 30 months , but if the builder doesn t deliver on time , the buyer can t hold him accountable , said ml lahoty , a lawyer at the supreme court of india , who is representing home buyers in a case against dlf if the home buyers delay payment , even by a day , they have to pay the developer an 18 percent punitive interest in august , the united progressive alliance , the governing coalition of india led by the congress party , introduced a real estate regulation and development bill in the upper house of parliament the legislation seeks to protect buyers from predatory practices by real estate companies one part of the bill would deter builders from advertising residential projects without getting government clearances beforehand cheating real estate agents could be sentenced to as much as three years in jail the bill is seen as an attempt by the government to win over middleclass voters , who are increasingly drifting toward the opposition bharatiya janata party the government wants to get the bill passed in the winter session of parliament , and developers are lobbying hard against its passage this bill is all about penalizing developers and does not provide any relief mechanism , said mr talwar , the dlf executive whether the real estate bill will become law is unclear , but at least one determined home buyer has won a battle against dlf in an indian court in 2005 , amit jain , a 32yearold management executive from delhi , who was working in dallas , returned to india to set up an offshore office for his information technology company in gurgaon a year later , mr jain bought a house in belaire , a residential complex developed by dlf in gurgaon , and he rented an apartment in a building next to the construction site every morning i used to wake up , look out of my window and see that no work was being done , mr jain said i told the dlf , if you are not building my house , i couldn t invest anymore in 2008 , mr jain , who had paid 10 million rupees toward his house , stopped paying dlf , and the developer canceled his booking he was shocked to find that dlf said he must forfeit 5 million rupees half the amount he had paid mr jain took dlf to the competition commission of india , the country s business monopoly regulator , which in a landmark judgment imposed a penalty of 63 billion rupees on dlf and ordered that the contracts of dlf home buyers be modified the money was to be paid to government coffers i don t need the money anymore , mr jain said i don t even need that house to live here is to keep fighting the system at every point i want to make sure that these builders do not behave like they are rajahs and home buyers are slaves sai manish is a freelance journalist based in new delhi
on an evening in late october , several hundred parents crowded into a temple bethel auditorium near downtown san antonio to learn about a new school opening next fall they were told of a campus culture that makes the cultivation of wisdom and virtue a top priority , instead of standardized test scores , but still sends most students to top colleges and universities there would be a strict uniform policy and an atmosphere in which parents could feel safe dropping off their children for the day during a roughly 90minute presentation that namedropped aristotle , thomas aquinas , herodotus , john locke and dostoyevsky , the parents heard about a liberal arts curriculum steeped heavily in the western classical canon that tackled the primordial human questions , nourishing intellect and character the people in this room , you have an opportunity to get into this school , not the wait list , dave williams , the school s executive director , told them mr williams was not describing an elite private academy but a publicly financed , as phoenixbased great hearts in addition to its san antonio location , the school is awaiting the state s final approval to open a campus in dallas along with basis , a second arizonabased school that opened its doors in northwest san antonio this year , great hearts' presence signifies the emergence of a new kind of charter school in texas often dependent on infusions of private money and parents' contributions to supplement their programs , these schools go after students seeking intensely focused academics in a collegiate atmosphere and acknowledge that they do not serve every kind of student but that reliance on additional fees and other policies at the new schools have amplified an already contentious debate over charter schools' role in the public school system the schools are academically rigorous any kid can go , but these schools are n't going to be for every kid , just as harvard or princeton is n't for every kid , said phil handler , a spokesman for basis if your kid is there , we 'll do everything we can to help them keep up , but for some kids it s not the kind of education they want unlike many texas charters , particularly kipp and idea public schools which both formed with a mission to reach economically disadvantaged communities basis and great hearts tend to end up with student bodies that are disproportionately affluent and white at the 16 campuses that great hearts operates in the phoenix area \( where nearly 60 percent of public school students are hispanic or black \) , 69 percent of the nearly 7 , 000 students are white only two of great hearts' arizona campuses participate in a federal program that offers free and reducedprice meals for lowincome students of the almost 5 , 000 basis students in phoenix , tucson and scottsdale , roughly 12 percent are hispanic and 2 percent are black none of the eight campuses offer free and reducedprice meals , which is also the case at the san antonio school both basis and great hearts have come to san antonio as part of choose to succeed , an effort backed by a coalition of local philanthropic foundations , in a bid to increase the city s number of charter schools the operators , recruited particularly for their success in sending nearly all of their graduates to select colleges and universities , have received about 3 million each through the yearold campaign , which aims to establish 80 , 000 new seats in charter classrooms the equivalent of more than 20 percent of bexar county s public school population by 2026 choose to succeed has committed roughly 30 million to expanding the operations of six charter school networks in the city to date , most of that money has gone to the texasbased kipp and idea public schools about 5 million is earmarked for rocketship and carpe diem , which are known for their extensive virtuallearning programs taken together , all six charter operators reflect the diversity of the families that choose to succeed wants to serve , said matthew randazzo , the group s president and chief executive as a community , about twothirds of our kids in san antonio are lowincome , and we wanted to build a movement and a set of operators that really mirrored our community , he said but some policies at great hearts and basis have raised doubts about their commitment to economically disadvantaged or otherwise academically challenging children concern over great hearts' model led the nashville school district to deny its charter application last year because of what one official described as serious and persistent questions about their definitions of excellence , and reliance on selectivity and mission fit for success both great hearts and basis are what julian vasquez heilig , a professor at the university of texas at austin s college of education , refers to as la carte schools , because while they are tuitionfree , they charge fees for uniforms , field trips , extracurricular activities and athletics in some instances , that can amount to more than 1 , 000 per student annually on top of those fees , parents are also encouraged to assist the schools financially through personal donations with neither school providing transportation to their campuses , parents with limited financial means could face an additional obstacle in texas , charter operators may exclude students only based on their disciplinary history they cannot consider factors like socioeconomic background , race or past academic performance in the application process but those prohibitions can be insufficient to prevent a practice some education policy experts call creaming , in which charter schools pull in only the highestachieving or most dedicated students from traditional public schools that can also happen after students enroll in charters , where a lack of remedial support and rigorous curriculum can lead weaker students not to return some charters have perfected the art of creating barriers to lowincome kids , mr heilig said if you have to run a steeplechase to get into a school , most lowincome parents are n't able to do that , especially when they are working two or three jobs \( the university of texas at austin is a corporate sponsor of the texas tribune \) peter bezanson , great hearts' chief academic officer , said that in nashville , the school board had manufactured complaints about the school because it did not want the competition he said the school s financial inability to provide transportation created a challenge , but that parents organized car pools and distributed busroute information and that the school never allowed financial need to keep a student from participating in a trip or extracurricular activity for us , diversity is really hard , mr bezanson said it s been something that is really important to us , and we 've worked really hard to increase our access to diverse student populations and markets
washington congressional democrats , torn over involving the united states in another unpredictable middle east war , are emerging as a major barrier to president obama s plan to strike syria many of the president s core supporters , especially africanamericans and members of the democratic party s liberal wing who voted repeatedly against the wars in iraq and afghanistan , are expressing the deepest reservations with rankandfile house republicans showing little inclination to back mr obama on an issue on which he has staked his political credibility , scores of democratic votes will be needed if a resolution authorizing force against syria is to pass the house democrats say they are being confronted with a difficult choice go against the wishes of a president who is popular and well respected in their caucus , or defy voters back home who are overwhelmingly opposed to another united states military intervention overseas in the first sign of how splits within the party will loom large over the syria debate , two democrats voted no and a third voted present on wednesday when a divided senate committee approved a useofforce resolution with senators from both parties crossing over there are two major considerations to take into account , said representative hakeem jeffries , a freshman from new york and member of the black caucus the prestige of an administration we strongly support versus an openended conflict in the middle east that risks the lives of the people we represent if war were to break out not to mention the diversion of resources back into our communities that sorely need it in a reversal of the usual power dynamic in the house , the fate of the resolution rests to a large degree with representative nancy pelosi of california , the democratic leader and former speaker ms pelosi has not faced a bigger test from the president since she helped push his health care overhaul through the house without republican support in 2010 though she has said the vote will be a matter of conscience for her members , she is working assiduously behind the scenes with white house officials as they try to forge a path toward passage since meeting with the president on tuesday , ms pelosi has been gathering suggestions from her members about how to tweak his proposal so it can win their support her efforts come as the white house is taking additional steps to convert some of the most skeptical democrats on wednesday the white house chief of staff , denis r mcdonough , convened a conference call for members of the house progressive caucus early next week , susan e rice , the president s national security adviser , will brief members of the congressional black caucus but even with her widely acknowledged ability to marshal her members in the toughest of political predicaments , ms pelosi could find that in matters of conscience like war , party loyalty is not as powerful a force as it has been for her in the past i wasn t elected just to go along to get along , said representative gregory w meeks , another new yorker leaning against supporting military action in syria i was elected to utilize my thought process and to determine what i think is in the best interest of my district other democrats who have expressed strong reservations include many veteran members like jim mcgovern of massachusetts , jim mcdermott of washington and earl blumenauer of oregon the divisions within the party do not break down neatly along the usual lines that have separated the antiwar democrats from the hawks those who are deeply conflicted about how to proceed include liberals who are ordinarily suspicious of using military force but feel compelled to punish president bashar alassad of syria over accusations that his forces staged a chemical attack against civilians there are also members who represent primarily minority and urban districts where the president s word carries a lot of weight but voters are preoccupied with how spending cuts are hurting public assistance and threatening social security and medicare  and there are democrats who are weighing an appeal from a president they admire who happens to have strong antiwar credentials himself whose reputation could suffer greatly here and abroad if congress denies him its blessing representative elijah e cummings , who represents a district that includes parts of baltimore and has not decided how he stands on attacking syria , said the pressure from his constituents to oppose the president s plan is unmistakable when he visited a grocery store on wednesday , he said , almost a dozen people told him they thought intervening in syria was a bad idea none of them expressed support if you ve got 95 percent of them saying one thing , it becomes far more difficult to go against them , he said , adding that the president needed to make a more forceful and convincing case to the public if he wanted congressional consent for an attack as a good friend of his and someone who supports him , i think he s got to help the congress help him
the derby contenders vyjack and normandy invasion are also being considered for the preakness fear the kitten is no longer in the mix orb was an impressive winner of the 139th kentucky derby he arrived at his home base , belmont park , on sunday night assuming that he comes out of his derby race well , he will head to pimlico race course in a week for an attempt to win the preakness stakes , the second leg of the triple crown because orb wowed saturday , many of those who raced with him in the derby will likely pass on the preakness stakes as of now , only five other derby starters are considering the preakness  the secondplace finisher , the longshot golden soul , is planning on waiting to challenge for the belmont stakes , the third leg of the crown he will have freshness on his side at that point revolutionary , who finished third , was the best finisher of the trainer todd pletcher s five starters at this point , none of those starters are expected to return to challenge orb in baltimore overanalyze and revolutionary may return to for the belmont the plans for the fourthplace finisher , normandy invasion , appear to be fluid the goal for the horse will be to ready him for the travers stakes at saratoga this summer , with one or two races in preparation of that goal the preakness is not currently being considered as a potential next start mylute , who finished a credible fifth in the derby for jockey rosie napravnik , may return in the preakness napravnik is now the highestplaced woman jockey in kentucky derby history she also won her first race as a jockey at pimlico if mylute does return in the preakness , he may also be joined by a pair of d wayne lukas trainees , oxbow \( sixth in the derby \) and will take charge \( eighth \) itsmyluckyday , who finished a disappointing 15th in the derby , appears to have come out of the race in good order , despite not enjoying the sloppy conditions of the track saturday if he continues to do well , he will be pointed for the preakness goldencents , trained by doug o neill , who sat close to the early pace of the derby before folding to finish a wellbeaten 17th , is the final derby starter who is currently being considered for the preakness between now and the preakness , it is possible that one or two other derby starters will be considered for the race much will depend upon how they bounce back from their derby effort it would appear , however , that the strength of the performance of the derby winner , orb , has dissuaded a few horsemen from taking a shot if , for whatever reason , orb does not return in the preakness , other derby starters may reemerge for consideration new shooters , those who did not race in the derby , will also be under consideration for the preakness these include fear the kitten , who was on the alsoeligible list for the derby but did not run in the race the bob bafferttrainee govenor charlie , who most recently won the sunland derby bellarmine , who won an allowance race at churchill downs on saturday for the trainer ken mcpeek and the illinois derby winner departing there will likely be one or two others who are also being considered for the second leg this will bring the total field size of the preakness to about 12
the dreadful monotony and morbidity of the gun control discussion in this country has left me dispirited another mass shooting another round of shock , sadness and outrage another pitched discussion about rights and responsibilities , mental illness and background checks and then nothing the pundits debate merits the public demands action but in the end , nra intimidation pressures the cowards in congress to maintain the status quo and scare ordinary citizens into believing that they face extraordinary threats from the burglars out to steal property to a government out to rob them of their guns and the second amendment as president obama told telemundo i do get concerned that this becomes a ritual that we go through every three , four months , where we have these horrific mass shootings , and yet , we 're not willing to take some basic actions that we know could make a difference but it has become a ritual , and we or at least too many of our congressmen and congresswomen are too afraid to act we are stuck in a cycle of savagery as one shooter after another catches us in his sights one reason we talk past one another on guns is that we 're talking from vastly different worldviews according to a march report by the pew research center , gun owners are more likely to be men than women , older rather than younger , white rather than black or hispanic , live in the midwest and south , live in rural or suburban areas , and be married in many ways , this gun ownership division reflects the ideological split in our politics another reason is that nra and gun lobby scare tactics have been depressingly effective they raise the dander of oneissue voters to dazzling effect , and that leaves politicians groveling at their feet so rational discussion gets lost in the weeds of extreme rhetoric this is not an allornothing battle but we must approach the issue and the facts with an open mind and we have to start with one point the vast majority of gun owners are responsible , lawabiding citizens they own guns for protection , hunting , sports or even as collectors if most of these people were n't responsible , there would be far more mass shootings than there are now the problem , rather , is that there are simply too many guns in this country to ever ensure that some portion will not fall into the hands of the criminally inclined or the violently insane gun proliferation is a chicken that has come home to roost according to the genevabased there were an estimated 270 million civilian firearms in this country in 2011 the country with the second highest number of weapons 46 million was india , which has nearly four times the population of america a november 2012 congressional research service report put the estimate even higher , at approximately 310 million firearms available to citizens that s almost one gun to every man , woman and child in this country that leads to this idea of gunsasprotection , the idea that because criminals already have guns , lawabiding citizens need to have them too , just to even the playing field or dare i say , killing field according to that march pew report , protection has replaced hunting as the no 1 reason that people own guns the notion that the world is more dangerous than it used to be and you can be kept safe only with more guns is a linchpin of the nra argument and a profit inflater for the gun industry as the nra s executive vice president , wayne lapierre , put it the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a  the only problem is that the facts do n't neatly line up with that line of reasoning a june report from the institute of medicine and the national research council entitled to reduce the threat of firearmrelated violence had some intriguing but not conclusive findings according to the report , there were about 300 , 000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 however , the estimated range of defensive uses of firearms ranged from 108 , 000 to more than three million furthermore , the report pointed out that studies of the effectiveness of the defensive use of guns have found consistently lower injury rates among gun using crime victims compared with victims who used other selfprotective strategies however , the study hastened to add even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime , it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public concealed or open carry may have a different net effect on the rate of injury for example , if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide , homicide , or the use of weapons by those who invade the homes of gun owners this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use furthermore , a in the american journal of public health found the following we observed a robust correlation between higher levels of gun ownership and higher firearm homicide rates although we could not determine causation , we found that states with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearmrelated homicides the ambiguity here points to a much larger problem the dearth of serious scientific studies on gun violence to the vice president and the gun violence commission members , signed by more than 100 researchers from respected universities , pointed out that from 1973 to 2012 , there were more than four million firearm injuries in america meanwhile , the letter said , the national institutes of health granted only three major research awards to study the epidemic over that time by comparison , there were just 400 cases of cholera in america during that period , but the nih awarded 212 major research awards to study the disease this is in part because congress discourages serious study of this issue as the letter points out subsection c of section 503 and 218 of fy2013 appropriations act governing nih and cdc funding still contains the language none of the funds made available in this title may be used , in whole or in part , to advocate or promote gun control' we could get serious about this issue we could turn away from scaring people and toward scientific principles we could commit more money to more studies about the causes of and solutions to gun violence in this country , while sidestepping the talkingpoint spouters and the finger pointers and the profit makers but that would require courage and commitment , qualities that sadly run a deficit in washington
is over the inlaws are gone and christmas is not yet here it s a cold weekend day , not much happening , and you head to the strip mall flatscreens beckon , chromebooks too , and assorted pads , pods and tablets you turn on the radio , find your trusty litefm station , and settle in for some elton , celine , shania and mariah but there s no elton none of the usual celine and as for mariah , there is no hero or honey , just all i want for christmas is you , surrounded by oodles of christmas songs by nat king cole , andy williams and the chipmunks and the christmas chestnuts of bruce springsteen and paul mccartney when beset by the 1953 novelty hit i want a hippopotamus for christmas , you finally change the station you have wandered into the allchristmasmusic format , now spreading holiday cheer on the airwaves everywhere since first tried in phoenix or was it atlanta \? about 20 years ago , switching to christmas music between thanksgiving and christmas has become more popular every year stations see huge gains in listeners , and hundreds of programming directors , in every state , are giving roundtheclock christmas music a try , hoping to spike the ratings eggnog what began as a trend at adultcontemporary stations \( elton , celine , phil collins you get the idea \) is now spreading to stations with other formats , like country christian stations , too , are switching to christmas music , although therein lies a paradox for secular stations , the christmas format is as religious as they get all year , while at christian stations , the format means less jesus than usual , more radio chipmunks and hippopotami mike kinosian , the managing editor of radioinfo , a trade publication , has been covering this trend since almost the beginning , but he is not sure how it began everybody wants to take credit for a great thing , but nobody can seem to remember with any veracity what station it was ! mr kinosian said he said jerry ryan , for many years the program director at kesz in phoenix , is rumored to have been the first at a large station to go allchristmas music mr ryan could not be found and mr kinosian , who could not swear to the who , was also fuzzy on the when it has to be 18 years ago \? 1995 \? he guessed mid'90s is a safe bet but hold your reindeer since 2003 , vance dillard has been the program director for 94fm , known as the fish , one of two stations in the nashville area that goes allchristmas music for the holiday season he programs allchristmas music for 90 other christian stations owned , like the fish , by salem communications and while he , too , has heard that phoenix was first , he said he had the idea himself , and he gives dates earlier than the time frame attributed to phoenix i was one of the pioneers of christmas radio , mr dillard said when i was at peach in atlanta that was wpch , now a different station we began to do that back in 1988 the peach was owned by clear channel communications , for whom mr dillard also worked as brand manager so i influenced a lot of other clear channel adult contemporary stations across the country i 'd go in and tell the general managers and the program directors , tell them , you have to embrace christmas' according to , which tracks radio formats , 533 stations are currently playing only christmas music \( that list includes a handful of hd stations , not available on all receivers \) paul heine , a senior editor at inside radio , which runs the website , said that these stations could expect a lot of new listeners , although not all of them stick around in january during the holiday period , it s like ratings rocket fuel for stations that do a good job with the format and that are known as the christmas station in their marketplace , mr heine said so we 've seen where a station can double or even triple its overall ratings admittedly , it s a shortterm boost , just for months of november and december , but it draws in a massive amount of new listeners when mr dillard was at clear channel , he was spreading the format mainly to other adultcontemporary stations , which still represent the substantial majority of those who use it it s actually pretty easy for those stations to go allchristmas many of the artists their listeners are used to , like mr springsteen or ms carey , have recorded christmas songs the same listeners usually enjoy the nostalgic mist of christmas oldies , like bing crosby s white christmas , that are also in heavy rotation it s at stations that play christian music where christmas music may not fit so easily there s a slight disagreement amongst some christian stations , mr kinosian said do we play only the religious' music , or can we blend in contemporary music \? ' they want to be able to play christmas music , but do they want to play 100 percent religious music away in a manger , god rest ye , merry gentlemen or can they play something that has a little bit of fun to it \? he said that christian stations settle on varying ratios of the secular and the religious mr dillard , a christian who now programs for christian stations , said that he had no theological concerns i understand there are other christian stations that are going to stick strictly to christian songs , mr dillard said but all of those songs are part of the memories people have the movies people see , the tv they watch even churches , at their christmas pageants , the first half is usually lighthearted fun for the family , and then there s plenty of room for the message i do n't think we do harm to our mission to honor jesus christ we 're just being more seekerfriendly in our approach
vinyl is growing out of its niche there were always record collectors who disdained the compact disc , arguing that an lp s grooves yielded warmth and depth that the cd s digital code could not match but the market largely ignored them record labels shuttered their lp pressing plants , except for a few that pressed mostly dance music , since vinyl remained the medium of choice for d js as it turned out , that early resistance was not futile , thanks largely to an audience of record collectors , many born after cds were introduced in the 1980s these days , every major label and many smaller ones are releasing vinyl , and most major new releases have a vinyl version , leading to a spate of new pressing plants when the french electronica duo released random access memories in midmay , 6 percent of its firstweek sales 19 , 000 out of 339 , 000 were on vinyl , according to nielsen soundscan , which measures music sales other groups with a predominantly collegeage audience have had similar success the same week , the national sold 7 , 000 vinyl copies of its latest album , trouble will find me , and 10 , 000 vampire weekend fans opted for the lp version of modern vampires of the city when the , a new jersey indie band , posted a photo of their players carrying stacks of lp mailing boxes on their recently , their label , bar none , racked up what glenn morrow , who owns the label , described as phone orders for 2 , 000 worth of lps in 10 minutes a growing number of classic albums including and early rolling stones and bob dylan catalogs have had vinyl reissues in recent years as well michael fremer , who monitors the lp world on his web site , , said none of these companies are pressing records to feel good they 're doing it because they think they can sell about a dozen pressing plants have sprouted up in the united states , along with the few that survived from the first vinyl era , and they say business is so brisk that they are working to capacity , who started in 2000 , says his company makes about 440 , 000 lps a year , but a giant like , in canoga park , calif , turns out 6 million to 72 million , said steve sheldon , its general manager one plant , , in salina , kan , opened in 2011 after its owner , chad kassem , grew impatient with delays at a larger plant where his own line of blues reissues was being pressed his company , which runs four presses acquired used , but modified to run more efficiently now makes lps for all the majors , and lists jimi hendrix , eric clapton and nirvana reissues among its recent projects he is currently pressing 900 , 000 vinyl discs a year we 've always had more work than we could do , mr kassem said when we had one press , we had enough orders for two when we had two , we had enough orders for four we never spent a dollar on advertising , but we 've been busy from the day we opened there is a limit to how much the vinyl business can expand right now when it seemed inevitable that cds would supplant lps , the companies that made vinyl presses shifted to making other kinds of machinery the last new press was built in 1982 , so relatively recent startups like quality and brooklyn phono searched out used presses \( the going rate is about 25 , 000 \) and reconditioned them most plants have deals with local machine shops to make replacement parts some pressing plants have looked into commissioning or building new presses but have found the cost prohibitive as much as 500 , 000 , said eric astor of furnace mfg in fairfax , va since my partner also owns a cd dvd plant , mr astor said in an email , we 've been testing using the methods used in disc manufacturing to make a new breed of vinyl record , but that rd is slow going and not looking promising how are lps selling \? that is a matter of dispute david bakula , nielsen soundscan s senior vice president of client development and insights , said that last year , an 18 percent increase over 2011 , but still only 14 percent of the total market , made up mostly of digital downloads \( which are increasing \) and cds \( for which sales are declining \) this year , mr bakula said , vinyl sales are on track to reach about 55 million but manufacturers , specialist retailers and critics argue that soundscan s figures represent only a fraction of actual sales , perhaps as little , mr kassem and mr astor said , as 10 to 15 percent they say that about 25 million vinyl discs were pressed in the united states last year , and many more in europe and asia , including some destined for the american market mr bakula countered that manufacturers are speaking of the number of discs made soundscan tracks how many were sold but the manufacturers argue that lps , unlike cds , are a oneway sale labels do not accept returns of unsold copies therefore labels and retailers are careful to order only what they think they can sell moreover , lp jackets do not consistently carry bar codes mr kassem , for one , leaves them off his discs because , he said , they 're ugly and therefore cannot be scanned at the cash register and many shops that sell lps are independents that do not report to soundscan , although mr bakula said his company weights its figures to account for that there are other measures of the health of the field , including figures from ancillary businesses heinz lichtenegger , whose viennabased audio tuning company produces the highly regarded project turntable , said in an email that his company sells 8 , 000 turntables a month and mr fremer has sold 16 , 000 copies of a dvd , that shows users how to set up several turntable models vinyl retailers are thriving as well mr kassem of quality record pressings also runs , which sells lps as well as turntables and accessories , including cleaning machines and protective sleeves , a chicago company that owns , a storied audiophile label , has a similarly broad stock , including a selection of turntables that ranges from the 249 to the 25 , 000 josh bizar , the company s director of sales and marketing , said that music direct sold 500 , 000 lps and thousands of turntables last year and the buyers , mr bizar said , are by no means boomer nostalgists when you look at the sales for a group like daft punk , he said , you 're seeing young kids collecting records like we did when we were young we never expected the vinyl resurgence to become as crazy as it is , he said but it s come full circle we get kids calling us up and telling us why they listen to vinyl , and when we ask them why they do n't listen to cds , they say , cds \? my dad listens to cds why would i do that \?

johannesburg the day before reeva steenkamp died , she was getting ready to give a speech on a subject that she had known first hand and that is endemic in violence against women in the four months that she had been dating the sprinter , she had become a celebrity , and she had big plans for using her newfound fame to make a difference so she canceled a coffee date with her best friend , gina myers , to keep working on her speech she was so excited , said ms myers , whose family had offered ms steenkamp a room in their house when her lease was up five months ago she called to say she was n't finished yet she had been in an abusive relationship in the past and she wanted passionately to speak out about it , ms myers said she said that people chose to be ignorant because the subject made them uncomfortable but ms steenkamp s ambition to do more than modeling ended on feb 14 , when mr pistorius as she was locked in a tiny bathroom off his bedroom now , this stunned country is debating whether she died from the same scourge of domestic violence she was hoping to fight , or if she became a tragic victim of a national fixation on crime and selfdefense mr pistorius maintains that he killed her by accident , believing that she was an intruder who had climbed through an open window nearby in the dark , he said , he had not noticed that ms steenkamp , 29 , was no longer on her side of the bed south africa s prosecutors have rejected his version of events , calling the explanation unrealistic and putting forth a picture of mr pistorius as a hotheaded , reckless young man with a tendency toward jealous behavior for now , mr pistorius , 26 , is out on bail , living in his uncle s house in pretoria and awaiting on june 4 family members describe him as in mourning last week , his public relations company announced that he was holding a private memorial for ms steenkamp in his uncle s house , a move that was met with skepticism in the south african news media if there was trouble in the relationship , none have yet stepped up to say they knew about it ms myers , a makeup artist who talked to ms steenkamp frequently in her last weeks , said everything appeared normal between the young couple mr pistorius s friends , in affidavits to the court , said that he was in love and not afraid to say so he was making plans to have her travel with him to races , something he had never done before still , by many accounts they were an odd match ms steenkamp , despite her embrace of the limelight , rarely went to nightclubs , did n't like to drink and was known for her banana bread , friends and family say one of her favorite activities was to get in bed with a cup of tea those who knew her well said that she was a hard worker , always with a smile , though she often worried about making enough money to help support her parents in their retirement mr pistorius , by contrast , liked fast cars , gun ranges and johannesburg s night life in january , according to the police , he was involved in the accidental discharge of a gun at a shopping mall cafe before that , the police said , he had threatened to beat up a man at a racetrack and break another man s legs on another occasion , he was arrested on an assault charge and spent the night in jail a spokesman for mr pistorius said he would not comment on those matters or any others ms steenkamp s cousin , kim martin , who had breakfast with the couple recently , could not help thinking that mr pistorius was not at all like ms steenkamp s last boyfriend her old boyfriend was much more like her , she said , a quiet guy , family oriented whatever the result of the trial , the events have sent south africans into a frenzy of selfexamination some see the case as yet another reminder that south africa remains a violent society and one in which many whites , like mr pistorius , live in heavily guarded communities , but still fear attacks by the black majority and feel entitled to take matters into their own hands mr pistorius , who was born without fibulas and had his legs amputated below the knee as an infant , seemed obsessed with his personal safety he slept with a gun by his bed and kept a cricket bat handy he sometimes went to a shooting range when he had trouble sleeping at night , cheerily tweeting about his shooting prowess and how he had gone into full combat recon mode in november when he came home and thought there was an intruder in his spacious house in the silver lakes estates in pretoria it turned out to be nothing more than a washing machine in fact , the home invasion mr pistorius feared represents only a tiny percentage of crimes in south africa , and is even more rare within gated communities like his , which are often protected by brick walls , electric fences , motion sensors and video cameras of the 2 million serious crimes reported every year , roughly 16 , 000 are home invasion robberies , according to rudolph zinn , a criminologist at the university of south africa the vast majority of violent crime is committed by blacks and against blacks some columnists here have criticized mr pistorius for saying that he was worried for his safety when he shot into the small toilet enclosure without waiting to hear the intruder s voice the man dubbed as the blade runner has articulated , to the point of triteness , the most popularly espoused white , middleclass south african paranoia , niren tolsi in a commentary for the weekly mail and guardian for those more inclined to believe that he shot ms steenkamp in a rage , her death focused the spotlight on violence against women and just as the shooting of young children at an elementary school in newtown , conn , seemed to grab america s attention in a way that other mass murders had not , the death of ms steenkamp set off an outpouring of soul searching about the macho culture of south african men this is very much linked to a dominant south african masculinity in which guns are an archetypal symbol of masculine strength , said rachel jewkes , director of the gender and health research unit of the south african medical research council others are skeptical about mr pistorius s claim that he was not wearing his prosthetics at the time of the shooting and hence felt more vulnerable one colleague of ms steenkamp asked why someone who felt scared did not simply call the police or get out of the room but there are also ample doubts about the police force , which is notoriously inept at investigating serious crime even at this early stage , the performance of the police has been far from convincing their initial assertion that there had previously been allegations of a domestic nature involving mr pistorius has not yet been supported in court the lead officer in the case , , turned out to be facing attempted murder charges of his own and he told the court that testosterone had been found at the scene , though the substance had not been tested it was later identified as an herbal supplement that mr pistorius s publicity agent said he used for muscle recovery but that is also injected for sexual enhancement because there is only one survivor of the events that night , the case against mr pistorius will inevitably rely heavily on forensic and ballistic evidence , experts say some worry whether the police are capable i have no confidence in them whatsoever , said david klatzow , a leading forensic expert it grieves me , it embarrasses me , and it embarrasses many of the last remaining competent people who remain in the police force mr pistorius s sudden fall from grace shocked many in south africa and elsewhere , including some people who knew him in much of the country , he was a beloved symbol of the power of will over adversity he seemed really downtoearth , extremely gracious , not arrogant , not your typical olympic or professional athlete , said steven ungerleider , an american sports psychologist who had met mr pistorius on several occasions still , mr ungerleider said , i have seen and interviewed people who come across as very gracious , and we find out later that they have had some anger management issues , or had issues with jealousy some south african journalists are , in fact , taking themselves to task for failing to highlight more of mr pistorius s less savory behavior he crashed a speedboat on the vaal river in 2009 , injuring himself badly and ending up in intensive care no charges were ever filed , but photographs at the scene showed empty bottles of alcohol on the boat that year , he was arrested on an assault charge after an altercation with a female guest at a party at his home mr pistorius has said that the woman was drunk and that after he asked her to leave she returned to get her purse and tried to break down his door but the woman , cassidy taylormemmory , who also lives at silver estates , tells a different story according to her lawyer , ms taylormemmory was a friend of mr pistorius s girlfriend at the time after the couple had a fight during the barbecue , she left the party with her friend but returned to get her belongings at that point , mr pistorius slammed the door so hard a piece of the doorway broke off and hit ms taylormemmory s leg , injuring her enough to require surgery the prosecutor decided there was not enough evidence to proceed with the assault charge , her lawyer said , and both sides have sued over the altercation it was a bit of a mass confusion , mr pistorius said in a television interview at the time it ended up turning completely sour i had to spend the night in jail , which i never thought i would have to do it was quite hectic according to the police , mr pistorius was also involved in a verbal altercation at a racetrack with the boyfriend of one of his exgirlfriends in which he threatened to beat the man mark batchelor , a friend of the man , confronted mr pistorius later , and the runner threatened to break his legs , mr batchelor said during a television interview , mr batchelor described mr pistorius as possessive and obsessed with his own fame i think oscar got into that status where every woman wanted him , every business wanted to do business with him , mr batchelor said he started believing that another episode that raised eyebrows took place in january , at a popular cafe in a suburban johannesburg shopping mall a friend passed a handgun to mr pistorius under a table , and the gun went off , witnesses said the event was not reported to the police , and the friend took the blame for the gunshot , kevin lerena , a boxer and acquaintance of mr pistorius who was there at the time , said in a televised interview mr lerena said the gun had gone off by mistake , missing his toe by less than an inch you know , we are men , we are guys , mr lerena said people go out and have drinks and have fun whether testosterone is flying and tempers are flying , that s normal never , ever did it come across that i thought he had demons or bad vibes about him ms steenkamp was introduced to mr pistorius by a mutual friend , justin divaris , who owns a car dealership and had asked mr pistorius to be an ambassador for his business mr divaris was sponsoring an event at the kyalami racetrack and invited both of them to sit at his table , according to an affidavit he gave to the court the attraction between mr pistorius and ms steenkamp was apparent immediately , he said mr pistorius asked her to accompany him as a friend to a sporting awards dinner soon afterward later that night , he told mr divaris that ms steenkamp was terrific and that they had really hit it off when pictures from the awards dinner hit the papers , ms martin could n't resist calling her cousin i said , so are you dating oscar now \? ' and reeva laughed she said , no , but i would n't mind i admire him a lot' before she met mr pistorius , ms steenkamp , who had studied law , was living a quiet life , working steadily but without any major breakthroughs she was too short for runway work and mostly did catalogs and commercials she wanted to act , but suffered a lot of rejection , ms martin said , adding that she was giving it until she was 30 when work died down for the season in johannesburg , she would live in cape town with ms martin for several months and work there but lately things were looking up and she could not have been more thrilled , ms martin said she had just finished a television reality show and signed with new management it was infectious being around her , ms martin said she would take my girls into her room and they would sit on the bed and talk and talk she wanted children , she added i think she would have been the most amazing mother
rio de janeiro the conditions around the public health clinic in the of jacarezinho are precisely what most brazilian doctors prefer to avoid dealers of crack cocaine ply their trade along dilapidated train tracks , and the odor from a crematory for stray dogs overwhelms patients and medical workers of course i knew this mission would n't be easy , said idarmis gonz lez , 45 , one of the more than 4 , 500 cuban doctors the brazilian government is hiring to work in farflung villages in the amazon and slums in major cities we go where other doctors do not , said ms gonz lez as she examined an infant suffering from dehydration and diarrhea faced with a wave of street protests in 2013 over deplorable public services , president dilma rousseff has made the hiring of cuban doctors a cornerstone of her response to the turmoil , overriding the resistance of doctors' unions to sending the cubans , trained in a communist country that says it has a surplus of doctors , into neglected parts of brazil s public health system but the project also points to a broader ambition of brazil s government , which is vying to exert influence in cuba as the authorities in havana slowly  brazilian exports to cuba are surging , quadrupling over the past decade to more than 450 million a year the inroads made by brazilian companies in cuba , relying on loans from brazil s national development bank and that share brazil s expertise in tropical agriculture , reflect a sophisticated projection of soft power in a country where washington s influence remains negligible this is brazil playing the long strategic game in the caribbean , said julia e sweig , director for latin american studies at the council on foreign relations cuba benefits , too its medical diplomacy , established decades ago with the export of doctors to developing countries , is reaping a major dividend with brazil s new project , worth as much as 270 million a year to cuba s government the medical alliance bolsters ties between the countries , a prospect that brazilian leaders have been vigorously cultivating since the 1990s for brazil , the payoff is obvious it now ranks among cuba s largest trading partners , behind venezuela and china for venezuela , cuba s top ally and the supplier of about 100 , 000 barrels a day of subsidized oil , ideology forms the basis for stronger ties for brazil the relationship is more about finding opportunities for brazilian companies for instance , a brazilian soap opera produced by the globo network , avenida brasil , now appears on cuban state television , offering viewers a taste of life in rio de janeiro s gritty suburbs building on brazilian to lift cuban farm yields , brazilian soybean and rice farmers are also emerging as top suppliers of food to cuba but brazil s top project in cuba is the 900 million upgrade of the port of mariel by the construction giant odebrecht , the same company that has carried out various infrastructure projects in south florida while washington s prolonged economic sanctions prevent most american companies from doing business with cuba , brazil s efforts to gain a foothold in cuba come at a time when the island s economic relations are in a state of flux venezuela remains cuba s top benefactor , but it is unclear whether venezuela can sustain such largess as it confronts economic troubles of its own venezuela and cuba recently delayed a 700 million nickel venture , and talk of other cooperation projects has died down at the same time , chinese exports to cuba have climbed sharply chinese tourist buses can be seen outside big hotels , chinesebuilt geely cars have become de rigueur for cuban officials and thousands of students studying the spanish language fill hostels and havana s tiny strip of chinesecuban restaurants brazil s profile within cuba remains far more subtle , but the arrival of thousands of cuban doctors , many of whom are black , has made a big splash here , shaking brazil s medical establishment and revealing some painful tensions over race and privilege these doctors from cuba are slave doctors , said wellington galv o , director of the physicians union of alagoas in northeast brazil , repeating an of the project by critics who contend that the conditions faced by the cubans in brazil are degrading under terms of the program , which is managed in part by the pan american health organization , the cubans are not allowed to bring their families to brazil and receive only a fraction of their monthly salary of about 4 , 255 the rest is paid to cuba s government , providing it with a new source of hard currency supporters of the project in brazil retort that the description of the cuban doctors as slaves is a sign of thinly veiled racism and class bias among the medical establishment ms rousseff herself has lashed out at what she called prejudice against the cubans brazil ranks well below neighboring argentina and uruguay with just 18 doctors per 1 , 000 people , according to the so hiring the cubans could be seen as a savvy political move by ms rousseff , who is running for reelection next year i'm just happy to have a doctor , period , whether he s cuban or not , said sthefani nogueira , 21 , after a gynecological exam at a public clinic in the rio neighborhood of realengo , performed by israel fern ndez , 47 , a cuban doctor who arrived here in october with the project in its infancy , pitfalls could still emerge after venezuela began hiring cuban doctors in 2003 , hundreds of them to request asylum in the united states in brazil , latin america s largest democracy , confusion has persisted over whether the cuban doctors arriving here will be able to request political asylum a spokeswoman for the justice ministry said that the cubans would be able to request refugee status if they said that they were being persecuted for their political beliefs , though she said none had taken that step in 2013 brazil s efforts to deepen ties with cuba have encountered other problems dealing a blow to cuba s ambitions of increasing oil production , the brazilian oil company petrobras halted an offshore exploration operation in cuban waters after drilling produced disappointing results and odebrecht , the brazilian construction giant , has had to wage legal battles with some cubanamericans in florida over its activities in cuba but the doctors who return to cuba from brazil may carry with them the seeds of new perspectives after witnessing brazil s efforts to respond to the recent street protests and other forms of political dissent brazil is a model for cuba in that it has managed to develop its economy with peace and consensus , said roberto veiga , the editor of a cuban magazine funded by the german bishops' conference
michael tannen , the roches manager , was yelling into the phone at me why don t you just listen to the radio and figure out how to write a commercial song \? then the phone went dead we were at that point every music career gets to where the honeymoon was over the roches had burst onto the music scene in 1979 with a shower of press infatuation rarely accorded a folk group the unlikely pairing of king crimson s robert fripp , with his harddriving english art rock , and the three singing sisters from new jersey had caught the attention of music writers even before the album was released liz rosenberg , our publicist at warner brothers , told us the press was calling her for interviews she told us this was extremely unusual when the actual record came out , the momentum accelerated the sound of three fairly soft voices and three acoustic guitars , with songs about waitress jobs , commuter trains and longing to be accepted by your parents , issued forth into the 1970s climate of disco fever like a drop of powerful medicine into a compromised bloodstream fripp , in an interview , put forth that people don t realize gentle music can be revolutionary some of his fans were upset that he d traded in bombastic male music for lilywhite warbling so delicate you had to turn up the dial to hear it the roches was no 1 on the new york times s list of the year s best albums we were on our way at the whiskey a go go in la , mo ostin , then president of warner brothers , was pretty clear backstage after our soldout show he explained that we d had a very good launch , selling 200 , 000 records , but that we had to get airplay on our next album because of the unadorned softness of the sound , radio stations had largely ignored the release we developed a joke among the group if a radio station was playing our album , they were probably on the verge of going out of business i was 26 when the roches was released this april , i celebrated my 60th birthday i ve received more than my share of attention and respect for my songwriting skills every day i m complimented on the songs , in person , through emails , on facebook , in articles people like to tell me where they were when they heard runs in the family for the first time , how maid of the seas helped them get through the death of a close friend , or that their grandchildren have learned how to play mr sellack i m glad people take the time to tell me these things these are the rewards of a lifetime of songwriting but many years ago , michael tannen and the roches went their separate ways we never did figure out how to write a money song last year , i was invited up to the berklee college of music to do a songwriting seminar with the students there i sat in on an advanced songwriting class taught by scarlet keys she introduced me to the class , briefly describing my music career none of the students knew who i was to kick things off , i played a few of my songs for them then it was time for questions and answers a very earnest young man raised his hand i hope you re not offended , ma am , if i ask you whether you ve made money from songwriting at all we re all here studying and we ll have student loans to pay off and i m just wondering if music is a field i can expect to make a living in i thought that was a great question ! the guy had cut to the chase no , i said i mean , i ve had royalties trickle in , but i haven t made enough money from songwriting to support myself i turned to scarlet and said , how about you \? scarlet , turns out , had been a staff writer in nashville , where she d gone every day to a cubicle and churned out songs to feed the country music market she had in fact supported herself with her songs a lively discussion ensued , and several students got to play their songs as far as i was concerned , any one might have been a hit if you hear a song enough times , it becomes one you can sing along with that s a good definition of a hit song the problem with most songs is you don t hear them enough times i m a big fan of adele s rolling in the deep but that s only after i transcribed it for one of my students , which involved listening to it multiple times and studying it carefully i went from thinking rolling was a catchy commercial offering to realizing , omg , this woman s a genius songwriter ! my own songs usually begin with a voice that pops into my head hearing voices is a telltale sign of mental illness , but it s a staple in the songwriter s briefcase the last song i wrote , maxwell , about my cat who died , began in the kitchen while i was making breakfast i m the only one i m feeding anymore popped into my head i ve learned to recognize when i m being spoken to by the muse i put breakfast on hold and grabbed a pen five verses poured onto the page and by the end of it i was in tears maxwell is complete it s not a hit song it s probably not going to make any money i d rather listen to it , as if it were a teacher i have friends whose songs have made lots of money i envy them but personally , i ve given up on the idea of writing a commercial song and when i did that , i entered into a deeper , more fulfilling relationship with songwriting , unencumbered by the demands of the marketplace in closing , i share with you a joke scarlet told me as we packed up to leave her classroom , after the students had filed out question how many singersongwriters does it take to change a light bulb \? answer singersongwriters don t want to change anything is best known as a member of the roches , a trio formed with her sisters maggie and suzzy in the 1970s she currently works with the trio afrojersey , whose first cd will be out this summer , and is the author of the memoir blabbermouth

help yourself to d james dee s luscious , sprawling photographic archive of the modern new york art scene he has about 250 , 000 color transparencies and slides , ranging in size from 35 millimeter to 8 by 10 inches , documenting the work of almost every important artist of the last 40 years and installations at some of the most influential galleries and , yes , he s giving them away all you 'll need is a truck large enough to hold 65 cardboard file boxes it would help if you represent a nonprofit organization , because mr dee hopes to receive a tax deduction for donating his life s work but that s not a deal breaker you should , however , be conversant with modern american art history conversant almost none of the transparencies and slides are labeled mr dee , 68 , has retired after a 39year career as the , documenting work for artists , galleries , exhibitions , books and portfolios he is leasing his space at 12 wooster street , just north of canal street , and moving with his wife , sarala , to miami the moving vans will arrive on july 24 the photo collection will not come with him it has value to someone , mr dee said last week not to me the absence of captions and a lack of storage space have discouraged several institutions from accepting the archive the national gallery of art , getty images , and the fales library and special collections of new york university have declined his offer , mr dee said with that , he illustrated the strengths and weaknesses of an unlabeled archive by pulling stacks of 4inchby5inch transparencies from a box marked 198485 trans and dealing them like playing cards onto a light table , identifying each one as best he could basquiat julian schnabel do n't know there was an artist , mierle ukeles this was an installation she had at the sanitation transfer station joel shapiro basquiat i remember doing this shoot , but i do n't remember the artist this is a frank gehry joel shapiro nam june paik this was for the chase bank it s 45 feet long oh , who s the artist \? vincent arcilesi this , i have no idea i like it , though i like it this is probably an installation it s subversive enough , it could be ronald feldman the informality of the filing system is a bit shocking at first , until mr dee explains exactly what these transparencies and slides are they were justincase exposures just in case a frame was damaged during processing , just in case it was badly exposed or slightly fogged or a little too cyan if someone wanted four transparencies , i 'd have a fifth shot , mr dee said if they ordered 10 slides , i 'd shoot 12 it was cheaper to shoot extras than to go back and reshoot instead of throwing them out , i put them in a box one box followed the next , until there were 65 , not counting all the blackandwhite negatives , which are also yours for the taking , the dean of the new york studio school of drawing , painting and sculpture , said of mr dee he worked with so many artists in the '70s , '80s , '90s and up to the present the people he has shot and helped , in terms of documenting their work , are legion he was literally the best photographer in town in terms of dealing with color , mr nickson said for artists , that density of color is very important and he was very good working with anything large that included paintings by mr nickson himself , which can range up to 20 feet long mr dee said his strength was translating threedimensional sculpture into twodimensional imagery my goal is to find an angle that summarizes the piece and then the light that will describe it , he said my goal is that when someone looks at the photograph , they will say , that s a great sculpture' not , that s a great photo' mr dee entered into his specialized calling in 1974 after earning an mfa from ohio university he was invited to photograph a george segal sculpture for a monograph segal suggested that mr dee get into the business of photographing artwork borrowing segal s sinar 4by5 view camera , mr dee set up shop at 72 wooster street i grew with soho , he recalled as it exploded in the 1980s , my business did too he worked with artists and with gallery owners like brooke alexander , mary boone , paula cooper , mr feldman , ivan karp , louis k meisel and annina nosei he bought a fivestory building at 12 wooster street in 1982 , converted it into a coop and occupied the first and second floors a decade later business began plummeting as the art market collapsed and galleries stopped documenting artists' portfolios a decade after that , digital photography upended what business remained now mr dee wants to pursue his own photography without the distractions or demands of a commercial studio his artwork is focused on the intimate details of the human body , both anatomical and imposed tattoos , piercings and scarification i 've decided it is time to do the next thing in my life , while i still have the energy , he said that does not include indexing 250 , 000 transparencies or schlepping them to florida at some point , mr dee said , i 've got to get a dumpster to put them in he sounded very sad and quite serious
hello , and welcome to lower manhattan , the message begins , as elevator music plays before you , you will see a spray art by the artist bansky or maybe not it s probably been painted over by now this is the latest foray into street art by banksy , the elusive british artist , and it is perhaps the most public and expansive of his works , taking over not just a patch of sidewalk or a shop wall but a whole city titled better out than in , the exhibit was announced in his usual mysterious , popup fashion for the next month banksy will be attempting to host an entire show on the streets of new york , read a message posted on the artist s web site on tuesday , after clues that something was coming began appearing on posters in los angeles the new york residency has already begun reporters from the village voice located the first image , at 18 allen street , near canal street , on the border of the lower east side and chinatown painted on a concrete wall , it shows a child holding a can of spray paint , standing on another child s back , below a sign that reads graffiti is a crime the images in better out than in are accompanied by a loopy audio guide , accessed by calling an 800 number that appears beside the stencil \( dial 18006564271 , ext 1 for this one \) this piece is typical of bansky s output , the guide says the children in this case represent youth , and the sign represents well , signs though banksy s public pieces ripped from walls in england and california have recently gone to the auction block for millions , this project shows that banksy has lost none of his playfulness or wit about the place of street art in the global cultural marketplace you re looking at a type of picture called graffiti , from the latin graffito , the audio guide offers , which means graffiti , with an o in the plummy voice of an american man , it explains how stencils are made by spraying automotive spray paint through an intricatelycut shape in a piece of cardboard or to give it its proper term cheating

allahabad , india the pilgrims came , millions upon millions of them , in the greatest tide of humanity ever seen again and again , the vast crowds threatened to press too close , to trample the smallest then it happened as many as 30 people were at the train station here as they rushed up steps leading to one of the platforms , the police said the stampede came at the , a hindu religious festival that occurs once every 12 years by the banks of the ganges and yamuna rivers i ca n't believe god punished us this way , said santos singh , one of the pilgrims at the station my 15yearold son got injured i wish police were more responsive about 30 bodies covered in white sheets were visible on the train platform on sunday evening several appeared to be children death and loss have long been associated with the pilgrimage at the kumbh , deadly stampedes previously occurred at the allahabad pilgrimage in 1840 , 1906 , 1954 and 1986 and yet still the pilgrims come hindu lore says that when the moon and jupiter align , the ganges and yamuna are , bearing the divine nectar of immortality those who bathe in the conjoined waters are cleansed of their sins and given blessings that extend through several generations , hindus say pilgrims make the trip not just for themselves but for their children and grandchildren another lure is the presence of thousands of mystics , whom hindus but the crowds around the great in the predawn hours on sunday were frightening finally , the mystics rushed toward the holy waters , some with spears , tridents and swords held high they plunged in , scattering marigolds and sacred ash other pilgrims surged forward , and the mystics had to fight their way back to shore behind the mystics were saffronrobed gurus on silver thrones and behind the gurus were pilgrims by the millions , some barefoot and others so stooped they could see little more than their own feet a few crawled we have a dip here and then live happily for the rest of the year , said shaish narayan , 62 , a woodworker who first took part in the kumbh when he was 5 i put my faith in mother ganges n k auddy , a consulting engineer from kolkata , was taking part in his first kumbh because his daughter recently gave birth to his first grandchild , and he was hoping for a divine blessing for the child i want him to have a good future , mr auddy said government officials estimated that 10 million pilgrims were encamped in allahabad on saturday night , with 20 million to 30 million expected to bathe by monday if those figures are even close to being accurate , it is as if the entire population of texas decided to visit an area the size of savannah , ga , all on the same weekend about 80 million pilgrims roughly the population of germany are expected at some point in the kumbh s 55day run by comparison , 31 million people visited mecca in saudi arabia during last year s annual pilgrimage , each successive kumbh breaks the record for the largest gathering in human history many stay in a huge tent city built on riverbanks that were underwater as recently as october its inhabitants have access to drinking water , public toilets , good health care and consistent electricity none of which india has been able to reliably deliver anywhere else the precautions and amenities are intended to prevent the stampedes and plagues that have so worried government officials about 70 , 000 government employees provide security , sprinkle insecticide , sweep up excrement and spray bleach but it was not enough to avert a tragedy on sunday the stampede was set off by railway delays , shoddy infrastructure and overcrowding , several witnesses said train service was severely delayed during the early evening , they said , leaving more and more passengers stranded in the small station and promised to compensate the injured and the families of those killed a stampede seemed possible several times on sunday as pilgrims jockeyed to be present at the one place and time where the gods are said to bestow their most precious gifts one problem is that pilgrims often linger in the water and on the beach , preventing the next wave of people from entering the police routinely charged onto the beach , blowing whistles and pushing people back with long bamboo poles to clear the way for more pilgrims the intense jostling separated many families , and desperate searches took place all over the beach thousands of children and older women ended up in tents for the lost loudspeakers announced names , hometowns and locations devanti devi , of bihar , said her 70yearold mother had been missing for three days she does n't have any money , and i do n't think she can hear the announcements , ms devi said for some indians , the growing is a cause for concern a rightwing hindu group at the kumbh called last week for continued confrontation with the nation s muslim minority by insisting that a hindu shrine be built where a mosque once stood these rightwing organizations use the kumbh to mobilize pilgrims , and there s always the threat that they can turn violent , said sumanta banerjee , a researcher at the in shimla but politics seemed a distant concern for most of the pilgrims here maheshanand giri , one of the first mystics into the water on sunday , said that the presence of mystics was an important reason for the popularity of the kumbh people come here to have a holy dip in the ganges , and we are an addon , said mr giri madhusudhan upadhaya , a tea seller from hyderabad , said he had traveled for nearly two days before

the term zombie has traditionally referred to a corpse that has been reanimated through supernatural means and rendered into an automaton that does its master s will look it up in a dictionary and you will find the traditional definition firmly in place but pop culture , of course , has its own definition the cannibalistic , freeagent zombies that come pouring out of comics , video games , novels , movies and television have little in common with their languid , sleepwalking predecessors they come into being not through magic , but through a pernicious , fastacting pathogen ceaselessly devouring the living , surging over the landscape like a plague , these hoppedup creatures have become pop culture s designated agents of the apocalypse the zombie as we know it owes its life to the filmmaker george romero , whose 1968 blackandwhite classic , night of the living dead , is listed in the national film registry of the library of congress , reserved for culturally and historically important works filmed on a barebones budget , the film depicts a party of ghouls laying siege to a generally detestable group of human beings trapped in the now famous pennsylvania farmhouse as the film critic tony williams points out in his fascinating book the cinema of george a romero , this landmark movie represented the start of something new , and not just because its zombies were flesh eaters before the late 1960s , mr williams writes , zombies in american movies were usually black and often associated with voodoo after this period , the monsters generally looked more like the townspeople they were male and female , young and old , ethnically diverse by making the monsters appear more like the folks next door , the director broadened their appeal mr romero thumbed his nose at hollywood conventions the filmmaker cast an erudite , welltraveled africanamerican actor named duane jones as the hero , at a time when it was still rare for black actors to play substantial roles in films that were not explicitly about race beyond that , none of the living who find refuge in the farmhouse survive to the film s final frame even the young lovers , who would customarily serve as symbols of hope by living to see another day , are incinerated in a truck fire their charred corpses are devoured by zombies who behave in the manner of people stuffing themselves at a barbecue here , as elsewhere in mr romero s work , the walking dead are used to mock human excess when the zombies in night of the living dead finally overrun the farmhouse , a hysterical young woman is seized and hauled into the horde by the livingdead version of her brother , who had been killed earlier in the film this scene , played out in many ways in many movies , crystallizes what the novelist colson whitehead has described as the elementally terrifying moment when the familiar turns suddenly murderous and your relatives and your friends , your neighbors and the friendly folks who run the dry cleaners reveal themselves as the monsters they ve always been , beneath the lie of civilization , of affection stories about people who either adjust to the new reality or struggle mightily to deny it are the stockintrade of the walking dead , a hugely popular cable television show on amc that depicts a band of survivors struggling to stay alive in a postapocalyptic world of bloodthirsty zombies based on a comic of the same name , the show is essentially a soap opera it has performed so well in the 18to49 demographic that it has spawned a companion talk show the talking dead where the main show is the topic of discussion with zombies more popular than ever , hollywood is , of course , looking for ways to cash in the genre works well as comedy as in the british film shaun of the dead but there are limits to how far this material can be stretched and to the forms in which it can be successfully packaged until now , zombie flicks have been mostly lowbudget affairs , partly because the material was seen in hollywood as having marginal appeal , but also because the formula that drives the most successful zombie narratives generally requires smallscale intimacy rather than epic scope a cast of thousands fleeing through the streets of tokyo is axiomatic while godzilla is razing the city to the ground but even when the zombie apocalypse rages around the globe and threatens to wipe out the human species , its effects are best shown with a chekhovian closeness say , around a specific breakfast table or in the back seat of a specific family station wagon , where a doting and affable aunt betty turns suddenly bad and chomps a huge glob of flesh out of the nearest relative s face can the zombie trope flourish on the blockbuster scale \? the question will be answered next month when paramount releases the very expensive and long awaited zombie epic world war z , starring and produced by brad pitt it is based on the muchloved 2006 novel of the same name by max brooks , which describes in retrospect a zombie apocalypse that threatens all humanity the film s cost is estimated to be about 200 million , writes laura holson in the june issue of vanity fair or more than 200 times the budget for night of the living dead it would need to bring in 400 million worldwide just to break even world war z might bring a fresh vantage point to a vintage subject but for those of us raised in the romero tradition , the optimal setting for the zombie story will always be the isolated farmhouse where the living hunker down as the night and the dead come closing in
kabul , afghanistan the spokesman for president said thursday that the was responsible for calling in an airstrike on april 7 that left 17 afghan civilians dead , 12 of them children , and that the secret afghan militias that the agency controls behaved as if they were responsible to no one it was a cia operation using a security structure that was in full service of the cia and run by the cia , said the spokesman , aimal faizi , who said his remarks reflected the views of the afghan president mr faizi also criticized the agency and american special operations troops for running numerous similar militias elsewhere in afghanistan , with similar problems the criticism from mr faizi and other afghan officials pulled aside a curtain on a clandestine operation that went badly awry in the rugged mountains of eastern kunar province , killing an american cia employee and seriously wounding three other americans working for the agency the american who died had been in charge of a group of undercover paramilitaries known as the 04 unit , a socalled counterterrorist pursuit team , according to afghan investigators afghan reaction to the episode challenges the core assumptions in negotiations with the afghan government about the nature of the united states' presence in afghanistan after 2014 the military wants a mission with two main goals training afghan forces and conducting counterterrorism raids against groups like al qaeda special operations forces and irregular forces like the militias run by the cia are a crucial part of the effort , american officials say but mr karzai has been deeply suspicious about the activity of irregular forces in his country , and in march he forces from operating in wardak province now , the cia is the focus of his ire a spokesman for the cia would not comment about the case a spokesman for the american military , col thomas collins , declined to comment on the raid in kunar province or to discuss the military s investigation into it he said only that the operation was run by the national directorate of security , the afghan intelligence agency there was a battle going on , this nds unit was under grave pressure , colonel collins said but as to what caused the civilian casualties , that s still under investigation mr faizi said that after mr karzai received a report from his own investigation , he fired the head of the national directorate of security in kunar province , whom others identified as gen saadullah \( he uses only one name \) but mr faizi said that the 04 unit , a roughly 1 , 200member force , was not truly under the control of the afghan security agency , asserting instead that american intelligence officials were solely responsible for the unit it was a joint op at most in name , he said , but really in fact a ciarun parallel security structure , and such structures have been a factor of insecurity themselves mr faizi said mr karzai had ordered a review throughout the country of all counterterrorist pursuit teams , which are mostly used in the east and the south , and of similar irregular forces run by the cia or by american special operations units we are informed five minutes before they are conducting an operation , mr faizi said , and our security agencies do not have authority over them a united states official familiar with the events disagreed with that characterization the afghan unit involved in this prolonged firefight with the taliban was under afghan government control rumors of a rogue' unit or americans commanding the team reflect internal power struggles in kabul , the official said , speaking on the condition of anonymity details about the fighting in kunar were scant in the days afterward mr karzai appointed a delegation to go there and investigate , and he later said he blamed both the taliban and international forces for causing the civilian deaths , although at the time he did not mention the cia by name as the reports confirm that armed taliban were there in the area , we strongly condemn the use of civilians and their homes as shields by the taliban , as well as we do not accept the conduct of any airstrike on residential areas under any name and for any purpose whatsoever , mr karzai said this act by the isaf forces was a violation of human rights and the presidential executive order which bans airstrikes during operations in residential areas mr karzai on feb 16 after a coalition airstrike in kunar province killed 10 civilians , five of them children that strike took place in the same district as the april 7 fighting shigal district but in a different village at the time , officials said that the airstrike had been called to support a joint operation involving the afghan security agency , and that an afghan officials , including the head of mr karzai s delegation investigating the latest kunar episode , said that the earlier kunar attack also involved elements of the 04 unit under the command of american cia personnel , including the unidentified american who was killed on april 7 a copy of the kunar delegation s report was obtained by the new york times , and two members of the delegation were interviewed about the fighting its chairman , shuja ulmalk jalala , an adviser to mr karzai , and hajji sakh mushwanai , a member of parliament from kunar province one member of the 04 unit was also interviewed , speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to comment to the news media they all said that 75 members of the 04 unit , with four american advisers along , marched for four hours into a mountainous area near the village of sunoo on the night of april 6 and the morning of april 7 the force was planning to arrest taliban commanders suspected of having ties to al qaeda , and around 5 am on april 7 , it raided a house where one of them , ali khan , was believed to be living but the only man present was a mentally ill man who could neither speak nor hear he and about two dozen women and children were herded into one room of mr khan s house , the afghans said a short time later , the house came under taliban fire from all sides we had no choice but to stay in that house we were totally surrounded , the 04 unit member said we thought this was the last day of our lives one of the investigators , mr mushwanai , saw matters differently these are irregular soldiers , and they do not know the rules of war very well , he said by being in the house , it made those women and children a target the taliban s barrage lasted until 8 am , when reinforcements from the 04 unit arrived the force that was pinned down in the house tried to withdraw , and the four americans were hit by insurgent fire air support was called in to protect the retreat and to allow medical evacuation helicopters to rescue the wounded when the 04 unit members left the house and withdrew from the area , they told investigators , all of the women and children were still alive hours later , when villagers reached the scene , all but a few of the women were dead , the report said the investigators said they determined that none of the bombs or rockets used in the airsupport operation which included drones , jets and attack helicopters , they said hit the house where the victims were but the concussion from the explosions made the upper floor of the mudandtimber house collapse on top of the victims one of the investigators , mr jalala , said that of the 12 children killed , all were the sons , daughters , nieces or nephews of the taliban commander , mr khan , who was among seven insurgents killed in the attack on that basis , mr jalala rejected what he described as a coalition military claim that the taliban had killed the civilians for propaganda purposes common sense just does n't accept this , he said nobody would do that to their own family he said it was clear from pictures that the house had collapsed on the family , and that the strikes , including by rockets that exploded in the yard , were the only possible cause mr faizi , the presidential spokesman , agreed with that assessment there is no evidence they were killed by the taliban , he said these children were killed only because of the airstrikes these are irresponsible armed militias and irresponsible armed people , carrying out operations for and on the payroll of the cia mr mushwanai , the member of parliament from kunar , said his own home had been raided by the 04 unit twice they shot out the tv and the water cooler , he said america will leave behind these types of forces in 2014 , and it will further destabilize afghanistan
president obama is under water his approval in the polls is low and sinking , his signature initiative is staggering from a combination of incompetence and sabotage , his foreign policy is a jumble congress is a bermuda triangle where the most elementary white house business disappears the public is numbed and disgusted allies are theatrically furious about eavesdropping put it this way when the watercooler buzz in washington is focused on obama s neardeath experience in last year s campaign debates , it s pretty clear he is not setting the agenda i have a few suggestions for how obama might lift his presidency up from the bottom the todo list that follows consists of ideas that are worth doing on the merits advantageous on the politics most of them are familiar , because this is a time to revive the best features of a stalled presidency , not to launch grand new initiatives it s not that i want the president to think small by all means , address the threat of climate catastrophe and push ahead on early childhood education but he needs to get a few wins on the scoreboard i invite readers to post their own suggestions in the comments section the first job is obvious , not least to the president the bungling of the health care rollout was a humiliation for an administration whose campaign wizards famously tamed the social network in 2012 it has given republicans license to feign indignation even as they do their best to undermine the new program it has distracted the press from both the success stories \( like kentucky , where the rollout worked the way it was supposed to \) and the episodes of republican mischief \( like georgia , where the state blocked the hiring of navigators to help applicants through the enrollment process \) i have no doubt that the administration will get the system working and that the program will ultimately prove popular but the longer it takes , the more the president squanders the already meager public confidence that he can do right if after a few more weeks the assembled experts are still struggling to make the website work , maybe it s time to redeploy some techies from the national security agency which brings me to dismissing clapper , the director of national intelligence , is not a new idea fred kaplan of slate suggested it in june , after clapper lied to congress about the nsa s datamining george shultz , the former secretary state who belongs on any list of great living statesmen , called for it in september \( i do n't know how the guy who s in charge of national intelligence , clapper , is still there , shultz told a world affairs council audience he lied ! \) better late than never obama should fire him not just because he lied , but also because clapper has cast himself as the defender of the status quo , the apologist for excess he seems to think what our government does is none of our business the president should draft someone widely viewed as toughminded , clearthinking and credible i 'd bring back robert gates , who , having run both the defense department and the central intelligence agency , has the stature and the technical chops , and has shown he can run a gigantic enterprise without becoming a captive of it with a change of leadership should come systemic reform to make the spy agencies more accountable of the various options i 've read , my favorite is max frankel s idea of creating a specialized court with the expertise to watch over the intelligence agencies and enough transparency to inspire public confidence the president should make that idea his own comprehensive immigration reform is both the right thing to do and a winning issue politically a good , bipartisan bill has passed the senate , with enhanced border security , a more sensible legal immigration regimen , safeguards against employers who cheat and legalization for many of the 11 million who live in the shadows this sensible reform is trapped in the house by the crossfire within the republican party between those who would like to put out a welcome mat for hispanic voters and those , including the former profile in courage marco rubio , who are cowed by the wrath of their base it s conceivable that some house republicans will take heart from the experience of new jersey s governor , chris christie , who embraced humane reforms and won half of the hispanic vote in his reelection landslide last tuesday but even if the chances of success are small , the more the white house presses the issue , the more it isolates the ideologues from the pragmatists , and the more it separates the right wing from business donors as paul taylor , who follows immigration for pew research , puts it it s better politics if the president wins , but it s still good politics if he loses for years the administration has talked of rebalancing our military strategy to address an increasingly assertive china the pentagon , liberated from iraq and drawing down in afghanistan , has taken some modest steps in this direction , deploying more of the navy to asia , devoting more resources to china s space and cyber threats but our rivalry with china is not , and should never be , primarily military we need to compete on the fields of economics and diplomacy unfortunately the civilian custodians of our foreign policy have been bogged down in the middle east , a region that matters a lot , but not as much as it did when we were more dependent on imported oil in the middle east , obama is now pretty much where he wants to be jawjaw , not warwar , as churchill liked to say and that is clearly where the american people prefer him to be talks \( hopeful \) are underway to rid syria of chemical weapons and \( less hopeful \) to find a diplomatic end to that country s civil war there is fitful progress in the talks aimed at testing whether iran s new president has the will and the authority to put a verifiable lid on that country s nuclear program talks are taking place on the eternal conundrum of israel s coexistence with the palestinians success at any of those tables would be a blessing to humanity and a great lift for the president but while diplomats are patiently tending these negotiations , there is time to pay attention to unfinished asia business the biggest item awaiting some washington juice is the transpacific partnership , an immense , stalled , asian freetrade agreement that would do more to counter burgeoning china than any number of battleships like most freetrade agreements , it has opposition , from critics who fear it would insufficiently protect labor , consumers , the environment and intellectual property it s time for the administration to cut some deals , crack some heads and open up those asian markets the idea of a grand fiscal bargain a megadeal that wins bipartisan support on the whole complex of spending , taxes and entitlements was all the rage a year ago , but it has passed its sellby date not only has it proven politically unattainable as long as the house is in thrall to a band of leastgovernment ideologues , it has also been overtaken by reality even relatively conservative economists concede that the deficit a very sustainable 4 percent of gross domestic product is not the problem , at least not in the foreseeable future there a distant problem for social security and medicare as my babyboom generation retires , and it would be nice to address it before young americans find the cupboard bare but the immediate and urgent problems are sluggish growth and too few jobs michael strain , an economist at the american enterprise institute who often speaks sense to conservatives , suggests a humble bargain , a menu of smaller deals for example , strain says republicans should be willing to agree to a bit more spending on jobstimulating federal programs if democrats agree to slow the longterm growth of entitlements a little by , say , employing a more realistic cost of living formula if the president wants to be a bit bolder , he should look at systemic fixes fareed zakaria at cnn proposes that we do away with the practice of funding our decaying roads , bridges , airports and railroads by annual appropriations and create instead a national infrastructure bank backed by federal bonds , it would fund meritorious projects rather than those based on pork and patronage christina romer , former chairwoman of obama s council of economic advisers , suggests a policy of automatic stabilization we could set up a system that automatically cuts tax rates and increases unemployment benefits and food stamps when the economy weakens the costs would be offset in good years by automatic debt reduction justin wolfers , a university of michigan economist who leans democratic , refers to this as congressproofing the economy after the last few years , you have to like the sound of that it may well be that despite the evident voter unhappiness with washington gridlock congress will continue to be unmovable in which case president obama , of course , will not be on the ballot a year from now , but the midterm elections will be treated as a verdict on the state of america under his leadership , and the outcome will have a lot to do with how he spends his final years in office he should miss no opportunity to portray the 2014 elections not as 435 house contests and 33 senate races , but as a national referendum on our government dysfunction the message could be divided government has brought us paralysis and crisis and made us a global laughingstock send me democrats , and we 'll get things working again or at least , send me republicans with a trace of pragmatism we know the litany of reasons this will be a long shot the gerrymandering of congressional districts and the natural clustering of likeminded voters tends to make house seats oneparty fiefs the hegemony of narrowinterest money distorts voting it has become hard to get a presidential message out through the media noise machine the public has not fully grasped that the problem is not everyone , it s mostly the republicans norman ornstein , the veteran congresswatcher , points out that the last time someone succeeded in nationalizing a midterm election was 1994 , when newt gingrich led a republican uprising it took gingrich 16 years of preparation , and he was mobilizing the president but if the radicals persist in hostagetaking , brinksmanship , shutdowns and extremist rhetoric , ornstein says , then you might see a greater backlash it s worth trying however low the president s ratings sink , congress s are bound to be lower
s gou , mali malian and french forces were reported to be in control of two important central malian towns on tuesday after the french defense ministry said they recaptured them on monday , pushing back an advance by islamist militants who have overrun the country s northern half at the same time , the united states military said on tuesday that it had begun airlifting french troops and equipment from a base in southern to bamako , the capital of mali , aboard giant c17 transport planes two flights arrived on monday and a third on tuesday , and the airlift will continue for the next several days , tom saunders , a spokesman for the united states africa command , said in a telephone interview from the command s headquarters in stuttgart , germany jeanyves le drian , the defense minister of france , hailed the frenchmalian advance on monday as a clear military success for the government in bamako and for french forces intervening in support of these operations the developments in the two central towns diabaly , about 275 miles north of bamako , and douentza , on the eastern bank of the niger river , 300 miles northeast of the malian capital represented a reassertion of government control in areas where a lightning strike by islamist forces earlier this month prompted france to intervene , initially with airstrikes , to halt the rebel advance french soldiers in armored vehicles , part of what the military command in paris has labeled operation serval , rolled through the town of diabaly on monday to cheers from residents , who flew french and malian flags to welcome them i want to thank the french people , said mamadou traor , a diabaly resident he said french airstrikes had chased away the militants without harming any civilians , a claim echoed by other residents none of us were touched , mr traor said it was incredible in douentza , the associated press quoted a malian official , sali maiga , as saying islamist forces had already retreated from the settlement when french and malian troops arrived on monday after imposing an overnight curfew , the malian military and the french army spent their first night , and the people are very happy , the official said tuesday , and there have been no reports of incidents or gunfire the advances by government and french troops left them deployed along the main access routes to the desert redoubts of the islamist fighters farther north in settlements like timbuktu and gao interviewed by the french radio station rfi , gen ibrahima dahirou dembele , the malian army chief of staff , said his forces were seeking the total liberation of northern mali if the support remains consistent , it wo n't take more than a month to free gao and timbuktu , he said , northern cities that have been occupied by the islamists since early 2012 france has listed the restoration of central government authority across mali as one of its aims in the campaign agence francepresse quoted french military officials on tuesday as saying french warplanes had attacked islamist command centers near timbuktu in airstrikes over the past 48 hours france has said it is aiming to send 2 , 500 soldiers to mali , and 2 , 150 have been deployed so far neighboring chad has said it will send 2 , 000 soldiers to join west african forces assembling in support of government and french troops in mali islamist fighters overran diabaly a week ago , the closest they have come to bamako in an aggressive surge this month worried that there was little to stop them from rolling into the capital , where many french citizens live , france quickly stepped into the fight , striking the militants at the front lines and bombing their strongholds in the north suddenly , a longsimmering standoff with the islamist groups holding the north had been transformed into a war involving french forces , precisely the kind of event the west hoped to avoid american officials have long warned that western involvement could stir antiwestern sentiment and provoke terrorist attacks , a fear that seemed to be realized when militants stormed a gas facility in algeria last week , resulting in the deaths of at least 37 foreign hostages even after french forces entered the fight in mali , driving back the islamists proved more difficult than officials initially suggested rather than flee , many of the militants in diabaly seemed to dig in , taking over homes and putting the civilian population in the crossfire but they eventually fled on friday morning , residents said , in the face of relentless french airstrikes the fighters had little time to impose the version of that has made them infamous in the north , where they have carried out public whippings and amputations and stoned a couple to death but their brief reign over diabaly was a small taste of the harsh policies they have enacted elsewhere i had to cover my head at all times , said one diabaly woman , djenaba ciss when i walked with my brother to the fields , they would bother us they would ask us questions to verify that we were siblings few residents said they actually met the hardened men who had taken control of their village , but kola maiga , who lives at the edge of town , recalled their arrival on the morning of jan 14 i was in my house , and i saw them coming , and i knew , i knew that war was here in diabaly , mr maiga said the first day , they started shooting in the air they wanted the population to know they have power he feared them , he said , but they tried to reassure him , offering cookies to his children they said do not be afraid we are with allah , ' mr maiga said mali has been in crisis since last january , when tuaregs in northern mali began a separatist uprising , newly invigorated by an influx of fighters and weapons from libya after the fall of col muammar elqaddafi a military coup by junior officers angry at how the government responded to the tuareg uprising followed in march , leaving the country in disarray and hastening the loss of its northern half to insurgents islamist groups , some with links to , quickly pushed aside the secular tuareg militants , taking over northern towns and imposing their strict interpretation of shariah law the fighters appeared to find little support among the local population , who said the harsh version of islam they sought to impose had little resemblance to the moderate faith practiced by most people here these guys , they are vicious , said oumar diakit , diabaly s mayor it s not islam that they want they want other things as you can see , a poor country like mali , they have come to attack us residents who had fled to nearby towns returned to their homes on monday after hearing that the militants had been chased away they arrived , and they said they were going to bring shariah here , said mohamed tounkara , who returned on monday we do n't want shariah that s why i left with my family he said he was grateful

rio de janeiro s public ministry , a body of independent public prosecutors , has begun an investigation into a claim connecting former president to a vast votebuying scheme that involved the channeling of funds to the governing workers' party the inquiry , which was announced in the capital , bras lia , on friday and comes after several months of analyzing testimony , opens a new phase in what has arguably been , already involving the conviction of , jos dirceu de oliveira e silva , on conspiracy and bribery charges last year the move by the public ministry , which asked the federal police to carry out the investigation , is thought to be the first time that mr da silva has been directly investigated in connection to the scheme , called the mensal o , or big monthly allowance , for the regular payments that some lawmakers received the scandal emerged in 2005 , during mr da silva s first term as president at 67 , he remains a towering figure in brazilian politics marcos val rio de souza , a businessman who received a 40year sentence last year after he was found to have operated much of the embezzlement scheme , said in testimony last september that mr da silva and antonio palocci , a former finance minister , negotiated in 2005 a multimilliondollar payment with the former president of a portuguese telecommunications company the funds , according to mr de souza , were channeled from a supplier of the company , portugal telecom , based in macau , the former portuguese colony that is now a special administrative region of china , to accounts of advertising executives in brazil who worked on campaigns for the workers' party he also said that the funds were used to pay campaignrelated debts a spokesman for instituto lula , the former president s institute in s o paulo , said saturday that mr da silva had not been formally notified of the investigation he declined to comment further when mr de souza s testimony was made public last year , mr da silva dismissed it , saying , i cannot believe in lies portugal telecom , which has large operations in brazil , did not respond to requests for comment while several political figures , including jos genoino guimar es neto , the former president of the workers' party , received sentences in november for their roles in the votebuying scheme , none have gone to prison lawyers for the defendants have been maneuvering to delay the supreme court from formally publishing its findings from the trial , a step that is needed for those sentenced to go to jail
nairobi , kenya the bloody standoff at a kenyan shopping mall edged closer to a conclusion on monday night , with kenyan officials saying that their troops were securing the building and that there were no more civilians trapped inside we 're in control of westgate , kenya s interior ministry said in a twitter message late monday night , referring to the large , upscale mall that islamist militants stormed on saturday , killing more than 60 people among the militants were two or three young american men who appeared to be of somali or arab origin , kenya s foreign minister , amina mohamed said monday in an interview on pbs , ms mohamed said the american attackers were originally from minnesota or missouri that just goes to underline the global nature of the war that we 're fighting , she said the state department s senior spokeswoman , jen psaki , said we have no definitive evidence of the nationalities or identities of the perpetrators at this time we will continue to look into these reports for more than two days , kenyan forces have struggled to vanquish the militants , who , after killing shoppers , holed up in various corners of the mall with militarygrade weaponry hundreds of elite kenyan troops backed by armored personnel carriers , helicopters , planes and security officials from israel , france , britain and the united states have been deployed , but the militants , estimated to number from 10 to 15 , refused to surrender and held their ground by late monday night , the sound of gunfire had tapered off and kenyan news media reported that all the militants had been killed we believe all hostages have been released , said the kenya national disaster operation center in a special forces and kdf soldiers combing the building situation of hostiles to be confirmed kenyan officials have repeatedly tried to reassure the country and the world that they were bringing the crisis under control , mindful of the damage to the nation s image as a cornerstone of stability in an often turbulent region this will end tonight , kenyan officials had declared as a major rescue operation got under way on sunday evening but shortly thereafter , three kenyan commandos were shot dead at close range and several hostages were killed as kenyan forces tried to move in on militants hiding in a dark corner of the mall , western officials said when the standard , one of kenya s biggest newspapers , hit the stands on monday with the headline , the final assault , the sound of gunfire and explosives was still echoing through central nairobi , spreading even more fear among kenyans , who have been shocked and demoralized by the events over the past three days a cone of black smoke rising from the roof of the mall could be seen like a signal fire from all around the city kenya is a crucial american partner , whose security forces work closely with their western counterparts to contain islamist militants in the region now kenya s capital , considered an oasis of prosperity in this part of africa and an important base for western embassies and businesses , has become a battleground in the conflict , and there is growing concern that this attack will not be the last several witnesses said that some of the ringleaders of the assault in which masked gunmen moved methodically through the crowded mall on saturday , killing men , women and children may have escaped during the initial confusion one witness said that an assailant quickly tore off his clothes and changed into a new outfit before running out , hands raised , blending in with a crowd of fleeing civilians security officials in nairobi said that two other militants both women who appeared to be directing other assailants during the killings also managed to escape after the initial stage of the attack , raising fears that welltrained terrorists could be on the loose in nairobi several witnesses have said that some of the militants were clearly not african and may have been from western countries kenya s security forces have a reputation for being lowly paid and underequipped , and they seem to have been illprepared for a complex hostage situation against diehard militants like this according to several western officials , the kenyans initially rebuffed offers of assistance from the american government and turned instead to the israelis , who dispatched advisers from the israeli defense forces those advisers have been working closely with the kenyan commandos inside the mall , helping plan specific tactical operations , though officials said the israeli advisers had not engaged in any combat and had stayed out of public view the american , french and british officials have been left with a more backseat role from a command center just down the street from the westgate mall , helping the kenyans with the investigation of the attack and some intelligence matters , a highranking kenyan official said monday there s too much consultation going on , said the kenyan official , who had not been authorized to speak publicly this should have been a small rescue operation , not preparing for war on monday afternoon , kenyan security officials acknowledged that the effort to end the standoff had taken longer than expected , though they offered a different account of their setbacks , saying that about 10 kenyan soldiers had been injured but none killed the shabab , a brutal somali extremist group that had at least 20 fighters from the united states in 2010 , many of them young somaliamericans from a gritty part of minneapolis , claimed responsibility for the siege on the mall its spokesmen said that the attack was revenge for kenya s military incursion into somalia , which began in 2011 , when kenya sent thousands of troops across the border to push back the shabab three years ago , the group also claimed credit for the coordinated bombings that killed more than 70 people in uganda as crowds gathered to watch the world cup , calling it retribution for uganda s decision to send troops to somalia as part of the african union s effort to stabilize the country but the possible presence of militants from outside of africa in the mall attack and the way the assailants fended off attempts to dislodge them has raised questions about the shabab s latest claims some western security officials are now beginning to wonder if other terrorist groups may be involved this whole thing seems more advanced than anything the shabab has ever done , said one western security official , who did not want to be identified because the operations were still continuing they are clearly a multinational collection from all over the world , said julius karangi , chief of the kenyan general staff the fivestory westgate shopping mall sits in nairobi s westlands neighborhood , tucked among winding forested roads onlookers crept through the trees as the smoke billowed up , trying to catch a closer look jittery police officers used tear gas to drive them back and keep the roads clear for the heavy military vehicles entering and exiting the secured area throughout the day on monday afternoon , squads of troops rushed inside the burning building , and long bursts of automatic gunfire rang out , causing onlookers blocks away to hit the deck we are also closing in on the attackers , said david kimaiyo , inspector general of the national police service , in a twitter post earlier on monday the attack killed people from many countries france britain canada india china and ghana , among others many kenyans fear that the crisis could seriously hurt the economy , which is fueled by tourism and outside investment and is highly vulnerable to swings in perception kenya s currency fell against the dollar on monday on monday , reflecting the breadth of the crisis , judges at the international criminal court in the hague took the unusual step of suspending for one week the trial of kenya s deputy president , william ruto , on charges of crimes against humanity so that he could return home to assist in the government s response we have been assaulted by hateful , unthinking cowards , mr ruto said at the airport upon his return they work for the devil , we work for a living god , he added we shall defeat them we shall defeat them
this is a particularly bad time to sell the american people a war , and make no mistake we are being sold , and this military action , in another time and place and in some quarters , here and now would be called an act of war americans are not only weary of war , they 're weary of the politicians who commit us to it according to , only 10 percent of americans now have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in congress , a record low since gallup started tracking the measure in 1973 only 36 percent have the same level of confidence in the presidency furthermore , the degree to which americans trust the government in washington to do the right thing at least most of the time has tanked since peaking in the jingoistic , post9 11 , posttraumaticstress era according to gallup , the percentage of americans trusting the government to do the right thing always or at least most of the time hit a high of 60 percent in october 2001 that high level of trust mixed with a high level of patriotism , a clear attack on american soil and a clear enemy who publicly took credit responsibility for the attacks made going to war in afghanistan an easy choice president george w bush could do no wrong his soared to 90 percent then came iraq , and so began w s disaster the focus shifted from the country harboring the terrorists who 'd just finished an attack on an american business center to the country where w s father had left business unfinished so while american patriotism was at a record high according to gallup , the proportion of people in this country who said that they were extremely or very reached 92 percent in 2002 the bush administration , with its nest of warmongers , set about selling a trumpedup war with trumpedup facts the bush administration led us to a well that they knew was poisoned skepticism began to displace trust as the lies came into full resolution our faith had been misplaced our confidence had been betrayed we were promised that the war would only last a few months , but it stretched on from one miserable year to another and the bodies of young american men and women stacked up or came home mangled we were told that iraq s president , saddam hussein , had a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction none were ever found in our war of mass deception we were told that the iraqi people would see us as a we would come to be seen as a nightmare occupier how could the government have sold us such distortions \? how could so many of us have bought them \? never again , we said now here we are with another administration coming to congress and to the american people , asking for approval to strike another middle eastern dictator over weapons of mass destruction but this time , the facts on the ground in america have been altered the aftertaste from iraq still lingers to do the right thing at least most of the times has plunged to just 19 percent congress is divided on how we should proceed and the international community has yet to rally in favor of intervention striking syria has given americans a chance to exhibit and exercise the caution that they eschewed in the leadup to the iraq war , and they are doing just that according to an abc news washington post poll released this week , 6 in 10 americans oppose launching missile strikes against the syrian government even if the united states says it has determined that the syrians used chemical weapons people are questioning everything as they should are we absolutely sure of the evidence \? are there no options other than military options \? can we be guaranteed that we wo n't face retaliation and that we wo n't be drawn into a protracted engagement \? will bombing ease the refugee crisis or exacerbate it \? is this really about sending a message to syria about its use of chemical weapons , or is syria just a proxy , a small state on which we can make a big statement , a way for us to send a signal to others that our word is absolute \? is this an act of humanitarianism or militarism \? and what do we hope to accomplish \? the president has said that he s not interested in regime change with this action , and many fear that deposing s president , bashar alassad , at this moment could cause more problems than it would solve we are wary of terrorist elements within the opposition who would love to get their hands on syria s weapons in this community of thought , the syrian civil war is a war among demons with few angels and yet , syria s civilians still suffer more than 100 , 000 are dead , seven million are displaced \( that s a third of the country s population \) , including  something should be done , but what \? and why must we do it \? this is not an easy issue , but committing this country to military action never should be president obama is not president bush and iraq is n't syria , but trust is trust , and when certitude melts into uncertainty , it is hard to reshape
i recently had a serious hiv scare after an episode of unprotected sex the next day , at whitmanwalker , a clinic in washington that specializes in treating gay patients , i began a monthlong regimen of the drug truvada , a form of postexposure prophylaxis , or pep it has to be taken within 72 hours after potential contact with the virus that causes aids the price tag would normally be 1 , 200 , but i was able to get a subsidy the manufacturer gives to lowincome earners you can only get this deal once , my doctor warned jeez , i hope so , i said i mean , it s not like there are pep regulars , right \?

tel aviv declared tuesday that it had found evidence that the syrian government repeatedly used chemical weapons last month , arguing that president bashar alassad was testing how the united states and others would react and that it was time for washington to overcome its deep reluctance to intervene in the syrian civil war in making the declaration which went somewhat beyond recent suspicions expressed by britain and france israeli officials argued that president assad had repeatedly crossed what said last summer would be a red line but obama administration officials pushed back , saying they would not leap into the conflict on what they viewed as inconclusive evidence , even while working with allies on plans to secure the weapons if it appeared they were about to be used or handed to hezbollah the declaration from israel s senior military intelligence analyst was immediately questioned in washington officials said an investigation was necessary , but added that american intelligence agencies had yet to uncover convincing evidence that an attack on march 19 , and smaller subsequent attacks , used sarin gas , a deadly agent that is believed to hold in huge stockpiles we are looking for conclusive evidence , if it exists , if there was use of chemical weapons , jay carney , the white house press secretary , said when pressed on the israeli assessment in a briefing in tel aviv , an israeli military official was vague about the exact nature of the evidence , saying that it was drawn from an examination of photographs of victims and some direct findings that he would not specify secretary of state john kerry suggested there were mixed messages emerging from israel , saying that he spoke to prime minister benjamin netanyahu on tuesday morning and that the israeli leader was not in a position to confirm the intelligence assessment israeli officials said they would not try to explain the apparent difference between mr netanyahu s statement and that of his top military intelligence officials at the same time , daniel b shapiro , the american ambassador to israel , said that contingency plans to address the use of chemical weapons in syria were very much part of the discussions between defense secretary chuck hagel and his israeli counterpart here on monday the israeli intelligence analyst , brig gen itai brun , told participants at a security conference in tel aviv that the syrian government has increasingly used chemical weapons that echoed accusations that britain and france made in a letter last week to the secretary general of the united nations , calling for a deeper investigation the very fact that they have used chemical weapons without any appropriate reaction , general brun said , is a very worrying development , because it might signal that this is legitimate general brun s statements were the most definitive to date by an israeli official regarding evidence of possible chemical weapons attacks on march 19 near aleppo , syria , and damascus , the capital another military official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said that the evidence had been presented to the obama administration but that it had not fully accepted the analysis none of the assertions by israel , britain or france have included physical proof experts say the most definitive way to prove the use of chemical weapons is to collect soil samples promptly at the site and examine suspected victims a senior defense department official noted that the use of chemical weapons in an environment like syria is very difficult to confirm he added given the stakes involved , lowconfidence assessments by foreign governments cannot be the basis for us action the president has clearly stated that the use of chemical weapons would be a game changer thus , we must be absolutely confident of use before determining how to respond that will not be easy the syrian government , which has accused insurgents of using chemical weapons and has requested that a united nations forensics team investigate , has refused to allow that team to enter the country because of a dispute over the scope of its inquiry mr kerry , at a meeting of nato foreign ministers in brussels , urged that members of the alliance be ready to respond if it was determined that syria had in fact used chemical weapons but after his phone call with mr netanyahu he told reporters , i do n't know yet what the facts are , adding , i do n't think anybody knows what they are israeli military officials insisted at an annual conference of the institute for national security studies , one of the country s leading research institutes , that after a month of investigations they now understand what happened general brun said , it is quite clear that they used harmful chemical weapons he cited different signs , including photographs of syrians foaming at the mouth in a briefing after those comments , another israeli military official said it was believed that the attacks involved sarin gas , the same agent used in a 1995 assault on the tokyo subway system that killed 13 the syrian attacks killed a couple of dozens , the military official said , in what israel judged as a test by mr assad of the international community s response he said that the government had deployed chemicals a handful of times since then , but that the details and effectiveness of those attacks were sketchier their fear of using it is much lower than before using it , the official added if somebody would take any reaction , maybe it would deter them from using it again the public statements regarding the attacks , made days after the british and french governments wrote to secretary general ban kimoon of the united nations saying they , too , had evidence of chemical weapons , could complicate the situation for washington if the united states has been more reluctant than its allies to come to firm conclusions about chemical weapons , it may be because such proof could force mr obama s hand in august , the president that any evidence that mr assad was moving the weapons or making use of them could prompt the united states to act that would change my calculus , he said that would change my equation mr obama s aides have since amended his statement , saying that he was referring to major use of chemical weapons akin to what saddam hussein employed against the kurds two decades ago or the transfer of weapons to terrorist groups mr hagel s spokesman , george little , said in amman , jordan , where mr hagel arrived on tuesday , that the president s warnings remained in place we reiterate in the strongest possible terms the obligations of the syrian regime to safeguard its chemical weapons stockpiles and not to use or transfer such weapons to terrorist groups like hezbollah the united states has made efforts to gather evidence from the field in syria , but with few apparent results majid , a rebel commander from the eastern suburbs of damascus , said recently that his battalion had been contacted , through intermediaries , by the central intelligence agency , requesting samples to be tested for the presence of chemicals speaking via skype from jordan , and on the condition that he be identified only by his first name for his safety , majid said that the cia had requested soil , urine and hair samples from several areas around damascus
seeking to reconcile two contradictory realities a friend said admission was free , and a sign said admission might or might not be 25 ingrid opperman stood at the entrance desk to the on a recent morning and whipped out her englishgerman dictionary i am looking up admissions , ' explained ms opperman , 75 i am also looking up recommended' you do n't have to be from stuttgart to feel befuddled by the met s entrance policy , with its signs telling you what to spend and then suggesting that you do not have to spend it two lawsuits wending their way through state supreme court are seeking to address that confusion , accusing the museum of misleading the public not only but also , more important , about whether it is necessary to pay at all late last month , the museum argued in state supreme court that the cases , brought by members of the public , had no merit and should be thrown out \( the judge has yet to rule \) under a clause in its original 1876 lease for the space , and according to an 1893 state law , the suits contend , the museum is required to allow visitors to be admitted free on most days of the week this is a case about democracy in new york , said andrew g celli jr , a lawyer for the plaintiffs we had a partnership between the government and the arts communities , and it is clear that the bargain has broken down many visitors make a different sort of bargain when they visit the museum , an internal one involving rapid and conflicting questions of guilt , moral obligation , personal financial prudence and not wanting to look cheap meanwhile , the met said that free admission went the way of free love back in 1970 , when a new deal struck between the city and the museum effectively superseded all the old arrangements though controversy raged around the introduction of the new pay what you wish policy back then , those were simpler times , with simpler sums many visitors paid less than 25 cents to receive the famous met buttons \( which were briefly tickets and are now stickers \) the agreement with the city specifies that there has to be some minimal contribution , said harold holzer , the met s senior vice president for public affairs there are people who express their own interpretation of the policy by paying very little but something is required there is no question that except for the most alert visitor , a murkiness surrounds the matter of how to gain entry to the museum correctly first , there are the signs that set out admissions prices in bold type 25 for adults 17 for those over 65 and also contain the smaller , unbolded word recommended then there are the printed materials noting that a perk of annual membership \( cost 60 and up \) is free admission , the implication being that members get huge savings which , in fact , they do not , since technically they are not required to pay very much to begin with there are internet deals , including a recent offer from groupon , that offer discounted tickets but fail to point out that visitors already have the right to unilaterally discount their own tickets i know lifetime new yorkers who do n't quite know what it all means , mr celli said and it s much harder if you 're not a new yorker in its defense , the met points out that it charges nothing for special exhibitions and that even 25 does not cover the cost of a museum visit if the met loses in court , it stands to forfeit some 40 million in annual revenue , or about 16 percent of its 250 million operating budget an adverse decision could also affect other museums in the city , like the american museum of natural history , which has a  to understand the plaintiffs' arguments , to the 1870s , when the state authorized the parks department to set aside land for a grand new art museum of which the city could be proud whether the museum should charge admission was one of the most hotly contested issues surrounding its inception in the end , its lease with the city specified that on four days a week it be kept open and accessible to the public free of charge in 1893 , the state legislature enacted a law changing that to five days and two nights a week that left the museum able to charge for admission on nonfree days and that was where the matter stood , more or less , until the early 1970s , when the museum was running at a deficit , and its director , , asked the city for permission to charge general admission daily the city council balked a penny today may be a dollar tomorrow , warned councilman carter burden , according to court papers but a deal was hatched between hoving and , the redoubtable new york city parks commissioner and administrator of recreation and cultural affairs heckscher said he would allow the museum to charge a fee as long as its amount was left entirely to the individual s discretion heckscher promised to direct the city s corporation counsel office to amend the museum s lease , but it never did \( the museum says no amendment was needed because , as the museum s landlord , the city can set whatever rules it wants \) according to the two lawsuits one that says the museum deceives its visitors and is guilty of fraud , and the other a classaction suit seeking recompense for people who claim that they were duped by the policy the heckscherhoving agreement violates the lease and the law the plaintiffs in the suits comprise five museumgoers , including a persistent critic of , and past litigant against , the museum on other matters , and two czech citizens who responded to an internet appeal for people who said they had been misled into paying the full suggested admissions price the museum s lawyers argue , among other things , that the parties in the two suits have no standing to sue that the 1893 act was merely an appropriations act and that , in the end , none of that really matters , because the city specifically said the charges could be imposed this notion that the plaintiffs have encouraged , and that has been picked up in the blogosphere that you do n't have to pay anything is not true , mr holzer said moreover , he said , the signage is clear he added that the average visitor pays 11 , which indicates to me that people are paying exactly what they wish about 10 years ago , mr holzer said , the museum switched from its previous mitigating word , suggested , to the new one , recommended we wanted to see if it made any difference , he said , and it did n't make much difference a recent visit to the museum found an array of admissionsrelated opinions some people said they felt guilty and stingy unless they paid the recommended amount others said they loved the museum and thought any price was worth it and still others said they could not figure out what they were supposed to do we kind of heard a rumor that you do n't have to pay , said kim archibald , 33 , who was visiting from canada and on a budget in the end , she and her two friends paid a total of 23 , all they had allotted for incidental expenses that day this is not the cheapest city in the world to visit , she said
the mets had finally and mercifully departed the city , leaving the behind to contend with a more formidable and important foe intracity rivalry turned to intradivisional rivalry friday as the yankees felt the pressure to end a fivegame losing streak the return of two key players from lengthy stays on the disabled list was supposed to be the balm that would soothe the sting of the mets' fourgame sweep mark teixeira and kevin youkilis finally came back , but it was the seeming return of a player who never left that was the most helpful and reassuring aspect to the yankees' evening after a month of baffling performances and questions about his ability to pitch with a slightly slower fastball , the old dominant , aggressive and precise suddenly reappeared on the mound when the yankees needed him most pitching like the ace he is supposed to be , sabathia held the to one run over seven and a third commanding innings as the yankees beat the red sox , 41 , ending their losing streak and his own and moving within a game of firstplace boston in the american league east it was sabathia s first win since april 27 , and in his previous five starts he was 02 with a 485 earned run average as much as the yankees have minimized the mysterious dip in sabathia s velocity coming into friday s game , the fact that he reached 94 miles per hour with his fastball with regularity for the first time this season was suddenly greeted with near jubilation from nearly all corners his velocity was getting up there a little bit and i think he could feel the moment , vernon wells said this is a big game for us with the way we 've been playing him being able to get back on the mound and do what he did was huge for us since the beginning of last season , sabathia is 92 with a 263 era after a yankees loss he gave up six hits , walked none and struck out 10 , tying his season high in that category and to underscore wells s point that sabathia seemed to be motivated for what was really a vital game , it was the first time since he joined the yankees that he struck out 10 without issuing a walk with us having a tough week and us being swept by the mets , you want to go out and have a good game , sabathia said i was lucky enough to do that tonight luck had almost nothing to do with it sabathia was replaced after getting the first out of the eighth inning on his 109th pitch all game he worked ahead of hitters , pitching with confidence and attacking them with the resurgence of his highvelocity heaters for manager joe girardi , the only explanation for the increased pace of his fastballs was the warm weather i have n't seen any 94s until tonight , girardi said , and there were a lot of 92s and 94s whereas we 've seen a lot of 89s to 91s teixeira went 0 for 3 and scored a run in his season debut after a threemonth recovery from a torn tendon sheath in his wrist , and youkilis returned from a bulging disk in his back to go 1 for 4 with a run batted in mariano rivera , who blew his first save opportunity of the season against the mets on tuesday , returned to the mound for the first time since then and earned his 19th save , despite giving up ground ball singles to dustin pedroia and david ortiz with one out he struck out mike napoli , then got stephen drew to ground out to end the losing streak if he would have loaded the bases with nobody out , brett gardner said , i still would feel good about my chances but even with rivera s comeback performance and the return of youkilis and teixeira , this game was about the return of sabathia and the promise it could hold he was disconsolate after allowing a seasonhigh seven runs in his last outing against tampa bay that started the yankees' losing streak , and vowed to be more aggressive catcher chris stewart said that from the moment sabathia started warming up in the bullpen , his stuff was hard and true , and it held into the game sabathia insists that he does not look up at the radar gun readings on the scoreboard during his games , and that he does not care anymore what they say when i was younger , i did , he said i thought that was the way i was getting guys out but as i get older , i know it s more about location than velocity inside pitch ivan nova and vidal nuno were optioned to class aaa scranton wilkesbarre to make room for mark teixeira and kevin youkilis on the 25man roster nova and nuno are expected to join the starting rotation there after failing to draw a walk in their last three games , the yankees drew four on friday , all of which led off innings joe girardi was ejected for arguing a call in the sixth inning he admitted that replays showed he was wrong kareem abduljabbar watched the game from the stands wearing a brooklyn dodgers hat
before president obama administered his fix to the affordable care act last week and even before it was clear that he was leaning that way , bill clinton piped up , opining that obama should honor his claim that americans with insurance they liked could keep it this advice was n't exactly solicited and inasmuch as it gave detractors of obama and obamacare a fresh cudgel , it was n't terribly helpful , either but bill will be bill that s one way to view his latest postpresidential intervention as the impromptu utterance of a man whose mind is always racing , whose mouth is often running and who does n't mind the microphones and the spotlight there was an opening for his perspective , an appetite  you can alternately view what he said as payback he s no doubt aware of a widely publicized nugget from the new book double down game change 2012 , which reports that obama finds him a tad insufferable , the guest who overstays his welcome , and has said that he s best savored so he gave obama a dose all right it was more vinegar than honey , with just the slightest trace of arsenic or you can view what happened last week in grandly strategic and utterly gallant terms , which is where things really get interesting and which may be the most accurate appraisal of all clinton is looking to 2016 , and he s helping hillary it s less dicey for him than for her to secondguess obama , which could wind up being a prerequisite to succeeding him his presidency at this particular moment looks more and more like one of those unlucky florida homes perched unsuspectingly over a sinkhole soon only the top of the chimney will be visible and making sure that obamacare get fixed , and that a majority of americans three years from now are at peace with it , could have as much bearing on hillary s ambitions as on obama s legacy voters wo n't rush to elect a democratic president if the health care reforms that the party promoted so assiduously go bust what an unusual political spectacle we have before us , and what an amazing one could be ahead for starters there s clinton himself , an expresident in excelsis , his stride brisker , his footprint larger and his etiquette looser than those of other oval office alumni he s more ubiquitous , more loquacious , not just an as he was called after his sprawling remarks at the 2012 democratic convention , but a belittler in waiting , emitting so many words on so many fronts that a few are bound to sting last june he questioned obama s deference to publicopinion surveys that showed weak support for military intervention in syria and said that a president who hesitates for such reasons risks looking like in his animation and expansiveness , he s a sustained retort to obama s style obama right now is enduring the newsmedia ordeal of every president whose agenda has gone offtrack , with each facet of his personality examined and tagged as the cause he s aloof , he s cold , he s a loner clinton is the everpresent antonym of all of that , bringing obama s peculiarities and liabilities into relief as i watched obama s stiff apology on thursday i completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of americans , he said , with a listlessness that suggested that he completely wanted to get far away from the podium i could n't help imagining clinton s hypothetical performance in a similar spot and bind he would have been lavish with empathy , promiscuous with it he would have bled and he would have gushed in commenting on current events , he no longer has to be as restrained as he was during obama s first four years , when hillary was the secretary of state bill , doing his own globetrotting , could easily have said something to trip her up or bring her grief to the astonishment of many democrats well familiar with his past recklessness , he did n't it s amazing to me that he caused her no problems , one longtime democratic political operative remarked to me last week that was a thoughtful , daily exercise in discipline he s disciplined when he to be , a democratic strategist who has worked with him told me this observation bolstered the theory that the syria dig and last week s obamacare riff were n't accidental , at least not entirely , and that clinton s comments about obama can be read as those of hillary s proxy , establishing any necessary distance between what obama is doing and how a different democratic president for example , might handle things you ca n't overinterpret it , the strategist cautioned , saying that even a couple as conniving as the clintons ca n't and do n't sit there at the chessboard every day but hillary s possible candidacy is always in his subconscious , the strategist added , referring to bill he s always aware that he s got this project , which is getting her elected president if that s what she wants he was an effective , tireless cheerleader for obama during the 2012 campaign , an effort in line with what he surely deemed best for the country but it may have been best for hillary in 2016 , too had obama lost , the democratic nominee in the coming presidential election would be facing a republican incumbent besides , bill deftly kindled clinton nostalgia , reminding people of a more prosperous era but the calculus for him over the coming years is much , much more complicated if obama does n't recover , if there are more fumbles and if hillary formally decides that she 'd like to carry the ball next , bill s best approach may be cheerleading mingled with fault finding , and the current president may be faced with a former president whose tangle of motives is unlike any that other former presidents possessed at the same time , bill ca n't be too vocal , too vivid exposure has risks , evident in his divisive about the south carolina primary that hillary lost to obama in 2008 and in precisely the way that he sometimes makes obama seem tepid , he could outshine hillary , inadvertently or not a friend of mine who went to a public event of hers last week was blown away by how blown away he was amid all of the hillary hullabaloo , he 'd forgotten that she s no dynamo on the stump many democrats overlook this , but not the ones whispering sweet encouragements in elizabeth warren s ear part of what they see in warren and part of what they believe could make her a spoiler is a sizzle that does n't come as naturally to hillary back to bill to pay his sizable debt to his wife , to pave his own return to the white house , he 'd have to pull off a balancing act like none in the history of helpmeets you have to hand it to the clintons never a dull moment
carcaliu , romania on a snowy day in january , radu dogaru , sheltering with a computer at his mother s house in this remote romanian village , set out the terms for a deal that had eluded him for months but that now suddenly seemed tantalizingly close communicating on facebook with a fellow member of a gang that , three months earlier in rotterdam , had , mr dogaru said he wanted to finish the show and work out a sale of the stolen paintings to a wealthy local wine producer who had sent word that he was keen to buy the paintings , by picasso , monet , matisse and other modern masters , were worth tens of millions of dollars but mr dogaru , desperate to unload the canvasses , told his accomplice , mihai alexandru bitu , that the eager buyer could have the dogs for 400 , 000 euro , about 531 , 000 , and agreed to take the paintings to a meeting the next day to complete the sale what do you think about this buyer , so hot suddenly \? asked mr dogaru , according to a record of the exchange yesterday he was not interested , and now he is hitting the phones what he did not realize , though , was that the buyer , serghei cosma , was cooperating with the romanian prosecutor s office and planned to attend the meeting with an agent masquerading as an art expert the whole thing was an elaborate sting operation we were about to catch them redhanded , said raluca botea , the chief prosecutor in a special romanian unit responsible for fighting organized crime and the leader of the hunt for the art thieves she was one of numerous people close to the case interviewed for this article mr cosma declined to comment just a few hours later , however , the operation fell apart , when mr dogaru received a warning that the police were tapping his cellphone today , six months on , the fate of the paintings is still unknown , as law enforcement authorities in romania and the netherlands , as well as art lovers around the world , struggle to penetrate the fog of claims and counterclaims about what happened to the masterpieces , from the in rotterdam , as mr dogaru s mother , olga , has at times claimed \? or perhaps spirited away by a tall mystery man in a fancy black car , as \? or could they , as many in the desolate village of carcaliu believe , simply be hidden somewhere in this rural corner of romania \? as a citizen of the world , i want to believe that the paintings still exist , said ms botea , the chief prosecutor but as a prosecutor i need facts i do n't yet know what has happened to them or whether they have been destroyed or not the failure of the sting operation extinguished hopes that the only person who knew and perhaps still knows the exact location of the paintings might lead the authorities to his loot , and has left the art world fearing the works may be lost forever investigators are not sure how many paintings mr dogaru planned to sell to the bogus buyer and suspect only four , each for 100 , 000 euros , but that would have been much better than the none they have now arrested on the night of jan 19 , mr dogaru , who is scheduled to go on trial in august , has admitted to stealing the paintings but has given little solid information about what has become of them he has suggested darkly that other , bigger fish are involved and will kill him if he talks but , according to ms botea , the chief prosecutor , much of what mr dogaru , 29 , and his 50yearold mother , who was arrested in march , have said has scant relation to the truth in one instance , mr dogaru indicated that the robbery in rotterdam had been an inside job he pointed a finger at the director of the kunsthal museum , describing him as a man who wanted to help a wayward son entangled with a romanian prostitute in fact , the director is a woman , with young children mr dogaru s lawyer , radu catalin dancu , said he had pressed his client to say where the paintings are and who else might have been involved in the robbery other than the small group of smalltime romanian criminals now in detention but this , said the lawyer , has yielded nothing concrete mr dogaru s mother , meanwhile , has spun a tangled web of contradictory stories she changes her story all the time depending on how she sees the interests of her son , ms botea said one thing that does seem clear is that after a meandering journey the paintings ended up for a time in carcaliu , a village mostly inhabited by russianspeaking old believers , a community that broke away from the russian orthodox church in the 17th century and developed a deep wariness of outsiders mr dogaru was raised largely by his russianspeaking mother his hottempered romanian father kept getting thrown in jail for violent brawls his 86yearold grandmother said mr dogaru prayed , crossed himself and read the bible he is a very serious man , she added villagers say that they occasionally saw mr dogaru at church and that , unlike many local men , he did not get drunk or smoke and took great pride in his physical condition but , according to a neighbor who declined to be named because he feared retribution , mr dogaru s only real interest in religion was the theft of icons from village homes when he is here , we have trouble when he goes , everything is calm , the neighbor said the paintings mr dogaru has admitted to stealing in rotterdam which include monet s waterloo bridge , london , gauguin s girl in front of open window and picasso s harlequin head started their journey to what many fear was oblivion in a bold raid last year mr dogaru and an associate grabbed seven works shortly after 3 am on oct 16 , entering and leaving the kunsthal in just 96 seconds , and leaving no clues to their identity except for blurry , unrecognizable images on security cameras the alarm sounded only as they left the next morning , mr dogaru took five of the stolen paintings to brussels , where he attempted to sell them to a mobster known as george the thief failing , he carried the works back to rotterdam the same day one of mr dogaru s partners hid all seven paintings in pillows and drove nearly nonstop to carcaliua , arriving on oct 19 , according to a detailed account of the group s activities contained in an official indictment though only a small village , carcaliu has so far defied months of insistent probing by the antiorganized crime unit , which hired a man from the area to try to make sense of the archaic russian spoken there and carried out some 60 searches the village has resisted giving up its secrets describing the case as the most difficult in her 24year career , ms botea said , there are nights we cannot sleep because of the frustration we feel about this whole case mr dogaru appears to have hidden the works initially in his family home but later moved at least some of them in a suitcase to the house of his mother s sister , marfa marcu mrs marcu , in an interview , said she had never opened the suitcase she says she last saw it when her sister took it away , along with a shovel , soon after mr dogaru s arrest mrs dogaru has told prosecutors that , with the help of her son s girlfriend , she buried the case in the yard of an abandoned house after a few days , they dug it up , wrapped the paintings in plastic and buried them in a nearby cemetery the trail then goes cold in an interview with prosecutors on feb 27 , mrs dogaru said that sometime in january , this time acting alone , she dug up the paintings and , desperate to destroy the evidence of her son s theft , brought them home and burned them all in a stove used to heat water for the bathroom and a sauna how she managed to do this is not clear the stove in which mrs dogaru claimed to have shoved all the artworks is barely a foot wide and seems far too small to contain what would have been a bulky bundle of canvas and wood in a written statement on feb 28 , mrs dogaru retracted the incineration story and said she had , in fact , handed the paintings to a russianspeaking man , about 40 , who arrived at her house in a black car she explained that her son , whom she visited in prison to get instructions , had told her to expect such a visitor and to give him the paintings mrs dogaru told the same story to a livein housekeeper , florentina pondichie , and to her and her son s lawyer , mr dancu the housekeeper , in an interview , said she had never seen mrs dogaru burn anything in the stove late at night and thought the artwork had been taken away the lawyer , too , doubted that the paintings were burned i believe that somehow , somewhere we will find these paintings , he said since february , however , mrs dogaru has flipflopped more than once in a statement in june , she returned to her earlier version of a pyre of artworks in the bathroom stove but on monday , she told a panel of three judges in a bucharest courtroom i did not burn them the only hard , but still very tentative , evidence of what might have happened has come from a laboratory at the national history museum in bucharest , which last week completed a forensic analysis of ash collected from the stove it is quite likely that something terrible has happened , said the museum s director , ernest oberlandertarnoveanu analysis of the ash , he said , had found nails , tacks , color pigments and fragments of canvas indicating the remains of at least four paintings we know that she burned some paintings , but we do n't know if what she burned were the paintings from the kunsthal , the director said when mr dogaru first left carcaliu for the netherlands last year , he left behind a reputation for brawling and smalltime banditry but gave no indication of a career ahead as a worldclass art thief soon after his arrival in rotterdam , mr dogaru took an unorthodox turn in his quest for new and brighter horizons he registered his girlfriend , natasha timofei , then 18 and a former star pupil at carcaliu s village school , on kinkynl , a pornographic web site that bills itself as a prostitution marketplace while the girlfriend made about 2 , 655 a week from clients about four times the average monthly salary in romania mr dogaru and two romanian friends spent their time pimping , pumping iron and robbing houses , according to the indictment but then they set their sights on a more ambitious goal stealing masterworks of 19th and early20thcentury art from the kunsthal museum he has known only one thing since he was 4 years old , and that is stealing , said stefan karpov , a carcaliu resident who recalled mr dogaru as a bully notorious for his brushes with the law back in romania after the robbery , mr dogaru began telephoning contacts , believing that stolen paintings by worldfamous artists could be sold in much the same way as stolen luxury watches , which he had some experience in fencing his contacts included petre condrat , a prominent model in bucharest , who he thought might know wealthy people interested in buying something different , something special , according to the prosecutor s account of the case on nov 17 , he sent an accomplice , eugen darie , with two works a matisse and a gauguin to meet a possible buyer found by mr condrat an art expert was present to verify authenticity after examining the brush strokes and composition , the expert , mariana dragu , took the paintings into the bathroom to inspect them under an ultraviolet light she decided they were genuine when the meeting finished , she promptly alerted the police it was obvious that the paintings did not have a legal origin , she said last week in a telephone interview quickly homing in on mr dogaru as the ringleader , the romanian antiorganized crime unit started tapping his phones and in the following weeks tracked his increasingly frantic efforts to find a buyer i'm thinking what the hell are we going to do with this luggage , mr dogaru told his accomplice , mr darie , in early january i'm worried that were are going to be stuck real bad mr darie , who has since been arrested and admitted to driving the getaway car in rotterdam and to driving the paintings to romania , replied that if a buyer could not be found soon we are going to bury them and we can dig them up in a hundred years if we want investigators , who were listening in , realized that their quarry was getting desperate and could be lured in , along with the paintings , if they could set up a bogus buyer but their hope turned to panic when on jan 19 , mr dogaru said in a phone conversation that he was very scared and suggested that he might burn the paintings mr dogaru had just been told by mr condrat , the model , that the police were tapping his cellphone investigators say they think mr condrat , who could not be reached for comment , had no specific information about the investigation but was trying to distance himself from mr dogaru the call nonetheless upended the sting operation fearing that the art work might go up in smoke , the antiorganized crime unit ordered mr dogaru s immediate arrest we had to do something , ms botea said even from behind bars , mr dogaru has still not given up on trading the paintings when two dutch police officers and a prosecutor traveled to romania in june to interview him , according to romanian officials who were present , mr dogaru offered to give them four paintings if they moved him to stand trial in the netherlands , where he apparently judged prisons to be more congenial than those in romania the dutch authorities allow that mr dogaru might have offered information on the paintings' whereabouts in return for a trial in the netherlands , but they deny ever taking the deal seriously he may have offered , but we , from the beginning , have said that we will do it in the usual way , through the romanian authorities , said jeichien de graaff , a spokesman for the rotterdam public prosecutor our aim has always been to get the artwork back
the broadway revival of cat on a hot tin roof , starring scarlett johansson as maggie the cat , fell short of recouping its 36 million capitalization before ending its 15week run on saturday , a spokeswoman for the show said on monday while only 25 percent of broadway shows ever turn a profit , this cat was initially seen as a likely moneymaker given the star billing of ms johansson , who had proven herself on broadway in the 2010 revival of a view from the bridge \( for which she won a tony award \) and seemed a natural fit as the sexy , fierce maggie the producers were so confident that they provided ms johansson a star salary minimum of 40 , 000 a week the challenges facing the revival began with the show s theater , the richard rodgers the producers had hoped to mount the play in a 1 , 100seat broadway playhouse , which would have provided atmospheric intimacy none were available , however , so the play went into the 1 , 400seat rodgers , traditionally a musical theater house not only did the production feel somewhat swallowed by the large space , the actors often found themselves speaking at a loud pitch just to hear each other and some of the early buzz on the show criticized them for seeming to shout the critics reviews in january were mixed several praised ms johansson , but the takeaway was that the revival was not a mustsee and given that this was the third cat on a hot tin roof on broadway in just the last decade , audience demand for another staging of the show may have been modest to begin with ticket sales began to slide after the reviews were published and never really recovered its final week was one of its strongest at the box office , which is typical for a show about to close for the seven performances last week , cat grossed 721 , 456 , or 63 percent of the maximum potential amount still , only 80 percent of the seats were sold for that final week had the show been in a smaller playhouse , of course , the gross potential would have been higher and there would have been more soldout performances but whether the show would have recouped in a smaller theater is impossible to predict stuart thompson , the play s lead producer and a broadway veteran on several tonywinning shows \( the book of mormon , god of carnage \) , declined to comment this week asked if the show had recouped , the show s spokeswoman simply replied , not quite , and declined further comment this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
president obama , who seems to think the american people simply need some reassurance that their privacy rights are intact , on friday that only tinker around the edges of the nation s abusive surveillance programs he said he wants greater oversight , greater transparency , and constraints on the mass collection of every american s phone records by the national security agency he did n't specify what those constraints and oversight measures would be , only that he would work with congress to develop them but , in the meantime , the collection of records will continue as it has for years , gathering far more information than is necessary to fight terrorism he said he wants an adversary to challenge the government s positions at the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court , a longneeded reform that would allow the court s federal judges to hear more than one point of view in approving targets and security policy but if those arguments remain closed to the public and the president did not suggest otherwise then it will be impossible to evaluate whether the change has had any effect at a minimum , he could have urged the court to release unclassified summaries of its opinions when possible finally , he announced that the nsa would hire a civil liberties and privacy officer and create a web site about its mission , and that a task force would review the nation s surveillance technologies these measures , however , are unlikely to have a real effect on intelligence gathering fundamentally , mr obama does not seem to understand that the nation needs to hear more than soothing words about the government s spying enterprise he suggested that if ordinary people trusted the government not to abuse their privacy , they would n't mind the vast collection of phone and email data bizarrely , he compared the need for transparency to showing his wife that he had done the dishes , rather than just telling her he had done so outofcontrol surveillance is a bit more serious than kitchen chores it is the existence of these programs that is the problem , not whether they are modestly transparent as long as the nsa believes it has the right to collect records of every phone call and the administration released friday that explained , unconvincingly , why it is perfectly legal then none of the promises to stay within the law will mean a thing if all mr obama is inclined to do is tweak these programs , then congress will have to step in to curb these abuses , a path many lawmakers of both parties are already pursuing there are bills pending that would stop the bulk collection of communications data , restricting it to those under suspicion of terrorism other measures would require the surveillance court to make public far more of its work if the president is truly concerned about public anxiety , he can vocally support legislation to make meaningful changes , rather than urging people to trust him that the dishes are clean

athlone , ireland the demolition getting underway here recently was in a housing complex where a 2yearold , probably chasing a dog , had climbed through a fence last year and drowned in a pool of water behind a dozen partly constructed homes john burke , hired to do the job , marveled that the halfbuilt houses he was about to bulldoze once carried a price tag of more than 450 , 000 he estimated that he was about to grind 500 , 000 worth of abandoned construction into gravel you ca n't do anything with these houses , he said , as his workers made neat piles of the billboard posters surrounding the complex that once promised idyllic living the cost to finish them would be too high there is no market like that here there are no jobs and leaving them unattended is dangerous nothing more typified ireland s roaring economy a decade ago than its housing market , which saw prices and construction surge and nothing better illustrates the costs and complexities of cleaning up after the bursting of that bubble than what to do with the thousands of homes that were never finished or , if they were occupied , have proved to be substandard other countries with similar problems , like spain , are also dealing with the issue , but none have gone as far as ireland , which is aiming to tear down about 40 troubled developments by the end of next year , with more demolitions possible in the future , officials say but in a nation that by the government s estimate still has 1 , 300 socalled ghost estates and possibly hundreds of thousands of unoccupied new homes , the razing program is only nibbling at the problem the pace of development was so huge in the 2000s that at one point , per capita housing completions were four times as high as in the united states during that time , ireland allowed a kind of honor code building inspection the result is that many people paid high prices for houses that are fire hazards or sinking in bogs or are built with faulty foundations or missing drainage systems , a problem that is even harder and more expensive to solve in nearby ballymahon , debbie cox paid about 255 , 000 for her semidetached house in 2005 but when it rains hard , the smell of sewage outside her home has sometimes been overwhelming she gave away her garden furniture because it kept sinking into the mud in her backyard her water pipes , buried too close to the surface , have frozen in very cold weather mrs cox doubts she could get more than 95 , 000 for her property today most of the other homes in her housing complex , hawthorn meadows , about two hours by car from dublin , have been rented for about 500 a month , while she pays about 1 , 100 a month just for her mortgage i do n't think ireland is fixed , she said one recent evening not at all what about people like us \? over all , irish property prices remain nearly 50 percent below their peak in 2007 even on the outskirts of dublin it is easy to find housing developments with many vacancies most of those who do live in them are renters in many cases , they have views of halfbuilt houses surrounded by chainlink fences not all the news about ireland s real estate market is bad as ireland becomes the first euro zone country to officially emerge from an international bailout program later this month , experts say that demand for homes is up in dublin , particularly for houses in certain neighborhoods but most of the ghost estates are in western or central counties including cavan , donegal , roscommon , and longford , often in the countryside where developers received tax incentives to build and where the aftereffects of the economic crisis are still plain to see village main streets are full of boardedup stores and the local authorities are frustrated county longford , where mrs cox lives , received about 14 million from the central government to make repairs in developments like hers last year but brian ross , the county s senior executive engineer who is in charge of troubled housing complexes , says he needs at least 10 times that much to sort out half of it the county s jurisdiction is only over the public spaces and there is no money for issues inside the homes , like a lack of insulation an estimated 12 , 500 homeowners are also dealing with pyrite damage , a substance that creates destabilizing cracks and deep fissures in foundations , walls and ceilings and was widely used during the boom the bill for the 1 , 000 worst cases is expected to be about 70 million the national institute for regional and spatial analysis at the national university of ireland in maynooth concluded in 2010 that there were more than 300 , 000 vacant new homes in ireland , and 621 housing developments with more than 12 houses that were either unoccupied or not fully built more recently , government officials identified about 2 , 000 unoccupied or incomplete developments since then , officials said , remedial measures have reduced the number to about 1 , 300 about 40 , 000 households live in them but even when housing complexes have been identified as unlikely to ever be completed or inhabited , tearing them down may not be so easy many of them are tangled in lawsuits and bankruptcy proceedings at the height of the boom , only 12 percent to 15 percent of new developments were ever visited by inspectors , experts say , compared with 100 percent in the united states and most of europe most experts believe the cost of clearing up the problems will most likely fall to the taxpayers the developers are not going to tear these things down , said rob kitchin , the director of the national institute for regional and spatial analysis they are bust or they probably would have finished them in longford , troubled housing complexes abound , mr ross said one part of a development sinking into a bog has already been torn down but nearby , the rest of it looks in sorry shape even from the outside , the houses of gleann riada show signs of mold tall weeds are growing in some of the gutters one homeowner there said that the local authorities had recently paved the road and put in surveillance cameras but for a time , he said , the sewage system was in such a bad state that methane gas was collecting under the houses there were two explosions , and residents were told not to close their windows , even in winter , and not to light any fires what can you do \? the homeowner said , declining to give his name because his neighbors might be angry at him for talking about problems in the complex you just have to make do experts say some owners of substandard homes may eventually stop paying their mortgages , causing more problems for the country s troubled banks the number of people falling behind in the mortgage payments on their homes continued to grow last quarter , to 99 , 189 , up 1 , 315 during the three months ending in september , according to ireland s central bank some irish homeowners have moved to britain to take advantage of easier bankruptcy laws there recently , ireland made its bankruptcy laws easier as well , though still not as easy as britain s jan o sullivan , ireland s housing minister , said that in many cases the banks were simply going to have to offer debt forgiveness to homeowners in the meantime , mrs cox and her husband said they felt abandoned and were not sure what their next step would be it s been such a huge disappointment , she said the show house was so beautiful
there has been a quiet upheaval in the lobbying industry on the surface , the firms that represent thousands of businesses , trade associations and special interests are taking a beating in practice , however , the lobbying industry is moving below the radar more than 3 billion is still spent annually , more of which is not being publicly disclosed corporate america is relying on new tactics to shape the legislative outcomes it wants the adoption of innovative practices by the influence industry , combined with legal reporting requirements that are full of loopholes , have created misleading indicators which suggest that there has been a decline in the clout of the lobbying sector in fact , lobbying techniques have evolved so as to elude the regulations that implement the 1995 lobbying disclosure act these regulations are revised every 6 months in written guidance on lda registration and reporting requirements issued by the clerk of the house and the secretary of the senate lobbyists and their lawyers are capitalizing on arcane gaps in regulatory guidelines for example , constricted definitions of lobbying contained in congressional regulations have been construed to exempt from disclosure money spent on grass roots mobilization on television , digital and social media campaigns and on public relations efforts to build support among voters and key elites with these exemptions not counted , an analysis of annual lobbying revenues shows that after increasing by 1533 percent between 1998 and 2010 \( from 14 billion to 355 billion \) , disclosed fees have dropped by 250 million , to 33 billion in 2012 at some of the top firms , reported drops have been dramatic barbour , griffith rogers , which was founded by haley barbour , a former chairman of the republican national committee and a former governor of mississippi , has experienced a fall in lobbying revenues , as recorded by the center for responsive politics \( see figure 1 \) they went from 223 million in 2007 to 138 million in 2012 , a 381 percent decline fig 1 half a mile away from bgr , another firm that saw tremendous growth from its founding in 2000 to 2007 , qga , now reports lobbying revenues in a nosedive qga was created by ed gillespie , who also once ran the republican national committee and who has been a key adviser to republican presidential campaigns , and jack quinn , a top adviser to former vice president al gore according to the center for responsive politics \( see figure 2 \) , qga s revenues went from 163 million in 2008 to 68 million in 2012 , a 583 percent decline fig 2 increasingly sophisticated forms of political engagement on both the left and the right have outrun old forms of regulation most recently , the success of the obama campaign in advancing computerdriven techniques to reach key segments of the electorate has produced a blossoming industry of digital and specialized communications firms using data analysis , microtechnology and computerized listbuilding to create public support for or opposition to legislative and policy initiatives virtually all of which goes effectively undisclosed there are other factors pushing lobbying activity into the shadows obama administration regulations bar any lobbyist hired by the executive branch from participation in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to a former employer or former clients , including regulations and contracts they prohibit the appointment of lobbyists to federal boards and commissions and they restrict former federal appointees from lobbying for two years after leaving federal employment taken together , these regulations have encouraged those interested in public service to find jobs that do not require them to register as lobbyists or , put another way , those who are eager for government work are not going to formally register themselves as lobbyists and thus make themselves ineligible at the same time , in part because the administration has painted such a dark picture of lobbying , corporations are seeking alternative mechanisms to achieve their legislative and regulatory goals without public disclosure of their expenditures the enhanced ability of web sites like the center for responsive politics and the sunlight foundation both of which many reporters and columnists , including me , have relied on to provide data on lobbying expenditures has , in turn , increased the likelihood that undisguised corporate spending will receive unwanted publicity to address diminishing revenues , lobbying firms have created their own public relations operations , subsidiaries with the same goals as the lobbying arm , that charge similarly high fees , but which do not have to be publicly reported to either the house or the senate  the brg group , for example , created bgr public relations the firm s web site provides the following background  when our firm started more than two decades ago , clients didn t want help with the media as part of our service now , almost every client wants and needs public relations advice bgr public relations fulfills that need in a big and unique way led by veteran tv and print journalist jeff birnbaum a former washington post and wall street journal reporter and the coauthor of showdown at gucci gulch , bgr pr specializes in offering counsel in a way that sets it apart jeff and his team can explain how reporters think and how they decide what news is from their perspective in ways that conventional pr people simply cannot qga has hired john feehery , who spent 15 years working for the republican house leadership , as president of quinn gillespie communications , and jim manley who spent 21 years working for democratic senators , most recently as communications adviser to senate majority leader harry reid on its web site , qga declares our founding principle that every public policy issue is at its core a communications challenge is even truer today this is why at qga you ll find people who are among washington s most credible and connected , bipartisan government relations and strategic communications professionals you can t just roll into a member of congress , buy a couple of steaks , to get a tax provision , feehery told me in a phone interview he described the basic public relations approach as setting up an echo chamber to help frame messages , by , among other things , creating web sites for the client , seeking coverage of the client s goals by the press , working with pollsters to develop a message and creating videos demonstrating the products or services the client can offer as an example of this work , feehery cited quinn gillespie s efforts in support of the brazilian aircraft manufacturer , embraer , which was competing with a us company , beechcraft , for a 950 million pentagon contract to build 29 light attack aircraft for the afghanistan national army air corps in this case , feehery said , with a foreign company competing with a domestic manufacturer on a military contract , it was important to cultivate a level of respect for the competence of embraer in the broad military community , including not only officers , but contractors , think tank analysts and the extensive media that cover defense issues the campaign on behalf of embraer was aimed at the military , but it was also aimed at the people who talk about these things , who read the pentagon newspapers , aviation magazines , feehery said the internet has radically altered the lobbying arsenal the scope of the ongoing upheaval in lobbying was brought home with a vengeance in 2011 and 2012 by the failure of traditional lobbying strategies to win approval of the stop online piracy act in early 2011 , by all normal standards , the odds were with passage of sopa the legislation had the backing of some of the most powerful companies and associations in washington , including the american bankers association , the aflcio , americans for tax reform , disney , the teamsters , mastercard , visa , espn , the motion picture association , the major tv networks and the us chamber of commerce in addition , the measure had strong bipartisan support in the house , including from lamar smith , republican of texas and chairman of the judiciary committee and many committee members the parallel bill in the senate , the preventing real online threats to economic creativity and theft of intellectual property act of 2011 , had 42 republican and democratic senate sponsors , including patrick leahy , democrat of vermont and chair of the senate judiciary committee on nov 30 , 2011 , will oremus wrote in slate in a time of legislative gridlock , the stop online piracy act looked like a rare bipartisan breakthrough the bill , known as sopa , promised a brave new internet one cleansed of rogue websites that hawk pirated songs and movies as well as counterfeit goods for congress , the legislation s goals amounted to a can tlose trifecta uphold justice , protect legitimate businesses \( and jobs ! \) , and make the web safer for lawabiding consumers who could be against that \? in a month , support for sopa imploded and with it the world of the expense account lobbyist an antisopa coalition abruptly burst on the scene towards the end of 2011 catching the sopa backers by surprise it included some highdollar , hightech corporations google , facebook , twitter , yahoo with the means to invest heavily in lobbying , traditional or otherwise opposition to the bill quickly caught fire among the broader public it was expressed in emails , text messages , voicemails , twitter comments , internet petitions and outspoken attacks at town hall meetings none of which have to be reported as lobbyingrelated backers began to jump ship in january of 2012 , seven house members withdrew sponsorship , and 10 senators followed suit florida republican senator marco rubio , one of the bill s sponsors , announced on facebook earlier this year , this bill passed the senate judiciary committee unanimously and without controversy since then , we ve heard legitimate concerns about the impact the bill could have on access to the internet and about a potentially unreasonable expansion of the federal government s power to impact the internet congress should listen and avoid rushing through a bill that could have many unintended consequences congressman dennis ross , republican of florida and a cosponsor of the bill , tweeted matter of factly , sopa is dead the emergence of a powerful public force outside traditional avenues of influence put fear of elective defeat into the hearts of members of congress and forced the lobbying community to beef up its own nontraditional tactics now , in the lexicon of washington insiders , the acronym sopa has become a verb , as in the warning to overconfident legislators don t get sopaed anita dunn , former director of communications in the obama white house and now a managing director of the democratic strategic consulting firm , skdknickerbocker , said in a phone interview that the public dialogue has become more important in influencing the climate in which decisions are made dunn pointed out that the universe of gatekeepers deciding what the public will know about the legislative process is no longer limited to a very narrow group of people , editors and the members of congress instead , she said , the new media including social media means almost anyone can shine a light on congressional negotiations , so that company or association pushing an issue can no longer depend on the effectiveness of an oldguard lobbyist with good connections on capitol hill if someone decided to lift an issue into the public dialogue , you have to be prepared to have that dialogue , dunn said , which in turn suggests that the hiring of a strategic communications firm like skdknickerbocker to prepare an active communication and pr strategy is a good idea dunn argues that the work she and others do at skdknickerbocker is not in fact lobbying we do not lobby , she told me we work closely on teams with government relations people from other firms this avoidance of activities falling under the legal definition of lobbying allows skdknickerbocker and its clients to minimize publicity concerning work both would perhaps like to keep out of public view the liberalleaning website , republic report , has pointed to a number of skdknickerbocker s controversial activities , many in direct opposition to the obama agenda , including while skdknickerbocker has done well in the new legislative environment , according to dunn , she noted that the most explosive growth in the field of lobbying is taking place in the use of digital technology to mobilize and direct public and elite opinion two of the most prominent are democratic firms that grew out of past presidential campaigns blue state digital , which was founded by a handful of the online specialists in howard dean s 2004 campaign , and bully pulpit interactive , which was started by veterans of obama s 2008 campaign on the bully pulpit web site , jen nedeau , a director of the company , argues there is a strong overlap between political and commercial digital advertising by using datadriven ads to craft a narrative , we believe that social media does not only have the ability to sell soap , but as we ve already proven , it can help to get out the vote and at least in 2012 , that is one action that has certainly made a difference modesty is no virtue in the world of client acquisition , and blue state digital exhibits none on its web site , the firm boasts blue state digital helps clients create change in their own organizations , in the marketplace , and in society we do work that matters building authentic relationships and activating audiences , raising awareness and raising money the company does not stop there every agency promises results , it says we create behavior blue state s clients run the gamut from corporations like hbo , ford , att and google to unions and trade associations like the communications workers of american , unite , to non profits like the jewish federation the market value of blue state and bully pulpit has been demonstrated by the decision of major public relations conglomerates to gobble up blue state and hire away andrew bleeker , founder of bully pulpit on dec 30 , 2010 , blue state announced that it had been acquired by the world s largest communications services group , wpp less than a month later , on jan 14 , 2011 , hill knowlton strategies , a wpp subsidiary and a longterm member of washington s pr establishment , announced the hiring of bully pulpit s bleeker my goal is to extend the next generation of digital public relations to h k strategies clients , bleeker declared there is another way to interpret these developments the seemingly venturesome high tech and strategic consulting firms in the field of influencing public opinion are headed toward a more traditional businessasusual role as they and their top personnel are acquired by massive multinational corporations the growing network of strategic communications , digital practitioners and the newly created pr subsidiaries of oldline lobbying firms is , in effect , supplanting special pleaders traditional tactics while simultaneously enhancing their ability to operate out of the limelight many of the activities most people would call lobbying now fall outside of its legal definition they have become a large but almost invisible part of special interest influence on public policy
washington s three nominees to run and , the energy department and the sailed through their separate senate confirmation hearings on tuesday and appeared to be on track to win approval from the committees , though none of the panels voted on the nominations marilyn b tavenner , who has been chosen to run the government s big health care programs , won endorsement from the house republican leader , representative eric cantor of virginia , who said he had worked with her in his days as a state lawmaker ms tavenner deflected criticism of mr obama s health care policies with mildmannered responses in which she described herself as a pragmatist committed to solving problems , not scoring ideological points she has been acting administrator of the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services since december 2011 and , if confirmed , would get the job on a permanent basis similarly , mr obama s nominee for energy secretary , , a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology who was under secretary of energy in the clinton administration , faced no opposition tuesday in a threehour hearing held by the senate energy and natural resources committee sylvia mathews burwell , who has been nominated as director of the budget office , also appeared to have in the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs ms tavenner , a nurse , worked for more than two decades at the hospital corporation of america , a commercial hospital chain , eventually becoming an executive there from 2006 to 2010 , she was the secretary of health and human resources in virginia , managing medicaid , foster care and other programs for tim kaine , a democrat who was then governor and is now a united states senator at the hearing , held by the senate finance committee , mr cantor said ms tavenner , who grew up in the rural town of fieldale , va , was eminently qualified ms tavenner pleased republicans with her vision for the medicare agency , which has an annual budget of more than 850 billion we need to operate cms as a business and act like business partners , she said in response to questions , ms tavenner said she had ordered an internal investigation of the premature disclosure of information about the rates that would be paid to medicare managed care plans the disclosure , on april 1 , touched off frenetic trading that drove up share prices for insurance companies that run such medicare advantage plans , including humana , unitedhealth group and aetna i consider this a huge issue , ms tavenner told senator charles e grassley , republican of iowa ms tavenner indicated at several points that she was not impressed with the work of actuaries who say the 2010 could lead to higher premiums for policies sold to consumers in the individual health insurance market fewer than 20 million americans are in that market , ms tavenner said , so most americans will not be affected in addition , she said , the government will offer subsidies in the form of tax credits to help some people pay premiums , and consumers will have a choice of policies providing different levels of coverage at different prices finally , she said , some insurance policies have low premiums for a reason they offer skimpy , barebones coverage , and consumers may not discover that unless they need coverage for a serious illness senator richard m burr , republican of north carolina , said that subsidies mask the cost of health insurance to consumers , but do not hold down the cost of health care or of insurance in response to a question from mr burr , ms tavenner could not immediately say how much it would cost the federal government to run health insurance marketplaces , or exchanges , in more than half the states next year when congress passed the health care law , it assumed that each state would set up its own regulated market , but many states have balked , leaving the task to federal officials ms tavenner said the obama administration was still working with arkansas on its proposal to expand medicaid by subsidizing the purchase of private insurance for lowincome people officials in florida , ohio and other states have expressed interest in such premium assistance , even though it might be more expensive than expanding the traditional medicaid program because private insurers often pay higher rates to doctors and hospitals ms tavenner said she believed that only a handful of states were interested in following arkansas s example mr moniz avoided taking firm positions on many of the issues , and pointedly refused to be pinned down on whether a factory on which the department and which is intended to convert plutonium from bombs into fuel for civilian power reactors should be finished the united states has an agreement with russia , which mr moniz helped negotiate , that each side will convert some of its weaponsgrade plutonium into a form unsuitable for weapons mr moniz did commit to visiting another troubled , multibilliondollar construction project , a in southcentral washington state that is supposed to solidify military nuclear wastes so they cannot spill at the request of the committee chairman , senator ron wyden , democrat of oregon , he also agreed to meet people at the plant who mr wyden said were whistleblowers pointing to safety problems
the obama administration did the right thing earlier this month when it the decision by a littleknown federal agency to ban the import of certain oldermodel apple iphones and ipads that it determined had violated patents owned by samsung electronics the case concerns a class of patents that are part of industry standards used in many electronic devices when setting these standards , technology companies agree to license related patents to one another on to make it easier for everybody to do business but as the wireless business has boomed in recent years , patent negotiations have become increasingly acrimonious and have resulted in brought before an obscure quasijudicial federal agency known as the united states international trade commission in this case , samsung took apple to the commission after the companies were unable to reach a deal over the licensing of samsung patents related to data transmission in devices like the iphone 4 apple argues that samsung refused to honor its promise to license its technology while samsung asserts that apple refused to pay its fees the commission ruled that apple violated samsung s patents and blocked the import of several apple devices that are assembled in china presidents can put aside the commission s decisions , but none have used that authority since 1987 president obama now a strong message that a routine dispute over standardsessential patents should not be the basis of an import ban the administration s action does not preclude samsung from pursuing its patent claims against apple it can still go to federal court , which , unlike the commission , can forbid the sale of devices that infringe on patents or award monetary damages the itc can only ban imports products like smartphones contain millions of technical advances , which is why it is important for the industry to create technical standards and for companies to crosslicense patents to one another the administration s decision in this case supports that process
washington the government shutdown is endangering what america eats , food safety experts said this week , as all inspections of domestic food except meat and poultry have halted and the centers for disease control and prevention recalled furloughed workers to handle a that sickened hundreds of people in 18 states offices are dark across the federal agencies charged with making sure that the fruit , vegetables , dairy products and a vast array of other domestically produced food are safe to consume inspectors , administrative staff , lab technicians , communications specialists and other support staff members have been sent home while lawmakers wrangle over government spending this is a selfinflicted wound that is putting people s health at risk , said representative rosa l delauro , democrat of connecticut , a longtime food safety advocate because the shutdown comes on top of earlier budget cuts to the agencies , she said , you 're creating the potential for a real public health crisis at the same time , several crucial agriculture reports used by traders and farmers have been canceled because of the shutdown , seriously hampering decision making about planting and disrupting commodities markets the highestprofile report canceled because of the shutdown is world agriculture supply and demand estimates , which supplies statistics on the worldwide production of crops from cotton to corn it also provides data on other agricultural products , including meat and sugar it leaves the commodities market in a bit of a fog , said christopher narayan , an analyst with the bank soci t g n rale in new york , who said investors would face difficulties in obtaining accurate information at the food and drug administration , which is responsible for inspecting the bulk of food that americans eat , the agency has gone from a goal of inspecting about 200 plants per week to none and has reduced inspections of imported food at the agriculture department , a meat and poultry hot line that consumers can call for information about food safety or to report problems is closed at the cdc , about 68 percent of staff members were furloughed , including several epidemiologists and dozens of other workers who oversee a database that tracks foodborne illness these staff members identify clusters of sickness linked to potentially dangerous strains of bacteria like e coli and salmonella , and their absences have significantly reduced the center s ability to respond to an outbreak even though the agency has brought back about 30 furloughed workers to handle the salmonella outbreak , which has been linked to raw chicken , the cdc remains shorthanded , said barbara reynolds , a center spokeswoman we 're still down to a skeleton crew , she said others worry that the agency is not getting its message out when you have an outbreak and health alert like this , you have to get this information into the hands of consumers , said caroline smith dewaal , food safety director at the center for science in the public interest , a washington research group the cdc may have brought back some staffers , but their communications staff is working at reduced capacity and that s a concern the agency s ability to get information out is limited the agriculture department , which traced the salmonella outbreak to a poultry producer in california , has been spared the brunt of the sequestration cuts and the government shutdown since exposed unsanitary conditions at meatpacking plants , federal law has required inspectors at meat and poultry processing plants we 're up and running , said david goldman , assistant administrator with the agriculture department s food safety and inspection service , which inspects meat and poultry plants our inspectors , labs and field investigators are still on the job at the fda , about 45 percent of the agency s staff members are furloughed fda is doing what it can under this difficult situation to protect public health , said steven immergut , the agency s assistant commissioner for media affairs food safety advocates say that even without the government shutdown and budget cuts , the agency is limited in what it can do under normal circumstances , it inspects less than 2 percent of most imported food \( imported meat and poultry are inspected by the agriculture department \) the fda will not say what percentage of imported food is now inspected , only that it is less than 2 percent the agency continues to deploy staff members at the nation s ports to inspect some of the millions of pounds of food that come in each day from abroad , officials said about 20 percent of the food americans eat is imported , including 85 percent of seafood and a significant amount of produce but officials said the inspections consisted mainly of routine paperwork checks the agency will conduct physical inspection of food and take samples but will be limited because of staff reductions , the agency said the fda does have contracts with states to continue some inspections because those inspections were paid for with money from the previous fiscal year , officials say but nearly 9 , 000 inspections that were to be done by the states for the current fiscal year have been put on hold because of a lack of money a new food safety law , passed in 2011 , that was supposed to give the fda greater enforcement powers had already been delayed because of the acrosstheboard budget cuts known as sequestration it will now be further delayed because of the shutdown this puts a strain on an already strained system and raises serious concern about the safety of the food we eat , said tony corbo , a lobbyist for food and water watch , a food safety advocacy group in washington
this is the second part of a  ten years ago this week , on march 20 , 2003 , the united states invaded iraq the war officially ended on dec 15 , 2011 eight years , eight months , three weeks and four days later when the last american forces withdrew in the days between , hundreds of thousands of lives were altered irrevocably home fires asked 16 veterans who served in iraq to reflect on how their lives changed on the two dates bracketing the war their accounts will be published in home fires on consecutive days this week by david abrams as united states troops crossed the border between kuwait and iraq , heading north on their thunder run to baghdad , i was as far away from the battlefield as you could get i was a staff sergeant stationed in alaska on a desk job , and i felt completely disconnected from what was happening halfway around the globe that day , my unit had an earlymorning formation for our physical training , all of us dressed in sweats , balaclavas and shoes fitted with spikes to keep us from slipping on the icy roads as we ran , our breath crusting the balaclavas with frost , i thought of my fellow soldiers in iraq who were at that very moment heading into the dark unknown of combat but i didn t think of them as people , as fighting machines of flesh , blood and bone they were icons on a battle map , avatars in a video game , images from a news report the war was not real it was a movie i watched from the distance of the frozen north it wasn t until 2005 that operation iraqi freedom would turn personal that s the year i deployed to baghdad with the 3rd infantry division many of them soldiers returning for their second tour of duty these were the same troops i d depersonalized in my thoughts two years earlier in the coming months , i d see some of them walking around with dried blood on their uniforms and a hard , tight expression on their faces i was ashamed i ever thought of them as anything less than human in december 2011 , i was once again mentally divorced from the battlefield i d been out of the army for three years and by this point it was not only in my rearview mirror , it was a mere speck on the horizon and so , when i heard our exit from iraq was complete and the last man out the door had turned off the lights , i gave a virtual shrug and moved on to the next news story i don t even remember the exact moment the war ended , that s how softly it finished maybe i thought about eight years of bombs and blood , maybe i sighed , maybe i said a brief prayer for the dead or maybe i flushed with shame at the way i d once again put the war at a distance david abrams served in the united states army from 1988 to 2008 he is the author of fobbit , a comedy about the iraq war , and is a contributor to he lives in butte , mont , with his wife by roy scranton sometime in the night , i wake to the sound of gunfire angry shouts of crowds massed around weary americans rangers huddled in a dusty ghetto somebody screams there s no riot my sergeant s watching black hawk down again , the volume turned way up he says it helps keep him awake we re on night duty in the barracks , charlie battery , strassburg kaserne , germany , manning the phone 5 pm to 9 am usually nothing happens usually the hardest part is fighting off boredom i ve got homework to do , anyway , for my online course in roman history i have to write a paper about the varian disaster , in which germanic tribes slaughtered three roman legions it s quiet now in the mountains i go outside and stand in the cold , smoking a cigarette , under the grim eye of the wehrmacht eagles watching from our world war iiera barracks down in the motor pool , enormous tracked launchers stand idle we re a cold war unit , rocket artillery , built to fight the russians one of the reasons i d joined the army after 9 11 was that i wanted to see what history looked like as it happened here in germany , though , everything belongs to another era the global war on terror remains distant , abstract , obscure i startle when a figure blooms out of the dark he s a shadow in woodland camo and i m slow to recognize his face check it out , the duty runner tells me we just invaded iraq princeton university , december 2011 the war s over , they tell me on npr , just before i head out the door i m already late , might just have time for coffee , but i wheel back and check the news online i d heard right i m supposed to be on campus in 15 minutes to talk to freshmen about writing about war one class at 9 , another at 11 , spend the afternoon on research , then the english department party at 5 iraq drops away and everything wobbles i ve been out now longer than i was in , yet the war had remained constant the whole time , a kind of white noise against which my life stood in contrast even if i d moved on , or thought i had , my relation to the war defined me that s gone i had thought i would read the kids a story of war to plug them into the moment they d feel , through me , a charged connection to events a world away now i realize , walking out the door with both relief and loss , that all i have to offer is history served in the united states army from 2002 to 2006 , and was deployed to iraq in 20034 his writing has appeared in , boston review , daily beast , the massachusetts review , lit , new letters , and elsewhere he is a coeditor of and contributor to  by andrew slater on the day the invasion of iraq began , my company of paratroopers gathered at the airfield before dawn we were about to begin a nineday combat mission valiant strike to clear the remnants of the taliban from the sami ghar mountains in zabul province , afghanistan , about 50 miles south of the spot where i d get hit by an ied six years later until that week in march , we d been the only brigade in the army in actual combat , which is hard to imagine now by 2007 , there would be more than 20 brigades in action we searched villages dawn to sunset every day for a week , living out of our rucksacks we were handing out handcrank powered radios to afghan villagers and it occurred to us that we should use one ourselves to listen to the news as exhausted as we were each night , we took turns around the radio to catch the news from bbc quetta about the new war beginning to the west i remember hearing about the helicopter that crashed in kuwait on march 20 , killing 12 soldiers , and wondering how bad the invasion would be our mission seemed to go on forever and we joked about the war in iraq being over before we even got back to kandahar none of us realized then that we would be in the streets of south baghdad just 10 months later , in a very different kind of fight when the war ended , i was in graduate school , also unaware at the time that nine months later i would be returning to iraq this time as a school teacher i left the service in 2010 , after my fifth deployment , to get a master s degree i put scare quotes around the word ended , because having come back , it is clear to me that the war has only ended for the americans i live in the relatively safer kurdish region of northern iraq , teaching english composition at the american university of iraq in sulaimani things are calmer than they were , but iraq isn t safe yet baghdad is still a city of checkpoints and blast walls , even if my students tell me there s also a shopping mall now the car bombs and killings keep happening , and even if the pace has slowed , the memory of the bad years keeps the fear here alive it is peace without relief andrew slater was an army infantry and special forces officer from 2000 to 2010 he was deployed five times three to iraq and two to afghanistan he is a lecturer of english composition at the american university of iraq sulaimani his fiction has appeared in epiphany a literary journal and in the anthology  next a war , before and after , part 3
an operetta , puccini wrote to his viennese friend and agent angelo eisner on dec 14 , 1913 , is something i will never do this italian master s intense , serious and vocally strenuous operas would seem to have little in common with the formulaic , comic viennese operetta yet puccini signed a contract to write an operetta for the carltheater in vienna a few months later the eventual result , la rondine , is an outlier in the puccini canon though its popularity has grown in recent years , and it on friday in , its bittersweet plot and light music have led many to dismiss it but beneath its seeming modesty lies a daring attempt to cross the boundary between and operetta , and behind its escapist plot lurks the terror of world war i siegmund eibensch tz , the enterprising director of the commercial carltheater , reasoned that puccini , the most popular composer in opera , could write a viennese operetta that would achieve both critical and popular success but the boundaries between the genres and eventually the political ones between italy and austriahungary would defeat his hopes operetta was the most important form of popular culture in vienna in 1913 performance statistics were tracked the way box office numbers are today , and stars were subject to tabloidstyle news coverage while most audience members turned to operetta for disposable entertainment , its creators longed for respect from the cultural establishment franz lehar , operetta s leading composer since his 1905 smash , the merry widow , wrote that operetta should better itself to improve the public taste and produce works of significant art rather than profitable fluff he called for music more ambitious and dramatically integrated than operetta s traditional short songs and for plots that , if not serious , at least offered believable and sympathetic characters in 1913 puccini was struggling to find a new libretto while in vienna for the local premiere of his fanciulla del west , he enjoyed lehar s ideale gattin , and an operetta may have seemed an opportunity for something different but almost as soon as he turned his hand to one , the affair began to sour by may 1914 puccini wrote to eisner that he found alfred maria willner and heinz reichert s germanlanguage libretto for die schwalbe \( the swallow \) sentimental and tiresome it is not clear whether puccini began composing the 8 to 10 individual numbers , to be separated by spoken dialogue , that had been stipulated in his contract in july he wrote , no operetta , quite the opposite ! but the carltheater was never confronted with this challenge , because the outbreak of world war i dealt the final blow puccini was under pressure from the italian intelligentsia to prove his loyalty to the allies , which italy joined officially in may 1915 that fall he signed a new contract with an italian publisher and commissioned giuseppe adami to adapt die schwalbe into la rondine , an opera without spoken dialogue , to be sung in italian the opera finally had its premiere in monte carlo on march 27 , 1917 the libretto is a collage of borrowings from verdi s traviata comes the central figure of magda , a jaded parisian courtesan who longs for real love with the respectable country boy ruggero from johann strauss s fledermaus comes lisette , magda s flirty maid , and from puccini s own boh me comes the act ii setting of a bustling bar as well as lisette s poet lover prunier \( in operetta the second couple is also a tenor and a soprano , their music written for light voices \) magda and ruggero s courtship in act ii approaches farce in another trope from die fledermaus lisette borrows a dress from magda , magda \( independently \) dresses as a commoner , and in a busy night out they do not recognize each other in the end magda s reputation proves an insurmountable barrier for ruggero , and in act iii she flies back to her old protector , rambaldo , like the swallow of the title in the operetta industry successful plot tricks were habitually recycled into exhaustion but for puccini the libretto suffered from unoriginality , the absence of a big cathartic moment and the lack of a clear motivation for magda s act iii departure like magda to rambaldo , puccini flew back to opera but the spirit of operetta lingers over the finished work , italian though it may be viennese waltzes pervade the score , first in magda s act i praise of romantic love , a theme that fatefully returns immediately before ruggero s entrance act ii provides ample opportunity for dancing , set to further waltzes and , alarmingly for those unaware of the opera s heritage , a fox trot the act reaches its climax with ruggero s toast in a large ensemble number whose contrapuntal and harmonic complexity owes more to donizetti than to operetta at the opening of act iii the waltzes of the previous acts return , only to be swept away along with magda and ruggero s happiness the elegant belle poque world of courtesans and the social distinctions that render magda s secret so shameful were casualties of world war i la rondine emerged from the war as profoundly elegiac , its prolonged incubation rendering it instantly outdated , a memorial of a more pleasurable and sensuous world it is marked as an operetta by its music s light charm and its plot s inconsequentiality \( the score s most popular excerpt , magda s beautiful che il bel sogno di doretta , appears in the opera s first 10 minutes and has the primary function of providing a plot summary for those who may not have read the program \) some wartime operettas , written in haste , had done more to acknowledge the confusions of contemporary life , if not present solutions emmerich kalman s csardasf rstin , given its premiere in 1915 , proclaimed that in those days a nightclub singer could marry a count the timing and transformation of la rondine left it neither fish nor fowl , lacking in the dramatic stature of an opera but too alienated from its surroundings and too demanding of its singers and orchestra to be an operetta puccini , never fully satisfied with la rondine , revised it several times for the 1920 vienna premiere he scaled down the grandiose act ii toast and later continued to tinker with the sequence of events in act iii he never settled on a definitive answer the original version , presented at the met , remains the standard marta domingo s production , seen at the los angeles opera and the washington national opera and available on dvd , uses a later version and adds a suicide by drowning for magda at the end of the opera but her death seems an unearned tragedy , a ratchetingup of the opera s stakes at odds with both the music and the story it is the quicksilver froth of puccini s score , and of magda and ruggero s love , that gives la rondine its shimmering poignancy the wistful heroine displays none of the steeliness or passion to merit the end of a tosca or a madama butterfly , nor is she afflicted by mimi s or violetta s disease \( the intense soprano kristine opolais , making her met debut in these performances , promises to be a more volatile magda than angela gheorghiu was in a beautifully sung but distant portrayal in 2009 \) the strangest twist in the history of la rondine may be the fate of its libretto when die schwalbe exited the realm of operetta , the viennese librettists willner and reichert evidently saw fit to take their plot elsewhere , to puccini s operetta counterpart , franz lehar , no less lehar s 1918 operetta wo die lerche singt \( not to be confused with the 1936 marta eggerth film of the same title , which has some of the same music but a completely different plot \) , while nominally based on an obscure middlebrow play , is a remixed rondine the delicate sparrow has become a lark , the mimic among birds but what a difference the war has made magda , the courtesan glorified and condemned , has become margit , a hungarian peasant girl she leaves her rural life for the big city of budapest despite its cosmopolitan thrills , her painter lover proves unfaithful , and she returns to the countryside while magda leaves ruggero under threat from bourgeois morality , lehar s operetta instead makes a conservative argument for the wholesome virtues of simple rural folk , laced with hungarian folkloreinspired music where puccini s sympathies were with a sophisticated , compromised woman who could not break into provincial family life , lehar s are with an innocent who proves too good for the racy metropolis viennese operetta , the child of the german folk play and offenbachian travesty , has retreated to its most rustic , cozily traditional roots puccini grew to hate la rondine , calling it this pig of an opera but the experiment left us a unique postcard the opera is a sad but smiling tribute to the ephemeral , momentarily forgoing contemplation of the serious and eternal in favor of a night s light entertainment , giving listeners license to enjoy familiar themes as if they were old friends magda and ruggero s romance enchanting and transporting but consciously living on borrowed time embodies the appeal of the opera itself for the people of monte carlo it offered relief and distraction through the most horrific of times and its continued ability to delight and enchant has given it an afterlife at least for now
washington and congressional democrats on friday abandoned their oncefirm stand that growing airport bottlenecks would be addressed only in a broader fix to acrosstheboard spending cuts , accepting bipartisan legislation that would bring the nation s air traffic control system back up to full strength with remarkable speed , the house overwhelmingly approved legislation to give the secretary of transportation enough financial flexibility to shift as much as 253 million to the air traffic control system , less than a week after the onset of politically problematic flight delays driven by acrosstheboard spending cuts the money will be shifted from airport improvement funds , and none would come from additional revenues , once a key demand of mr obama and the democrats the 361to41 vote came less than 24 hours after the senate rushed the measure through republicans claimed victory consider that the democrats' opening position was they would only replace the sequester with tax increases , representative eric cantor of virginia , the house majority leader , said in a memo to members before the vote by last night , senate democrats were adopting our targeted cut this , not that' approach this victory is in large part a result of our standing together the congressional action effectively undoes one of the thorniest results of sequestration , the 85 billion in spending cuts that took effect march 1 and have rippled across the federal government with the president s promised signature , democrats will lose significant leverage they had hoped would force republicans into a larger agreement since the flight delays were seen as the sort of inconvenience that could force a reversal of the cuts the action also brought charges that lawmakers known for gridlock could move only when affluent travelers like themselves felt the sting of congress s indecision and that the struggles of lowerincome americans affected by the spending cuts were being ignored house members who have cleared precious little legislation this year made swift work of the air travel bill minutes before flying out themselves for a weeklong break , a pile of cars stacked up behind the capitol waiting to ferry them to washington s airports we 're leaving the homeless behind , said representative peter welch , democrat of vermont we 're leaving a lot of national guard folks behind we 're leaving seniors who depend on meals on wheels in the dust children who rely on head start can teach themselves to read that s basically what s happening the shifting of 253 million from the airport improvement program to air traffic operations in the should be enough to stop further furloughs and keep the air traffic control system operating at a normal pace through sept 30 , the end of the current fiscal year this is a bandaid solution , said jay carney , the white house press secretary , even as he said mr obama would sign it it does not solve the bigger problem republicans and some democrats had been pushing for much of the month for a rescue of the air traffic control system but lawmakers who wanted a separate budget rescue for the faa met resistance from some lawmakers who questioned why air travel was being rescued when children were being thrown out of early education programs , inspections were being curtailed and checks to the longterm unemployed were shrinking with those cuts largely invisible to most americans , some democrats argued that mounting delays at airports might be the only pressure point left to force republicans to negotiate a broader deal to reverse the cuts , with a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases that position held sway with democrats into thursday evening , when senator mark udall , democrat of colorado , and senator susan collins , republican of maine , cornered senator harry reid of nevada , the majority leader we made the pitch that this was n't about elite americans this is about all americans , mr udall said , singling out hotel and restaurant workers , airport workers and others who would be affected by a sharp decline in air travel opponents also feared that a rifleshot rescue of the air trafficcontrol system would open the floodgates for other supplicants seeking relief from the cuts that fear was realized almost the moment the bill cleared congress cancer clinics , head start administrators , housing advocates and teachers all demanded that their programs be addressed next we 've seen how devastating the cuts to our core government programs are already , from cuts in head start , reductions in housing assistance , cuts to unemployment benefits and fewer job training programs all when our nation still has a 77 percent unemployment rate , said rachel gragg , federal policy director for the national skills coalition , a job training advocacy group and yet , congress is scrambling to fix one small if highly visible piece of sequestration , rather than solve the whole problem but visible it was on united airlines flight 1543 from san francisco to washington on friday , the pilot announced after a 90minute delay that congress was at fault for their ineptitude , having financed worthless projects but not the faa a consulting company called masflight said friday that since furloughs began on sunday , the percentage of flights from major american airports that waited more than an hour to take off rose to 14 percent from 07 percent , and the percentage that waited from 31 to 60 minutes increased to 95 percent from 72 percent , compared with the previous month republicans continued to assert that those delays were intentionally inflicted on the traveling public by a white house eager to press its political point we 're here today because this administration has decided to put politics over passengers , said representative rodney davis , a freshman republican from illinois , who said the administration already had the flexibility to save the air traffic controllers but even republican aides said that was not true under sequestration rules , all program categories faced cuts , and backfilling the narrow category air traffic operations at the transportation department took congressional action with democrats now in retreat , further programspecific actions could be possible when congress passed legislation financing the government through sept 30 , it granted some select agencies the flexibility to make such changes before the budget cuts hit , justice department officials warned of nearly 60 , 000 furloughs and rising vacancies at the federal bureau of investigations and other federal law enforcement agencies congress granted attorney general eric h holder jr more latitude , and with the fbi grappling with the bombings , mr holder asked and received permission to shift hundreds of millions of dollars in the justice department budget to spare the agencies of any furloughs a similar request is expected from the defense department in the coming days
the 2012 offseason was tumultuous for the orlando magic from late may to early august they fired stan van gundy , the best coach in franchise history traded dwight howard , the best player in franchise history and lost the free agent ryan anderson , the league s most improved player last season the loss of van gundy has had a noticeable effect on the team s offensive strategy he tried to maximize his team s 3point attempts while minimizing his team s long 2point attempts \( 2point attempts from 15 feet or farther \) the reason for this was simple on average , a 3point attempt is worth 106 points , while a long 2point attempt is worth 8tenths of a point van gundy wanted his teams to look for more efficient 3point shots rather than settle for inefficient 2point shots this strategy is evident in the team s statistics in each of van gundy s five seasons , the team led the nba in percentage of 3point shots taken , hoisting one in about every three field goal attempts as expected , the team disdained the long 2point shot , finishing last or nexttolast in the league in the percentage of long 2point attempts taken in all five of van gundy s seasons under the guidance of the new head coach , jacque vaughn , orlando has dropped to 20th in the percentage of 3point shots taken and risen to 7th in the percentage of long 2point shots taken orlando s emphasis on taking efficient shots in the van gundy era paid off the magic finished in the top six in effective field goal percentage an adjusted field goal percentage that takes into account the extra point provided by a 3point shot in each season of van gundy s tenure but this season the magic have fallen to 12th , although that is hardly unexpected given the loss of howard and anderson , the team s two most efficient shooters last season what is surprising , though , is that a return to the van gundy way would most likely lead to a more efficient shooting team than last season s squad this season orlando is shooting 395 on long 2point shots and 346 on 3point shots suppose the magic were able to retain those percentages if 250 of their long 2point attempts were shifted to 3point attempts \( a reasonable assumption based on the data \) with this change the team s effective field goal percentage would increase from 495 to 505 , just 0001 below last year s mark that improvement would lead to an increase of 168 points a game although that may not seem like much , the extra points would be expected to translate to a 1621 wonlost record , good enough to move the magic to 9th place from 12th in the eastern conference of course , none of this addresses the magic s defense , which has regressed predictably after the departure of howard , a threetime defensive player of the year but those problems may be more a function of personnel rather than philosophy , and thus are likely to take more time to solve for now , a minor change in orlando s offensive approach may yield immediate dividends
amherst , mass while many existing oil and gas reserves in other parts of the world are facing steep decline , the arctic is thought to possess vast untapped reservoirs approximately 13 percent of the world s undiscovered oil deposits and 30 percent of its natural gas reserves are above the arctic circle , according to the united states geological survey eager to tap into this largess , russia and its arctic neighbors canada , norway , the united states , iceland and denmark \( by virtue of its authority over greenland \) have encouraged energy companies to drill in the region for russia , which recently seized a greenpeace ship and is prosecuting 30 of the group s activists for attempting to scale an oil platform , the temptation to exploit the arctic ocean is especially powerful russia s economy is heavily dependent on exports of oil and gas , and the government relies on these sales for much of its income until recently , the russians could draw on reservoirs in western siberia to satisfy their needs , but now , with many of these fields in decline , they are counting on arctic supplies to maintain current production levels our first and main task is to turn the arctic into russia s resource base of the 21st century , dmitri a medvedev , then the president , declared in 2008 the russians have explored drilling options in several offshore areas of the arctic in the pechora sea , above northwestern siberia , the russian energy giant gazprom has installed its prirazlomnaya platform the one protesting greenpeace activists attempted to board further east , in the kara sea , the stateowned rosneft is collaborating with exxonmobil to develop promising deposits rosneft has also teamed up with statoil of norway and eni of italy to investigate prospects in the barents sea but russia is hardly alone in seeking to exploit the arctic norway , like russia , derives considerable income from gas and oil exports and is under pressure to develop reserves in the barents sea to compensate for the decline of its existing fields in the north and norwegian seas other areas of the arctic are also being eyed for development cairn energy of edinburgh has sunk exploratory wells in waters off greenland , for example , while royal dutch shell is attempting to develop fields off alaska for all of its promise , however , the arctic is not likely to surrender its resources easily sea ice covers much of the area in winter , and storms pose a constant danger global warming is likely to reduce the extent of sea ice in the summer and fall , permitting extended drilling operations , but it could also produce unruly weather and other perils adding another layer of risk , many of the boundary lines in the arctic remain to be fully demarcated , and various arctic powers have threatened to use military force in the event that one or another intrudes on what they view as their sovereign territory the severe challenges of operating in the arctic have already proved daunting for shell , which has spent 45 billion to exploit reserves off alaska but has yet to drill a single producing well some of these challenges are legal indigenous communities and environmentalists , fearing the contamination of local waters and a threat to wildlife , have filed lawsuits to prevent the company from drilling in addition , the arctic itself has proved to be a formidable adversary in the summer of 2012 , during royal dutch shell s first attempt to probe its arctic deposits , shifting winds and floating ice halted drilling several months later , when one of its drilling rigs ran aground during an especially severe storm , shell announced that it would suspend operations in alaska s arctic waters and that before it proceeded , it would bolster its capacity to operate there shell s misfortunes have heightened concern that arctic drilling poses an unacceptable threat to the region any major spill that occurs there is likely to prove far more destructive than the one produced in the gulf of mexico by the deepwater horizon disaster in april 2010 , because of both the lack of adequate response capabilities and the likelihood that ice floes and sea ice will impede cleanup operations as more companies push into the arctic and accelerate their operations there , the risk of accidents and spills is bound to increase the fact that shell one of the most technically advanced oil companies has so far proved unable to overcome these risks should provoke intense concern over the prospect that other , less proficient firms will soon be operating in these perilous waters
insomnia is never far from my thoughts , especially when i am writing a poor sleeper even as a girl , i spent many nights scribbling diary entries in a notebook on the bathroom floor after our household had gone to bed as a mother with a fulltime job , i often sought the desk in the wee hours by necessity those liminal hours between dark and dawn continue to haunt my praxis even now that my nest is empty for me , there is nothing as attuned as nocturnal writing we who suffer from sleeplessness also have an arsenal of advice to offer one another after i once confessed in an article to being a mouthbreather and ferocious snorer , concerned readers urged me to seek medical attention , certain that some sort of breathing issue was causing my inability to get a good night s rest according to a small study in the journal sleep , they may be right many who believe that their insomnia is caused by hyperarousal anxiety or racing thoughts are likely to be suffering from breathing problems could it be that simple \? more important , even if i could , would i want to cure my insomnia \? isn t my sleeplessness closely tied in with my sense of myself as a poet of wanting to see , to be always awake and aware of the ultimate big sleep of which each night s little sleep is trope and harbinger \? for centuries , poets from a wide range of cultures have written about their wakeful , nocturnal anguish and ecstatic vision in the eighth century , the chinese poet tu fu , in a translation by sam hamill , pined , sleepless , memories of war betray me i am powerless against the world does the study linking insomnia to troubled breathing change the way we think about and read insomniacal art \? a dark night of the soul , heartache , remorse , guilt , desire , godhunger surely this , and not obstructed airways or a drop in oxygen levels , is the stuff of poetry would it alter how we experience gerard manley hopkins s dark sonnets \( what hours , o what black hours we have spent this night ! \) , if we knew he may have sawed zzzzs \? i think not true , it s harder to romanticize insomnia if we know it might be a matter of aberrant breathing treatable by nose strips , ungainly headgear or a trip to the sleep clinic but poetry has always been about breathing the word inspire , in fact , derives from the latin in \( in \) spirare \( to breathe \) as robert frost wrote , poetry is a way of taking life by the throat it is not new to speculate about how ailments of all sorts may have affected works of art it is now believed , for example , that the frisson of haloed light in the embroideries of hildegard of bingen might have been inspired by migraine aura how much , say , did john berryman s alcoholism or wallace stevens s own martini logic contribute to the cadmium shine and the lunar paraphrase of their compositions \? none of this musing , however , diminishes the work of medicine to help all of us to live healthier lives whether caused by poetic hyperarousal or disordered breathing , there is nothing , finally , inspiring about a protracted spell of insomnia although i m not yet ready to call a specialist , i am as grateful for the ameliorating advances of sleep scientists as i am for the revelations of a host of poets who manage to make art , if not meaning , out of sleeplessness this is an excerpt from draft , a series on writing , at nytimescom opinionator
when it comes to the and home openers , robert ostertag has seen just about everything , from the first game ever played at shea stadium in 1964 to tom seaver s return in 1983 to gary carter s gamewinning home run in 1985 considering these are the mets we are talking about , he has also endured his share of drubbings , meltdowns and cold , windy weather that has made queens feel like the arctic on monday , ostertag will be back at to take in what he says will be his 50th consecutive home opener , a golden anniversary that has required a peculiar kind of devotion and determination and perhaps a dose of willful blindness tickets for the opener can be hard to come by crowds can be rowdy and the weather mean and foreboding then there are the mets themselves , who have started any number of seasons without any particular expectations and who , ostertag said , are not headed anywhere special this season , either still , he continues to make the trek year after year from his home in poughkeepsie , ny , taking along about 20 friends for one of the sport s timehonored traditions , a day that for ostertag may be less about poetic renewal and more about friendship , routine and perseverance we did it in '65 , '66 , and kept on going , and lo and behold , i made it to 30 , and i started to wonder if i could get to the number 50 , said ostertag , who is 81 and still works as a lawyer i will probably keep it up as long as i can ostertag has not kept many ticket stubs from his run , so he has no independent proof of his feat but he does have friends and family members who will vouch for him , as well as old scorecards from the 1960s that have names like hunt , hickman , kranepool and grote penciled in the mets will acknowledge ostertag s feat by posting his name on the scoreboard in the middle of the fourth inning monday ostertag grew up in hollis , queens , and rooted for the although he went to yankee stadium and saw yankees stars like joe dimaggio , ostertag found the dodgers and their boisterous , bereft fans more endearing and compelling ebbets field was a whole different thing , he said it took a lot of character to be a dodger fan and none to be a yankees fan when the dodgers deserted brooklyn after the 1957 season , ostertag was stationed in maine in the air force the mets arrived in new york five years later , after he had moved his family to poughkeepsie , and he quickly , and happily , concluded that they had all the craziness of the old dodgers even though the mets lost 120 games in their first season , a modernera record , ostertag was hooked in their 51 seasons as a franchise , the mets have won just 478 percent of their regularseason games perhaps ostertag has been their lucky charm the mets have won 31 of their 51 home openers , a robust 608 winning percentage as a result , he has often left the stadium with the mets undefeated and the possibilities seemingly limitless and then reality quickly sets in the mets actually got off to a slow start with their home openers , losing their first six , including the two at the polo grounds , which ostertag did not attend ostertag s streak began in 1964 , when willie stargell hit a home run to help the pirates beat the mets , 43 the mets finally won a home opener in 1968 , when jerry koosman shut out the san francisco giants , 30 , striking out 10 a year later , the mets stunned the baseball world by winning the world series , but they began the season farcically , losing to the firstyear montreal expos , 1110 , at shea second baseman ken boswell committed three errors i remember thinking , it took us seven or eight years to win an opener , and they win one in their first try , ostertag said with a sigh back then , ostertag and his friends drove in a caravan of cars to shea stadium as the ringleader , he bought the tickets , which was easier in those early years between 1971 and 1981 , the mets never drew more than 40 , 000 fans for opening day the low point was in 1979 , when just 10 , 406 tickets were sold the weather has often been cold and windy more than two decades ago , ostertag invited a group of lawyers bar association colleagues to opening day before the game , they met at the marriott hotel near la guardia airport , and then they found their seats they were in the far leftfield corner , and the weather was worse than the seats the wind was fierce and the cold bonechilling , ostertag said we lost the game , of course , and my bar group wanted to know why i would have subjected my friends to such a bitter experience the group never returned , he said clearly , those lawyers did not have the necessities of rooting for the mets parkas , pluck , peptobismol ostertag s streak has been in jeopardy several times , most notably in 1970 , when he broke his leg skiing he made it to the opener anyway and sat in an aisle seat to stretch out he got there , maybe in pain , but he got there , said tom ostertag , a lawyer for major league baseball who has attended about 20 opening days with his father in recent years , the hassles have grown tickets have become harder to find age has caught up with some of robert ostertag s friends and because of the traffic , ostertag now rents a bus so the group can tailgate with impunity as for this season , ostertag finds himself a glasshalfempty guy the mets lack decent pitchers , outfielders and hitters , he said , and management still appears reluctant to spend big money to sign better players ostertag expects the mets to lose more than 100 games a gloomy projection even by mets standards i'm a born pessimist , and i 've never been disappointed , he said in support of his assessment of the mets i could have been a yankees fan , but it would n't have been as much fun so there you have it the ostertag season preview plenty of mets losses , but always enough reasons to keep watching
foxborough , mass the most crucial member of the on sunday did not play the final 50 minutes he hobbled off the field , then into the locker room , then grabbed a jacket and parked himself on the new england bench , from where he watched his departure loom large over the afc championship game that player , aqib talib , is the patriots' best cover cornerback , and he hurt his thigh on baltimore s second offensive series the odds of their missing him were probable his return was announced as questionable as quarterback joe flacco and his big receivers dismantled the diluted secondary , new england s chances of a comeback were rendered doubtful then the patriots were out out of the playoffs , out of contention , after losing , 2813 , at gillette stadium the ravens , ousted here last season on a missed field goal that would have forced overtime , scored the final 21 points to advance to super bowl xlvii against the san francisco 49ers on feb 3 in new orleans at gillette stadium , where according to the elias sports bureau patriots quarterback tom brady lost for the first time in 68 games in which he had led at halftime , fans started leaving midway through the fourth quarter they bolted because of two splendid catches by anquan boldin , who capitalized on talib s absence , that expanded baltimore s lead to 15 points from 1 point in a 3minute43second stretch i do n't think anything was as good as it needed to be tonight , patriots coach bill belichick said he was in a dour mood afterward , even more than usual an eighth consecutive season without hoisting the lombardi trophy can do that to a man so can watching talib , whose arrival in a november trade with tampa bay stabilized the patriots' secondary , stagger to the sideline , after breaking up a pass intended for boldin receivers like the 6foot1 , 220pound boldin big , strong and aggressive can present problems for inexperienced cornerbacks , and talib , listed at 62 and 202 pounds , had the size and instincts to match up with him boldin , who had 5 catches for 60 yards , did not pester the patriots immediately none of the ravens' receivers did of flacco s six firsthalf completions , only one was by a receiver after halftime , flacco shredded the new england secondary , whose members insisted afterward that they made the necessary adjustments , that they were surprised by nothing except perhaps the result the ravens regrouped , making essential modifications they put flacco in the shotgun they operated a hurryup offense they threw more in earlydown situations they deployed three receivers , spreading the defense safety steve gregory , in man coverage when dennis pitta fooled him on a 5yard touchdown that put baltimore ahead to stay , 1413 , said flacco showed more patience in the second half it s not like we do n't see it almost every day , patriots cornerback kyle arrington said , referring to practicing against a nohuddle offense but , he lamented , we just could n't get off the field the game turned early in the fourth quarter , with the ravens leading , 2113 , when bernard pollard drilled patriots running back stevan ridley in the helmet for the fourth time in five seasons , pollard injured a patriots player brady s knee in 2008 wes welker s knee in 2009 rob gronkowski s ankle in last year s afc championship game ridley appeared to lose consciousness , and the ball popped free , recovered by arthur jones at the new england 47 four plays later , flacco recognized an advantage while reading the defense boldin in single coverage against marquice cole , a backup elevated by talib s injury earlier , on thirdand9 , boldin outdueled cole down the sideline for a 26yard gain flacco fired a perfect backshoulder pass to boldin , who leapt and caught it for an 11yard touchdown while cole was facing him the thing that anquan s taught all of us is to get after footballs , the baltimore receivers coach jim hostler said recently meeting the ball with your hands what it means to come back and get a ball and make spectacular plays as boldin did on his first touchdown , when he soared over devin mccourty perhaps mccourty benefited most from talib s arrival , remaining at safety , where his range was maximized but not sunday you do n't see your season coming to an end , mccourty said you ca n't prepare for this

paris in an age of ballistic serves and blinding strokes , not much remains of the artistry of slice and angle in international tennis but a parisian artist , his brush strokes creating a swirl of movement and color , has returned for a 10th visit to revive the art of watercolors and stack it against the flash of modern digital images on sunny and on overcast days , joel blanc , 64 , a whitehaired artist who bills himself as a painter of the moment , sits at his easel in box b17 a neck strap holds his canvas in place last monday , as rafael nadal at daniel brands across the net , blanc glanced up and down , partly hidden by the courtside geraniums , daubing pale blues and oranges and greens on a large rectangular canvas the figures began to appear nadal , righthanded through a bit of artistic license , wore red shorts and a gray headband brands , stroking a forehand , wore dark blue shorts and blue shirt soon , spectators in neighboring boxes became part of the spectacle two tennis players locked in combat before a crowd filling a great stadium none of it sharpedged , all of it a whimsical flash of movement and color on friday , blanc captured marion bartoli in flowing black lines that matched her black outfit as she defeated mariana duquemarino first commissioned to paint by french television in 2004 , blanc began creating his own world of images at roland garros dashing players , imperious chair umpires , streaking ball boys and ball girls , and cautious line judges it s a wonderful mix , said claude esclatine , the deputy sports director for french television , who decided that year to add a twist to tennis coverage blanc said , i am fascinated by movement and energy over the years he has painted a swarm of action images , including racehorses , polo ponies , figure skaters , tour de france cyclists and marathon runners every sport where people are running , he said every sport which is difficult to draw and it s my deal , you know , my challenge another of blanc s challenges , as a freelance painter , is to finance his life although he worked for french television for two years , he returns to the french open now as the guest of olivier morvan , a real estate developer morvan s father first sat in box b17 before world war ii , blanc said i like painting in general , morvan said , and i think he does a really nice job the two men met and became friends when blanc accepted an invitation to paint morvan s children sitting in the box every year i order a painting from him , morvan said , and he makes a greeting card for me a book of blanc s tennis figures , published in 2004 , contains a time capsule of international tennis from nearly a decade ago andy roddick turned up stiff in green \( his shirt \) and white \( his cap \) guillermo coria morphed into a stationary figure in black shorts and white cap , arms extended in a balletstyle forehand a younger serena williams became a whirling flash of fuchsia and red blanc seemed mildly resentful that his talent for capturing tennis in the moment had not led to an official invitation to paint roland garros each year for the french tennis federation i do n't know why , he said , shrugging and exhaling through tightened lips they do n't , ah , i do n't know why his appreciation of morvan s support is evident , as is his feeling of being left out in france , he said , i am the only one to do that , referring to his art of the instant he added , in france , it s difficult to get access to the upper people
to stop clinics from receiving public financing , texas' republican leaders gambled that the state could operate a contraception and cancerscreening program for lowincome women without tens of millions of federal dollars but with the exclusion of about 40 planned parenthood clinics none of which performed abortions from the texas women s health program in 2013 , records showed that claims for birth control and wellness exams dropped , as did enrollment numbers state health officials reintroduced the medicaid women s health program as the texas women s health program in january after the federal government discontinued its 9to 1 match for the program a decision the obama administration made when state lawmakers began enforcing rules they said made clinics even loosely affiliated with abortion providers ineligible to receive taxpayer dollars \( by law , none of the providers in the program performed abortions \) the new statefinanced program got off to a rocky start in some parts of texas , the state s health agency struggled to find providers to replace planned parenthood clinics , which provided 40 percent of women s health program services in 2012 there can still be some pockets where we do n't have a provider and we did before , said dr kyle janek , the texas health commissioner planned parenthood may have been the only game in that area during the first six months of this year , there were 38 percent fewer reimbursement claims for birth control than there were during the first six months of 2012 , according to a texas tribune analysis of data provided by the texas health and human services commission the number of wellness exams , meanwhile , decreased by 23 percent program enrollment figures have also declined to 110 , 900 in may from 127 , 000 in january 2012 figures from may were the most recent available cecile richards , the president of the planned parenthood federation of america , called the figures troubling despite all the promises from state officials that women s health care needs would be met , she said , it s clear they are n't but dr janek argued that the claims numbers were misleading he said birth control distributed by the program has not declined as much as initial claims data suggested , because the majority of providers that replaced planned parenthood clinics were physician groups that directed patients to pharmacies to fill prescriptions , rather than distributing the drugs themselves , as family planning clinics do the program s pharmacy data for 2013 is not complete , and the state could not provide information on how many birth control prescriptions were filled we think when you add all those up for birth control , both those delivered at the pharmacy and those given by the provider s office , we 've got an increase , not a decrease , dr janek said the women s health program claims for longacting , reversible birth control methods like intrauterine devices and hormonal implants , which must be inserted by the provider , declined by 17 percent in the same time period dr janek said that was the result of the state not paying providers enough to cover the procedure , something health officials have rectified by raising reimbursement rates for copper iuds by 200 and hormonal implants by 75 we 've changed that , so i expect the second six months and thereafter will tell a different story , he said dr janek said that while he was happy with the staterun program s progress , he would not be satisfied until we do better the state is conducting targeted outreach to encourage more women to enroll health officials said that when they sent mailers in october and november to women whose families were registered for other state programs , enrollment promptly increased by more than 9 , 000 women while republican state leaders work to improve capacity in the staterun program , many family planning clinics have struggled seventysix family planning clinics closed after the 2011 legislative session , when republican lawmakers with planned parenthood in their cross hairs cut twothirds of the state s family planning budget , set up a tiered system to shift remaining dollars away from reproductive health clinics , and ousted planned parenthood and other clinics from the women s health program haven health clinic in amarillo , for example , the only family planning clinic that serves the 26 counties in the texas panhandle , saw a 20 percent decrease in women s health program patients from 2012 to 2013 we 're struggling now , but we 'd be out of business if the program closed completely , which would be devastating for this part of the state , said carolina cogdill , haven s chief executive republican lawmakers attempted to mitigate the damage they had done to texas' family planning infrastructure in the 2013 legislative session by passing the largest financial package for women s health in state history texas' 201415 budget includes 71 million to operate the texas women s health program , 100 million to expand a primary care program to serve an additional 170 , 000 women , and 43 million to replace family planning grants the federal government used to award to the state health agency but has now given to another organization but women s health advocates remain concerned that the damage wrought in 2011 cannot easily be undone the texas women s health program has great potential , but it has not taken off in private practice yet , said dr janet realini , the chairwoman of the texas women s healthcare coalition , which represents 39 medical trade associations and advocacy groups the providers who were doing most of that work have been either excluded or damaged by the cuts parkland health and hospital system in the dallas area received 212 calls in january from former planned parenthood patients looking for a new women s health program provider , said paula turicchi , parkland s senior vice president for women and infants specialty health in 2013 , parkland clinics have served 9 , 180 patients in the program , compared with 8 , 655 in 2012 we definitely saw a greater impact around those locations where planned parenthood had been a provider , ms turicchi said in response to the 2011 budget cuts , parkland instituted a 25 copayment for lowincome family planning patients ms turicchi said that 42 of 420 patients who canceled appointments in february 2012 because they could not afford the copayment later returned pregnant parkland recently received 48 million through the state s expanded primary health care program to increase services for poor women in 2014
a record 39 players will make their allstar game debuts at citi field on tuesday , a roster full of fresh and vibrant faces , and none seemed to epitomize the anticipation better than grant balfour , a 35yearold reliever from australia balfour wore his sleeves rolled up and his chin stubbled , holding a cricket ball in his right hand i played some backyard cricket , balfour said the cricket ball was handed to him by a television reporter from major league baseball s affiliate in britain , who used the entry point to inquire about balfour s winding career path , from his father s rugby background to the fringe youth baseball tournaments he attended just to get noticed more than a quartercentury ago it was 16 arduous professional years before balfour found his way here , preparing to be sitting in the same american league bullpen as mariano rivera , after finishing the first half with 25 saves in 25 chances for the al westleading  it s crazy to think i'm sitting here today coming from that , balfour said it was a sentiment that was shared frequently in the jackie robinson rotunda at citi field on monday s workout day the mainstays like miguel cabrera , justin verlander , david ortiz and rivera were dwarfed in number by rookies and newcomers i think the game s definitely getting younger , said first baseman allen craig , one of three firsttime allstars from the st louis cardinals there are so many new faces here , it s pretty cool that a lot of guys are getting to experience their first allstar game and do this whole thing it s pretty cool craig , 28 , and infielder matt carpenter , 27 , each rose relatively slowly through the cardinals' system , brewing as players while struggling to find positions with openings in the big leagues their versatility helped carpenter has started at four positions this season , craig three and so did patience it hardly seemed to bother craig that sitting across from him was the milwaukee brewers' 23yearold rookie , jean segura , who last year was playing in the futures game bryce harper \( 20 \) , mike trout \( 21 \) , manny machado \( 21 \) , patrick corbin \( 23 \) and matt harvey \( 24 \) have zipped into baseball stardom at astounding rates you look at their talent , the talent fits for where they are , craig said those guys are pretty amazing national league manager bruce bochy agreed , saying that the game s infusion of young talent has been , in his opinion , changing the game i think they are just getting better , faster , stronger still , and it s impressive to watch these guys , bochy said i 've seen more pitchers throwing in the mid90s than i 've ever seen i think we are getting some great talent coming up from all over the world bochy was probably not speaking specifically about balfour , who has flown under the radar for much of his career , mainly filling middlebullpen innings for the tampa bay rays always a hard thrower with a fierce competitive streak , balfour said it took time for him to find consistency and confidence essentially , he said , i feel like i 've always been a little bit of a late bloomer balfour was initially left off the roster by al manager jim leyland , and he acknowledged it was disappointing still , he brought an additional bag with him to the ballpark sunday , and when his a s teammate bartolo colon started sunday s game , balfour became his replacement on the allstar roster for years , balfour began every season by scribbling personal goals on a notepad , things like win a world series and earn a trip to the allstar game this year i was able to cross it off , balfour said it s very gratifying agent scott boras was in attendance at workouts monday and held his own impromptu news conference while some of his clients spoke to reporters in the rotunda inevitably , boras was asked about robinson cano , the yankees' allstar second baseman who left boras to sign with jayz and his new sports agency , roc nation sports , which is partnered with the creative artists agency in his new album , magna carta holy grail , jayz taunted boras by name , saying scott boras , you over baby robinson cano , you coming with me on monday , when asked about the difficulty of losing cano as a client , boras spun off with what seemed to be a subtle jab at jayz every player has personal decisions to make , boras said i can only tell you about what i do i do baseball 24 7 i do n't do other sports i do n't do anything else all we do is study the game boras added i 've had opportunities to do a lot of different things i do n't do it i just stay inside the game , stay close to your players and close to the analysis of the system mets manager confirmed a report that infielder jordany valdespin threw a tantrum in the clubhouse after finding out the mets optioned him to class aaa las vegas the easiest way to put it is i went out in the clubhouse to calm him down , collins told reporters it was not accepted very well by the other 24 guys , i can tell you that , too the starledger was the first to report valdespin s apparent tirade after saturday s game against pittsburgh valdespin reportedly stormed out of collins s office and loudly expressed his dissatisfaction with the demotion in front of teammates in the clubhouse valdespin was in a 2for36 slump , dropping his average to 188 collins also said he had to discipline valdespin multiple times in the mets' minor league system the baltimore orioles slugger chris davis has 37 home runs , tying reggie jackson in 1969 for the secondmost at the allstar break the only player to hit more barry bonds with 39 in 2001 that season , bonds hit a record 73 home runs , breaking mark mcgwire s record of 70 from 1998 but mcgwire admitted to having used steroids during his recordbreaking season , and bonds s record has been tainted by accusations that he used steroids in his pursuit of the home run crown in my opinion , i assume 61 is the record , davis said , referring to the number hit by the yankees' roger maris in 1961 i think most fans would agree with me on that the maris record has been eclipsed six times bonds did it once , mcgwire twice and sammy sosa three times seven allstars trace their minor league roots to the same team the new britain \( conn \) rock cats , the class aa affiliate of the minnesota twins david ortiz , torii hunter , grant balfour , jesse crain , glen perkins , michael cuddyer and joe mauer all spent time there that s where it all started for me , hunter said that s where it all started for a lot of us orioles' outfielder adam jones brought a vintage wwe championship belt with him to the allstar game he said he planned to bestow it on the winner of monday night s home run derby baseball is promoting its youthful stars in this year s allstar game , which may help explain why hiroki kuroda , the 38yearold yankees starting pitcher was not named to the al team , despite having the secondlowest earned run average in the league at 265 but kuroda , who has had woeful run support and was the victim of mariano rivera s only two blown saves this season , merely has an 86 record al manager jim leyland said he considered adding kuroda when justin verlander was unavailable to pitch , but decided to take baltimore s 25yearold chris tillman , who is 113 with a 395 era i would almost be embarrassed not to take a guy that s 113 to the allstar game , leyland said
readers discuss the value of art museums as detroit weighs how to solve its financial crisis the choice being debated in detroit whether to sell works from the detroit institute of arts to help pay the city s debts is agonizing how can we equate a few pieces of canvas with paint on them with the pensions of thousands of firefighters , nurses , police officers , teachers and other civil servants \? the same choice is being played out in many other communities across the country in a sense , we have always had this dilemma , but this time , there are several special factors one is that cities and towns are going bankrupt , and they ca n't continue to provide basic services , let alone support for art museums another factor is the stunning rise in prices for works of art thousands of works go for over a million dollars every year eight and even ninefigure prices are common mixed into this is the fact that museums have become dependent on support from federal , state and local government in the form of tax subsidies , tax exemptions , especially from real estate tax , and , most important , tax deductions at the same time , private donors are being asked to give more and more how long will the 1 percent agree to subsidize a service for the 99 percent \? there are more than 100 , 000 nonprofit arts organizations in this country , all with their hands out how can museums justify this kind of support \? we claim to be moral institutions , open to all , providing the best to the most , and we all work hard to do just that but is that really our audience \? do n't we , for the most part , serve the affluent , the educated , the converted , those who are on our side of the income and education gap \? museums make a determined effort to widen their audience the detroit institute of arts is a leader in that effort but we are still falling short the shortfall is where that agonizing question arises how many lives is a rembrandt worth \? frank robinson ithaca , ny , aug 5 , 2013 how many lives is a rembrandt worth \? if we follow this line of thought and take a running start down its slippery slope in history , we would quickly arrive in the 2009 boardroom at brandeis university , where choices seemed nonexistent and the art collection necessarily fungible thousands of employees would lose their jobs if the university closed under the weight of its sudden financial losses unsurprisingly , other options besides selling art emerged taken to global dimensions , why do n't we insist that greece sell its art and architecture to pay its bills and feed its people \? how many lives is the acropolis worth \? detroit s financial condition is n't the result of sudden factors like other municipalities , the city has been living off disastrous shortterm thinking and an absence of longterm investment however , more shortterm thinking will only perpetuate disaster sell detroit s gems , and they are gone forever let s commission economists to determine the longterm value of keeping the collection in detroit compared with the onetime limited dollar value of its sale perhaps a recent property tax that provides 23 million annually for the dia should be reduced commensurate with other cutbacks imposed across the city certainly , the dia should make some sacrifices along with the rest of the city dying around it natalie marsh director gund gallery at kenyon college gambier , ohio , aug 7 , 2013 how many lives has a rembrandt saved \? growing up in detroit in the 1950s , the daughter of a factory worker , i did n't have books , paintings and music around the home in high school my art teacher , irving berg , signed me up for a sculpture class at the detroit institute of arts i had never been there when the bus stopped in front of the museum , i got out \( heart racing \) , walked toward a huge statue \( rodin s the thinker \) , ascended the wide marble stairs , opened the doors and walked in i was changed a transformative moment like this cannot be unique to me as a kid from the east side of detroit , i was able to wander the galleries of my art museum what a gift today i am an artist marie tapert whitmore lake , mich , aug 7 , 2013 if the proceeds from selling a rembrandt really did feed hungry children , i 'd be in favor but the money would go to paying off those who purchased bonds , lent money or extended credit to detroit , whose financial fortunes have been sliding downward for decades there are no guaranteed investments let those who gambled incur the losses and let this be a cautionary tale not forgotten sheila sorvari austin , tex , aug 7 , 2013 mr robinson s letter raises some very important questions , but also poses false choices although the bankruptcy proceedings may require a valuation of all of detroit s assets , we believe that those responsible for restoring the city s fiscal health will conclude that the sale of the dia s collection if , indeed , such a step is legally permissible would be both terribly shortsighted and wrong from an economic point of view however much the collection may be worth on the market today , this figure is inconsequential in comparison to its longterm value to the city and region as a cultural asset just last year voters validated this point of view by supporting a levy to provide an additional 23 million in annual operating funds for the dia far from seeing it as an institution supported by the affluent for the benefit of the privileged few , the citizens of wayne , oakland and macomb counties affirmed their belief in the importance of this great museum to their communities now and in the future it is our fervent hope that detroit will emerge from this economic crisis with renewed confidence and all of the resources , including cultural institutions , to prosper once again timothy rub christine anagnos philadelphia , aug 8 , 2013 mr robinson asks , how many lives is a rembrandt worth \? i suggest that the humane answer is none those who consider art essential to civilization should realize that it is even more essential for a civilized society not to abandon its most vulnerable members , let alone break its promise of pensions to those who have invested their working lives in public service would you sacrifice your life , or your child s life , for a rembrandt \? if not , why expect your fellow citizens to sacrifice theirs \? felicia nimue ackerman providence , ri , aug 8 , 2013 if detroit wishes to raise some revenue from its museum s art collection , there may be options less drastic than selling works of art objects could be leased for defined periods of time to other museums , or to private collectors for the duration of their lives , so the museum would be assured of their eventual return the reassembly of the collection could be staged as a celebration by the museum in the future , once detroit gets past its current troubles works could also be sent on tour to other museums this was famously \( and infamously \) done to raise revenue for the barnes foundation such a tour would expose people in diverse places to the treasures that have until now been reserved for detroiters people attending the touring exhibit might feel that they are supporting detroit , as well as enjoying its art ron l meyers new york , aug 7 , 2013 it s 2013 , and there are whistlers , van goghs and caravaggios in detroit a few of them are hanging in a trophy case called the detroit institute of arts but many more are sleeping in a kindergarten classroom because they did n't eat breakfast the 150 million estimated market value of a piece like matisse s the window is just that a market value that has little to do with art the real value of art emerges when people engage with it , and this requires an investment in education trooping a line of innercity schoolchildren past a milliondollar painting \( a painting that they are , of course , not allowed to touch \) reinforces market values and hierarchies without promoting , or generating , real art arts education does not depend on expensive paintings it depends on \( relatively cheap \) books , supplies and teachers i think detroit should sell its collection and pay off its debt but the city should also set money aside to cultivate the city s children its future caravaggios whose deep reserves of talent might otherwise disappear , unheard and unseen angela sorby milwaukee , aug 7 , 2013 for many people , and not just museum people like me , making great art available to everyone is vital for a healthy society ms marsh rightly asks where the sale of detroit s cultural assets would lead and cites the infamous , botched attempt of brandeis university to sell off its collection nevertheless , as ms ackerman eloquently points out , the practical , political and moral question remains for detroit and , to a lesser degree , for other museums the pensions of civil servants , as well as basic municipal services , will be cut without some infusion of cash , and the institute s paintings are significant assets if we do n't sell them , what do we tell those retired schoolteachers and firefighters \? mr rub and ms anagnos , as well as ms tapert and ms sorby , go to the heart of the matter the justification for the cost of museums and preserving our cultural legacy is in the power of works of art to enhance our lives , educate us and move us ms tapert s story is a profound illustration of the extraordinary impact of museums' many education programs for the whole community , and especially for children nevertheless , some people still feel that the use of society s resources for art museums during a crisis is not justified museums must deal with that doubt , reach out even more and demonstrate once again that , in fact , they do save lives frank robinson ithaca , ny , aug 8 , 2013
washington president obama on wednesday nominated caroline kennedy to be ambassador to japan , moving to give a scion of america s most enduring political dynasty a diplomatic post that has often gone to political heavyweights in naming ms kennedy , whose nomination has been rumored for months , mr obama is keeping with a wellestablished tradition of rewarding important campaign supporters with plum embassies he recently put forward bigdollar fundraisers to be envoys in london , berlin , copenhagen and madrid but ms kennedy s value to mr obama has been less about money than mystique as the daughter of president john f kennedy , her imprimatur on his candidacy in 2008 along with that of her uncle , senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts elevated mr obama at a crucial moment against his betterknown rival , hillary rodham clinton and it gave ms kennedy lasting ties to mr obama , something analysts said would come in useful in japan , where officials and journalists have been buzzing with speculation about what a kennedy in tokyo would mean for japan s standing in the united states ms kennedy , 55 , a lawyer and an author who has served as director of numerous nonprofit organizations , has never worked in government and has no special expertise in japan but some experts said her lack of knowledge is outweighed by her connections to the oval office she shares that with other marquee figures who have served as ambassador to tokyo , including former vice president walter f mondale howard baker , a former senator and white house chief of staff and thomas s foley , a former house speaker for those who say she does n't know a lot about japan , i say sure , ' but neither did walter mondale , said kurt m campbell , a former assistant secretary of state for east asian affairs what you really want in an ambassador is someone who can get the president of the united states on the phone , mr campbell said i ca n't think of anybody in the united states who could do that more quickly than caroline kennedy her stature , he said , should assuage japan s worries that in washington , tokyo takes a back seat to beijing the current ambassador to china , gary f locke , was commerce secretary during mr obama s first term , but he hardly knows the president as well as ms kennedy does in a statement on wednesday , the japanese foreign ministry welcomed the nomination , noting that caroline kennedy has the deep confidence of president obama and that her choice reflected the great importance the obama administration attaches to the japanus alliance if confirmed , ms kennedy would replace john v roos , a lawyer and major fundraiser for the president mr obama chose mr roos over joseph s nye jr , a harvard professor who was the preferred candidate of mrs clinton , then mr obama s newly appointed secretary of state mr roos was barely known in japan when he arrived in 2009 but he built up a following on twitter with frequent posts about baseball , justin bieber and mrs clinton many of them in japanese he was the first envoy to attend a peace memorial in hiroshima , and he dealt with the tsunami and subsequent crisis at the fukushima nuclear power plant while ms kennedy may not have firsthand ties to japan , historians note that her father played a critical role as president in repairing the alliance between japan and the united states relations had become frayed over the signing of a 1960 treaty that made permanent the american military base on okinawa president kennedy sent another harvard academic , edwin o reischauer , as his ambassador to tokyo , and mr reischauer , with his japanese wife , haru , worked to wean the countries away from their postworld war ii relationship as occupier and occupied the president also sent his brother , attorney general robert f kennedy , on a fencemending tour of japan ms kennedy would not face anywhere near that kind of tension these days , american officials worry most about clashes between japan and china over disputed islands in the east china sea but the japanese bridled when mr obama skipped a meeting last month with prime minister shinzo abe on the sidelines of the group of 8 meeting in northern ireland none of mr obama s other diplomatic appointments are likely to draw the attention that ms kennedy s has anna wintour , the editor of vogue magazine and a fundraiser for mr obama , was rumored to be under consideration for posts in london and paris but she was passed over for london in favor of matthew barzun , a technology executive who was the obama campaign s national finance chairman and served as the ambassador to sweden from 2009 to 2011
he was the big fish in the small pond that was the greenwich village folk music scene circa 1960 , sought out and emulated by newcomers like bob dylan and tom paxton but by the time his memoir , the mayor of macdougal street , was published posthumously in 2005 , dave van ronk had been relegated almost to a footnote in the history of american popular music , better known for the many singersongwriters whose careers he had fostered than for his own work now van ronk may finally be about to get his due inside llewyn davis , the new coen brothers movie opening on friday , is based loosely , very loosely , on his memoir , which has just been reissued in advance of the film , a threecd van ronk retrospective called down in washington square , with 16 previously unheard recordings , has already been released by smithsonian folkways in connection with a new book and cd about the caff lena folk club in saratoga springs , ny , one of van ronk s 1974 shows there is being streamed , and a new documentary evoking the folk scene over which he presided , another day another time , will be shown on showtime on dec 13 dave van ronk is not an obscure figure , ethan coen said when asked about the origins of the film he s the biggest figure on an obscure scene , playing a kind of niche music that we knew and liked we gravitated to his book , because it is a great , and very funny , document of its time his acid voice is part of what draws you into the book , which is the best thing i know of in giving a sense of what it was like to be a working musician at that time as van ronk himself wrote in the song that gives the cd retrospective its title , his was very much the world of beatnik poets with conga drums , uptown virgins and bowery bums , bluegrass picking and flamenco strums born in brooklyn in 1936 , raised in queens in an irishdutch family , he headed for greenwich village in the early 1950s , and stayed there until his death in 2002 , working in clubs that often proved to have less staying power than he did , and sometimes recording for labels that he also outlasted so what gives van ronk , a bearded bear of a man , his enduring quality in 2013 \? it depends who is doing the talking people refer to gatekeepers , and dave van ronk was one of those guys , said jeff place , a music archivist at the smithsonian institution who assembled the cd package and wrote the main essay in its liner notes he did the research , and nurtured a lot of people onto the repertoire , people who went on to record those songs and became better known than he was mr place compared van ronk to progenitors of the british blues scene like alexis korner and cyril davies , who led the roots movement that gave members of the rolling stones and cream their first opportunities to play but it was van ronk s voice , a gruff and gravelly baritone , that could shift into a hauntingly vulnerable higher register when needed , his mastery of guitar styles associated with bluesmen like the rev gary davis and mississippi john hurt , and his astute choice of material that drew people to his performances and records he was a very good singer , with a tremendous feel , and a brilliant curator of songs , drawing from the very limited resources of that time , said t bone burnett , the music supervisor for inside llewyn davis , whose title derives from one of van ronk s records \( inside dave van ronk \) his widow , andrea vuocolo , who lives in a greenwich village building that still has his name on the entrance buzzer , put it another way he was everybody s library , and all of his peers borrowed from him none of the songs on the soundtrack cd accompanying inside llewyn davis , for example , were written by van ronk but he sought out traditional songs , from blues to sea chanties , wrote new fingerpicking guitar arrangements and reworked the vocal lines so thoroughly that they entered the broader folk repertory bearing his stamp such is the case of hang me , oh hang me , which opens the movie and its soundtrack album fare thee well \( dink s song \) and green , green rocky road , which closes the cd in a version sung by van ronk his arrangements were smart , not virtuosic , and he thought of the guitar as a frame , said elijah wald , who wrote the mayor of macdougal street with van ronk and is one of his former guitar students he always considered himself a singer , and because he couldn t afford great accompanists , he turned himself into the best accompanist he could in today s music landscape , jazz , folk , pop and country are largely compartmentalized , with lines of communication among them sometimes tenuous but van ronk from the beginning saw himself as synthesizing all of those styles and others i never really thought of myself as a folk singer at all , he wrote in the liner notes to one of his early folkways albums still don t what i did was combine traditional fingerpicking guitar with a repertory of old jazz tunes
new delhi the powerful cyclone that struck s eastern coast this weekend washed away thousands of mud homes , knocked down power lines , blocked many of the region s roads and damaged crops and fishing boats but reports from the region on sunday showed the success of one of the biggest and most rapid evacuations in india s history , an operation that moved more than 800 , 000 people to safety just 14 years ago , a cyclone in roughly the same place killed more than 10 , 000 people , and over the past century , the storms that have roared out of the bay of bengal have left much death and destruction in their wake but while an accurate assessment of the damage caused by this weekend s storm will probably take weeks , the official death toll reported sunday evening was 17 , an astonishingly low number considering that 12 million people live in the storm s path the success of the evacuation operation was possible largely because of vast improvements in the country s physical infrastructure and communication systems , although the police found it necessary , at times , to coerce reluctant villagers to leave their mud and thatch homes , which were vulnerable to high winds and drenching rain , local officials said most of the deaths were attributed to falling trees and collapsed houses , officials said the cyclone , named phailin , was expected to drop up to 10 inches of rain over two days in some areas by late sunday night , it had been downgraded from a cyclone to a depression , with sustained winds of 25 miles per hour and gusts of 34 miles per hour change can come slowly to india the caste system still predominates , grinding poverty remains endemic and clean water is rare but the effective response to the threat this weekend demonstrates that indians are transforming their country , particularly in the ways that they communicate and get their news nearly a billion people routinely use cellphones in india , up from fewer than 40 million a decade ago even many of the poorest villages now have televisions , and india s numerous 24hour news channels have blanketed the nation s airwaves with coverage of the storm as the cyclone approached , many villagers tried to stay behind to safeguard their land and livestock during the worst of the storm , according to local news reports , but almost none were unaware of the coming danger and that is a huge change another crucial change has been a boom in the construction of cement houses , schools and businesses that provide crucial shelter in even the remotest areas villagers who stayed until the last moment had somewhere to go for safety k baliah , a district official from srikakulam in andhra pradesh state , said that some of the 60 , 000 people evacuated in the district did not leave their homes willingly all were allowed home on sunday , he said people are complaining that they knew nothing would happen , but officials forced them to move anyway , he said with no apology with at least 1 , 000 acres of farmland submerged and many thatched homes and fishing boats destroyed , officials said their coercion proved effective but mr baliah said that because the cyclone was not as severe as predicted , officials would have a harder time persuading large numbers of people to evacuate in the future dr jibanananda mohanty , a retired veterinary surgeon from bhubaneswar in the state of odisha , said by telephone on sunday that he had spent a harrowing night listening to howling winds and crashing trees outside , and that his home remained without electricity and water but he had days to store enough water , milk , vegetables and other supplies to carry him through because of the advanced warning , we were prepared for this situation , dr mohanty said i have n't heard of any loss of life in my neighborhood india s state and central governments spent days preparing for the worst prime minister manmohan singh said in a statement on saturday that he had been briefed on preparations for the storm and had directed the central government to extend all needed assistance to state officials service members from the country s army , air force and navy were deployed to help with rescue and relief operations , said a k antony , india s defense minister , and hundreds of shelters were set up visakhapatnam , in andhra pradesh and near the center of the storm , experienced little damage apart from a collapsed sea wall by 9 am , the sun was shining , businesses had opened at their usual times and traffic had resumed its usual chaos people emerged from their homes on sunday with a sense of relief and , in some cases , an i knew it all along attitude tousis ahmed , 30 , who is employed in india s emerging technology industry , stayed out late on saturday night and even swung by the beach , which had been cordoned off , to check on the ocean the waves were calm , so i went home and had a sound sleep , mr ahmed said b murkandarao , a fruit vendor , said he stayed open for business on saturday night until his usual hour and was back on the street again on sunday morning they tried to scare us on tv , but i was never worried , he said the bay of bengal region is among the most vulnerable in the world to the effects of climate change , and experts have predicted that storms are likely to become more intense india and bangladesh together have more people at risk from rising sea levels than any other place in the world so the government s relatively effective response to the most recent storm is an encouraging sign
leesburg , va the said friday that it would delay closing control towers at 149 airports until june to allow for safety analyses and to attempt to resolve multiple legal challenges the closings had been planned as part of a 637 million spending reduction at the agency required under the acrosstheboard budget cuts known as the sequester the towers identified for closing are at fields that handle mostly private planes , corporate jets , aviation schools and minimal airline traffic the towers' longterm fate is not yet clear the faa said that about 50 airport authorities and municipalities had indicated that if necessary , they would pick up the cost of running the towers themselves in a statement , ray lahood , the transportation secretary , said , this has been a complex process , and we need to get this right safety is our top priority , he said we will use this additional time to make sure communities and pilots understand the changes at their local airports craig fuller , the president of the , a group that represents nonairline , nonmilitary fliers , praised the delay the faa announced in march that it was closing towers at the 149 airports , a decision that met with strong protests since then , pilots said that their concern was not so much landing and taking off without a tower most small airports never had one in the first place as getting used to operating without one at a nontowered airport , pilots announce their intentions on a preestablished radio frequency and listen to other pilots do the same thing , and then are able to maintain a mental map of other traffic they fly a set pattern to approach the runway , usually in a u shape , at an altitude of about 1 , 000 feet , with the last turn lining up their aircraft with the runway at an airport with a tower , a controller assigns a pilot a specific path so there so there is no need to keep track of the other traffic none of these towers are there by happenstance , said jamie beckett , a flight instructor in winter haven , fla a risk was identified the risk could be because of traffic volume or the mix of traffic mr beckett compared it to the driveway of a school with 20 kids on bicycles , 50 moms in suv s and 12 school buses you probably need somebody there to direct traffic , he said at leesburg executive airport in virginia , which opened 49 years ago and has never had a tower , pilots on friday described a detailed , almost formulaic etiquette of radioing in at certain stages , and behaving in predictable ways , almost like participants in a square dance they said operating without a tower worked well as long as everyone cooperated but some pilots said that in its plans to close the towers , the faa was risking safety in a way that had not occurred since 1981 , when the agency was forced to close towers because president ronald reagan fired thousands of air traffic controllers who had gone on strike some instructors at leesburg said that there were some nearby airports , like the one in frederick , md , where instructors would not send a student on a solo flight if the tower were shut down on the tarmac at leesburg , john a somiak , an assistant chief flight instructor at aved flight school and the chairman of the airport s subcommittee on safety , said that at times , he wished his airport had a tower , so that pilots would not have to manage the task of agreeing on a sequence of landings or takeoffs it would give us some order on crazy days , he said but i do n't know who would pay for it
anyone who has even casually followed the pittsburgh pirates this season is probably familiar with one particular number 21 that s how many years it had been since the pirates have made the postseason , let alone had a winning season that streak ended as the pirates defeated the cincinnati reds , 62 , in a onegame , winorgohome playoff continue reading for highlights and analysis the pittsburgh pirates got a taste of october baseball and they want more led by starting pitcher francisco liriano , who pitched seven strong innings , and powered by two home runs by russell martin , the pirates cruised to a 62 victory over the cincinnati reds and will move on to st louis to start a five game series on thursday the pirates rattled reds starter johnny cueto early and chased him from the game in the fourth inning after building a 31 lead marlon byrd got things going in the second inning with solo home run and martin soon followed with his first of the game pittsburgh s fans showed up in full force for their first playoff game in 21 seasons they were loud and boisterous throughout , and will get to see at least one more october game this season choo lifted a fly ball to right that was ruled a home run after an umpire review a fan reached over the fence and made contact with the ball ryan ludwick followed that up with a double down the rightfield line that was also interfered with by a fan these pirates fans are just super excited to be watching october baseball , so we should cut them some slack watson worked his way out of further trouble , though , and the reds are now down to their final three outs votto phillips 0 for 8 , haven t hit the ball out of the infield  tyler kepner \( tylerkepner \) 2 oct 13 he could have pitched longer , but the pirates are going to need him rested for the next series , should they hold on to their 61 lead the pirates bullpen , which is one of the best in the game , should be plenty rested for thursday s potential matchup with st louis as tony watson takes the mound for pittsburgh liriano went seven innings , allowed four hits , one walk , one run and struck out five martin entered this game with two career postseason home runs in 115 atbats he matched that in four atbats tonight after launching his second homer of the game , a solo shot with one out in the seventh yankees fans are wondering where this power was last october ! liriano is experiencing postseason success for the first time in his career he had made two previous october starts , both of them against the yankees , in 2009 and 2010 he lasted just two innings in the first one and allowed four runs in fiveplus innings in the second but liriano is a different pitcher now than he was toward the end of his tenure with the twins he s found his way back to the allstar he was in 2006 , just in time to lead a longsuffering franchise back to prominence it s hard to believe that liriano is still only 29 years old , but when he made his debut in 2005 , he was just 21 liriano is in complete control in this one here in the seventh the pirates are 695 when leading after 6 innings , due to their excellent bullpen liriano is pitching well enough to go the distance , but the pirates may want to spell him soon with an eye on the next series , which starts thursday in st louis up comes byrd , who has helped to fuel the pirates offense tonight his solo home run in the second gave the pirates a 10 lead and he drove in another run in the fourth he now has runners on first and second with one out acquiring byrd was one of the shrewd moves the pirates made during the season to bolster its offense byrd , 35 , started the season without any job security , but turned a spring training invite from the mets into a starting gig he even got his own tshirt night at citifield on august 27th the tshirt depicted a pair of wings and the text let it fly byrd flew all right , right out of the organization , that very same day he was traded to the pirates before the game and went on to hit 318 the rest of the regular season the byrd tshirt can now be found at a thrift store near you as we head to the sixth inning , things are looking bleak for the reds they have mounted only one rally against liriano over the first five innings and have managed just one run liriano has thrown just 60 pitches entering the inning , 43 of them for strikes another reds pitcher joined the party , jj hoover , but he could not stop the pirates from padding their lead byrd grounded into a force out , but walker came around to score marshall s line is atrocious he failed to retire a single batter , giving up a run , a hit and two walks i guess he s never been marshall d before as 3batter postseason relief appearances go , that s not as bad as ryan speier in the 2007 ws but it s close http tco cdivsfa7ol  tyler kepner \( tylerkepner \) 2 oct 13 the new reds pitcher , sean marshall , got the same name chanting treatment cueto received when he entered the game marshall does not have the same ring to it , but it seems to be working nonetheless as the pirates have added another run , thanks to a double by walker there is still just one out runners on first and second for morneau during pittsburgh s many down years , i said the fans that did show up to watch them were the best in baseball this is their reward  david waldstein \( davidwaldstein \) 2 oct 13 you won t have johnny cueto to push around anymore he s been pulled with one out in the fourth inning only one pitcher lived up to expectations in this presumed pitcher s duel cueto never looked comfortable tonight , which is surprising given his cool reputation under pressure he gave up seven hits , two of them homers , and three runs in threeplus innings bruce finally finds success against liriano , driving in a run with a single to left in the following atbat , frazier hit a shot that was just a few feet away from landing fair in the left field stands that would have given the reds a 43 lead instead , on the next pitch , liriano got frazier swinging when the reds play the pirates , there are bruises a plenty there were 28 hit batters in games between the two teams this year , the most of any two teams in all of baseball choo was hit seven times by pirates pitching in the regular season and was plunked again to lead off the fourth the reds now have runners on first and second with one out , their first threat of the game it was not a knockout punch , but alvarez drove in the third run with a sac fly to center cueto has thrown 52 pitches with two outs in the third inning reds manager dusty baker just visited the mound , trying to talk his pitcher out of a jam the pirates have runners on first and third with one out , pedro alvarez , an allstar who hit 36 homers during the regular season , is at the plate dusty baker pregame if you know johnny cueto like i know johnny cueto , he thrives in this type of environment  tyler kepner \( tylerkepner \) 2 oct 13 while the bottom of the second inning resembled somewhat of a fireworks display for the pirates offense , the reds hitters have yet to get a ball out of the infield through three innings , there have been seven ground balls and two strikeouts it took a spectacular dive into the crowd in foul territory by third baseman todd frazier to save cueto from the second even liriano had a hardhit single in the inning now liriano is back on the mound , in the allimportant shutdown inning that could set the tone for the rest of the game russell martin , who of all the pirates hitters had the most postseason experience coming into this game \( making his sixth appearance \) , homered to leftcenter to give pittsburgh a 20 lead cueto seems rattled by crowd , which is insistently chanting cueeeto on repeat the first four batters here in the second have hit the ball hard , two of them hit it hard enough to clear the fence unreal fans chanting for cueto , he drops ball on mound , next pitch is a hr by russell martin  tyler kepner \( tylerkepner \) 2 oct 13 marlon byrd , who was 7 for 12 with a home run in his career against cueto , lifted one over the leftfield fence in his firstever postseason atbat pretty amazing that neal huntington found a 4 and 5 hitter in late august byrd , batting fifth , comes through with a homer 10 pirates  tyler kepner \( tylerkepner \) 2 oct 13 bad news for all lefthanded reds hitter liriano has yet to give up a home run against lefties in 2013 lefthanded batters are hitting just 133 against him jay bruce , who was 0for11 against liriano entering the game , struck out as part of another onetwothree inning a bit more stressful than liriano s first inning , but the same result for cueto marte tried to bunt his way on but the throw was faster than he was , and he is very fast walker then flied out deep to left then with chants of mvp filling the air at pnc park , mccutchen earned a walk before morneau lined out to right when cueto has pitched this season , he s been very effective the problem is , he has started only twice since june 28 and has been placed on the disabled list three times this season with back problems two of his starts this season were at this ballpark , and he was 10 with an 073 era , giving up three hits in 12 1 3 innings he s also 82 with a 190 era in his career at pnc park three up , three down liriano struck out shinsoo choo to start the game and induced two weak grounders to retire the side in order off all the key acquisitions the pirates made over the past year , none has been more crucial to their success than liriano , who was 168 with a 302 earned run average in 2013 he was especially good at pnc park , going 81 with a 147 era while the team has been willing to spend a little more in recent years , the pirates payroll is still among the smallest in the majors , meaning they needed to catch some breaks in free agency to be competitive they took a chance on liriano , who in recent seasons had not looked anything like the allstar who took the american league by storm with the minnesota twins in 2006 the twoyear , 1275 million contract he signed turned into an even greater bargain after a broken his arm , occurring in an offfield accident , reduced liriano s takehome pay to 1 million but don t feel too bad for liriano his onfield performance has guaranteed him 8 million for 2014 , which is still a steal for pittsburgh if he continues at this level doug drabek top of the mound , fires a strike to the plate for the ceremonial first pitch that s the way you do it  tyler kepner \( tylerkepner \) 2 oct 13 wow ! andrew mccutchen s mom can really , really sing outstanding national anthem performance  tyler kepner \( tylerkepner \) 1 oct 13 based on how things played out over the

early last year , after a series of frightening encounters with her former husband , stephanie holten went to court in spokane , wash , to obtain a temporary order for protection her former husband , corey holten , threatened to put a gun in her mouth and pull the trigger , she wrote in her petition he also said he would put a cap in her if her new boyfriend gets near my kids in neat block letters she wrote ,  the judge s order prohibited mr holten from going within two blocks of his former wife s home and imposed a number of other restrictions what it did not require him to do was surrender his guns about 12 hours after he was served with the order , mr holten was lying in wait when his former wife returned home from a date with their two children in tow armed with a small semiautomatic rifle bought several months before , he stepped out of his car and thrust the muzzle into her chest he directed her inside the house , yelling that he was going to kill her i remember thinking , cops , i need the cops , ' she later wrote in a statement to the police he s going to kill me in my own house i'm going to die ! ms holten , however , managed to dial 911 on her cellphone and slip it under a blanket on the couch and quickly directed officers to the scene as they mounted the stairs with their guns drawn , mr holten surrendered they found ms holten cowering , hysterical , on the floor for all its rage and terror , the episode might well have been prevented had mr holten lived in one of a handful of states , the protection order would have forced him to relinquish his firearms but that is not the case in washington and most of the country , in large part because of the influence of the and its allies advocates for domestic violence victims have long called for stricter laws governing firearms and protective orders their argument is rooted in a grim statistic when women die at the hand of an intimate partner , that hand is more often than not holding a gun in these most volatile of human dramas , they contend , the right to bear arms must give ground to the need to protect a woman s life in statehouses across the country , though , the nra and other gunrights groups have beaten back legislation mandating the surrender of firearms in domestic violence situations they argue that gun ownership , as a fundamental constitutional right , should not be stripped away for anything less serious than a felony conviction and certainly not , as an nra lobbyist in washington state put it to legislators , for the mere issuance of court orders that resistance is being tested anew in the wake of the massacre in newtown , conn , as proposals on the mandatory surrender of firearms are included in gun control legislation being debated in several states among them is washington , where current law gives judges issuing civil protection orders the discretion to require the surrender of firearms if , for example , they find a serious and imminent threat to public health but records and interviews show that they rarely do so , making the state a useful laboratory for examining the consequences , as well as the politics , of this standoff over the limits of second amendment rights by analyzing a number of washington databases , the new york times identified scores of gunrelated crimes committed by people subject to recently issued civil protection orders , including murder , attempted murder and kidnapping in at least five instances over the last decade , women were shot to death less than a month after obtaining protection orders in at least a halfdozen other killings , the victim was not the person being protected but someone else there were dozens of gunrelated assaults like the one ms holten endured the analysis which crosschecked protective orders against arrest and conviction data , along with fatality lists compiled by the represents at best a partial accounting of such situations because of limitations in the data the databases were missing some orders that have expired or been terminated they also did not flag the use of firearms in specific crimes , so identifying cases required combing through court records washington s criminal statutes , however , contain a number of gunspecific charges , like unlawful possession of a firearm and aiming or discharging one , offering another window into the problem last year , the times found , more than 50 people facing protection orders issued since 2011 were arrested on one of these gun charges in some instances , of course , laws mandating the surrender of firearms might have done nothing to prevent an attack sometimes the gun used was not the one cited in the petition in other cases , no mention of guns was ever made but in many cases , upon close scrutiny , stricter laws governing protective orders and firearms might very well have made a difference the times also looked at several other states without surrender laws in minnesota , more than 30 people facing active protection orders were convicted of some type of assault with a dangerous weapon over the last three years , court records show and in oklahoma , the times found the case of barbara diane dye ms dye , 40 , obtained an emergency order of protection in july 2010 , on the same day she filed for divorce from her husband , raymond dye , a firefighter ms dye , who worked as a personal trainer at a gym the couple owned , explained in her petition that since telling her husband she wanted a divorce because of his infidelity , he had repeatedly threatened to kill her she wrote that she feared he would have a violent reaction when he receives divorce papers when asked if there were weapons on the premises , she wrote , yes in fact , mr dye possessed an arsenal of weapons , which ms dye and her family would later beg the local police to help them deal with , to no avail after obtaining the court order , which was good until a hearing about a lengthier order three weeks later , ms dye went into hiding in texas but returned to oklahoma to attend divorce proceedings two weeks after obtaining the initial order , she was in a bank parking lot in the city of elgin when in his truck , blocking her in witnesses later told the police that mr dye , 42 , tried to drag her into his truck when she fought back , mr dye brandished a 357 revolver and shot her in the leg she fell to the ground mr dye fired several more shots into her , saying , i love you , i love you , according to the police report he then shot himself in the chest with a different gun , a 45caliber semiautomatic pistol , and collapsed , dead , onto his wife  , ' said ms dye s mother , barbara burk , a local official who has fought unsuccessfully in oklahoma for a measure that would give judges issuing protective orders the power to order sheriffs to confiscate weapons and hold them for a cooling off period is there nothing you can do \? intimate partner homicides account for nearly half the women killed every year , according to federal statistics more than half of these women are killed with a firearm and a significant percentage were likely to have obtained protection orders against their eventual killers \( a , published in criminal justice review , of women slain by intimate partners in 10 cities put that number at one in five \) it was in recognition of these converging realities that congress included a provision in the , over the objections of the nra , that barred most people subject to full protective orders filed by intimate partners from purchasing or possessing firearms in a nod to the concerns of the gun lobby , the statute excluded most people under temporary orders , on the ground that they had not yet had the opportunity to contest the accusations in court the statute , though , is rarely enforced in 2012 , prosecutors nationwide filed fewer than 50 such cases , according to a times analysis of records from the , a research center at syracuse university that collects federal government data it has , therefore , largely fallen to a statebystate patchwork of laws to regulate this issue or not a handful of states have enacted laws requiring that judges order the surrender of firearms when issuing even temporary protection orders the strictest states , like california , hawaii and massachusetts , make it mandatory for essentially all domestic violence orders others , like new york and north carolina , set out certain circumstances when surrender is required in a few other states , like maryland and wisconsin , surrender is mandatory only with a full injunction , granted after the opposing party has had the opportunity to participate in a court hearing several other states , like connecticut and florida , do not have surrender laws but do prohibit gun possession by certain people subject to protective orders although enforcement remains an issue , researchers say these laws have made a difference , published in 2010 in the journal injury prevention , found a 19 percent reduction in intimate partner homicides washington state has seen several efforts to enact firearm surrender laws in 2004 , representative ruth kagi , a democrat , introduced a bill mandating the surrender of firearms with temporary protective orders but after strong opposition from the nra , the bill failed to make it out of committee the nra s lobbyist in the state , brian judy , testified that the measure granted extraordinarily broad authority to strip firearms rights gunrights groups stress that the subjects of temporary orders have not even had the chance to be heard in court , and that many temporary orders do not become full injunctions advocates for domestic violence victims counter that the most dangerous moment is when such orders are first issued , and that the surrender of weapons at this stage may be only temporary nevertheless , in 2010 , they decided to lower their ambitions and backed a proposal in the washington legislature requiring surrender only after a full protective order was issued , restraining threatening conduct against family members or children of family members the measure also would have made it a felony to possess a firearm while subject to such an order once again , the nra and its allies strenuously objected the group sent out a legislative alert to its members , who besieged legislators a veteran gunrights lobbyist flew in from florida to meet with representative roger goodman , a democrat who had introduced the measure mr judy , the state nra lobbyist , wrote in an email to mr goodman that his organization considered the current washington law already bad on this subject he added , it is the nra s position that any crime that is serious enough to cause an individual to lose a fundamental constitutional right should be classified as a felony ultimately , lawmakers stripped the gun measure out of a broader package of domestic violence legislation this year , the issue is pending once again in the washington legislature , part of a number of gunrelated proposals introduced after the newtown shooting the proposed , further narrowed in an attempt to placate the nra , seeks to mirror the language of the federal prohibition , which bars most people under full protective orders from buying or owning weapons but in an email to house judiciary committee members considering the measure , mr judy wrote that the federal law does not provide adequate protection and argued that individual firearm rights were more broadly protected in washington s state constitution than in the second amendment the bill seemed on the verge of being scuttled as the nra pushed to amend it in a way that supporters argued would render it meaningless , but house democrats managed to close ranks and pass it it faces a much steeper climb in the republicancontrolled state senate , where the nra wields greater influence the issue has also gained traction in colorado a traditional power base for the gun lobby but also the state where 12 people were shot to death and 58 were wounded at a movie theater in july a that would require the surrender of firearms in protectionorder cases is part of a guncontrol package passed by the state senate last week , though not a single republican voted for it and in congress , representative lois capps , democrat of california , introduced a last week that would expand the federal prohibition to include temporary orders and current or former dating partners even so , across the country , any suggestion of a broad shift must be tempered by history in the mid1990s , wisconsin became one of the first states to require the surrender of firearms with full protective orders but in 2010 , seeking to strengthen enforcement , advocates for domestic violence victims pushed for the statewide adoption of procedures that had been successful in a few counties among a host of provisions , people subject to protective orders would have been required to list their firearms and surrender them to the county sheriff or a third party within 48 hours the nra mobilized , calling the measure a blatant violation of americans' fifth amendment rights in an alert to its members jordan austin , an nra lobbyist , expanded in his testimony on the bill before an assembly committee once a person has an injunction issued against him , he is already a prohibited person he cannot , under the fifth amendment , be forced to disclose whether he is in possession of firearms , because that would be tantamount to forcing him to admit a crime the bill died in the state senate in virginia , the gun lobby has repeatedly stymied efforts to make it illegal for people subject to court injunctions to possess firearms \( currently , they are barred only from buying and transporting firearms \) there s often recognition that firearms and domestic violence is a lethal combination , but it s followed quickly with concerns about taking away an individual s right to possess a firearm , said kristine hall , the policy director for the  the lack of a state surrender law helps explain what happened when deborah wigg , a 39yearold accountant in virginia beach , obtained a protective order in april 2011 against her husband , robert wigg , whom she was in the process of divorcing in her petition , she described a violent encounter in which mr wigg grabbed her by her hair , threw her down , ripped out a door and threw it at her he was arrested and charged with assault she also made clear in the petition that her husband owned a 9millimeter semiautomatic handgun she eventually won a full protective order , but mr wigg kept his gun , which he used in his business installing and servicing atm s ms wigg and her coworkers at an accounting firm openly fretted about the weapon she agreed that every morning she would call marty ridout , a partner at the firm , so he could make sure she was safe on the morning of nov 8 , 2011 , ms wigg left mr ridout a voice mail message saying everything was fine around 11 pm that night , however , mr wigg , 43 , at his wife s home and began ringing the doorbell and pounding on the door ms wigg called her parents her mother , adele brown , told her to hang up and call 911 but as ms brown and her husband , who lived about a halfmile away , were heading over , mr wigg smashed through the door and into the house the browns arrived to find a neighbor bent over their daughter s bleeding form , screaming , debbie , do n't leave me ! when we got to her , those beautiful blue eyes were already set , ms brown said ms wigg died of a single shot to the head after shooting his wife , mr wigg drove to the browns' , apparently to kill them as well he killed himself in their front yard it astounds me , mr ridout said i cannot believe we have a society where a person has physically abused another person and been charged with assaulting her and that they do n't automatically take away his weapon one state with strict laws in this arena is california , where anyone served with a temporary protective order has 24 hours to turn over any weapons to local law enforcement or sell them to a licensed gun dealer enforcement , however , has been inconsistent so in 2006 , the state set up pilot programs to increase enforcement in san mateo county , just outside san francisco , and butte county , a largely rural area north of sacramento the programs' money dried up in 2010 with the state s fiscal woes , but san mateo sought other financing because it believed that its program was saving lives we have not had a firearmrelated domestic violence homicide in the last three years , said sgt linda gibbons , who oversees the program as the head of the major crimes unit in the county sheriff s office last year alone , the program took in 324 firearms through seizure or surrender from 81 people , out of more than 800 protective orders it reviewed every morning , detective john kovach , who handles a range of domestic violence investigations , reviews a stack of protective orders filed the day before generally 15 to 20 a day looking for any mention of firearms usually , a handful of orders a day will contain some reference to guns , which detective kovach follows up on he sometimes contacts the person protected by the order to find out more he also checks various law enforcement databases , including one available in california that tracks handgun purchases he goes out once or twice a week and serves the restraining orders himself usually , he says , he tries to collect firearms immediately , employing a wellhoned sales pitch about helping the person comply with the law if he believes beforehand that the person might not be cooperative , he will sometimes request a search warrant my experience is the quicker you act , the more successful you 're going to be , he said notably , given the gun lobby s objections to seizing guns after just a temporary order , detective kovach said he had handled only one or two restraining orders involving firearms in the last year that were eventually dropped after the court hearing in a typical case , a 19yearold woman from redwood city filed for a restraining order against her husband in december , explaining that he had become increasingly abusive and that she had recently moved out she checked off a box on the form saying he had used firearms to threaten her and , on a confidential weapons possession data sheet provided as a part of the san mateo program , indicated that he owned an assault rifle and a handgun the detective picked up her order the following morning and , with a colleague , arranged to meet that day she told them that after an argument a year earlier , her husband had threatened to kill himself , sending her in a text message a picture of himself holding an assault rifle to his head more recently , he had warned that if she started dating , he would shoot the man , her and then himself detective kovach quickly secured a search warrant he and several other detectives staked out the man s home and served him with the protective order while he was walking his dog in their search , they turned up seven guns , including two ar15 assault rifles every murder , when you look at it , there are always points where law enforcement could have made a difference , the detective said i do n't ever want to be that guy who goes to sleep knowing he has n't done everything to protect the public in washington state , the times s analysis highlighted danger at play when there is no broad mandatory firearm surrender law under current law , judges issuing protective orders are required to order the surrender of firearms only in very specific situations , like a determination by clear and convincing evidence that the person has used the weapon in a felony or has committed another offense that by law would disqualify him from having a firearm otherwise , judges have the discretion to issue a surrender order under a variety of circumstances , including a finding that there is a threat of irreparable injury \( there is also a court form specifically requesting the surrender of firearms , but advocates say it is rarely used because few victims of domestic violence know about it \) all five of the washington cases identified by the times in which the woman who obtained the protective order was later killed were murdersuicides in three cases , the woman wrote in her petition that her husband or exboyfriend possessed firearms in none of the cases did the judges issue surrender orders in fairness , it was not always clear that such an order would have prevented the deaths even so , those cases can show the existing system s weakness in the face of obvious peril melissa batten , a 36yearold software developer for xbox , secured a temporary protective order in july 2008 , describing a series of episodes in which her estranged husband harassed her and also broke into her workplace in redmond she said he also pointed a loaded gun at her in an argument and then put it to his head , threatening to kill himself it fell to a mutual friend , however , not the courts or law enforcement , to deal with the gun he persuaded the husband , robert batten , to sell his 22caliber handgun back to the dealer , according to a police report but mr batten later bought two more guns , a 357 smith wesson revolver and a 9millimeter taurus semiautomatic , according to the police it is not clear exactly when he bought them , but the police found evidence that he went to a gun show a few days after being served with the protective order \( in some states , the existence of the order would have barred him from buying guns \) mr batten shot his wife eight times in the parking lot outside her home before shooting himself , killing them both ms batten s case then there are the more routine episodes that unfold outside the public eye julie lohrengel obtained a temporary order for protection against her estranged husband , shawn lohrengel , in august 2010 , detailing several encounters , including one in which he had shaken her and grabbed her by the throat she checked off the box in the petition that indicated he possessed firearms the court commissioner did not order mr lohrengel to surrender his guns several weeks later , ms lohrengel and a friend , with ms lohrengel s two children in the back seat , drove up to her home in centralia but stopped when they saw mr lohrengel s truck parked outside the garage as they started backing out of the driveway , between five and eight gunshots rang out , but no one was wounded when the police arrived , mr lohrengel ran out onto the front porch with a rifle , as if looking for someone , the police report said he eventually pleaded guilty to aiming and discharging a firearm and reckless endangerment sometimes , the person who takes out a protective order is not the one ultimately victimized james anthony mills , 17 , pleaded guilty last year to seconddegree murder for that killed adrian wilson , 16 , at a birthday barbecue in auburn , wash less than a year before , an exgirlfriend of mr mills s had obtained an order for protection against him she explained in her petition that mr mills had threatened her with a gun during an argument nothing was done about the weapon even in cases where there was evidence that someone subject to a civil order for protection possessed a gun in violation of state and federal law , no move was made to remove it dennis pirone was arrested in seattle in july 2009 and charged with harassing his exgirlfriend jody mayes a criminal nocontact order was issued , requiring him to surrender his firearms he filled out a form declaring that he had none he was arrested again a few weeks later for violating the nocontact order once again , after being ordered to surrender firearms , he declared that he did not have any that december , ms mayes sought a protective order , writing in her petition that mr pirone had bought a gun even though he is a convicted felon and is not supposed to have it in his own words two months later , mr pirone flew into a rage at another woman , a roommate , after she refused his sexual advances he came back with a small silver handgun , told the woman , i will kill you , and pointed the gun at her before firing a shot into an old sofa , according to a seattle police report the police later found two 22caliber semiautomatic handguns in the house more than a year after her ordeal in spokane , stephanie holten still cannot understand why the judge did nothing about her former husband s guns  , she said , but at the same time , public safety has to be paramount ms holten , 39 , who is still seeing a counselor about the episode , said her mind relentlessly replays the scene of her on her knees , looking down the barrel of a loaded gun in the recording of her 911 call , she can be heard sobbing and begging mr holten to leave he can be heard responding , between expletives , that she is going to die mr holten who later pleaded guilty to attempted firstdegree assault and was sentenced to more than six years in prison ordered her upstairs to her bedroom , forcing her to show him that she still had their wedding photos and other mementos he then offered her a deal he would put the gun down if she promised to drop the protection order , give him custody of their son and not call the police when she tearfully assented , mr holten placed his 9millimeter carbine the same weapon ms holten believes she saw at his home a month earlier and cited in her court petition in a hallway closet that was when they both heard a male voice say police department her legs buckled , and she crumpled to the ground i wish in my case he had to surrender everything , she said if the cops had been able to take the firearms out of that household when they served him , i think it would have averted the entire thing
brussels divisions among european union foreign ministers on monday prevented the renewal of the arms embargo on syria , raising the possibility of a new flow of weapons to rebels fighting to bring down the government of president bashar alassad while we have no immediate plans to send arms to syria , it gives us the flexibility to respond in the future if the situation continues to deteriorate and worsen , william hague , the british foreign secretary , said after more than 12 hours of stormy talks in a declaration , the european union said member states that might wish to send weapons to syrian rebels shall assess the export license applications on a casebycase basis in line with the organization s rules on exports of military technology and equipment the ministers did agree to renew all the economic sanctions already in place against the syrian government but efforts to ease the arms embargo , led by britain , exposed deep rifts on monday over the issue of arming the rebels meanwhile , secretary of state john kerry met with his russian counterpart to continue to try to organize peace talks in geneva next month austria , the czech republic and sweden came to the meeting strongly opposing arms shipments they distrust large parts of the syrian opposition and said they feared that the weapons would end up in the hands of jihadist groups they also said funneling arms to the opposition now would undermine the chances of a deal with the assad government before the planned peace conference in geneva there were also fears that russia , which already sends arms to the syrian government , would feel freer to send more france supported britain in seeking to ease the embargo , but had called for a wider consensus the european ministers said it was now up to each member state to decide for itself whether to export weapons to the opposition , because the armsexport issue had been separated from the other sanctions in a sign of the tensions , the austrian foreign minister , michael spindelegger , held an impromptu news conference late monday warning that the end of the embargo risked creating a situation where everybody is entitled to deliver weapons to the assad regime or to the opposition the failure to agree means that the european union s existing package of sanctions will lapse after friday but ministers emphasized that economic sanctions like asset freezes and travel bans on syrian officials would continue a lapse of all the sanctions would have been a serious embarrassment for the bloc i'm glad at the end of the day we were able to have a sanctions regime for all the other sanctions that were in place , frans timmermans , the dutch foreign minister , said after the meeting mr timmermans said none of the union s member nations , including his own , intended to ship arms to the syrian rebels immediately but he warned that lifting the arms embargo could lead russia to step up its arms shipments to the assad government the only effect you could have let s be realistic about this is that it will stimulate the russians to provide even more arms , he said but they 've been providing so many arms that i'm sure even more will not make much of a difference with new concerns being raised about whether syrian military forces were using chemical weapons , and intense fighting continuing in the city of qusayr , the united nations top human rights official on monday blamed all parties in the conflict for flagrant disregard of international law and human life appalling violations of the most basic human rights are occurring in syria , said the official , navi pillay , the high commissioner for human rights , speaking in geneva at the opening session of the human rights council invoking the responsibility of governments to protect the civilians of other countries from war crimes , ms pillay said , i fear that we in the international community are failing to meet our fundamental obligations to the victims those concerns gained urgency on monday as laurent fabius , the french foreign minister , said that there were growing suspicions of localized chemical weapons use in syria , but that the evidence needed very detailed verification he spoke after le monde , the french newspaper , that the syrian government had used canisters of some form of toxic gas against rebel forces in the damascus suburb of jobar le monde said that it had placed two journalists with the rebels for two months , and that a photographer working for the paper suffered blurred vision and respiratory difficulties for four days after inhaling a gas on april 13 in his le monde article about the gas canisters , jeanphilippe r my reported that they opened with a click , and emitted an agent that was colorless and invisible he wrote that the use of the gas was not uncommon in small areas that were the sites of intense fights , and quoted a syrian doctor as saying that in some cases , if those exposed do not receive immediate emergency treatment , death ensues mr assad has dismissed accusations that his forces have used chemical weapons , but his government has accused the rebels of deploying such weapons his government continues to receive arms from iran and russia , and fighters from iran and hezbollah mr kerry and sergey v lavrov , the russian foreign minister , met in paris on monday evening to try to lay the groundwork for talks that would bring together representatives of mr assad s government and the syrian opposition the assad government has indicated that it is prepared to attend , but the syrian opposition is still picking new leaders mr kerry said additional meetings between american and russian officials would be held to work out how this conference can best be prepared for the possibilities of success , not failure both of us , russia and the united states , are deeply committed , remain committed to trying to implement the geneva 1 principles , which require a transitional government by mutual consent that has full executive authority in order to allow the people of syria to decide the future of syria , mr kerry said the expectation is that the meeting will be held by

leaders of the coalition , the fair immigration reform movement , and the service employees international union , one of the most active unions working to pass the overhaul , said they would spend more than 1 million on radio ads , telephone banks and social media drives in the districts they will focus on the house leadership , including speaker john a boehner of ohio , representatives eric cantor of virginia , kevin mccarthy of california and peter roskam of illinois , as well as three other top republicans darrell issa of california , greg walden of oregon and cathy mcmorris rodgers of washington other republicans the groups will focus on as possible swing votes are representatives buck mckeon of california , mike coffman of colorado , daniel webster of florida and michael grimm of new york coalition leaders said focusing on those districts would be part of a nationwide campaign to push house lawmakers to hold a vote before the end of this month on a broad immigration bill that would include a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants in the country illegally the campaign would also concentrate on republican districts in california and texas and in districts with many latino voters in central florida , they said we need a vote on citizenship , said eliseo medina , international secretarytreasurer of the service sector union , the seiu the immigrants deserve that , and our country deserves that house leaders have given no sign that a vote on one comprehensive immigration bill is part of their strategy a broad bill that includes a path to citizenship passed the senate last week , with 14 republicans joining 52 democrats in support but no similar bill has been introduced in the house the house judiciary committee is preparing four immigration bills , but none of them include legalization for undocumented immigrants mr boehner has tipped his hand only to say that any bill must pass with a majority of republican votes deepak bhargava , executive director of the center for community change , a central organization in the coalition , said many immigrant communities were spurred to action after house republicans passed a measure last month to halt a program giving reprieves from deportation to young undocumented immigrants , which has been very popular in those communities house republicans have already gone a long way in stoking our families outrage , mr bhargava said but the leaders said they would appeal to republicans longterm political interests although the number of house districts with a significant amount of latino and immigrant voters is not more than 40 \( out of 435 \) , it is large enough to cost house republicans their majority in elections next year if they repel those voters by blocking the overhaul , mr medina said the gop day of reckoning is not faroff in the future , it is now , he said carlos duarte , the state director in texas for mi familia vota , a latino voter registration group , said that aside from townhall meetings and other activities during july , the organization would continue to court new latino voters mr duarte said the group registered more than 40 , 000 latinos in texas who voted for the first time in 2012 both texas senators , republicans john cornyn and ted cruz , voted against the senate bill i think they made a mistaken political calculus , mr duarte said we are not going away any time soon
the second editorial in our series about science and math education , which focuses on women and minorities , has sparked an impassioned debate among online commenters about the career choices women , and to a lesser extent minorities , make some readers argued that we are seeing a problem where there is none if girls are choosing not to pursue computer science or engineering careers , that simply means they are not interested in those fields and may never be no matter how much effort is put into removing gender bias and stereotypes but other commenters many of them women made a forceful case that parents , teachers and employers are pushing girls away from these professions rohit p , a professor from new york , wrote clearly what matters to the us is the total number of scientists and not how they are divided by gender or color or whatever any woman who wants to be a scientist should be encouraged but why should we encourage women interested in music or literature or psychology to go into physical science instead \? would we prefer that alice munro had gone into physics instead \? jane austen \? emily dickinson \? let the social engineers keep their hands off the choices of individuals ciaran o from new york added while your comments about school quality are valid , why do women minorities have to work in every profession in exact proportion to their share in the population \? why no editorial about the underrepresentation of asians on profootball teams \? maybe many women for whatever reason aren t that interested in being computerprogrammers but the ny times editorial board seems to be insisting that they do this job regardless , to meet some kind of progressive agenda the paper has for society this scares me instead of blaming society for imposing stereotypes on students , david hedges , a teacher from brooklyn , wrote that it makes more sense to focus on students attitude people choose their identities from a menu of stereotypes , he wrote in part students choose to be interested by a subject or respectful of a teacher regardless of whether they are good at a subject or not even the best teachers will sour if they are under utilized by their students aptitude may not be a choice , but attitude is and in my experience as a high school teacher in brooklyn for 25 years , it s the students attitude that disallows them access to the aptitude they need to grasp higher level thinking skills the many women who wrote in offered a strong rebuttal ann m from boston wrote you ve left out a big , important factor outright discrimination as a woman in the physical sciences , i have been told by a professor that he did not want to invest time in mentoring me since i was so likely to leave the field to have children i chose a less rigorous graduate school over a more prestigious one almost entirely because it was the one school where the first question asked in interviews wasn t what does your husband do \? \( granted it s unusual for a 24 year old applicant of either gender to be married , but still , the interview was supposed to be about me ! \) it is exhausting to constantly fight against people who believe that you are less capable because of your gender or race even if we ve jumped through all the hoops to get to this point , we re still being pushed out one reader , marie b , a parent from omaha , said she had a 20year career as a structural engineer but wrote that she would probably not encourage her two daughters to follow in her footsteps my daughters are bright , consistently straight a s in honors classes and do exceptionally well in math and science , she wrote i m reluctant to encourage them to go into engineering , however it s so totally male dominated as a work model that it s difficult to manage a worklife balance add to that the subtle innuendo that borders on sexual harassment and can wreck havoc on one s self confidence i m not sure the financial gain is worth the personal cost susan d from tulsa , who identified as an educator , wrote that she has been distressed at the decline in the number of women in computer science , a trend evident in statistics from the census bureau when i eventually went to graduate school i decided to brave the topic of women and computing for my masters project , she wrote my eyes were opened to how women moved to the margins in computer science , after a stellar start doing the first programming ever during wwii i found gender identities are a powerful force in career choice and they still have tremendous impact as long as we live in a culture where women and minorities in stem are exceptions or unusual , and the images of male geeks populate media \( as well as females geeks as offbeat \) , we won t see great change rolemodels matter we invite you to read through the comments and share your thoughts on this and other editorials in our series
phoenix fritz clapp , a 67yearold lawyer with a bright red mohawk , practices intellectual property law years ago , his clients were smalltime businesses that nobody had ever heard of then he found something bigger today , mr clapp , an eloquent and irreverent man known to wear a purple fez during negotiations with other lawyers , represents the interests of a group not commonly associated with intellectual property the hells angels motorcycle club his main role is not as a bulldog criminal defense counsel for the notorious group but as a civilized advocate in its relentless battle to protect its many registered trademarks just in the past seven years , the hells angels have brought more than a dozen cases in federal court , alleging infringement on apparel , jewelry , posters and yoyos the group has also challenged internet domain names and a hollywood movie all for borrowing the motorcycle club s name and insignias the defendants have been large , wellknown corporations like toys r us , alexander mcqueen , amazon , saks , zappos , walt disney and marvel comics and they have included a rapper s clothing company , dillard s and a teenage girl who was selling embroidered patches on ebay with a design resembling the group s death head logo the hells angels remain etched in the popular imagination as sullen , heavily muscled men in leather vests who glare from behind raised handlebars , ready to take on anyone who crosses them rebels with no particular cause but their own form of ritualized brotherhood but over the years , the group collectively made a leap from image to brand , becoming a recognizable marque and promoting itself on items as varied as tshirts , coffee mugs and women s yoga pants sonny barger , 75 , the longtime hells angels leader , at times has offered his own online bazaar of goods that bear his name sunglasses , bottles of cabernet sauvignon and books he has written with more to sell and more to protect , the hells angels' turn toward the litigious comes with a twist the bikers are increasingly calling on the same legal system they deride as part of the machinery that has unfairly defined them as criminals in fact , they have become more conscious of protecting their image from misuse even as law enforcement officials have cracked down on the hells angels , saying they represent a criminal gang on six continents , trafficking drugs and guns and engaging in money laundering , extortion and mortgage fraud these conflicting portraits biker club versus biker mafia took shape in numerous interviews with hells angels members , defense lawyers , prosecutors and federal agents and in a wide review of legal filings and internal hells angels documents the group s less confrontational side has emerged as its aging membership has been refreshed by new members from a historically familiar source recent military veterans and as motorcycling in general has risen in popularity across the country we stabbed and slabbed people left and right in the day , but that way is less common now , said richard mora , known as chico , a hells angels member in the phoenix chapter even so , 65 years after the hells angels was founded in fontana , calif , it still exists as a uniquely american subculture of hardened individualism , fierce fraternity and contempt for society s mores in its rulebound world , only full members are permitted to wear the provocative death shead patch or the two words of the club s name , which , like the logo , is trademarked by the organization separately , the group sells socalled support merchandise to the public on club websites and at hells angels parties and charity events recently the club opened a retail store in toronto designations such as 81 \( h and a are the eighth and first letters of the alphabet \) and big red machine \( hells angels' colors are red and white \) are on an array of goods , including tshirts \( children s sizes available \) , beanies , tank tops , bikinis , underwear , pins , cigars , key chains , window decals and calendars the bikers generally settle their lawsuits on favorable terms , extracting concessions from the accused parties by getting them to stop using the trademarks , destroy and recall merchandise and , in a few instances , pay some damages united in merchandising , and litigiousness , the hells angels nevertheless say that they remain a club defined by decentralization , with each chapter operating as its own entity but law enforcement officials contend the group functions in a more cohesive , structured way policing the hells angels and other likeminded motorcycle groups is largely the domain of the  in my experience working street and motorcycle gangs , the hells angels operate like a criminal organization with a global infrastructure and a lot of money they can generate from members worldwide , said john ciccone , a special agent for the atf in los angeles who has worked on gangs for more than two decades he added if you go up against the hells angels to prove they are a racketeering enterprise , they do have the resources to fight tooth and nail and all the way to the end you do not usually see those dynamics in street gangs like the crips and bloods mr clapp s first case for the hells angels was a 1992 lawsuit against marvel comics , which had named a comic book and its lead character hell s angel the company changed the name to dark angel and agreed to donate 35 , 000 to a children s charity safeguarding the club s trademarks has been mr clapp s job ever since he is counsel for the hells angels motorcycle corporation , a nonprofit established in california in 1970 that owns and protects the club s intellectual property the corporation , which has board members , is controlled by the hundreds of chapters that make up the hells angels club part of the strategy is to bring shockandawe cases and to shine a bright light on them in federal court and the media , said mr clapp , who graduated from the mcgeorge school of law in sacramento the intent is not just to punish the infringers but to educate the public that the hells angels marques are well guarded and not generic and that they must not be infringed upon in the united states , the corporation has 18 trademark registrations covering the use of seven different marques , including a halfdozen or so variations of the death shead icon , and additional trademark registrations in more than a dozen other countries mr clapp s sparse bears the description lawyer from hell in a brief video , he leans into the camera sporting his mohawk , sunglasses , jeans and a black tshirt with the word acid on it , a reference , he recently noted , to the brand of cigars with that name and not to lsd mr clapp , a former bikerrights lobbyist who for years has been close to mr barger , rides a motorcycle but is not a hells angel he lives in a motor home and moves around the west , depending on where his legal work takes him lawyers who have defended clients sued by the hells angels say mr clapp s manner hardly resembles the brutishness many associate with the club initially , we were not sure whether we had to worry for our safety , said kevin drucker , a lawyer who represented headgear inc , which was sued in 2008 over tshirts bearing the hells angels name but the impression i was left with was that when they litigate , they do so civilly this changed the way i thought about them that case was eventually settled soon after targeting headgear , the hells angels sued a new york clothing business called company 81 , alleging that use of the number 81 on its products was an infringement we were trying to enter into a coexistence agreement with the hells angels , said daniel bellizio , a new york intellectual property lawyer who was the company s general counsel our customer base and the channels of distribution were very distinct , and there was little likelihood of consumers confusing the brands although the hells angels eventually stopped responding in the case , a 65page sworn deposition taken by another lawyer for company 81 illustrated mr barger s views on merchandising well , i do n't want to sound pigheaded , but there s a million people out there that want to make a dollar off of the name hells angels and the emblem hells angels , and we try to stop them , mr barger said he explains that the hells angels are so protective about their membership marks that members must sign a document stipulating that anything with the club name or symbols belongs to the corporation and not to them it s on loan to them while they 're a member , he said and if they ever leave the club , it all has to be turned back in asked about the number 81 , mr barger said , we do n't let anybody use it but us he added , eightyone is hells angels he said if he encountered someone wearing clothing with an unofficial 81 , he would wrest it from the person on the spot i would n't ask them , i 'd take it later in the deposition , he said i would say , why do you have that \? ' and he would probably say , i support 81' and i would say , that is n't an 81 shirt' and then i would say , look , we can do this two ways you can give me the shirt and i 'll give you a legitimate one' or if the guy says , hey , none of your business where i got it , ' mr barger continued , i 'd beat him up and take it the squat red and white building , with a large death shead and the words hells angels motorcycle club emblazoned on the side , sits on a quiet street on the fringes of downtown phoenix , fenced off from nearby public housing and some bail bond offices this is the phoenix chapter inside , about 10 hells angels mill around a long bar , sipping drinks and laying out food for their regular , highly secretive meeting , known as church with its patchwork of memorabilia , the clubhouse resembles a hells angels museum the death shead is plastered on cushions and light shades there is a stripper pole in the front room and slot machines in the back hells angels slogans and photos cover the walls in the yard , 81 is spray painted on a rusted garbage can next to a highway 81 sign at 6 feet 2 inches tall , weighing about 350 pounds with long , stringy hair , mr mora is a longtime phoenix hells angel the new members are younger , smarter and savvier , and they have better bikes , said mr mora , a construction worker in his mid60s who many years ago served time in prison for murder they are better at reading the streets , seeing our enemies and spotting patterns and changes they are also more cleancut the justice department website says the hells angels have a total of 2 , 000 to 2 , 500 members in around 230 chapters in the united states and 26 other countries the department says more than 90 of those chapters , with over 800 members total , are in the united states the true reach of the club globally , though , is unclear the main hells angels website lists about 425 chapters in more than 45 countries while hells angels members and those in rival biker clubs have tended to hold down bluecollar jobs , the newer generation is more eclectic , with careers and families , a contrast to the riders in the '60s and '70s who seemed wayward and singularly devoted to the club today s bike clubs include men pushing 70 and newer members in their 30s some work in motorcycle repair shops or tattoo parlors , but others have less stereotypical jobs eye doctor , chef , accountant , master s student in thermal dynamics , lawyer , military contractor and high school football coach whatever their generation , the hells angels are bound together as renegades , if not outlaws mike koepke , 32 , a newer member and president of the yavapai county chapter in arizona , said , being a hells angel is a stressful lifestyle because we have people coming at us from all angles , but who would n't want to be that rebel \? he says that riding with his brothers can be transcendent my first religious , zenlike experience was in 2007 riding back from montana , recalled mr koepke , who is the father of a young son and an emt studying to be a paramedic it was as though hands were pushing the rain aside so i could get to my destination it was a spiritual moment andres ospina , 33 , known as oz , who fought with the marines in iraq , is another recent addition to the hells angels in arizona he has struggled with posttraumatic stress and depression , but said he found solace in the camaraderie of the club , which he likened to going back to your platoon , your safe place i credit the club with saving my life , said mr ospina , who receives disability benefits from the military i had two choices i could have become antisocial and locked myself in an apartment and cried about things that upset me , or i could be social with people who are likeminded clutching his hells angels vest , mr ospina , a father of two , said in a sense , this is my armor now it keeps people away i am literally fighting for my own right to be who i want to be , and to be left alone in black canyon city , ariz , howie weisbrod , 65 , a member of the cave creek chapter , was helping with security at a bar where some 100 hells angels in club vests and jackets mingled at a celebration in honor of mr barger mr weisbrod , a burly brooklyn native , said law enforcement is obsessed with us because we are the hells angels motorcycle club and a visible target , adding they see us as some kind of symbol they think that by controlling us they can control the other clubs but that ai n't true a hells angel for four decades , he has had his encounters with law enforcement , having spent about 10 years in federal prison on a drugs and weapons conviction what he calls an obsession , law enforcement views as a necessity state and federal agents reject the notion that the hells angels and some rival bikers clubs are merely hangouts for antisocial tough guys instead , they say , hells angels chapters are dens that forge dangerous criminal conspiracies mr weisbrod and other hells angels acknowledge that federal and state gang enhancement laws , which can significantly lengthen prison sentences , have been a deterrent to more criminality in late 2009 , a jury in phoenix convicted a member named nathaniel sample of two felonies and determined that the hells angels were a gang mr sample , convicted of aggravated assault and assisting a criminal street gang , was sentenced to about eight years , a term that is largely the result of the gang charge since 2002 , there have been about a halfdozen cases in ventura county , calif , in which juries have convicted members for being part of a street gang in the same period , a similar number of hells angels have pleaded guilty and admitted to belonging to a gang derek malan , a senior deputy district attorney in the county , said those convictions had hobbled the club s chapter there the national prominence of the club in ventura is done , he said there have been more convictions in that chapter than in any other hells angels chapter in california the visibility of the ventura chapter has also been diminished since the departure about two years ago of its longtime president , george christie jr , a gregarious man who had been a spokesman for the hells angels mr christie , 66 , who owned a tattoo shop , the ink house , in ventura and has a consulting business to help felons handle incarceration , was probably the bestknown hells angel after mr barger some say that he displeased the organization by , among other things , recruiting local surfers from gangs to increase his chapter s sagging membership numbers the recruits , seen riding around in flipflops or tennis shoes and shorts , were not considered worthy of being hells angels by some other members i gave the club a shot in the arm to keep it on the cutting edge of the motorcycle club culture , mr christie , who led the chapter from 1978 to 2011 , said this year my thinking was that if we did n't bend , we would break and , in doing so , we would be helping law enforcement by becoming extinct in 2011 , mr christie , who had served two prison terms of about a year each , was indicted on federal charges stemming from an extortion plot and the firebombing of two competing tattoo parlors in 2007 he faced a statutory maximum of 120 years in prison but the prosecution and his lawyer struck a deal he recently started serving a third prison term , 10 months mr christie takes issue with law enforcement s position that organizations like the hells angels are gangs that operate as underworld criminal enterprises i am not foolish enough to say that crimes have not been committed , but there is no nexus between all of them or many of them , he said in 2011 , the state department and the department of homeland security added the hells angels and other motorcycle clubs to a list of criminal organizations that includes the mafia , the chinese triads and the yakuza , the japanese syndicate this classification has made it harder for foreign members of these groups to enter the united states for bike runs and other club events a recent case that epitomizes , for federal authorities , why they designate some motorcycle clubs as criminal organizations is one against the hells angels in the south carolina city of rock hill , a suburb of charlotte , nc in june 2012 , 20 members , prospects and associates of the club s rock hell city nomad chapter were arrested on a 91count federal racketeering indictment based on wiretaps , surveillance , video recordings , controlled buys and a paid informant the charges encompassed a range of illicit activity drug distribution , trafficking of firearms and stolen goods , prostitution , arson , robbery and other violence , extortion and money laundering sixteen of the defendants were convicted of crimes related to a racketeering conspiracy a dozen of them reached plea deals , including the chapter s vice president , daniel bifield , known as diamond dan he was sentenced to 17 years in federal prison the way they got away with it for a while is that the hells angels are such insular groups and they use code in such a sophisticated and elusive manner , jay n richardson , the assistant united states attorney who prosecuted the case , said in an interview replacing chrome' on a motorcycle , for instance , refers to both legitimate business purposes and illicit ones one thing that has not changed is that the hells angels remain the top name of the outlaw motorcycle constellation its members are regarded as more sophisticated and loyal than those of other biker groups , and the process for gaining membership is believed to be the most arduous , making it the toughest one for law enforcement officials to infiltrate the hells angels do n't recruit , said troy regas , president of the club s nevada nomads chapter the hells angels is one of the top trademarks in the world it is like harley davidson but agents have persisted and , stung by infiltrations , biker groups now do exhaustive background checks on prospective members and will enlist private investigators the clubs administer liedetector tests and require completion of detailed applications and even references from prison inmates and even when law enforcement gets the upper hand , the hells angels fight back in court , sometimes using prominent lawyers who have represented such figures as martha stewart , leonardo dicaprio and shaquille o'neal in 2010 , seven members in arizona were arrested after a shootout with the vagos , a rival biker group , in a rural neighborhood of the town of chino valley more than 50 rounds were fired , injuring a handful of bikers that november , a state judge , ruling in favor of the defense , threw out a grand jury indictment that named five hells angels and contained charges that included attempted murder and participation in a criminal street gang conviction would have brought sentences decades long richard gaxiola , a phoenix lawyer for the hells angels , argued that a detective had misled the grand jury and violated his clients' constitutional rights by portraying the vagos as family oriented while vilifying the hells angels the next month , a fresh indictment was returned , and two other hells angels had been added but mr gaxiola soon uncovered an even bigger problem with the prosecution s tactics that prompted him to seek a dismissal of the entire case the detective and the lead prosecutor had failed to disclose that their key witness was a paid informant within the vagos who previously had tried to associate with the hells angels but had been shunned a new judge sided with the defense by tossing out the case in june 2012 , saying the defendants' due process rights had been violated , and concluding that the prosecution had been negligent we were able to level the playing field , which is crucial because when it comes to the hells angels in the justice system , their constitutional rights are under assault at every step , mr gaxiola said
london europeans , who prided themselves on a muscular foreign policy in libya , arrive at this week s meeting of the group of 20 nations deflated and divided , waiting for the united states to take the lead on syria and wondering just how much resistance to intervention russia will ultimately muster after his parliamentary defeat last week , prime minister david cameron of britain has lost much of his leverage to address the syrian conflict , analysts said , while france s president , fran ois hollande , is struggling to persuade a skeptical public of the need for military strikes against syria after what is suspected to be its use of chemical weapons that makes the twoday summit meeting , which begins thursday , the site for a potential standoff between the russian president , vladimir v putin the host of the gathering in st petersburg and a prominent ally of the syrian leader , president bashar alassad and president obama , with the europeans largely on the sidelines indeed , analysts said , the british parliament s rebuff of mr cameron , by rejecting his call for a response to the attacks , ended a period of foreign policy leadership by europe s two defense powers , britain and france it also provoked a kind of existential crisis , particularly for britain , which prides itself on its special relationship with washington it is a reversal from the recent past , when an activist foreign policy worked well for the british and french leaders a successful military campaign in libya in 2011 helped mr cameron , and mr hollande gained popularity more recently after a military intervention in mali similarly , on syria , the two nations had played the role of interventionist outriders to a cautious american president but mr cameron s parliamentary defeat has left him diminished , and that activism is in doubt , said mark leonard , director of the european council on foreign relations that defeat now threatens to undo a dynamic that had defined the frenchbritish position within the european union and farther abroad in the european context , as germany becomes the allpowerful economic player , the only way for britain and france to exert their influence is through foreign policy and defense , mr leonard said they had been slightly clinging to each other to show that they still count in a world in which germany is economically dominant now , the prospect of britain s loss of its traditional role as the closest defense partner of the united states has left policy makers in london nervous , particularly after secretary of state john kerry pointedly praised france as his country s oldest ally people are very jittery about the precedent it sets and what it means , said one british official , speaking on the condition of anonymity under government regulations , while adding that it was too soon to draw decisive conclusions about the implications for britain s role in future military operations some british politicians have sought unsuccessfully to reopen the option of taking part in military action in syria if the situation changes , and in parliament on wednesday , mr cameron put his best gloss on the situation , arguing that britain could still play a role britain has a very proud record on humanitarian aid , not just in this conflict but in many previous conflicts , mr cameron told lawmakers in this one we are actually the secondlargest aid donor that there has been we have spent over 400 million i accept that britain can t be part , and won t be part , of any military action on that front , he added , but we must not , in any degree , give up our revulsion at the chemical weapons attacks we have seen and we must press this point in every forum of which we are a member on tuesday , mr cameron s spokesman pointed out that the group of 20 summit meeting was predominantly an economic forum but insisted that the prime minister would play a full role in all discussions , including those on syria , and would continue to press the case for a political transition in damascus , the syrian capital yet one official conceded privately that mr cameron s position in st petersburg would be pretty tough syria will probably come up for debate on friday morning , and mr putin may relish british discomfort at the parliamentary rebuff , added the official , who , like others , spoke on the condition of anonymity under government regulations for mr cameron , personally , the embarrassment is acute when leaders of the group of 8 of nations met by a lake in northern ireland in june , none was more hawkish on syria than the british prime minister , who denounced mr assad as a man with blood on his hands during the discussions , which he hosted , mr cameron sought unsuccessfully to put pressure on mr putin to abandon mr assad now , with his parliamentary defeat , mr cameron s powers of persuasion are likely to be further reduced

by the time reached his mid40s at the beginning of the 20th century , he had long been saluted as the best society portrait painter of the gilded age but he was having a midlife career crisis he was a darling of established critics , but to upandcoming artists , he seemed oldfashioned around 1900 , he put down his oils and turned to watercolors , capturing landscapes , gardens , exotic locales , and people at leisure , at work and at rest , often on his travels in europe and the middle east experimenting with unusual compositions and new techniques , he reinvented himself aesthetically sargent never did convince modernist artists that he was one of them but the curators at the two museums that bought many of those works a century ago are hoping for a different outcome when john singer sargent watercolors goes on view , first at the on april 5 , then at the museum of fine arts in boston on oct 13 the exhibition brings together 93 of sargent s best watercolors from 190212 for the first time these were years when he was very experimental , said teresa a carbone , the curator of american art at the brooklyn sargent was living in london , where watercolors were highly prized his , though , were different from those of british watercolorists more gestural , for one thing , and mystifying for their use of opaque watercolors at a time when they were typically translucent the lush results are not only very beautiful , ms carbone said , but also innovative in ways that are just now being appreciated even by her and erica e hirshler , senior curator of american paintings at the boston museum , who collaborated on the exhibition ms carbone planted the seed for the show in 2008 , with an email to ms hirshler we were besieged by requests for loans of the sargent watercolors , and i thought we ought to think about what we wanted to do with them ourselves , ms carbone said her first thought was , why not unite the two collections \? ms hirshler agreed then it became more interesting , ms hirshler said , as the two curators began their research among the things they discovered was that these works represented sargent s own vision of himself as a watercolorist at a very important moment as such , they were far from tangential to his career sargent , an obsessive traveler in the words of ms carbone , would sit with his brushes and watercolors on his journeys , capturing the scenes before him , often from odd angles low in a venetian gondola , for example he made dozens and dozens of images , many in a series , intending to keep them himself when he allowed some to be exhibited in london in 1903 , 1905 and 1908 , they elicited mostly good reviews but they were never for sale then , in 1908 , his friend , the boston artist edward darley boit whose family was the subject of sargent s renowned 1882 painting the daughters of edward darley boit wrote to him boit proposed a joint exhibition at the knoedler company gallery in new york sargent eventually agreed , probably to help his old friend s career as ms hirshler recounts in her essay for the exhibition catalog , he wrote to boit that sketches from nature give me pleasure to do pleasure to keep more than the small amount of money that one could ask for them he did not want to be bothered by repeated requests to see them relenting slightly , sargent raised a possibility i really do not care to sell them at any rate not piecemeal if by any chance some eastern museum , or some eastern collector wanted to buy the whole lot en bloc , i might consider it his watercolors , he declared , only amount to anything when taken as a lot together sargent selected 86 watercolors and packed them off to new york , where they drew glowing reviews and crowds of viewers knoedler , aware of the artist s wishes , contacted museums in hopes of making a sale the brooklyn museum quickly made an offer for 83 of the watercolors \( three were truly not for sale \) sargent hesitated , wondering if boston , where he had more patrons and closer ties , was interested boit and his brother called the museum of fine arts there , but its bid came too late and was smaller brooklyn won the trove for 20 , 000 \( about 500 , 000 in today s dollars \) soon boit proposed another joint exhibition , and sargent agreed the date was set for 1912 this time , the boston museum raised its hand early in the preparation for the exhibition , and before the opening it bought 45 watercolors for about 10 , 800 as visitors to john singer sargent watercolors will see , the two collections are very different brooklyn s works are mostly smaller , freer , more expressive almost none are signed knowing that his next works would land in boston , sargent made them larger and more finished , and signed them they are all just a delight , ms carbone said we do n't tire of looking at them , and people will experience that when they come some of the subjects have pictorial depth , but not a lot it s all about sargent s immersion in the process they are all spontaneous , she added , but it s also clear that sargent worked the sheets very aggressively there are nuances , shifts in technique many , like in a medici villa , from 1906 , show sargent as a master of reflected light some , like a series portraying the marble quarries above carrara , border on the abstract what he did n't paint is often as interesting as what he did one of sargent s favorites , bedouins , from 19056 , was shown and critically acclaimed twice in london before he sent it to new york it shows two tribesmen , with faces sharply rendered their garments are suggested as if the watercolors dissolved some are reminiscent of his oils the cashmere shawl , from about 1911 , is one it depicts a woman in a white dress and patterned shawl , an example of his use of the wax resist technique , which left some spaces perfectly white it s a phenomenal work , ms carbone said it s close to his regular portrait practice , but the whole sheet is executed all the way to the edges it s freer in brooklyn , the museum engaged a watercolorist to demonstrate six of sargent s watercolor techniques , including wax resist and scraping , in videos that will be shown on small monitors in the galleries as they view these works , visitors will see , as many contemporaries did , that far from stagnating , sargent was innovating in his watercolors yet it s easy to understand why appreciation of them faded by 1910 , abstract art was budding in europe and america a year after sargent s second exhibition at knoedler , the momentous 1913 armory show in new york took place , changing everything in the art world his modernism becomes oldfashioned very quickly , said ms hirshler sargent s reputation declined , and it was n't until the 1950s that his oils came back into favor now , perhaps , is the time for his watercolors to regain their renown

miami caught in the baseball vortex that had vaporized their offense and drained their confidence , the searched for an escape route before tuesday s game at marlins park some of the players spent additional time analyzing video some took extra cuts in the batting cage others simply stuck to routine , hopeful that this would be the night they unearthed the ability to score a couple of runs , maybe more in recent days , though , that most fundamental skill had become the baseball equivalent of quantum physics for this toughluck team difficult , if not impossible staying true to form , the mets were as ineffectual as ever tuesday , cobbling together four hits against one of baseball s worst teams but considering the many ways the mets have managed to engineer lategame meltdowns , their loss to the was one of their cruelest in recent memory the marlins scored twice in the bottom of the ninth , winning when juan pierre came across on a wild pitch delivered by mets reliever brandon lyon it was the mets' sixth straight loss , each more demoralizing than the last they also wasted yet another quality start , this time from the righthander jeremy hefner , who allowed four hits and one earned run in eight innings it was not good enough i wish i could have finished it off , said hefner , whose record fell to 03 they got a run for me , and that s my responsibility to go out there and finish the game off it speaks volumes for the mets' inadequacies at the plate that scoring one run is considered something of a luxury over their last six games , the mets have produced 11 runs while hitting for a 165 average \( 34 for 206 \) they are even worse with runners in scoring position , hitting 098 \( 4 for 41 \) on tuesday , they were 0 for 3 offensively , we have to find a way , third baseman david wright said it seems like the better teams , they go through a rut like this , it only lasts a series or two we ca n't allow it to consume us and allow it take over for one week , two weeks we have to snap out of it hefner was the caretaker of a 10 lead heading into the bottom of the ninth , and then it all fell apart leading off , the marlins' chris coghlan was able to work a 31 count coghlan does not like to see much movement , hefner said , so he tried to throw him a sinker with plenty of break the pitch stayed up , and coghlan sent a soft line drive to left field for a single he put a good swing on it , hefner said it just happened in the wrong part of the game after coghlan advanced to second on a passed ball that skipped by catcher anthony recker , pierre dropped a sacrifice bunt that recker fielded in front of the plate instead of throwing to first for the sure out , recker tried to get coghlan at third the throw was high the play was close it appeared that coghlan may have come off the bag , and manager terry collins left the dugout to argue with the thirdbase umpire tim mcclelland but coghlan was called safe i tried to make a play i should n't have tried to make , recker said , adding i just need to get an out with runners at first and third , collins opted to remove hefner but instead of calling on closer bobby parnell , who had pitched in the last two games , collins summoned lyon collins said parnell was not pleased , but he wants to be exceedingly careful with parnell after he experienced elbow soreness last season lyon promptly allowed a bloop single to donovan solano , which scored coghlan after lyon intentionally walked placido polanco to load the bases , he uncorked a wild pitch on his first offering to greg dobbs that allowed pierre to score the winning run from third the mets had been hoping to bounce back from monday s 43 loss in the series opener , a 15inning marathon that featured 5 hours 31 minutes of listless offense they had 11 hits in 54 atbats given their recent troubles , that counted as an onslaught on tuesday , hefner struck out eight and walked none he was matched pitch for pitch by the marlins' kevin slowey , who allowed four hits and one run in eight innings recker accounted for the mets' lone run with a sacrifice fly in the fifth inning hef pitched an unbelievable game , recker said he did n't deserve this
it s that time of year the long weekend when we gather with friends and family to celebrate hot dogs , potato salad and , yes , the founding of our nation and it s also a time for some of us to wax a bit philosophical , to wonder what , exactly , we 're celebrating is america in 2013 , in any meaningful sense , the same country that declared independence in 1776 \? the answer , i 'd suggest , is yes despite everything , there is a thread of continuity in our national identity reflected in institutions , ideas and , especially , in attitude that remains unbroken above all , we are still , at root , a nation that believes in democracy , even if we do n't always act on that belief and that s a remarkable thing when you bear in mind just how much the country has changed america in 1776 was a rural land , mainly composed of small farmers and , in the south , somewhat bigger farmers with slaves and the free population consisted of , well , wasps almost all came from northwestern europe ,  america today is nothing like that , even though some politicians think sarah palin like to talk as if the real america is still white , protestant , and rural or smalltown but the real america is , in fact , a nation of metropolitan areas , not small towns tellingly , even in 2008 she did so in greensboro , nc , which may not be in the northeast corridor but with a metropolitan population of more than 700 , 000 is hardly mayberry in fact , twothirds of americans live in metro areas with halfamillion or more residents nor , by the way , are most of us living in leafy suburbs america as a whole has only 87 people per square mile , but the average american , , lives in a census tract with more than 5 , 000 people per square mile for all the bashing of the northeast corridor as being somehow unamerican , this means that the typical american lives in an environment that resembles greater boston or greater philadelphia more than it resembles greensboro , let alone true small towns what do we do in these dense metropolitan areas \? almost none of us are farmers few of us hunt by and large , we sit in cubicles on weekdays and visit shopping malls on our days off and ethnically we are , of course , very different from the founders only a minority of today s americans are descended from the wasps and slaves of 1776 the rest are the descendants of successive waves of immigration first from ireland and germany , then from southern and eastern europe , now from latin america and asia we 're no longer an anglosaxon nation we 're and we 're increasingly nonwhite yet i would maintain that we are still the same country that declared independence all those years ago it s not just that we have maintained continuity of legal government , although that s not a small thing the current government of france is , strictly speaking , we had our antimonarchical revolution first , yet we 're still on republic no 1 , which actually makes our government one of the oldest in the world more important , however , is the enduring hold on our nation of the democratic ideal , the notion that all men are created equal all men , not just men from certain ethnic groups or from aristocratic families and to this day or so it seems to me , and i 've done a lot of traveling in my time america remains uniquely democratic in its mannerisms , in the way people from different classes interact of course , our democratic ideal has always been accompanied by enormous hypocrisy , starting with the many founding fathers who espoused the rights of man , then went back to enjoying the fruits of slave labor today s america is a place where everyone claims to support equality of opportunity , yet we are , objectively , in the western world the country where children of the wealthy are most likely to inherit their parents' status it s also a place where everyone celebrates the right to vote , yet many politicians work hard to disenfranchise the poor and nonwhite but that very hypocrisy is , in a way , a good sign the wealthy may defend their privileges , but given the temper of america , they have to pretend that they 're doing no such thing the blockthevote people know what they 're doing , but they also know that they must n't say it in so many words in effect , both groups know that the nation will view them as unamerican unless they pay at least lip service to democratic ideals and in that fact lies the hope of redemption so , yes , we are still , in a deep sense , the nation that declared independence and , more important , declared that all men have rights let s all raise our hot dogs in salute
the statement is mild compared with more controversial documents like charter 08 , the brainchild of the imprisoned nobel peace laureate liu xiaobo the consensus simply states the hope that china will remain committed to pluralism , as well as fairness and justice in the political realm the full text is posted here  the signatories include some of the country s most prominent scholars and writers who publish and speak out on social issues , like cheng ming , a leading neoconfucian the christian sociologist he guanghu the new left film critic l xinyu and the liberal philosopher xu youyu the statement has not been widely reported in china , although a long feature appeared in the influential newspaper southern people , or nanfang renwu , a sign perhaps that the initiative has not completely run afoul of the government s continuing tightening of public discussion one of the participants was yang fenggang , a christian and a pioneer in the study of the sociology of religion in china mr yang is a professor of sociology at purdue university and director of its center on religion and chinese society , one of the most influential institutions studying religion in china , regularly hosting conferences and academic exchanges i recently spoke with mr yang about the consensus and its meaning for public debate in china how did this get started \? the founder is a wenzhou christian named wang wenfeng he went to a seminary in singapore , and that s where he started the forum the first three were there and were just about christian theology the fourth was in south korea , and the previous one , the fifth , included neoconfucians but this time they pulled in the new left and liberal groups , too in the west , this might be unremarkable a group of intellectuals meet and issue a statement what s the significance \? i think it is severalfold the new left and the liberals , those public intellectuals have stopped talking to each other when they get an invitation , one of the first questions is , who else have you invited \? if the invited people include those from the other camp , they won t participate it got to that level of tension but this time , they willingly sat together for three full days is this because it s abroad \? well , on the surface , oxford is attractive no matter which camp you re in , if it s oxford , it s prestigious also the organizer , wang wenfeng , is really humble he never got into disputes with any of them that persuaded many in china , these political labels have different meanings than in the west how would you define new left and liberal \? it s hard the new left , in my view , is different from the old left or the maoists the new left made clear that they don t like to be called leftists but they like to be called xinzuoyi , the left wing many ideas and terms are borrowed from the left in the west they are critical of capitalism , imperialism , globalization this is where they draw their theory , rather than the old marxist , leninist or maoist theory but every conversation they ll turn to it being the fault of the us growing inequality , people losing houses they ll say it s because of capitalism from the us and the liberals , which some people call the right \? they have classic liberal ideas free markets , individual rights , constitutionalism but , interestingly , there are some closer to the left these people began to say things like in the chinese situation , we need a stronger government only a stronger government will make things happen i d say there s a new reshuffling of the camps i personally came out of the meeting thinking there were only two camps there are people who advocate a bigger role of the state and those who argue for individual rights so i think statism and individual rights is a bigger division so the four camps may not make as much sense i can think of people from the liberals who speak for the need of a stronger state neoconfucians , most of them , argue for that , and even christian scholars like liu xiaofeng have become strong advocates for a stronger state so all these people could sit together and talk yes , we managed to come up with this public statement even though there s nothing big in it , that these four camps could form a consensus , that itself is important people in china talk about the country being torn apart , that s how bitter the camps are but here they can talk about it and start with what we have in common and then see what our differences are i think this is needed in chinese society at this point the four points of consensus take into account the concerns of the left , the liberals , the confucians and scholars of christianity even though the language , everyone had to compromise nonetheless , you can see it expressed their views we had very interesting debates during the evenings but there was this trust , and some people said , it s ok , i trust you to formulate the language there was this feeling that they had to move forward and agree or else the country could be torn apart the choice is interesting you have christians or scholars of christianity , but no representatives of traditional religions such as daoism and buddhism is there a lack of scholars in those areas \? the main idea was , who are the public intellectuals \? those who have a public voice in china when you think of it , there are almost no buddhist or daoist public intellectuals on weibo i follow a lot of buddhist monks , fashi almost none talk about public issues or concerns why do you think that is \? are they coopted by the government because they get more benefits from the government for example in temple reconstruction , soft loans and so on \? certainly i think that s an issue they comply more to the government s viewpoint but also i think they may not be equipped to be part of this public debate active public intellectuals today are not only collegetrained but have graduate degrees but you ll find few of them in buddhism and daoism this gets me thinking there isn t much interfaith dialogue in china you almost never see religious groups getting together to meet it is like the party s view is , if there s a problem , tell us , and we ll solve it , but don t you guys start talking about it because it might develop into something independent , and we don t want that that s something that came up in the discussions there was a feeling that as long as we come up with something , it s meaningful we don t know how the authorities will react , but at least we can show that we can work together this group of people have the concern that the authorities may simply go their own way without taking any input when we sat together we were conscious of this it s interesting that christians were included of course , it started as a christian theological forum , but the participants from the other groups evidently felt it was appropriate to be talking to christians and scholars of christianity the government sometimes views christianity as a foreign religion and less favorably than other religions a few years ago someone published a book which listed the main groups in china it included the traditional left , social democrats , socialism with chinese characteristics , plus some newer groups but no christians you could ignore christianity because it had no social impact but now christians are part of the discussion i see this as an introduction of christian scholars to the public forum but wasn t there the cultural christian movement a decade ago \? what they did was to introduce christianity as a cultural phenomenon and a cultural resource , but not to express social or political concerns it was cultural theology , history and the arts but this time it s about expressing social and political concerns , like rule of law and that power should come from the people , equality , justice a key christian contribution to this debate is the idea that rights are godgiven and not stategiven , meaning a state or government can t take them away as it pleases was this brought up \? yes , definitely an interesting case is he guanghu he signed charter 08 he was the only scholar who studies religion who was among the initial signers since then he has been more public in making his position known his christian faith has become publicly known for many years he tried not to say anything about it , but now he feels confident to be out when we talk about public intellectuals , how do you define that in china \? public space is limited in china , and westerners often see it just in terms of weibo how do these intellectuals participate in public life \? weibo is one those who aren t on weibo participate in other ways they get invitations to give talks , sometimes appear on television , or write articles to newspapers and magazines and especially they participate in conferences interestingly , in china , the media pay attention to conferences if a conference like this one here were in the west , journalists wouldn t care about these sorts of things but in china the media report on them conferences become platforms for people to express their concerns , and their voices can be heard what is the next phase \? will you meet again \? they hope to hold another one , perhaps in brazil , to put china in a global context i think they hope to invite people from all four camps , but this consensus is thin , delicate it depends how people react this is not like charter 08 or anything like that the language is very toned down even the old left can t really object i think the government will not be able to say much about it maybe in the future it s not necessary to have a consensus , but just a platform to discuss topics people should have different viewpoints , because no country has just one viewpoint , one consensus the key is that people are expressing themselves in a polite , constructive way that s my thinking , too in the future we could have real debate we did have some debates and some interesting moments , but the general tone was most people felt this was hard to achieve and let s maintain good relationships , rather than pushing one s views too hard so they want to start with this , but a healthy way is to have genuine debate , to show the differences not emotional and sentimental , but to make good arguments if that happens , it would be great hopefully this is the beginning for that
kiev , ukraine they are not sleeping in tents in independence square , but ukraine s ultrawealthy businessmen , known as the oligarchs , perhaps pose as grave a threat to president viktor f yanukovich as the demonstrators on the streets of this capital city do you think there is a big difference between people on the street and people with big business \? said the most visible , and the most prowestern , of the oligarchs , petro poroshenko , a shipping , confectionery and agriculture magnate whose television station has been broadcasting round the clock from independence square there is no difference in their love of their own country , he said in an interview in the lobby of the ukraine hotel , overlooking the square , where the protesters appeared as miniature silent figures , waving flags and milling about bonfires at the end of the day , we are all talking about the modernization of the economy and the country protesters may be occupying government buildings and staging loud rallies calling for the government to step down , but behind the scenes an equally fierce and perhaps more decisive tug of war is being waged among a very small and very rich group of oligarchical clans here , some of whom see their future with europe and others with russia that conflict was ignited , along with the street protests , by mr yanukovich s decision to halt free trade talks with the european union last week like other tycoons scattered throughout postsoviet countries , ukraine s rich capitalized on the flawed privatization of publicly held assets to establish enormous fortunes , presiding over news media , banking , telecommunications , steel , coal and heavy industry empires but in contrast to russia , where president vladimir v putin has barred the oligarchs from politics , ukraine s wealthy clans retain enormous influence , acting as a shadow cabinet with identifiable factions in parliament mr poroshenko is himself a member of parliament their political stances tend to align with their places in the economy , with the more established families favoring integration with the west and a newer group analysts say rapacious around mr yanukovich s son favoring the kremlin in this battle of the titans , the street becomes a weapon , but only one of many and then looming over all the political battles is an imminent financial crisis ukraine , shut out of world markets and facing a yawning budget deficit , will need a cash infusion of around 18 billion by march to avoid default and an economic crisis with unknown but presumably dire consequences the warring camps of oligarchs have distinctly divergent interests that dictate how they approach both relations with europe and the financial crisis on one side you have businessmen like mr poroshenko , whose fortune was he is typical of the older money here , people interested more in marketing their assets , whether through initial public offerings or attracting international partners , than grabbing quick profits they were hoping that an affiliation with the european union and its more stringent protections of property rights would protect their interests they are also more open to a proposed loan from the that would require a reduction in government energy subsidies and structural overhauls , including revamping the judiciary mr poroshenko has been joined by victor pinchuk , the billionaire soninlaw of a former president , leonid kuchma , who on wednesday joined several former ukrainian presidents in signing a letter of support for the demonstrations ukraine s wealthiest man , rinat akhmetov , is usually seen as a staunch backer of mr yanukovich but mr akhmetov s company , system capital management , issued a largely neutral statement saying ukraine should seek integration with both russia and europe the trade deal with europe , mr poroshenko said , is a way to modernize the country , to fight corruption , the way to have a fair court , freedom of press , democracy modernization of the country is possible , he said and unfortunately , by not signing , somebody is stealing the hope of the people , the wealthy included on the other side is a group around mr yanukovich , a coterie of secretive oligarchs , many with longstanding , close business interests in russia , and none with a particularly strong interest in good governance , opposition politicians say we do n't expect any of them to come to our side , yuri levchenko , an official with the nationalist svoboda party , said in an interview it is highly unlikely , because they know they wo n't find a better partner than yanukovich mr yanukovich s son , oleksandr , a dentist , who has become one of the richest men in the country during his father s time in office , leads a group known as the family that has elbowed out competitors operating through a conglomerate called management assets company , with interests in construction , banking and coal mining in the traditionally prorussia eastern ukraine another in the yanukovich camp is dmitry v firtash , another one of ukraine s wealthiest men , who made his fortune primarily as a gas middleman in eastern europe , one of the few allowed by russia to act as a gobetween in natural resources deals through successive ukrainian governments , mr firtash cut deals to operate as an intermediary through a swissregistered company , rosukrenergo , in sales by gazprom , the russian natural gas monopoly , to ukraine , a business worth billions however , in 2009 , the prime minister at the time , yulia v tymoshenko , insisted that the ukrainian national energy company buy directly from gazprom mr firtash s longstanding ally in government , a deputy prime minister , yuri boiko , was in moscow this week reportedly negotiating a threemonth reprieve in ukraine s payments to gazprom if achieved , it would provide a critical financial prop to mr yanukovich mikhail b pogrebinsky , a political analyst in kiev , said in an interview that some yanukovich allies were enticed by the prospect of cheaper gas prices , which create instant profits in ukraine s energy intensive industries and opportunities for plunder they want to solve their problems with cheap gas , he said having controlled the presidency for only three years , many of the oligarchs want to postpone economic overhauls until they have amassed greater wealth , serhiy taran , the director of the international democracy institute in kiev , wrote in the russian newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta the young ones would like to go on frolicking for a while , he wrote with their shortterm focus , analysts say , these oligarchs are far more comfortable dealing with russia than with europe and the imf , with their demands for fairness and transparency from this perspective , it made sense for mr yanukovich to play along with europe as long as possible , to extract the best possible deal from russia if this was the plan , as many analysts say , it was dealt a severe blow this summer , when the united states federal reserve sent signals that it might be ready to wind down its loose money policies , the socalled tapering the fed decided to hold off , but interest rates spiked anyway , and the damage to ukraine was done already struggling with a trade deficit and plummeting reserves , it lost access to the financial markets , setting up the deadline to obtain financing early next year among russia s strategic interests in ukraine are the gas pipelines that provide access to european markets , as pivotal to the russian economy as the persian gulf shipping lanes are to america s for the kremlin , its national interest lies in keeping trade routes open to consumers of energy , rather than suppliers , and ukraine one of the most energy intensive economies in the world , with antiquated steel mills , train and car factories and fertilizer plants burning vast volumes of natural gas and coal is an important consumer russia has also emphasized to the ukrainian elites the risks they run in joining forces with europe roman khudyakov , a member of the russian parliament , told journalists that the majority of the businessmen in ukraine know that in the event of joining the eu , their plants will collapse overnight , unable to compete on equal terms with western companies mr yanukovich has reached out to beijing , traveling there this week during the height of the protests in kiev in search of assistance , but came back with only some business deals , not cash the chinese , experts say , have no interest in interfering in a matter of vital interest to their ally in moscow it remains to be seen whether russia will help mr yanukovich dodge the financial crisis next year to date , moscow has proposed solving ukraine s balance of payments crisis by reducing gas prices , but that approach , analysts say , is just as likely to produce profits for insiders as it is cash for the government
geneva the united nations experts investigating human rights conditions in north korea said tuesday that the shocking evidence they had collected from defectors and others suggested largescale patterns of abuse that demanded an international response the human rights council pushed for the investigation in an attempt to bring new attention to allegations of horrifying abuses at the north s infamous gulags that have been trickling out for years as more people have escaped the brutal police state until now , world powers including the united states had focused instead on attempts to dismantle the north s nuclear weapons program the chairman of the threemember commission of inquiry , michael donald kirby , told reporters that the testimony he had heard in recent months evoked reactions similar to the discovery of concentration camps in europe after world war ii he cited the statements of a former prisoner who said she had seen another woman forced to drown her baby in a bucket , and the account of a man who said he had collected and burned the bodies of prisoners who had died of starvation experts say the number of prisoners in gulags has dropped in recent years to an estimated 120 , 000 or fewer from a possible high of 200 , 000 but that might be partly because so many had died from forced labor and a lack of food the great value of the report , said eileen chamberlain donahoe , united states ambassador to the human rights council , is that it has begun to shed light on the horrifying realities of life in north korea and raise international awareness of the ongoing tragedy and barbaric conditions there she also said the findings represented a small but significant crack in the north s information blockade the findings of the threemember commission of inquiry were part of an interim report to the council the final report in march is expected to eventually be presented to the united nations general assembly it remains unclear what actions the united nations might take any referral to the international criminal court for human rights abuses would need to be approved by the security council , which includes north korea s longtime ally , china although china did not actively oppose the investigation , a senior chinese diplomat in geneva on tuesday criticized the interim findings politicized accusations and pressures are not helpful to improving human rights in any country , chen chuandong said , according to reuters on the contrary , they will only provoke confrontation and undermine the foundation and atmosphere for international human rights cooperation mr kirby said the panel had submitted several requests seeking cooperation and access to north korea , including a letter to the country s leader , kim jongun , but the north korean government said it totally and categorically rejects the commission of inquiry a senior north korean diplomat in geneva , kim yongho , said tuesday that the evidence cited by the panel had been fabricated and invented by forces hostile to north korea , and dismissed the commission as a hotbed of confrontation and distrust mr kirby said that he had invited north korea to provide hard evidence that refuted any of the testimony received , but that none was forthcoming
annapolis , md as midshipmen were graduating from the naval academy here last week , navy investigators were conducting an investigation into reports that several football players had serially raped a female midshipman at an offcampus party last year three navy football players are under investigation in the case , according to naval academy officials no charges have been brought , but the academy has delayed the graduation of one of the three midshipmen and his commissioning in the navy , according to academy officials and others briefed on the inquiry the academy s superintendent , vice adm michael h miller , is expected to receive a final report from the naval criminal investigative service in the next week or two and then decide whether to proceed with charges , according to academy officials the investigation , stemming from an april 2012 party , has sputtered off and on for more than a year , hampered in part by the woman s initial refusal to cooperate , the officials said she was ashamed and then later felt intimidated , according to her washington lawyer , susan burke in a series of interviews , the female midshipman said that she was upset that she had faced disciplinary action for underage drinking at the party while the football players were permitted to play last season academy officials acknowledged the inquiry but declined to comment further naval academy leadership is monitoring the progress of this investigation and evaluating the appropriate options for adjudication , a spokesman said in a statement it is completely inappropriate to make any other public comment on this investigation or any ongoing investigation , as we risk compromising the military justice process academy officials said that the players were allowed to play for the team last fall because no charges had been brought in the case and they were accorded the presumption of innocence as a result officials described the case as delicate and complex , and one in which the investigation has been hampered by the limits of the available evidence the inquiry comes amid a growing national controversy over sexual assaults in the military and over whether he pentagon has reacted aggressively enough to curb them the controversy has now reached into the cloistered world of the elite service academies in january , a naval academy instructor was charged with raping a female midshipman the courtmartial began this week the naval academy has said that it had 51 total reports of unwanted sexual contact during the academic years from 2011 through 2013 but in recent interviews , current and former female midshipmen said they believe many more episodes go unreported they said that women , who first arrived in annapolis in 1976 and now make up 22 percent of the student population , are often worried about the consequences candace tisdale , a midshipman and a friend of the woman at the center of the current investigation , said women at the academy learn to adapt to harassment and a sometimeshostile climate the desire to be accepted by the group , and the high stress during plebe summer and plebe year , make you accept it , she said the academy culture teaches midshipmen to meet high moral standards but also drills into students not to throw shipmates under the bus , she said annie kendzior , a former midshipman who has filed a lawsuit over two alleged assaults by athletes in 2008 that she did not report to the academy until 2011 , said she initially declined to pursue the cases because she did n't want to be labeled as this person who got varsity athletes kicked out in a series of interviews , the female midshipman involved in the 2012 episode now under investigation offered an account of that april night and its aftermath naval academy officials confirmed many of the basic facts that she provided in her account now 21 , she asked to remain anonymous , concerned about her career and reputation she said that after that night , she was taunted and harassed by other midshipmen and suffered from depression for months in a public statement friday , ms burke , her lawyer , said the woman was ostracized and retaliated against by the football players and the naval academy community on april 14 , 2012 , the woman said , she went to a crowded offcampus party hosted by a group of football players it was held at an annapolis home known as the football house in interviews , several midshipmen who attended the party said it was one of several houses used by members of the academy athletic teams , in violation of rules prohibiting midshipmen from having offcampus housing in the annapolis area the woman , then a thirdclass midshipman , or sophomore , said she drank heavily before the party and was intoxicated by the time she arrived at the football house she said she drank more after she got there and began to black out she said she could recall only brief moments of that night she remembers sitting on a bed in the house with one football player , then being in a car with three others i was sitting on my knees on the floor in the back seat , she said i remember briefly seeing them , and i remember crying , and being upset and saying , i'm sorry' later , she woke up on a stairway in the house , and then finally awoke the following morning on a couch eventually , she said , she was driven back to the academy by one of the players now under investigation the day after the episode , she noticed bruises on her body ms tisdale recalled that she lost track of her friend at the party , but told her the next day that while she had seen her with one of the football players , she did not know much more the woman said that she texted that football player , and wanted to talk he came to her room , where she said he eventually acknowledged that he and another player had had sex with her she said that he later denied having made such an admission to her later that night , ms tisdale told her friend that rumors were flying around campus that several football players had had sex with her at the party social media also quickly began to play a role in spreading word around campus ms tisdale said that a football player showed her a private facebook page on which some midshipmen had posted suggestive comments that appeared to be about the episode the female midshipman said she felt so ashamed that she did not want to report anything to naval academy officials but a few days later , she said , she learned that another female midshipman was planning to report what had happened that is what forced me to go in and talk , she said she wanted to put it behind her , but she could n't because it was the buzz of the campus , said her lawyer , ms burke the female midshipman met with a chaplain at the academy , and then an academy sexual assault counselor the counselor told her that she had already heard about the episode from five or six people , whom the counselor did not identify , but said none had provided the woman s name , the midshipman said still worried about the backlash , she was not fully cooperative once an investigation was begun by the naval criminal investigative service i told them i chose to drink , it was my fault , and i could n't remember , she recalled the ncis agent told me , just because you were drinking does n't give them the right' in the weeks after the party , the woman said , one player approached her , saying he wanted her to remain quiet she said she heard the same thing from other people who were in contact with the football players this was a common message i heard over and over again , she said they would say that the guys are saying that me not talking had kept the peace kenyon williams , a midshipman and a friend of the woman , said she had to deal with subtle intimidation the football team sits together in the dining hall , and we would have to walk past them to go to dinner , and sometimes they would stare at her , he said last fall , she had to abide by an academy rule requiring all midshipmen to attend every navy home football game she said that at some games , she would sit by herself i hated every minute of it , she said the naval criminal investigative service interviewed many of those who attended the party , according to several midshipmen who said they were interviewed and officials who have been briefed on the inquiry several football players were questioned , but without the female midshipman s full cooperation , the inquiry languished , according to the officials the woman said that she lost her driving privileges and privileges for weekends off campus because of her underage drinking , which she had acknowledged during the investigation that angered her because she said a lawyer for the academy told her she did not have to worry about being punished the disciplinary action came after a meeting with the academy s commandant then , capt robert e clark ii the equivalent of the dean of students at a civilian university who , she said , told her he thought of her as a daughter and urged her to cooperate with the investigation and talk about what had happened five midshipmen , including a football player and the female midshipman at the center of the case , were disciplined for underage drinking at the football house party , according to academy officials five others , including some football players , were disciplined for providing alcohol to minors , according to the officials twelve midshipmen received some form of disciplinary action as a result of the party , the officials said at the end of last year , the midshipman said she learned the investigation was about to be closed after i found out that they were closing the case , it blew my mind , she said in her statement issued friday , ms burke criticized the decision to close the initial investigation last year throughout 2012 , the naval academy superintendent did nothing , instead closing the investigation without charges , and blaming the victim s unwillingness to cooperate further as the reason for the closure , ms burke said with the encouragement of a sympathetic faculty member , the woman says she finally decided to speak up in january , she told investigators from the ncis that she was prepared to tell them everything she knew she also hired ms burke , who says she began meeting with navy investigators as well in cooperating with the investigators , the victim agreed to secretly record conversations with some of the football players , including one by telephone the day before president obama came to deliver his graduation address at the naval academy last friday , she said after the academy superintendent , admiral miller , receives the ncis report , it will be up to him to decide whether to bring charges against any midshipmen lawmakers in congress have proposed taking the decisionmaking power over whether to press charges in sexual assault cases out of the military chain of command , and putting it into the hands of prosecutors and law enforcement professionals critics of the military justice system say the fact that commanders have power over such decisions makes it less likely that women in the military will report sexual assaults to their bosses for fear of being subject to retaliation admiral miller declined to comment , but said in a statement i am fiercely dedicated to maintaining a climate of dignity and mutual respect at the naval academy that is free from the threat of sexual assault and sexual harassment it is a top priority
beirut , lebanon not long ago , rebels on the outskirts of damascus were peppering the city with mortar rounds , government soldiers were defecting in droves and reports circulated of new territory pried from the grip of president bashar alassad as his losses grew , mr assad unleashed fighter jets and scud missiles , intensifying fears that mounting desperation would push him to lash out with chemical weapons that momentum has now been reversed in recent weeks , rebel groups have been killing one another with increasing ferocity , losing ground on the battlefield and alienating the very citizens they say they want to liberate at the same time , the united states and other western powers that have called for mr assad to step down have shown new reluctance to provide the rebels with badly needed weapons although few expect that mr assad can reassert his authority over the whole of syria , even some of his staunchest enemies acknowledge that his position is stronger than it has been in months his resilience suggests that he has carved out what amounts to a rump state in central syria that is firmly backed by russia , iran and hezbollah and that mr assad and his supporters will probably continue to chip away at the splintered rebel movement assad is powerful now , not as a president who controls a state but as a warlord , as someone who has more and more sophisticated weapons than the others , said hassan hassan , a syrian commentator at the abu dhabibased englishlanguage newspaper the national he is not capable of winning back the country the civil war has balkanized the country , with an array of armed groups controlling different areas the government retains its grip on the capital and has been solidifying its control over a string of major cities to the north rebel groups hold large swaths of land in the country s north and east , though they are far from unified , with militias competing for resources , imposing their own laws and sometimes turning their guns on one another the kurds , syria s largest ethnic minority , control their own areas and often fight to keep the rebels out over all , about 60 percent of the syrian population lives in governmentcontrolled areas , while the rebels effectively control 60 percent to 70 percent of the actual territory , said andrew j tabler , a syrian expert with the washington institute for near east policy that is because the rebels are strongest in less populated rural areas , he said but a stalemate that has divided the country for months has begun to shift as mr assad s forces bolstered by regular support from his allies have rolled back rebel gains and eased the pressure on the capital even fighters who had hoped that mr assad would end up deposed , dead , jailed or exiled like other autocrats singled out in the arab spring uprisings have begun to acknowledge the emerging reality if the revolution continues like this , the people will revolt against us , said a rebel commander from the central city of homs , where mr assad s forces have made gains in recent days the commander , who wanted only his first name , ahmed , used to protect his family , criticized his fellow rebels for putting the interests of their brigades ahead of the wider antiassad struggle and accused them of hoarding powerful weapons or selling them for a profit that lack of unity has prolonged the war and made their mission harder , he said if a regular syrian comes and asks me what we have given him , i do n't know what to say , ahmed said throughout the more than two years of fighting , the military prowess on both sides has been heavily linked to the reliability of their international backers mr assad has received continuous military and financial support from russia and iran as well as added muscle on the battlefield from hezbollah , the lebanese militant group and political party while he has come to rely more heavily on local militias , the clear command structure of the army and mr assad s status as a unifying figurehead have kept his forces together meanwhile , the many rebel groups have had to compete for irregular bursts of support from saudi arabia , qatar and a range of private funders , each with its own ideological interests this has exacerbated tensions among the rebel groups , as a win for one is seen as a loss for others the rise of qaedalinked groups like the nusra front and the islamic state of iraq and syria has further splintered the cause , with some syrian fighters resenting international jihadists who have joined the battle to serve their own ends the united states and its western allies have pressed for mr assad to leave power and talked about arming select rebel groups the european union lifted its arms embargo on syria , which rebels expected would lead to weapon supplies but rebels say none have arrived so far they do not want the fall of this regime that is why they are not helping , said , the head of the free syrian army , a loosely knit umbrella group that has been soliciting aid and that is supposed to funnel it to vetted groups while keeping it from extremists general idris accused the west of delaying with endless meetings , summits and requests for new guarantees that extremists would not get arms , and said this left the rebels at a huge disadvantage against mr assad s forces they have russia and iran and hezbollah , he said but these democratic countries that call for freedom , when you have people seeking freedom from dictatorial , oppressive regimes and need help , they do not give any aid but in recent months , the rebels have also failed to consolidate their victories , plan and execute new advances and provide basic services to civilians in areas they control nearly a year after launching the battle to take syria s largest city , aleppo , the city remains damaged and divided many residents blame the rebels for bringing the destruction farther south , government forces with help from hezbollah seized the town of qusayr last month , depriving the rebels of a key pathway for arms and fighters from lebanon into central syria since then , the rebel movement has shown signs of internal disarray clashes among battalions are on the rise , and many who welcomed international jihadists for their battlefield skills have turned against them last week , extremists killed two rebel commanders in separate episodes in northern syria all of this has given mr assad a new level of confidence , said assem kansou , a member of the lebanese parliament and the local branch of mr assad s baath party whose children grew up with mr assad and who has visited him frequently throughout the crisis mr assad appeared worried months ago when rebels on the outskirts of damascus often fired shells at downtown , said mr kansou but his mood appeared better last month , after the army took qusayr and pushed the rebels farther from the capital now you sit with him and you see that he is at ease , mr kansou said he s a person who is very confident in himself , working bit by bit all needs to be fixed , but he has a sense that this crisis will pass with all of its consequences
washington in more than a dozen classified rulings , the nation s surveillance court has created a secret body of law giving the the power to amass vast collections of data on americans while pursuing not only terrorism suspects , but also people possibly involved in nuclear proliferation , espionage and cyberattacks , officials say the rulings , some nearly 100 pages long , reveal that the court has taken on a much more expansive role by regularly assessing broad constitutional questions and establishing important judicial precedents , with almost no public scrutiny , according to current and former officials familiar with the court s classified decisions the 11member foreign intelligence surveillance court , known as the fisa court , was once mostly focused on approving casebycase wiretapping orders but since major changes in legislation and greater , it has quietly become almost a parallel supreme court , serving as the ultimate arbiter on surveillance issues and delivering opinions that will most likely shape intelligence practices for years to come , the officials said last month , a former national security agency contractor , edward j snowden , leaked a classified order from the fisa court , which authorized the but the court s stillsecret decisions go far beyond any single surveillance order , the officials said we 've seen a growing body of law from the court , a former intelligence official said what you have is a common law that develops where the court is issuing orders involving particular types of surveillance , particular types of targets in one of the court s most important decisions , the judges have expanded the use in terrorism cases of a legal principle known as the special needs doctrine and carved out an exception to the fourth amendment s requirement of a warrant for searches and seizures , the officials said the special needs doctrine was originally established in 1989 by the supreme court in a ruling allowing the drug testing of railway workers , finding that a minimal intrusion on privacy was justified by the government s need to combat an overriding public danger applying that concept more broadly , the fisa judges have ruled that the nsa s collection and examination of americans' communications data to track possible terrorists does not run afoul of the fourth amendment , the officials said that legal interpretation is significant , several outside legal experts said , because it uses a relatively narrow area of the law used to justify airport screenings , for instance , or drunkendriving checkpoints and applies it much more broadly , in secret , to the wholesale collection of communications in pursuit of terrorism suspects it seems like a legal stretch , , a national security law expert at syracuse university , said in response to a description of the decision it s another way of tilting the scales toward the government in its access to all this data while president obama and his intelligence advisers have spoken of the surveillance programs leaked by mr snowden , the court has also interpreted the law in ways that extend into other national security concerns in one recent case , for instance , intelligence officials were able to get access to an email attachment sent within the united states because they said they were worried that the email contained a schematic drawing or a diagram possibly connected to  in the past , that probably would have required a court warrant because the suspicious email involved american communications in this case , however , a littlenoticed provision in a 2008 law , expanding the definition of foreign intelligence to include weapons of mass destruction , was used to justify access to the message the court s use of that language has allowed intelligence officials to get wider access to data and communications that they believe may be linked to nuclear proliferation , the officials said they added that other secret findings had eased access to data on espionage , cyberattacks and other possible threats connected to foreign intelligence the definition of foreign intelligence' is very broad , another former intelligence official said in an interview an espionage target , a nuclear proliferation target , that all falls within fisa , and the court has signed off on that the official , like a halfdozen other current and former national security officials , discussed the court s rulings and the general trends they have established on the condition of anonymity because they are classified judges on the fisa court refused to comment on the scope and volume of their decisions unlike the supreme court , the fisa court hears from only one side in the case the government and its findings are a court of review is empaneled to hear appeals , but that is known to have happened only a handful of times in the court s history , and no case has ever been taken to the supreme court in fact , it is not clear in all circumstances whether internet and phone companies that are turning over the reams of data even have the right to appear before the fisa court created by congress in 1978 as a check against wiretapping abuses by the government , the court meets in a secure , nondescript room in the federal courthouse in washington all of the current 11 judges , who serve sevenyear terms , were appointed to the special court by chief justice john g roberts jr , and 10 of them were nominated to the bench by republican presidents most hail from districts outside the capital and come in rotating shifts to hear surveillance applications a single judge signs most surveillance orders , which totaled nearly 1 , 800 last year none of the requests from the intelligence agencies was denied , according to the court beyond broader legal rulings , the judges have had to resolve questions about newer types of technology , like video conferencing , and how and when the government can get access to them , the officials said the judges have also had to intervene repeatedly when private internet and phone companies , which provide much of the data to the nsa , have raised concerns that the government is overreaching in its demands for records or when the government itself reports that it has inadvertently collected more data than was authorized , the officials said in such cases , the court has repeatedly ordered the nsa to destroy the internet or phone data that was improperly collected , the officials said the officials said one central concept connects a number of the court s opinions the judges have concluded that the mere collection of enormous volumes of metadata facts like the time of phone calls and the numbers dialed , but not the content of conversations does not violate the fourth amendment , as long as the government establishes a valid reason under national security regulations before taking the next step of actually examining the contents of an american s communications this concept is rooted partly in the special needs provision the court has embraced the basic idea is that it s ok to create this huge pond of data , a third official said , but you have to establish a reason to stick your pole in the water and start fishing under the new procedures passed by congress in 2008 in the fisa amendments act , even the collection of metadata must be considered relevant to a terrorism investigation or other intelligence activities the court has indicated that while individual pieces of data may not appear relevant to a terrorism investigation , the total picture that the bits of data create may in fact be relevant , according to the officials with knowledge of the decisions , a professor of constitutional law at the university of chicago , said he was troubled by the idea that the court is creating a significant body of law without hearing from anyone outside the government , forgoing the adversarial system that is a staple of the american justice system that whole notion is missing in this process , he said the fisa judges have bristled at criticism that they are a rubber stamp for the government , occasionally speaking out to say they apply rigor in their scrutiny of government requests most of the surveillance operations involve the nsa , an eavesdropping behemoth that has listening posts around the world its role in gathering intelligence within the united states has grown enormously since the sept 11 attacks soon after , president george w bush , under a secret wiretapping program that circumvented the fisa court , authorized the nsa to collect metadata and in some cases listen in on foreign calls to or from the united states after a heated debate , the essential elements of the bush program were put into law by congress in 2007 , but with greater involvement by the fisa court even before the leaks by mr snowden , members of congress and civil liberties advocates had been pressing for declassifying and publicly releasing court decisions , perhaps in summary form reggie b walton , the fisa court s presiding judge , wrote in march that he recognized the about the court s decisions but , he said , there are serious obstacles to doing so because of the potential for misunderstanding caused by omitting classified details gen keith b alexander , the nsa director , was noncommital when he was pressed at a senate hearing in june to put out some version of the court s decisions while he pledged to try to make more decisions public , he said , i do n't want to jeopardize the security of americans by making a mistake in saying , yes , we 're going to do all that'
for three years economic policy throughout the advanced world has been paralyzed , despite high unemployment , by a dismal orthodoxy every suggestion of action to create jobs has been shot down with warnings of dire consequences if we spend more , the very serious people say , the bond markets will punish us if we print more money , inflation will soar nothing should be done because nothing can be done , except ever harsher austerity , which will someday , somehow , be rewarded but now it seems that one major nation is breaking ranks and that nation is , of all places , japan this is n't the maverick we were looking for in japan governments come and governments go , but nothing ever seems to change indeed , shinzo abe , the new prime minister , has had the job before , and his party s victory was widely seen as the return of the dinosaurs who misruled the country for decades furthermore , japan , with its huge government debt and aging population , was supposed to have even less room for maneuver than other advanced countries but mr abe returned to office pledging to end japan s long economic stagnation , and he has already taken steps orthodoxy says we must n't take and the early indications are that it s going pretty well some background long before the 2008 financial crisis plunged america and europe into a deep and prolonged economic slump , japan held a dress rehearsal in the economics of stagnation when a burst stock and real estate bubble pushed japan into recession , the policy response was too little , too late and too inconsistent to be sure , there was a lot of spending on public works , but the government , worried about debt , always pulled back before a solid recovery could get established , and by the late 1990s persistent deflation was already entrenched in the early 2000s the bank of japan , the counterpart of the federal reserve , tried to fight deflation by printing a lot of money but it , too , pulled back at the first hint of improvement , and the deflation never went away that said , japan never had the kind of employment and human disaster we 've experienced since 2008 indeed , our policy response has been so inadequate that i 've suggested that american economists who used to be very harsh in their condemnations of japanese policy , a group that includes ben bernanke and , well , me , visit tokyo to apologize to the emperor we have , after all , done even worse and there s another lesson in japan s experience while getting out of a prolonged slump turns out to be very difficult , that s mainly because it s hard getting policy makers to accept the need for bold action that is , the problem is mainly political and intellectual , rather than strictly economic for the risks of action are much smaller than the very serious people want you to believe consider , in particular , the alleged dangers of debt and deficits here in america , we are constantly warned that we must slash spending now now now or we 'll turn into greece , greece i tell you but greece , a country without a currency , does n't look much like the united states surely japan offers a more relevant model and while doomsayers keep predicting a fiscal crisis in japan , hyping each uptick in interest rates as a sign of the imminent apocalypse , it keeps not happening japan s government can still borrow long term at a rate of less than 1 percent enter mr abe , who has been pressuring the bank of japan into seeking higher inflation in effect , helping to inflate away part of the government s debt and has also just announced a large new program of fiscal stimulus how have the market gods responded \? the answer is , it s all good market measures of , which were negative not long ago the market was expecting deflation to continue have now moved well into positive territory but government borrowing costs have hardly changed at all given the prospect of moderate inflation , this means that japan s fiscal outlook has actually improved sharply true , the foreignexchange value of the yen has fallen considerably but that s actually very good news , and japanese exporters are cheering in short , mr abe has thumbed his nose at orthodoxy , with excellent results now , people who know something about japanese politics warn me not to think of mr abe as a good guy his foreign policy , they tell me , is very bad , and his support for stimulus may have more to do with oldfashioned porkbarrel \( tofu barrel \? \) politics than with a sophisticated rejection of conventional wisdom but none of that may matter whatever his motives , mr abe is breaking with a bad orthodoxy and if he succeeds , something remarkable may be about to happen japan , which pioneered the economics of stagnation , may also end up showing the rest of us the way out
senator rand paul , republican of kentucky , began an oldschool , speakuntilyoucanspeaknomore filibuster on wednesday just before noon , and was still going strong hours later mr paul , who opposes the nomination of john o brennan to lead the central intelligence agency , had previously said he would filibuster president obama s nominee after receiving a letter this month from attorney general eric h holder jr that refused to rule out the use of drone strikes within the united states in extraordinary circumstances like the sept 11 terrorist attacks on wednesday , mr paul did exactly as promised , taking to the senate floor to filibuster mr brennan s nomination i rise today to begin to filibuster john brennan s nomination for the cia , mr paul began i will speak until i can no longer speak i will speak as long as it takes , until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our constitution is important , that your rights to trial by jury are precious , that no american should be killed by a drone on american soil without first being charged with a crime , without first being found to be guilty by a court mr paul is the first senator to use an actual filibuster after the senate reached a deal earlier this year to take some basic steps to limit the filibuster as mr paul s filibuster quickly nicknamed the filiblizzard by twitter users , poking fun at the washington snow storm that failed to materialize entered its fourth hour , the senator from kentucky got an assist from his friends , as senators ted cruz , republican of texas , and mike lee , republican of utah , joined him on the senate floor to help with the effort mr paul did not yield the floor a move that would effectively end his filibuster but he did , with some apparent relief , yield to take questions from his republican colleagues mr cruz began by making the obvious allusion , referring to mr paul as a modern day mr smith goes to washington , joking that his effort would surely be making jimmy stewart smile and , perhaps befitting of public stands , mr cruz also took the opportunity to remind the chamber that wednesday marks the 177th anniversary of the fall of the alamo , noting with some pride that mr paul is originally from the great state of texas mr cruz then proceeded to read from a letter written by william barrett travis , a lieutenant colonel in the texas army who died at the alamo , concluding , does that glorious letter give you any encouragement and sustenance on this 177th anniversary of the alamo \? apparently it did , as mr paul soldiered ahead , before again receiving some help , this time from an unlikely source senator ron wyden , democrat of oregon mr wyden said that while he had voted in favor of mr brennan s nomination at tuesday s senate intelligence committee meeting and plans to vote for him again on the senate floor , he believed that mr paul has made a number of important points about the administration s lethal drone program and the potential for targeting american citizens on united states soil i think senator paul and i agree that this nomination also provides a very important opportunity for the united states senate to consider the government s rules and policies on the targeted killings of americans and that , of course , has been a central pillar of our nation s counterterror strategy , mr wyden said he added that he felt that the executive branch should not be allowed to conduct such a serious and farreaching program by themselves without any scrutiny , because that s not how american democracy works and then , as the \( now bipartisan \) filibuster began to feel a bit like a shakespearean drama , none other than senator marco rubio of florida entered from stage right , complete with a water joke a reference to his recent state of the union response , in which a video of a parched mr rubio chugging water quickly went viral you ve been here for a while , so let me give you some advice , mr rubio keep some water nearby trust me
even before robert bork died last month , he had achieved something close to martyrdom in the quartercentury since the senate rejected his supreme court nomination , successive generations of conservative lawyers and activists have carried the torch , depicting his defeat as an injustice of historic proportion following his death at the age of 85 , liberals mostly maintained a respectful silence while conservatives dusted off old complaints about the conduct of the confirmation hearing and the unfairness , in their view , of the borking the nominee received clearly , the bork battle survives bork no one who actually lived through the senate judiciary committee hearing in september 1987 is without views on the subject , and i have previously offered mine i think that the televised hearing , which held the country spellbound , provided a rare and valuable public seminar on the meaning of the constitution , the methods of constitutional interpretation , and the different answers that competing methods offer to the most profound questions of individual autonomy and equality indisputably , there was some exaggerated rhetoric , and certainly the hearing had its rough edges as judge richard a posner observed in slate last month , that s politics , and a supreme court confirmation hearing is at its core a political event but what borking really amounted to was holding the nominee s vigorously expressed views up to the light for public inspection in five days of testimony , thenjudge bork a former professor of mine whom i liked and respected had every opportunity to make his case his ideas were fully aired and considered by a vote of 58 to 42 , the senators , having heard from their constituents , concluded that his constricted constitutional vision , locked into the supposed original intention of the framers , was not what the country needed or wanted some time after the senate vote , i was invited to a conversation with judge bork at the offices of the new republic magazine he was hurting and angry when my turn came to ask a question , i asked him whether , at any time during the hearing , he had felt that a member of the judiciary committee had met him on his own level in serious constitutional conversation no , he answered not even arlen specter \? i asked specter had his mind made up from the beginning , he snapped i knew that wasn t true , although judge bork clearly believed it senator specter , a pennsylvania republican , had in fact agonized over his vote , as i knew from having talked with him almost daily a yale law school graduate and former prosecutor , the senator went head to head with the nominee through several rounds of questioning , hours of mesmerizing constitutional debate in which he probed for any sign of flexibility in judge bork s view that the entire course of modern constitutional law was profoundly mistaken finding none , senator specter , who had assumed at the start of the hearing that he would vote for confirmation , decided to vote no , fully recognizing the price he would pay within his own party five other republicans followed \( judge bork and senator specter , whose paths crossed at such a significant moment in their lives , died within months of each other arlen specter , who eventually became a democrat , died in october at 82 \) at the new republic gathering , i didn t say anything to correct my old professor s view that the hearing was a charade in which the fix was in from the start arlen specter could speak for himself , it seemed to me it was clear at that moment , and became only more so as the years passed , that robert bork couldn t accept the legitimacy of his defeat no one is entitled to a seat on the supreme court , of course , and many towering legal figures who never made it took their disappointment to the grave judge bork was hardly unique in his sense of entitlement , but it ran so deep that it prevented him from understanding the obvious dynamic of what happened because he had been nominated to fill the swing seat vacated by justice lewis f powell jr , a moderate conservative whose retirement left nearly every issue of constitutional moment hanging in the balance , his nomination became a public referendum on whether the court should move decisively to the right or stay basically the same the status quo won out it s evident in retrospect how much would have been different had robert bork been sitting all these years in the seat that president reagan intended for him and that anthony m kennedy finally assumed in february 1988 it was pretty clear back then , too justice kennedy then , like judge bork , a federal court of appeals judge was confirmed unanimously as the confirmation hearing has come down in history , judge bork s comment that serving on the supreme court would be an intellectual feast is what many people remember it sounded so arrogant when it was , i think , rather refreshingly honest a less famous but more telling moment took place earlier , during a colloquy with senator orrin hatch , a republican from utah it was senator hatch s daunting task to show that the nominee was not the extremist his opponents had described , but rather a person of comfortably mainstream views to that end , the senator read a series of quotations from liberaltomoderate law professors who , like judge bork , had criticized roe v wade , the 1973 abortion decision the names of the critics read like a legal establishment hall of fame finally , senator hatch served up what sounded like a concluding , softball question in your lengthy constitutional studies , is there any supreme court decision that has stirred more controversy or criticism amongst scholars and citizens than that particular case \? then came the unexpected answer i suppose the only candidate for that , senator , would be brown v board of education scrambling to reclaim lost ground , senator hatch quickly offered or possibly the dred scott case yes , that s right , judge bork said the moment passed quickly , but it s worth unpacking that deeply revealing exchange as senator hatch immediately grasped , the nominee had violated a cardinal rule of modern judicial confirmation hearings , which is that brown v board of education is beyond debate the 1954 school desegregation ruling was in fact the subject of substantial criticism within the legal academy in the 1950s and well into the 1960s some eminent professors , while endorsing the outcome , took strong issue with the court s analytical method awareness of the rich critical literature from that period had faded away by 1987 , effaced by the decision s celebrated unanimity and moral weight so while judge bork s answer to senator hatch was historically accurate , it was an obtuse accuracy more to the point was how the moral dimension seemed to elude him as he tossed brown into the same box with the abortion decision of which he had been so scathingly dismissive i should explain this column s title , robert bork s tragedy i see him as a tragic figure not because he was dealt an unjust hand he wasn t but because of his inability to understand what happened he spent his final decades surrounded by acolytes who stoked his sense of victimhood , and there seemed to be no one around him to provide a reality check as his rants about the supreme court s depredations and the collapse of western civilization \( he portrayed the two as inextricably linked \) became ever more extravagant \( in a symbolic gesture aimed at the republican base , mitt romney named him cochair of his campaign advisory committee on law \) by 1996 , in slouching towards gomorrah modern liberalism and american decline , he was taking aim at darwinian evolution and embracing intelligent design , evidence for which he later called overwhelming a country i do not recognize , a book he edited in 2005 , found him plunging ever deeper into the culture wars , with the supreme court as his main target his introductory essay charged that the supreme court s unconstitutional rulings were an attempt to remake society and thus to remake man himself he complained about the court s embrace of radical individualism and its destruction of taboos about vile language he wrote , our culture s abandonment of a sense of the sacred , an abandonment greatly facilitated by the supreme court , is a heavy loss , adding in a tone of angry despair almost every value , every virtue , every symbol , and every institution that was once taken as sacred , not to be overthrown in practice , has now been overthrown or is in question in 2010 , he declared his opposition to elena kagan s supreme court nomination , bafflingly calling her admiration for aharon barak , the distinguished former president of israel s supreme court , disqualifying in and of itself ms kagan had described the israeli judge , internationally known for his human rights decisions , as her judicial hero but to judge bork , justice barak was the worst judge on the planet \( he had an odd fixation about justice barak , devoting a chapter of a 2003 book , coercing virtue the worldwide rule of judges , to an attack on him and on the court he led the israeli supreme court displayed an addiction to universal values that was subverting the jewish character of the israeli state , judge bork complained \) it s tempting to suppose that only the bitterness of defeat drove a once cheerfully combative iconoclast to the apocalyptic rhetoric that defined his subsequent writing and speeches perhaps he saw himself as the one who might have kept his finger in the dike , holding back the inexorable tides of ever expanding notions of equality that he feared so deeply in fact , his record suggests that the pre and postnomination robert bork were one and the same , with the later version simply having lost the need for discretion so perhaps his defeat didn t so much change him as free him from inhibition when the senate rejected his backwardlooking vision and instead embraced anthony kennedy , who praised the constitution s framers for having made a covenant with the future , it was no tragedy for the country but it was for a man , and it s important to know the difference
the united states has just spent thousands of american lives in a distant land for a victory that now seems hollow , if indeed it can be called a victory at all our own country , moreover , is emerging from a recession , dispirited and selfabsorbed , worried about the fragility of the recovery and the state of our democracy idealism is in short supply so , as another faroff war worsens , americans are loath to take sides , even against a merciless dictator , even to the extent of sending weapons the voices opposed to getting involved range from the pacifist left to the populist right the president , fearful that foreign conflict will undermine his domestic agenda , vacillates this is the united states in 1940 sound a little familiar \? i 've been reading two engrossing new histories of that time those angry days by lynne olson and 1940 by susan dunn both focused on the ferocious and now largely forgotten resistance franklin d roosevelt had to navigate in order to stand with our allies against hitler of course , 2013 is not 1940 the middle east is not europe president obama is not fdr but america is again in a deep isolationist mood as a wary congress returns from its summer recess to debate syria , as president obama prepares to address the nation , it is instructive to throw the two periods up on the screen and examine them for lessons how does a president sell foreign engagement to a public that wants none of it \? the clich of the season is that americans are warweary from our long slogs in iraq and afghanistan that is true , but not the whole story to be sure , nothing has done more to discredit an activist foreign policy than the blind missionary arrogance of the bush administration but the isolationist temper is not just about the legacy of iraq economic troubles and political dysfunction have contributed to a loss of confidence add to the mix a surge of xenophobia , with its calls for higher fences and bigbrotherly attention to the danger within \( these anxieties also helped give rise to the expanding surveillance state , just as nativism in that earlier period gave license to j edgar hoover s obsessive eavesdropping \) isolationism is strong in the tea party , where mistrust of executive power is profound and where being able to see russia from your front yard counts as mastery of international affairs but sophisticated readers of the new york times are not immune , or so it seems from the comments that arrive when i write in defense of a more assertive foreign policy \( in recent columns i 've advocated to shift the balance in syria s civil war and to encourage democracy in egypt \) not our problems , many readers tell me isolationism is not just an aversion to war , which is an altogether healthy instinct it is a broader reluctance to engage , to assert responsibility , to commit isolationism tends to be pessimistic \( we will get it wrong , we will make it worse \) and amoral \( it is none of our business unless it threatens us directly \) and inwardlooking \( foreign aid is a waste of money better spent at home \) we are not the world s policeman , nor its judge and jury , proclaimed representative alan grayson , a progressive florida democrat , reciting favorite isolationist excuses for doing nothing our own needs in america are great , and they come first at the margins , at least , isolationists suspect that our foreign policy is being manipulated by outside forces in 1940 , as olson s book documents , antiinterventionists deplored the cunning british plutocrats and imperialists , who had lured us into the blood bath of world war i and now wanted to goad us into another one in 2013 , it is supposedly the israelis duping us into fighting their battles many proisrael and jewish groups last week endorsed an attack on syria , but only after agonizing about a likely backlash and , sure enough , the first comment posted on the washington post version of this story was , so how many americans will die for israel this time around \? this is tame stuff compared with 1940 , when isolationism was shot through with shockingly overt antisemitism , not least in the rhetoric of the celebrated aviator charles lindbergh both lynne olson and susan dunn , in interviews , were wary of pushing the analogy too far the middle east , they point out , is far murkier , far less familiar in 1940 everything was black and white there was no gray , dunn told me on one side , adolf hitler and ruthless , barbaric warfare on the other side , democracy , humanism , morality and world civilization itself yes , at least so it seems in hindsight , but the choice was not so clear in 1940 both books offer copious examples of serious , thoughtful people who had real doubts about whether hitler was a threat worth fighting cabinet members and generals , newspaper publishers and business leaders at yale , dunn reports , an antiwar student movement that included such future luminaries as gerald ford , potter stewart and sargent shriver drafted a petition demanding that congress refrain from war , even if england is on the verge of defeat olson told me she was startled to hear secretary of state john kerry inveighing against armchair isolationism last week in his testimony on syria i think to be skeptical now does not mean you 're an isolationist , said olson , who is herself skeptical about taking sides in syria it s become a dirty word fair enough but can we dial down the fears and defeatist slogans of kneejerk isolationism and conduct a serious discussion of our interests and our alternatives in syria and the tumultuous region around it \? the event that ultimately swept the earlier isolationists off the board was , of course , pearl harbor but even before the japanese attack the public reluctance was gradually giving way , allowing the delivery of destroyers to the british , the lendlease program , a precautionary weapons buildup and the beginning of military conscription one factor that moved public opinion toward intervention was the brazenness of hitler s menace americans who had never given a thought to the sudetenland were stunned to see nazis parading into paris another was a robust debate across the country that ultimately transcended partisanship and prejudice most historians and popular memory credit roosevelt s leadership for the country s change of heart , but olson points out that for much of that period roosevelt was to borrow a contemporary phrase leading from behind he campaigned in 1936 on a pledge to shun political commitments which might entangle us in foreign wars and to seek to isolate ourselves completely from war it was a vow he renewed repeatedly as hitler conquered country after country there would be no american boots on the ground olson argues that while roosevelt resolved early to send aid to britain , it is not at all clear that he would have taken america into the war if it had not been forced upon him by pearl harbor but by december 1941 , she writes , the american people had been thoroughly educated about the pros and cons of their country s entry into the conflict and were far less opposed to the idea of going to war than conventional wisdom has it obviously we got into it because of pearl harbor , but that debate made a crucial difference , olson told me and i think that is what s called for now congress in recent years has not won much respect as an arena of policy debate , but it was heartening last week to hear leaders of both parties moving a little beyond petty obstructionism and bitter partisanship and inviting a serious discussion i hope that congress can elicit from the president this week a clear and candid statement of america s vital interests in syria , and a strategy that looks beyond the moment i hope the president can persuade congress that the us still has an important role to play in the world , and that sometimes you have to put some spine in your diplomacy and i hope americans will listen with an open mind
let it be known that the tough drake era begins not this week , with the release of nothing was the same , the first official tough drake album , but rather began all the way back on jan 6 , 2012 that day saw the release of the video for a rick ross song featuring drake and french montana the clip is a fuzzy michael mann ripoff , nighttime miami reduced to blacks , grays and electric blues , oozing sinister energy in it , drake dons a black sweatshirt , black jeans , black boots and a gold chain he spends most of his verse staring hard into the camera , his eyebrows barely moving he gestures brusquely with a bandanna in his right hand and he delivers what is easily the most tart , harsh , menacing verse of his career might look light , but we heavy though this came not even two months after the release of drake s masterpiece album of sensitivity and recrimination , and it read like an almost total repudiation of it that album was a bloodletting of heartbreak and anxieties , while stay schemin was a firm punch to the jaw that became a staple at the same time as some purple songs from take care not only was drake writing his own narrative , he was also writing his own counternarrative it s difficult to tell which of those is now the main plot both are in play on nothing was the same \( young money cash money republic \) , drake s third excellent majorlabel album , and the first to come as he is firmly ensconced in hiphop s top tier before , he was an interloper effecting seismic change in hiphop , thanks to his dismantling of the usual facades of acquisitiveness and fearlessness building on kanye west s template of ambivalence , drake took mr west s selfexamination and stripped it of all its agitation , preserving only the emotional turmoil he wanted success , and was aware of his more conventional competition , but his concerns were primarily internal but drake is on top now , the genre s stylistic standardbearer and its most reliable and versatile hit maker , and his concerns have shifted accordingly on nothing was the same drake broods like before , sure , but also puffs his chest in equal measure he s always used his music to send messages to women who 've broken his heart , or whom he just could n't hold tight enough now he s got something to lord over them , too the musical choices are familiar hazy , often doleful postsoul and lowendheavy hiphop , largely moving slowly and with deliberateness most of the album is produced by drake s longtime associate 40 , who s sticking close to the sound that s become their joint signature the aching hit hold on , we 're going home recalls find your love , from 2010 pound cake is reminiscent of dreams money can buy , from 2011 the most noticeable change in drake over the last couple of years has been physical , not musical suddenly he s muscled , full of hard angles the eyes remain soft , but everything around them has been remade this is the externalization of the bravado that is now an essential part of his music he s bragged plenty before , but now it has weight \( it s probably worth mentioning the new york nightclub altercation between drake s crew and chris brown s crew in june 2012 when drake spoke of it in a recent gq interview , he had an ominous air , as if anticipating how things could get worse \) but muscles aside , there s no real physicality to drake s toughness it s a psychological evolution more than anything , the result of accepting his stature as reality , not just a dream in the past , laying himself bare has been the most natural thing but when you 're the object of ire and jealousy , the apt response is to flash teeth and snarl a bit the nothing was the same tough talk began several months ago with the release of like most of drake s opening album singles , it s far more muscular than what appears on the rest of the album it s rousing and victorious there ai n't really much out here that s popping off without us and also a bit malevolent that was one of several songs , dating back to stay schemin , in which drake put up his dukes and prepared for a fight the baleful 5am in toronto , or his verse on the remix to versace by migos \( this year i'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it \) , or the joyful flexing on asap rocky s single , the unprintable title of which shortens to problems these songs taken together are the equivalent of a shuttle burning through its rocket boosters before thrusting into space , a familiar drake strategy such sturdy and assured early singles and guest appearances free him up to make an album heavy on catharsis that s only part of what drake s done on nothing was the same , but still a huge part sometimes the opposing personalities occupy the same song , as on furthest thing , part tender and part tense but this album includes some of his most diaristic work , including from time , which is full of scars passive aggressive when we 're texting , i can feel the distance , he says casually , as if exhausted the song continues with melancholy piano flourishes by chilly gonzales , who set the reflective , miserable mood on marvins room on take care \( from time also recalls common s wistful i used to love her and maybe that s a quiet swipe at common , who took some lazy shots at drake a couple of years back \) connect is slightly rougher , more of a rumble than a mope it s about falling for a woman not worth falling for , and then falling again , and again , never learning a lesson the idea is so fun every time at least we try for home run every time this is drake at his eviscerating best , putting both himself and his partner under a microscope , then using the flaws as fuel when it falls apart , i'm always still down to pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground wish you would learn to love people and use things and not the other way around there is a way drake cuts through the structures of language that people create to better capture their emotions but really end up as hindrances it s unique in hiphop , and rare in pop as a whole he is raw , tender , direct that goes for his blustery side , too wutang forever is a roughedged love song that samples the wutang clan it bleeds into own it , a sort of extended interlude that drips feeling right down to drake s voice , which is processed heavily until it begins melting \( similar is 305 to my city , a formless , odd track on which drake s vocals slither like warm candle drippings \) then , as if backing away from a lover s embrace , comes worst behavior , the most chaotic and rowdy song here , which seethes with spite , with drake invoking mase s casually swaggering verse on the notorious big s mo' money mo' problems people still let drake down on this album , he talks about strained businesspersonal relationships on tuscan leather , and returns a few times to the subject of women he s loved who 've moved on and found happiness elsewhere in places , now , he s pushing back with ferocity on pound cake , it s his old classmates in the cross hairs thinking back on how they treated me my high school reunion might be worth an appearance make everybody have to go through security clearance on too much , it s family members and old friends who receive a tongue lashing when he performed it on this month , he began with a disclaimer before i do this song , i just want to say to my friends and family , i want the best for everybody , and i love you all but during the song , he had the same eye of the tiger as in the stay schemin video it was visceral , even a little uncomfortable there s an implicit hiphop competition taking place this year between drake , jay z and mr west , whose severe left turn yeezus is the only hiphop album of the year that gives nothing was the same a run for its money , even as it runs in far less accessible directions that mr west showed up to perform at ovo fest , the annual summer festival drake hosts in toronto , indicates , though , that whereas drake once happily colored within mr west s lines , he is making his own paintings now , and mr west can benefit from standing next to them \( for what it s worth , there are definite echoes of mr west s early production on the first two songs on this album \) that may also be why drake allowed few other people onto this album it s a meaningful time to stand alone , on top to the extent that other voices invade this record , they do so respectfully sampha s decaying pleas on too much , trae the truth s houston bona fides on connect , jay z s cool boasts on pound cake , and that s about it none of them disrupt drake s effortless triumph over mainstream rap excess on his recent 5am in toronto , drake gave himself an origin story my weight up i refused to wait up i started a new race and that s true by creating his own sound , and lane , he ensured no one could best him and by being consistently innovative and great , he ensured that his outlier sound would take over hiphop s center he s winning under the new rules , and the old ones , too so drake is defiant about his place in the pecking order now paris morton music 2 , the final song on nothing was the same , is all about that i'm the big homie they still be trying to lil' bro me , dog like i should fall in line tough drake is n't having it

president obama mr speaker , mr vice president , members of congress , fellow citizens fiftyone years ago , john f kennedy declared to this chamber that the constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress it is my task , he said , to report the state of the union to improve it is the task of us all tonight , thanks to the grit and determination of the american people , there is much progress to report after a decade of grinding war , our brave men and women in uniform are coming home after years of grueling recession , our businesses have created over six million new jobs we buy more american cars than we have in five years , and less foreign oil than we have in twenty our housing market is healing , our stock market is rebounding , and consumers , patients , and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before together , we have cleared away the rubble of crisis , and can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger but we gather here knowing that there are millions of americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded our economy is adding jobs but too many people still ca n't find fulltime employment corporate profits have rocketed to alltime highs but for more than a decade , wages and incomes have barely budged it is our generation s task , then , to reignite the true engine of america s economic growth a rising , thriving middle class it is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities , you can get ahead , no matter where you come from , what you look like , or who you love it is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many , and not just the few that it encourages free enterprise , rewards individual initiative , and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation the american people do n't expect government to solve every problem they do n't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue but they do expect us to put the nation s interests before party they do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can for they know that america moves forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery over the last few years , both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than 25 trillion mostly through spending cuts , but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of americans as a result , we are more than halfway towards the goal of 4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances now we need to finish the job and the question is , how \? in 2011 , congress passed a law saying that if both parties could n't agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal , about a trillion dollars' worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year these sudden , harsh , arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness they 'd devastate priorities like education , energy , and medical research they would certainly slow our recovery , and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs that s why democrats , republicans , business leaders , and economists have already said that these cuts , known here in washington as the sequester , are a really bad idea now , some in this congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training medicare and social security benefits that idea is even worse yes , the biggest driver of our longterm debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population and those of us who care deeply about programs like medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms otherwise , our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children , and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations but we ca n't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful we wo n't grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling , or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers , cops , and firefighters most americans democrats , republicans , and independents understand that we ca n't just cut our way to prosperity they know that broadbased economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction , with spending cuts and revenue , and with everybody doing their fair share and that s the approach i offer tonight on medicare , i'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan simpsonbowles commission already , the affordable care act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs the reforms i'm proposing go even further we 'll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors we 'll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for medicare , because our medical bills should n't be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive and i am open to additional reforms from both parties , so long as they do n't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement our government should n't make promises we cannot keep but we must keep the promises we 've already made to hit the rest of our deficit reduction target , we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested , and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the welloff and wellconnected after all , why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks \? how is that fair \? how does that promote growth \? now is our best chance for bipartisan , comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit the american people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms , and more time expanding and hiring a tax code that ensures billionaires with highpowered accountants ca n't pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas , and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in america that s what tax reform can deliver that s what we can do together i realize that tax reform and entitlement reform wo n't be easy the politics will be hard for both sides none of us will get 100 percent of what we want but the alternative will cost us jobs , hurt our economy , and visit hardship on millions of hardworking americans so let s set party interests aside , and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future and let s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors the greatest nation on earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next let s agree , right here , right now , to keep the people s government open , pay our bills on time , and always uphold the full faith and credit of the united states of america the american people have worked too hard , for too long , rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another now , most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda but let s be clear deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan a growing economy that creates good , middleclass jobs that must be the north star that guides our efforts every day , we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation how do we attract more jobs to our shores \? how do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs \? and how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living \? a year and a half ago , i put forward an american jobs act that independent economists said would create more than one million new jobs i thank the last congress for passing some of that agenda , and i urge this congress to pass the rest tonight , i 'll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago let me repeat nothing i'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime it s not a bigger government we need , but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broadbased growth our first priority is making america a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing after shedding jobs for more than 10 years , our manufacturers have added about 500 , 000 jobs over the past three caterpillar is bringing jobs back from japan ford is bringing jobs back from mexico after locating plants in other countries like china , intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home and this year , apple will start making macs in america again there are things we can do , right now , to accelerate this trend last year , we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in youngstown , ohio a onceshuttered warehouse is now a stateofthe art lab where new workers are mastering the 3d printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything there s no reason this ca n't happen in other towns so tonight , i'm announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs , where businesses will partner with the departments of defense and energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of hightech jobs and i ask this congress to help create a network of fifteen of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made in america if we want to make the best products , we also have to invest in the best ideas every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned 140 to our economy today , our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to alzheimer s developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs devising new material to make batteries ten times more powerful now is not the time to gut these jobcreating investments in science and innovation now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the space race and today , no area holds more promise than our investments in american energy after years of talking about it , we are finally poised to control our own energy future we produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years we have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas , and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar with tens of thousands of good , american jobs to show for it we produce more natural gas than ever before and nearly everyone s energy bill is lower because of it and over the last four years , our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen but for the sake of our children and our future , we must do more to combat climate change yes , it s true that no single event makes a trend but the fact is , the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15 heat waves , droughts , wildfires , and floods all are now more frequent and intense we can choose to believe that superstorm sandy , and the most severe drought in decades , and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it s too late the good news is , we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth i urge this congress to pursue a bipartisan , marketbased solution to climate change , like the one john mccain and joe lieberman worked on together a few years ago but if congress wo n't act soon to protect future generations , i will i will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take , now and in the future , to reduce pollution , prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change , and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy four years ago , other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it we 've begun to change that last year , wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in america so let s generate even more solar energy gets cheaper by the year so let s drive costs down even further as long as countries like china keep going allin on clean energy , so must we in the meantime , the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence that s why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits but i also want to work with this congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and water indeed , much of our newfound energy is drawn from lands and waters that we , the public , own together so tonight , i propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an energy security trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good if a nonpartisan coalition of ceos and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea , then so can we let s take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we 've put up with for far too long i'm also issuing a new goal for america let s cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next twenty years the states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make it happen america s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair ask any ceo where they 'd rather locate and hire a country with deteriorating roads and bridges , or one with highspeed rail and internet hightech schools and selfhealing power grids the ceo of siemens america a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to north carolina has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure , they 'll bring even more jobs and i know that you want these jobcreating projects in your districts i 've seen you all at the ribboncuttings tonight , i propose a fixitfirst program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs , like the nearly 70 , 000 structurally deficient bridges across the country and to make sure taxpayers do n't shoulder the whole burden , i'm also proposing a partnership to rebuild america that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most modern ports to move our goods modern pipelines to withstand a storm modern schools worthy of our children let s prove that there is no better place to do business than the united states of america and let s start right away part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector today , our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007 home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years , home purchases are up nearly 50 percent , and construction is expanding again but even with mortgage rates near a 50year low , too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected too many families who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no that s holding our entire economy back , and we need to fix it right now , there s a bill in this congress that would give every responsible homeowner in america the chance to save 3 , 000 a year by refinancing at today s rates democrats and republicans have supported it before what are we waiting for \? take a vote , and send me that bill right now , overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home what s holding us back \? let s streamline the process , and help our economy grow these initiatives in manufacturing , energy , infrastructure , and housing will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs but none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs and that has to start at the earliest possible age study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning , the better he or she does down the road but today , fewer than 3 in 10 four yearolds are enrolled in a highquality preschool program most middleclass parents ca n't afford a few hundred bucks a week for private preschool and for poor kids who need help the most , this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives tonight , i propose working with states to make highquality preschool available to every child in america every dollar we invest in highquality early education can save more than seven dollars later on by boosting graduation rates , reducing teen pregnancy , even reducing violent crime in states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children , like georgia or oklahoma , studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level , graduate high school , hold a job , and form more stable families of their own so let s do what works , and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind let s give our kids that chance let s also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job right now , countries like germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges , so that they 're ready for a job at schools like ptech in brooklyn , a collaboration between new york public schools , the city university of new york , and ibm , students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate degree in computers or engineering we need to give every american student opportunities like this four years ago , we started race to the top a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards , for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year tonight , i'm announcing a new challenge to redesign america s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a hightech economy we 'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers , and create classes that focus on science , technology , engineering , and math the skills today s employers are looking for to fill jobs right now and in the future now , even with better high schools , most young people will need some higher education it s a simple fact the more education you have , the more likely you are to have a job and work your way into the middle class but today , skyrocketing costs price way too many young people out of a higher education , or saddle them with unsustainable debt through tax credits , grants , and better loans , we have made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years but taxpayers cannot continue to subsidize the soaring cost of higher education colleges must do their part to keep costs down , and it s our job to make sure they do tonight , i ask congress to change the higher education act , so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid and tomorrow , my administration will release a new college scorecard that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria where you can get the most bang for your educational buck to grow our middle class , our citizens must have access to the education and training that today s jobs require but we also have to make sure that america remains a place where everyone who s willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving , hopeful immigrants and right now , leaders from the business , labor , law enforcement , and faith communities all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform real reform means strong border security , and we can build on the progress my administration has already made putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history , and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship a path that includes passing a background check , paying taxes and a meaningful penalty , learning english , and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally and real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods , reduce bureaucracy , and attract the highlyskilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy in other words , we know what needs to be done as we speak , bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill , and i applaud their efforts now let s get this done send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months , and i will sign it right away but we ca n't stop there we know our economy is stronger when our wives , mothers , and daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace , and free from the fear of domestic violence today , the senate passed the violence against women act that joe biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago i urge the house to do the same and i ask this congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts , and finally pass the paycheck fairness act this year we know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day s work with honest wages but today , a fulltime worker making the minimum wage earns 14 , 500 a year even with the tax relief we 've put in place , a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line that s wrong that s why , since the last time this congress raised the minimum wage , nineteen states have chosen to bump theirs even higher tonight , let s declare that in the wealthiest nation on earth , no one who works fulltime should have to live in poverty , and raise the federal minimum wage to 900 an hour this single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families it could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank rent or eviction scraping by or finally getting ahead for businesses across the country , it would mean customers with more money in their pockets in fact , working folks should n't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while ceo pay has never been higher so here s an idea that governor romney and i actually agreed on last year let s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living , so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on tonight , let s also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work , it s virtually impossible to get ahead factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up inescapable pockets of poverty , urban and rural , where young adults are still fighting for their first job america is not a place where chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny and that is why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them let s offer incentives to companies that hire americans who 've got what it takes to fill that job opening , but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance let s put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in rundown neighborhoods and this year , my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardesthit towns in america to get these communities back on their feet we 'll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety , education , and housing we 'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest and we 'll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for lowincome couples , and doing more to encourage fatherhood because what makes you a man is n't the ability to conceive a child it s having the courage to raise one stronger families stronger communities a stronger america it is this kind of prosperity broad , shared , and built on a thriving middle class that has always been the source of our progress at home it is also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world tonight , we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us because of them , we can say with confidence that america will complete its mission in afghanistan , and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al qaeda already , we have brought home 33 , 000 of our brave servicemen and women this spring , our forces will move into a support role , while afghan security forces take the lead tonight , i can announce that over the next year , another 34 , 000 american troops will come home from afghanistan this drawdown will continue and by the end of next year , our war in afghanistan will be over beyond 2014 , america s commitment to a unified and sovereign afghanistan will endure , but the nature of our commitment will change we are negotiating an agreement with the afghan government that focuses on two missions training and equipping afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos , and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al qaeda and their affiliates today , the organization that attacked us on 9 11 is a shadow of its former self different al qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged from the arabian peninsula to africa the threat these groups pose is evolving but to meet this threat , we do n't need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad , or occupy other nations instead , we will need to help countries like yemen , libya , and somalia provide for their own security , and help allies who take the fight to terrorists , as we have in mali and , where necessary , through a range of capabilities , we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to americans as we do , we must enlist our values in the fight that is why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism operations throughout , we have kept congress fully informed of our efforts i recognize that in our democracy , no one should just take my word that we 're doing things the right way so , in the months ahead , i will continue to engage with congress to ensure not only that our targeting , detention , and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances , but that our efforts are even more transparent to the american people and to the world of course , our challenges do n't end with al qaeda america will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world s most dangerous weapons the regime in north korea must know that they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations provocations of the sort we saw last night will only isolate them further , as we stand by our allies , strengthen our own missile defense , and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats likewise , the leaders of iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution , because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations , and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon at the same time , we will engage russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals , and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead america must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyberattacks we know hackers steal people s identities and infiltrate private email we know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid , our financial institutions , and our air traffic control systems we cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy that s why , earlier today , i signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing , and developing standards to protect our national security , our jobs , and our privacy now , congress must act as well , by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks even as we protect our people , we should remember that today s world presents not only dangers , but opportunities to boost american exports , support american jobs , and level the playing field in the growing markets of asia , we intend to complete negotiations on a transpacific partnership and tonight , i am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the european union because trade that is free and fair across the atlantic supports millions of goodpaying american jobs we also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all in many places , people live on little more than a dollar a day so the united states will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy and empowering women by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to feed , power , and educate themselves by saving the world s children from preventable deaths and by realizing the promise of an aidsfree generation above all , america must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change i saw the power of hope last year in rangoon when aung san suu kyi welcomed an american president into the home where she had been imprisoned for years when thousands of burmese lined the streets , waving american flags , including a man who said , there is justice and law in the united states i want our country to be like that in defense of freedom , we will remain the anchor of strong alliances from the americas to africa from europe to asia in the middle east , we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights , and support stable transitions to democracy the process will be messy , and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like egypt but we can and will insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people we will keep the pressure on a syrian regime that has murdered its own people , and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every syrian and we will stand steadfast with israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace these are the messages i will deliver when i travel to the middle east next month all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk our diplomats , our intelligence officers , and the men and women of the united states armed forces as long as i'm commanderinchief , we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad , and we will maintain the best military in the world we will invest in new capabilities , even as we reduce waste and wartime spending we will ensure equal treatment for all service members , and equal benefits for their families gay and straight we will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters , because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat we will keep faith with our veterans investing in worldclass care , including mental health care , for our wounded warriors supporting our military families and giving our veterans the benefits , education , and job opportunities they have earned and i want to thank my wife michelle and dr jill biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they serve us but defending our freedom is not the job of our military alone we must all do our part to make sure our godgiven rights are protected here at home that includes our most fundamental right as citizens the right to vote when any americans no matter where they live or what their party are denied that right simply because they ca n't wait for five , six , seven hours just to cast their ballot , we are betraying our ideals that s why , tonight , i'm announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in america and i'm asking two longtime experts in the field , who 've recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for governor romney s campaign , to lead it we can fix this , and we will the american people demand it and so does our democracy of course , what i 've said tonight matters little if we do n't come together to protect our most precious resource our children it has been two months since newtown i know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence but this time is different overwhelming majorities of americans americans who believe in the 2nd amendment have come together around commonsense reform like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets , because they are tired of being outgunned each of these proposals deserves a vote in congress if you want to vote no , that s your choice but these proposals deserve a vote because in the two months since newtown , more than a thousand birthdays , graduations , and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun one of those we lost was a young girl named hadiya pendleton she was 15 years old she loved fig newtons and lip gloss she was a majorette she was so good to her friends , they all thought they were her best friend just three weeks ago , she was here , in washington , with her classmates , performing for her country at my inauguration and a week later , she was shot and killed in a chicago park after school , just a mile away from my house hadiya s parents , nate and cleo , are in this chamber tonight , along with more than two dozen americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence they deserve a vote gabby giffords deserves a vote the families of newtown deserve a vote the families of aurora deserve a vote the families of oak creek , and tucson , and blacksburg , and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence they deserve a simple vote our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country indeed , no laws , no initiatives , no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges i 've outlined tonight but we were never sent here to be perfect we were sent here to make what difference we can , to secure this nation , expand opportunity , and uphold our ideals through the hard , often frustrating , but absolutely necessary work of selfgovernment we were sent here to look out for our fellow americans the same way they look out for one another , every single day , usually without fanfare , all across this country we should follow their example we should follow the example of a new york city nurse named menchu sanchez when hurricane sandy plunged her hospital into darkness , her thoughts were not with how her own home was faring they were with the twenty precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe we should follow the example of a north miami woman named desiline victor when she arrived at her polling place , she was told the wait to vote might be six hours and as time ticked by , her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet , but whether folks like her would get to have their say hour after hour , a throng of people stayed in line in support of her because desiline is 102 years old and they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read i voted we should follow the example of a police officer named brian murphy when a gunman opened fire on a sikh temple in wisconsin , and brian was the first to arrive , he did not consider his own safety he fought back until help arrived , and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the americans worshiping inside even as he lay bleeding from twelve bullet wounds when asked how he did that , brian said , that s just the way we 're made that s just the way we 're made we may do different jobs , and wear different uniforms , and hold different views than the person beside us but as americans , we all share the same proud title we are citizens it s a word that does n't just describe our nationality or legal status it describes the way we 're made it describes what we believe it captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others and that well into our third century as a nation , it remains the task of us all , as citizens of these united states , to be the authors of the next great chapter in our american story thank you , god bless you , and god bless the united states of america
bill belichick made headlines in the days leading up to this game when he said that the nfl should make all plays subject to challenge after the patriots' highly improbable comeback sunday , browns coach rob chudzinski would probably concur tom brady s gamewinning touchdown pass to danny amendola was set up by a in the end zone downfield pass interference is by far the most impactful penalty an nfl official can call the league has not made it reviewable because it is a judgment call which , if you stop and think about it , is silly to a certain degree , every call is a judgment call the idea that judgment calls ca n't be reviewed was instituted back when replay itself was first instituted at the time , the league had reason to worry that replays would make for bad television viewing and cast an unfriendly spotlight on officials as it turned out , hd television came around and brought to life all the details you could want in instant replay though the whole review process takes too long , fans , for the most part , enjoy the debate and scrutiny of it that s why , for example , the former head of league officials , mike pereira , has found a second career working as a replay analyst for fox and as for the unfriendly spotlight on officials that the league was probably worried about , well , it s here regardless in fact , as this writeup \( and countless others \) prove , that spotlight can be harsher when plays are n't reviewable maybe not every play should be reviewable as belichick proposes , but officials should have the opportunity to correct their mistakes on pass interference if you 're inclined to fill out a pro bowl ballot , make sure you check the box for dolphins tight end charles clay the thirdyear pro has been the only true source of versatility for miami s offense his 97 yards and 2 touchdowns receiving were the difference in the win at snowy pittsburgh , just as his 91 yards and touchdown were the difference in miami s win over san diego four weeks ago clay has over 80 yards in three of his last four outings , and if he accelerates his pace just a bit these final three weeks , he could push for a 1 , 000yard season not to be a scrooge , but here s one voice wishing the nfl had postponed , or at least delayed , the eagleslions winter wonderland affair on sunday yes , it was sort of fun watching both teams pummel each other in the snow but it was n't football the field could barely be seen , let alone navigated with any semblance of grace or agility and not that it should matter from the nfl s standpoint , but these happened to be two teams built exactly the opposite of how you 'd build a team for playing in the snow the eagles and the lions have finesse offenses and defenses that hinge on linemen being able to fire off the ball none of those factors were in play sunday few actual football factors were the talk was about whether the packers should just shut down aaron rodgers for the season but with detroit s loss and green bay s win , if rodgers returns in week 15 \( big if \) , he 'll be doing so for a team that s just a halfgame out of first place in the nfc north it almost was n't that way , as the threewin falcons gave the packers a good fight the falcons had a chance to attempt a goahead field goal , but on fourthand5 , tight end tony gonzalez , for one of the few times in his hall of fame career , failed to make a contested catch give credit to packers backup utility defensive back jarrett bush , who had blanket coverage bush also had the gamesealing interception on matt ryan s desperation heave a few minutes later and , ladies and gentleman , is why the ravens gave joe flacco 120 million while toby gerhardt s late 41yard touchdown was impressive , and jacoby jones s ensuing 79yard kick return was more impressive , and cordarrelle patterson s 79yard touchdown was more impressive yet , none were as impressive as flacco s fiveplay , 80yard gamewinning drive in the snow even with the questionable pass interference call against minnesota s chad greenway , that drive was more about good offense and poised quarterbacking , and less about fluky football a week after mishandling the confusion of the firstdown chains at the end of the redskinsgiants game , referee jeff triplette had another blunder , erroneously awarding benjarvus greenellis a touchdown after replays clearly showed that he had gone to the ground after a backfield shoelace swipe by colts defensive lineman josh chapman what s baffling is the call on the field had been correct triplette overturned it fortunately for him , the call did not have a direct impact on the outcome in fact , with the colts unable to stop the bengals' power running game , it did not even have much of an indirect impact nevertheless , for a second straight week , the league will have to issue a news release about one of its best officials geno smith deserves a lot of credit for his first professionallooking quarterbacking performance since october despite what popular opinion might hold , the raiders are not an easy defense to play against true , it s a defense that s short on talent , but the talent is no shorter than that of the jets' offense schematically , the raiders do a lot with coverage rotations and disguise the type of ploys that a young pocket qb would be vulnerable against good work by smith in completing 16 of 25 pass attempts the bucs got their fourth victory in five weeks despite netting just 81 yards through the air as you might guess , the bucs' defense made some plays at the expense of the bills rookie quarterback ej manuel there were two interceptions by linebacker lavonte david , one by mason foster \( his second in three weeks \) and one by the rookie corner johnthan banks \( who has lately looked good in underneath man coverage and shows a feel for playing to his safety help \) there were also seven sacks recorded by seven bucs defenders it sounds as if mike shanahan wo n't be the redskins' head much longer whether he stays or goes , you can bet a new specialteams coach is on the horizon keith burns s already beleaguered coverage units gave up two more touchdowns in the redskins' embarrassing home loss to the chiefs a 74yard punt return to dexter mccluster and a 95yard kickoff return to quintin demps jim harbaugh and greg roman had a great game plan for keeping colin kaepernick comfortable the overwhelming majority of san francisco s pass plays , especially in the first half , targeted receivers on the outside , where the seahawks play straight mantoman coverage that meant all kaepernick had to read was the oneonone action between his receiver and the defender if the passes had been inside , where the seahawks play zone , kaepernick would have had to read multiple defenders the fact that harbaugh and roman took this approach suggests they remain leery of kaepernick s fieldreading acumen the seahawks' grabhappy corners are very difficult to defeat outside something the niners were reminded of when 9 of kaepernick s first 14 passes fell incomplete and kaepernick still had trouble at times identifying underneath zone defenders who widened their coverage to the outside there were a handful of throws that could have been picked off \( and one that was , by byron maxwell , who had a tremendous game \) but kaepernick remained just comfortable enough throughout the afternoon , which is why san francisco s passing attack stayed competitive it helped that roman sprinkled in a few designed quarterback runs in the red zone including the killer qb sweep behind two pullblocking linemen to convert the thirdand7 that set up the gamewinning field goal roman played to kaepernick s athletic instincts by allowing him to run without first making a read really , playing to his athletic instinct is what getting kaepernick comfortable is all about how do the peyton manning naysayers explain this \? in a game where the temperature at kickoff was 18 degrees \( wind chill 11 \) , the supposedly coldweatheraverse quarterback attempted a careerhigh 59 passes , 39 of which were caught , 4 of which went for touchdowns and none of which were intercepted against the titans just like in the first meeting against the chiefs manning enjoyed stellar pass protection against a typically manbased defense that s known for its creative pressure the broncos made the titans more vanilla , and on 59 dropbacks , manning was hit just once perhaps the biggest upset on sunday came out of glendale many expected the now 85 cardinals to beat the rams , but no one expected the cardinals' offensive line to keep the rams' ferocious front four almost completely off carson palmer the bangedup veteran quarterback \( elbow \) was hit only twice , and the one sack he endured came from linebacker alec ogletree , not a defensive lineman rams defensive end robert quinn , the nfl s best edgerusher this season , was kept to three tackles and one qb hit his pro bowl caliber counterpart , chris long , was held to two tackles the cardinals gave their unathletic offensive tackles plenty of help , not just with chipblocks and other doubleteam concepts , but quick passing plays that also helped palmer , who completed 27 of his 32 attempts , including all 12 to larry fitzgerald chargers wideout keenan allen had only three catches but two were in the end zone a thirdround rookie , he is gradually becoming philip rivers s goto wideout , particularly on third down allen does not have great physical tools , but he runs polished routes \( especially for his age \) and is capable of making contested catches in other words , he 'd be a great giants receiver three years ago the saints blitzed with six rushers on carolina s first thirdandmedium cam newton escaped pressure , and with the saints' mantoman defenders having their backs to the ball , rushed for 19 yards after that , rob ryan was more judicious in his blitz calls , leaving newton in the pocket with three and fourman rushes newton did his best to play with patience and poise , but he appeared increasingly less comfortable as the game progressed either newton was n't anticipating open receivers clearly or the saints' man coverage was stifling throughout the night \( probably a combination of both \) on the other side , new orleans s offense may have set the blueprint for attacking carolina s defense spread formations the saints widened their offensive sets , which widened the panthers' zone coverages , placing more of an onus on the defensive backs the plan worked only because the saints' offensive line , aided by the chipblocks that are naturally built into sean payton s system , kept the panthers' potent fourman rush at bay
soon after appointed him director of national intelligence in 2009 , called for a tally of the number of government officials or employees who had been prosecuted for leaking national security secrets he was dismayed by what he found in the previous four years , the record showed , to the justice department not one had led to an indictment that scorecard was pretty shocking to all of us , mr blair said so in a series of phone calls and meetings , he and attorney general fashioned a more aggressive strategy to punish anyone who leaked national security information that endangered intelligencegathering methods and sources my background is in the navy , and it is good to hang an admiral once in a while as an example to the others , said mr blair , who left the administration in 2010 we were hoping to get somebody and make people realize that there are consequences to this and it needed to stop the obama administration has done its best to define those consequences , with an aggressive focus on leaks and leakers that has led to more than twice as many prosecutions as there were in all previous administrations combined it also led to on friday when a federal appeals court accepted the justice department s argument that the first amendment does not protect reporters from having to reveal the sources suspected of leaking information to them in tracing the origins of this effort , present and former government officials said the focus on leaks began at the administration s highest levels and was driven by pressure from the intelligence agencies and members of congress an unprecedented cascade of disclosures , including hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables made public by wikileaks , according to these officials , gave the search for leakers a growing sense of urgency , while technological advances made the job of finding them easier and prosecutors until recently were given more latitude to comb through journalists' records to hunt for suspects the charges filed last month , the former national security agency contractor now holed up in a moscow airport , are the seventh leakrelated prosecution brought by the justice department and the department s next case may be aimed at just the kind of toplevel target that mr blair said he had hoped for james e cartwright , a retired general who was vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff until august 2011 general cartwright has been identified as a focus of an investigation into the disclosure of classified information about americanled cyberattacks on  supporters of the crackdown even those with qualms about seeking evidence from journalists say a culture of leaking must be reined in to protect covert sources and highrisk intelligence operations and reassure allies that it is safe to share intelligence somebody finally said this has got to stop , said john d negroponte , a former diplomat and director of national intelligence under george w bush maybe if there are more prosecutions , it will but critics argue that the cartwright case , and now the appeals court ruling , show how the antileak campaign has gone too far , producing a chilling effect on news gathering without deterring leakers mr snowden has said he was inspired by the deeds of pfc bradley manning , who is facing a courtmartial after divulging the diplomatic cables to wikileaks i think it has gotten away from them , said morton h halperin , who served in national security or diplomatic positions in three previous administrations if the president does n't fix this , i think his claim that he understands the importance of balancing the first amendment against claims of national security will lack any credibility implicitly at least , mr holder seemed to acknowledge some of the criticism this month when he longstanding on seeking evidence from journalists he said those restrictions will help ensure the proper balance is struck when pursuing investigations into unauthorized disclosures mr holder s move came in response to a torrent of criticism after the revelations this spring that prosecutors had secretly subpoenaed the phone logs for more than 20 phone lines of the associated press in one leak inquiry and two days of phone logs of a fox news reporter , james rosen , in another investigation aimed at a state department adviser , stephen jinwoo kim prosecutors also obtained a courtordered search warrant for mr rosen s emails by identifying him as a criminal coconspirator of mr kim s but mr holder s conciliatory message was seemingly undermined by the justice department s success in overturning a lower court s ruling that a reporter for the new york times , james risen , had a first amendment right to refuse to reveal his sources in the trial of a former cia analyst , jeffrey sterling mr sterling was charged in 2010 with disclosing classified information to mr risen about a covert operation to deceive iranian scientists described in mr risen s 2006 book , state of war mr risen has previously vowed to go to jail to protect his sources on saturday he said in a statement , i remain as resolved as ever to continue fighting the targeting of general cartwright in the investigation of disclosures about cyberattacks on iran also represents an escalation of effort if charged , he would be by far the most senior official ever to face criminal prosecution for divulging information to the news media other highranking officials have faced minor criminal charges for mishandling information , but only lowtomidlevel analysts , contract workers and technicians have been indicted on charges of releasing secrets to journalists the closest parallel would be the case against i lewis libby jr , the former chief of staff to vice president dick cheney who was convicted in 2007 of lying to a federal grand jury and to fbi agents investigating the unmasking of a covert cia operative to a newspaper columnist the cartwright case stands alone , said steven aftergood , who studies government secrecy for the nonprofit federation of american scientists it is a sign that the administration is not backing off its antileak crusade it is still going full tilt general cartwright has not commented on the reports that he is being investigated , but his lawyer , gregory b craig , has said any suggestion that his client betrayed his country is preposterous president bush also faced damaging leaks during his tenure but his justice department prosecuted only one official under the espionage act for disclosing national security secrets , a pentagon analyst first investigated in 2004 and convicted in 2006 as a conservative , president bush would have faced a greater public backlash had he sought to imprison leakers , said gabriel schoenfeld , a senior scholar with the hudson institute , a conservativeleaning research organization mr bush was not willing to spend the political capital , mr schoenfeld said this president is very hawkish on this so far , the obama administration has won two felony convictions for unauthorized disclosure of national security secrets private manning has also pleaded guilty to 10 offenses and is now being tried in military court on others a fourth felony prosecution crumbled , producing a minor misdemeanor conviction , and mr holder has privately said he regrets pursuing it in june , his department s record number of leak prosecutions was a logical legal response to an increase in both the number and seriousness of leaks but in interviews , former prosecutors and other administration and congressional officials offered a different perspective though the justice department issued no explicit directive to pursue leakers more vigorously , according to these officials , the climate in which leaks were judged changed markedly as a new team of national security officials joined the obama administration and quickly ran headon into what it saw as distressing lapses in controlling state secrets there was a lot of pressure to use every possible investigative tool , said one senior former prosecutor who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak for the justice department according to mr blair , the effort got under way after fox news reported in june 2009 that american intelligence had gleaned word from within north korea of plans for an imminent nuclear test a disclosure that eventually led to the indictment of mr kim the report infuriated the central intelligence agency not only because it indicated that the united states was privy to the private discussions of north korean leaders , but also because it was broadcast mere hours after a classified report with that information had been distributed to intelligence officials in subsequent meetings and phone calls , mr blair said , he and mr holder , who declined a request for an interview , agreed that leaks were flourishing partly because the government was too passive in addressing them of 153 referrals to the justice department of national security leaks during president bush s second term , only 24 had led to fbi investigations in half of those cases , investigators had identified suspects , but none of them had faced charges , although two investigations were in an advanced stage and ultimately produced indictments in 2010 mr holder s attitude , the same as mine , was to speed up the process and make it more effective , mr blair said so , yes , that would mean more aggressive prosecution the justice department imposed a tight deadline to decide whether to open criminal inquiries into leaks , shortening to just three weeks a review process that had often dragged on for months leaks considered unworthy of prosecution were marked for administrative inquiries underscoring the administration s determination , robert m bryant , mr blair s national counterintelligence executive , was put in charge of stanching leaks the white house has kept a careful distance from the justice department prosecutions , but president obama seemed unwavering in his support for them when government transparency advocates told him in march 2011 that chasing whistleblowers was sullying his record , the president disagreed , saying some disclosures had been very damaging to national security and members of congress continuously clamored for a tougher approach at a closed hearing in december 2009 , members of the senate select committee on intelligence , led by dianne feinstein , democrat of california , scolded mr holder , mr blair and the fbi director , robert s mueller , saying they had not adequately protected national security secrets a tipping point was reached in 2009 , said one knowledgeable senate aide , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not an official spokesman there was an official change of policy mr blair said , we had to do 50 pushups and promise to do better past overreaching notwithstanding , the cartwright investigation suggests that zeal has not waned the inquiry was prompted by a detailed account of a series of united states and israeliled cyberattacks on iran s nuclear program , in in the new york times and in published days later , both by david e sanger , a times reporter part of the operation , called olympic games , was revealed two years earlier because of a programming error , but much of it remained highly classified , setting off an aggressive search for the source or sources of mr sanger s information lucy a dalglish , a media lawyer and the dean of journalism at the university of maryland , says that case and others carry a strong message they are not going to give up on national security investigations , and they are still going to go after reporters' information if they think they need to , she said
in early march 1863 , an officer in terre haute , ind , ordered two veteran army sergeants to cross into clark county in nearby eastern illinois to carry out a peculiar , though increasingly common , order arrest a group of union army deserters it wasn t an easy assignment the men found swarms of deserters , but also met armed resistance from local residents who were fostering the runaway soldiers , and were even shot at a few times by then , illinois , indiana and ohio were lousy with deserters union maj gen william rosecrans , commander of the army of the cumberland in central tennessee , reported that 30 , 000 soldiers from those states were absent from his army , most of whom had fled due north soldiers had slunk away from the army in droves , tired of the war that dragged on and on many of them had been encouraged to desert by family , friends and neighbors at home the region had a high population of southern sympathizers and antiwar democrats who , in a concerted letterwriting campaign directed at soldiers , lashed out at president lincoln s recent emancipation proclamation and other administration measures to conquer the rebel states writers vowed to protect deserters from arrest , adding that they were organized , armed and ready to defend them in response , army commanders issued orders to capture the deserters post commanders in the old northwest , today called the midwest , sent small detachments of troops into small towns to hunt down , arrest and return deserters as they did in the clark county operation but as the two sergeants soon learned , things were rarely so simple the restive region was the front line of civil war in the north after successfully capturing several deserters , the army sergeants took them to a village inn to rest before returning to terre haute that night the mother of one of the deserters sought the legal advice of a local attorney , who told her to obtain a warrant from a sympathetic justice of the peace to arrest the sergeants themselves , for kidnapping the next morning , the clark county sheriff arrived at the inn , arrested the sergeants and took them and the captured deserters to marshall , the county seat on sunday morning , march 8 , judge charles h constable heard the complaints of the deserters constable asserted that the sergeants had no authority to cross the state line to make arrests and had violated illinois state rights he held them on bonds to appear in court and answer to the charge of kidnapping he then released the deserters the marylandborn constable had been a prominent attorney in illinois for years , having ridden the judicial circuit with abraham lincoln he and lincoln had been friends and fellow whigs , the latter writing letters of recommendation for him but in the early 1850s constable complained of whig party ingratitude to its longtime servants lincoln resented the fling at his party and the two nearly came to blows soon after , constable joined the democratic party and later was elected judge in the heavily democratic area word of the arrest of the sergeants and release of the deserters soon reached army headquarters in indianapolis col henry b carrington , post commander in the city , sprang into action he wired both the war department in washington and his immediate commander , brig gen horatio g wright , of the department of the ohio at cincinnati wright also wired secretary of war edwin m stanton about this alarming instance of civil interference in military matters he planned , he wrote , to rearrest the deserters , free the sergeants and arrest the judge and hold him in military custody no countermanding orders came from washington given the green light , wright ordered carrington to send a strong force to marshall to make the arrests and liberate the sergeants carrington took charge of the expedition himself a connecticutborn , yaleeducated attorney from ohio with close ties to treasury secretary salmon p chase , he had been appointed colonel of the newly formed 18th united states infantry regiment in the early months of the war in august 1862 , the department assigned him to oversee the mustering of indiana volunteer troops in indianapolis , where he employed his keen organizational skills to raise new units and he was already well aware of the problem of deserters in december , he had discovered that soldiers in camps around indianapolis were members of secret political organizations that aimed to obstruct the war effort and encourage desertion alert to the political stakes of the illinois matter , carrington planned his actions carefully he first sent a detachment of troops to rearrest the deserters in clark county to arrest constable , he took pains to ensure the secrecy of his movements , instructing the indianapolis telegraph office to transmit no messages mentioning him a force of 200 infantrymen and 25 dismounted cavalry troopers \( the latter dressed in civilian clothing \) departed indianapolis on a special train on the night of march 11 , loading west of the city to avoid observation reaching terre haute after midnight , they disembarked , ate an early breakfast and , on a freezing night on icy , rutted roads , began a march across the state line to marshall , about 15 miles away the cavalry , on borrowed mounts , rode ahead with orders to prevent word of the troops advance s reaching marshall they also had orders to filter into the courtroom and secure seats commanding the room , the day the sergeants hearing was scheduled carrington and the infantry marched into marshall after daylight and quickly surrounded the courthouse in the town square , allowing none to enter or leave the building no one inside was aware of the troops outside a regular army captain who accompanied the expedition later wrote that we took them completely by surprise four civilianclad troopers accompanied the colonel into the building , as he was expected to appear for the sergeants that day in the courtroom , the country prosecutor was just finishing his remarks to the special grand jury convened to indict the sergeants the two soldiers were present and , signaled by the troopers , rose from their seats and walked over to their comrades colonel carrington then stood up , politely introduced himself and informed the court that the courthouse was surrounded and judge constable was under arrest court adjourned while an affable constable hosted his captor to lunch , the loyal people of marshall happily treated the soldiers to an impromptu meal by midafternoon the troops began their march back to terre haute with their prisoner but by this time , an estimated 700 people presumably from the disloyal part of the local population had gathered in town , many of them armed and hostile and who fired indiscriminate shots but no collision occurred during his captivity in indianapolis , constable stayed in a hotel and had the freedom of the city on his word as a gentleman his arrest neatly accomplished , an intense debate commenced about what to do with him should he be tried by civil court or military commission \? the conversation involved some of the highestranking regional and national leaders , including caleb blood smith , lincoln s former secretary of the interior who had stepped down to take the federal judgeship in indiana , and john palmer usher , the incumbent secretary of the interior who happened to be visiting his terre haute home usher wrote to lincoln urging stern punishment for the president s erstwhile friend constable , noting particularly the rise in the northwest of the secret group called the knights of the golden circle , which was known to be arming to resist the new draft law and the arrests of deserters the judge advocate for the department of the ohio and legal adviser for general wright , maj rm corwine , voiced the army s grave concern about the increasing incidence of civil interference with military matters , especially the arrest of deserters he pointed out that local judges in ohio and indiana had , for partisan reasons , obstructed arrests this growing abuse had to be stopped , and he advocated that constable be tried by military commission but others wanted him before a civilian court , and the republican leaders in indianapolis had decided to forgo a military commission trial against a backdrop of violent events in indiana and illinois deadly clashes between troops and armed groups intent on protecting deserters occurred throughout the northwest partisan rancor in the legislatures verged on bloodshed in the farflung reaches of those states , opposition to the war was growing and challenged federal and state authorities ability to maintain order in the end , they decided to avoid provocative action , even at the risk of constable s getting off lightly constable went under guard to springfield , there to have a hearing before a federal district court judge , samuel h treat , a conservative democrat appointed to the bench in 1855 after a preliminary hearing on april 7 in which the federal prosecutor made only a desultory case , treat dismissed the charge and released constable the two sides were , for a moment , at rest in the days to come , however , maj gen ambrose e burnside would assume command of the department of the ohio and institute a crackdown on dissenting speech and combat unrest with military arrests and trials his policy served only to fan the flames of partisan opposition and invigorate democratic opposition to the war effort , exactly what the republicans in indianapolis sought to avoid in the coming months , constable s arrest became a cause c l bre for illinois democrats who opposed lincoln s war but soldiers and republicans targeted him for abuse , and his strongly democratic judicial circuit was the scene of much warrelated violence in august 1863 , a deadly gun battle occurred in danville between soldiers and antiwar groups in january 1864 , soldiers home on furlough mobbed constable on the streets of mattoon and forced him to take an oath of loyalty to the united states days later , a bloody gunfight broke out at paris between soldiers and organized bands in march , constable held court in charleston on the day of the infamous deadly ambush of soldiers on the courthouse square by armed antiwar partisans in the melee he fled for his life constable continued to serve as a judge , though after republican victories in the 1864 election , his circuit was significantly reduced he died in 1865

a 63 , tying the course record and nothing to sniff at , but history had eluded him jason dufner split the fairway with his drive on no 18 and stuck his approach shot within 15 feet of the hole a birdie putt gives him the first 62 in a major round ever what a day tiger woods walked off the 14th green with a par , his frustration even deeper he had a long eagle putt , which he knocked long he misread the comeback for birdie tied for 44th , woods must feel like this course is throwing a party , but forgot to invite him no 17 isn t going so smoothly for matt kuchar , who drove into the rough , hit his second shot into more rough near the green he was yelling for that shot to bounce out , but it was not following orders he has to get up and down from there to stay one back of the lead don t tell jason dufner that no 17 is a hard hole he hit the green , no problem with a hybrid on his approach shot he rolled the birdie putt just by the left edge tapin par ho hum tiger woods took out his driver on no 14 because , hey , what does he have to lose he reaches the green in one for an eagle putt a very long one , but an eagle putt nonetheless matt kuchar is greeted with chants of his last name at every green fans will get more chance to vent ahead , with kuchar now eight under par , one behind leader jason dufner a nice birdie on no 16 ensures that dufner , with 1718 next , is two pars

record in the morning , jason dufner is now on track to break it with a 63 he needs two pars on the final two holes to accomplish it jason dufner bounced back from his \( apparently mild \) disappointment on no 15 by knocking it stiff on no 16 and rolling in the 8footer for birdie to reach nine under piece of cake leader jason dufner could have added to his lead , but left a birdie putt hanging on the front edge on no 15 his reaction \? not much different than when he makes them burying his approach shot in the thick green short of the green , tiger woods fails to get up and down for par on no 11 and drops back to one over jim furyk snaps his birdie dry spell he hadn t had one since rolling in that ridiculously long putt on no 1 by draining one on no 10 that bumps him to seven under , one behind the lead for the fifth straight hole , robert garrigus walks off with a par on the latest , at no 16 , garrigus left his putt one turn from dropping into the hole for birdie his

growls at another par to his traditional greeting of kooooch from fans greenside , matt kuchar rolls in a longish birdie putt on no 12 to lift himself into the group at six under , one behind the lead robert garrigus , a huge hitter , tried to drive the green on the 323yard , par4 no 14 , and his ball was greeted by a tree to the right of the green with a thwack the ball , however , dropped straight down , adjacent to the green with a great shot to the green on the par3 no 11 , jason dufner joined leaders adam scott and robert garrigus at seven under tiger woods seemed likely to lose the momentum of two straight birdies when he drove into the rough on no 7 and his second shot nestled into deep rough short of a bunker short of the green but a flop shot out of the rough and a parsaving putt erased the doom two in a row for tiger he s only 29 players behind now the cheer you heard was from the tv production truck  dan jenkins \( danjenkinsgd \) 9 aug 13 tiger woods , wobbling on the edge of irrelevance in this tournament , has gotten himself back into the extended conversation if only because he s tiger woods a second straight birdie after a nice tee shot on par3 no 6 brings him to even par the tnt announcers are dusting off their best woods hyperbole for the occasion robert garrigus got back one of his dropped shots with a nice tee shot and birdie on the par3 no 11 he s back to seven under even tiger woods got into the birdie business with a nice approach and short putt on no 5 he , however , is still tied for 40th the leader board is starting to look like the new jersey turnpike at rush hour behind adam scott at seven under are four players at six under , one at five under , six at four under , four at three under , five at two under you get the picture the only thing missing is the honking robert garrigus has suddenly found bumps on his nice stroll around oak hill , with another wobbly hole he failed to save par again on no 10 the second straight bogey drops him back to six under , where he is tied with justin rose , jason dufner and jim furyk at least he has a lot of company in case you haven t noticed , the whole world is still in the tournament except phil and tiger  dan jenkins \( danjenkinsgd \) 9 aug 13 robert garrigus lipped out a par putt on no 9 and his bogey dropped him back to seven under and tied with adam scott , who is likely now

through seven holes 6 jim furyk , through three holes robert garrigus drains another long birdie putt on no 8 to grab the lead for himself at eight under tiger woods cannot save par after his adventures on the second hole robert garrigus , however , has the magic going and saves par out of that disastrous tee shot on no 6 in a few minutes time , jim furyk rammed in a birdie putt on no 1 from 45 feet , jason dufner had his 20plusfoot putt bounce over something in its path and pour into the hole anyway , and then kiradech aphibarnrat holed a pitch from the rough aside the no 16 green for a birdie furyk reached six under with his putt , as did dufner aphibarnrat is at three under oh , and paul casey just drained his third straight birdie to reach six under , too tiger woods sent his second straight tee shot into the rough , but got a little lucky that his shot out of there landed in a greenside bunker , a cushy little lie that beats hitting out of more rough stuff ah , the perils of major championship golf you re rolling along with four birdies in five holes , tie yourself for the lead and whack , one big duck hook brings you back to reality that s life for robert garrigus right now he just sent his drive on no 6 into the fans left of the fairway robert garrigus is making this look easy , a tapin birdie on the par3 no 5 is his fourth in five holes and now he s tied with adam scott at seven under tiger woods hit his very first shot off the tee into the rough , and although it wasn t far off the fairway , it was in deep enough trouble that he could only whack it back out into the fairway he did this with pure disgust on his face so , he s got that going early he had to get up and down from there for par , which he did with an 18foot putt jason dufner followed his eagle with a long putt for birdie on no 4 to jump to five under robert garrigus vaulted right past him to six under with three birdies in his first five holes phil mickelson the difficult thing about oak hill is that the greens are shallow and sloped back to front with the rain slowing the greens down , you can really attack it unfortunately my game was not sharp enough to attack it i wasn t sharp on the greens either i m constantly overreading them i just think this is a wonderful course and a wonderful setup it gives a chance for players who are playing great like adam and like justin to show it , and for players who aren t hitting it well like me , to fall back justin rose , on bouncing back from two opening bogeys i was just trying to hang on for dear life today there were spells when it was raining really hard out there hitting off the tee was really difficult then literally at the turn , the rain stopped and it was an easy game all of a sudden adam scott i felt like if i was really hot with the putter , i could have been quite a few better the course was playing very long when it was raining , so 68 is a good round amazing thing about mcilroyrory it rains during front nine , he s 5 the rain stops , he birdies four of six holes the guy is a gremlin  sam weinman \( samweinman \) 9 aug 13 adam scott had a chance to stroll into the clubhouse on a high with a final birdie , but missed his putt by a hair his round of 68 keeps him in the lead for the moment , but his face betrayed a bit of disappointment rose , on the other hand , might just skip off the course after two closing birdies made his 66 look even lovelier in hindsight his six birdies on the final nine really turned his round around he ll sleep well at six under jason dufner ignited quite a roar when his wedge shot from the fairway on the par4 no 2 hit the green long past the hole but rolled back resolutely before dropping into the cup for an eagle the almost imperturbable dufner even raised a fist in triumph it lifted him to four under rory mcilroy , the defending champion here , had a typical round for him his 71 included a double bogey , four bogeys and five birdies he is at even par , safely inside the cut but not quite threatening the leaders , either after making a complete hash of his tee shot on no 8 , adam scott got a big break when a young fan picked up his ball that gave him a drop , so he could hit from some trampled rough still , his backside was in the trees as he bounced his ball up on the green for a reasonable 8foot putt at birdie he pushed it left , though , and he settled for par justin rose took the far more conventional route , hitting the green with his approach and rolling in a 12footer for birdie to reach five under he is tied for second , two shots behind scott robert garrigus , starting strong just as he did in the first round , nabs birdies on nos 1 and 2 to boost himself to five under , tied for second , two shots behind adam scott webb simpson had pars on his final two holes after leaving a birdie putt on the edge on no 8 that could have given him a courserecord score instead , he walks off with a recordtying 64 he was six under for the day , four under over all , lifting himself from near the cut line to three shots short of the lead nice day the other two with 64s on this course ben hogan and curtis strange adam scott could not get up and down from the rough on no 7 to drop the shot he gained on the previous hole and settle back to seven under phil mickelson also carded a bogey here to fall back to two over justin rose is the only one who saved par , and he did it from a greenside bunker adam scott hit a picture perfect tee shot on the par3 no 6 and drained the sixfooter for birdie to jump to eight under justin rose saved par with a nice chip out of nasty rough after burying his tee shot there he is four under webb simpson ended his blazing hot streak by hitting into all kinds of trouble with his second shot on no 7 , and he could not get up and down out of the gnarled rough his bogey dropped him to four under over all hard to be disappointed with six under for the day , though webb simpson has continued his incredible round with backtoback birdies on nos 5 and 6 , which included a 35putt he rolled in on no 5 simpson is seven under for the day and five under for the tournament , which ties him for second with jim furyk , two shots behind scott because mickelson s ball landed where a tree would hinder his backswing , he gets to take a drop , which helps him have a clear shot to the pin he plays the chip as only mickelson can , and the ball nearly rolls in the hole he made the comeback for par meanwhile , scott s tee shot had lodged in some snarly rough and his chip out stops maddeningly short of the hole he had a 20footer just to save par it missed just right for scott s second bogey of the round he drops to seven under rose , meanwhile , calmly drained an 18footer for his third straight birdie to boost himself to three under for the tournament in danger oak hill course record is 64 \( hogan and strange \) webb simpson is 5 through 13 and if he doesn t , somebody else might  dan jenkins \( danjenkinsgd \) 9 aug 13 phil mickelson hasn t made much happen in the second round , and things will get really hairy on no 3 his drive was so far right , it cleared the fans and settled behind the spectator bleachers this is not how to try to get back below par he is one over and in danger of much worse following justin rose s beautiful tapin birdie , adam scott had to work harder for his from more than 30 feet away , scott rolled one beautifully toward the hole and it dropped perfectly in the right side of the cup that pushed his lead to three strokes at eight under justin rose , who started this round struggling , has suddenly found his swing on no 2 , he hit a perfect approach that spun back and nearly dropped it in the cup it stopped on the lip for a tapin birdie , his second straight that drops him to two under and gives him a real boost in this round woody austin has been penalized four strokes after discovering after two holes that he was carrying 15 clubs , one more than allowed that s a two shot penalty per hole that puts him five over for the round and four over over all and in serious danger of missing the cut ouch webb simpson is making the big move of the day , with five birdies in his first 12 holes with no bogeys he has lifted himself to three under and he is finishing on the front nine , the easier of the two halves at least the afternoon looks nice http tco rryydvus48  sam weinman \( samweinman \) 9 aug 13 adam scott made no 18 look easy , getting an 18foot putt for birdie and just missing it , taking his tapin par in stride as he heads to the turn , his lead two shots over jim furyk , who hasn t teed off yet lee westwood has officially lost the momentum he had early in his round , a bogey on no 2 sending him backward again at four under , he is tied with jason day , martin kaymer and david hearn \( who hasn t teed off yet \) the wet conditions are not helping players at no 17 , the 509yard par4 that is the most difficult hole on the course with no roll on the fairway with the rain falling , reaching this green in two is a gargantuan task the group of adam scott , phil mickelson and justin rose not a shorthitter among them all had drives in the fairway and took mighty rips at their second shots none of them reached the green scott and mickelson rolled balls to the front apron leading to the green , giving them long , uphill putts to get it close enough for reasonable par putts scott got it to five feet with that first putt , but missed it when it grazed the left lip that dropped him back to seven under rose and mickelson both got up and down for par despite the spongy green , adam scott spun his approach shot on no 16 back toward the hole for a nice 5foot putt , which he holed for birdie that brings him to eight under and three clear of his nearest pursuers jim furyk hasn t actually started pursuing yet his tee time is at 1 55 pm much respect for caddies at oak hill gotta keep grips dry , player dry , clean clubs , carry bag , get yardage , replace divots , rake bunkers  sam weinman \( samweinman \) 9 aug 13 rory mcilroy s attempt to revive his game and possibly successfully defend his title here hasn t gone altogether smoothly he started the day one under , but traded a bogey and a birdie and then collected a dreadful double bogey on the par3 no 15 to fall to one over par he might be fighting to stay above the cut line unless he rebounds no 17 , which is playing harder than any other hole so far in this tournament , clipped lee westwood , who dropped back to five under with a bogey there that left adam scott with a chance to stretch his lead to three strokes with a short birdie putt on the par3 no 15 , but the ball hit the left edge of the cup and stayed out , leaving scott at seven under no 18 claimed another victim , with jason day dropping a stroke there to fall back to four under with the rain picking up a bit , scoring has gotten more difficult the group of adam scott , phil mickelson and justin rose found that out on no 14 , the driveable par4 they were all close to the green after their drives , but all settled for pars as the speed of the green grew trickier to guess the rain has resumed , although forecasters are now saying the rain should move out of the area in the next hour or so adam scott was visibly unhappy with his approach shot on the par5 no 13 , which he put above the hole and hoped would roll back toward the hole , but the squishy green held it firm he had a slippery , downhill 15foot putt for birdie , which he barely touched , and it wiggled down and finally tumbled into the hole that put scott in the lead on his own at seven under mickelson had a better approach than scott and needed only a flat , 3foot putt for birdie to get him back to even par the players have folded up their umbrellas and fans have started to fold them up as well , with the rain all but stopping despite missing the fairway with his drive on no 12 , scott recovered with a great approach shot and had a 10foot putt for birdie , which he slid just past the hole a tapin par left him at six under , tied with lee westwood after a terrible finish to his first round with a finalhole double bogey , phil mickelson would like to turn things around early in the soft morning conditions but , so far , he has managed only pars on the early holes , and he is stuck at one over scott piercy has had a bumpy ride friday morning , but he has settled back to four under through eight holes he has three birdies and two bogeys and only three pars lee westwood is making the most of his morning so far , adding another birdie on the par4 no 14 he is playing the back nine first to tie adam scott for the lead at six under it is raining at oak hill and although play has not been stopped , delays seem almost certain friday with a sketchy forecast that includes possible thunderstorms adam scott did not waste time gaining momentum in his second round , with a birdie on the first hole when he holed a pitch from the fringe to push himself into the lead alone at six under several players used the opening holes to crowd the leader board scott piercy used three birdies and two bogeys in his first six holes to reach five under jason day was two under through four to reach that score as well and they were joined by lee westwood

the outsider art fair , a wonderfully eccentric jewel in the crown of new york art fairs , has a renewed radiance for the first time in its 20year history , it occupies a building retrofitted for art the clean , welllighted spaces of the former dia art foundation this places it in the western reaches of chelsea , once again confronting the world of contemporary insider art with irrefutable proof that the most lasting work comes from unstoppable emotional necessity , an especially useful lesson for the moment since its inception , the fair has been pivotal in establishing the importance and richness of 20th , and now 21stcentury , folk , outsider and selftaught art and for virtually introducing greats like , morton bartlett , george widener and others to the public but it has had some ups and downs founded by sanford smith in 1993 , it was first held on the ground floor of the venerable puck building on houston street , close by soho , then still heavy with art galleries the puck s quirky , irregular spaces seemed made for the oddities of outsider art , but in 2008 the building became unavailable for the next five years , the fair was held on or exiled to an upper floor of a generic office building on 34th street , where it did not flourish last year the 34th street space shut down , and andrew edlin , an art dealer and fair participant since 2004 , urged mr smith to move the fair to chelsea shortly thereafter mr edlin offered to buy it , and a deal was struck with mr smith staying on as a consultant , some new exhibitors were attracted , and others weeded out voil the

ugh and i say that advisedly john cogan and john taylor have a piece in the wsj \( where else \) arguing that the latest ryan budget would actually be expansionary , because confidence ! it s as if all the experience of recent years , in which the confidence fairy has yet to make an appearance , hasn t happened but this is fairly standard why the ugh \? partly because the ryan budget is so obviously ludicrous it s distressing to see credentialed economists lending support to the thing but also because cogan and taylor make a basically dishonest claim about the state of research reading them , you d think that anyone who believes that contractionary policy is contractionary is just a simpleton who doesn t know about expectations our assessment is based on a modern macroeconomic model \( developed with volker wieland of the university of frankfurt and maik wolters of the university of kiel \) whose features include a recognition that the resources to finance government expenditures aren t free they withdraw resources from the private economy the model provides for other essential attributes of the economy that consumers , businesses and workers respond to incentives , and they are influenced by their expectation of future economic conditions when making decisions today none of these features is provided for in oldstyle keynesian models actually , in a depressed economy the resources to finance government expenditures are free , because they would otherwise be unemployed mainly , however , the notion that keynesians don t believe that expectations of future conditions affect decisions today is strange both old keynesian and new keynesian models like mike woodford , whom they appear never to have read are very much about expectations in fact , the only interesting question here is why their results are so different from woodford s my guess is that they have slipped in some assumption that won t stand scrutiny , like the notion that the fed will raise rates even with the economy deeply below capacity \( they ve done that before \) anyway , sad stuff to see , and a disservice to readers
medley , fla about 4 , 400 miles from spain , ray hudson is calling a real madrid game the way he always does off a television screen in a tiny soundproof room in south florida free from distractions , he delivers his analysis in the thick geordie accent of his native newcastle , and it is as ludicrous as it is informed , as grandiloquent as it is sharpeyed who else could it have been ! he shouts when cristiano ronaldo opens the scoring after three minutes cristiano awakens his sleeping sword of destruction and it is excalibur ! it is one of nine goals hudson will describe this day in easy victories for barcelona and real madrid he will celebrate all nine but cherish a few a little more than the others that is because hudson seeks plays that are , in one of his favorite terms , magisterial it is a word he uses often stretching the e on the undulations of his friendly brogue he delights in passes that are as soft as a lover s kiss and in shots that curve like a bernini sculpture it is this singular kind of commentary flowery , clever , comically accurate that has given hudson a cult following among the soccer fans who delight in his work for bein sport , a young network on the fringes of the american sports television landscape websites collect his best phrases , a twitter account and perpetuate his outlandish style in  phil schoen , his playbyplay partner for more than 100 games a year , compares hudson to three eccentrics of sports broadcasting i think of him as john madden , dick vitale and don cherry rolled into one , schoen said and  hair uncombed and wearing a red , opencollar shirt , hudson wraps himself in rapt anticipation of brilliant dribbling and passing as a great play develops , he might inhale , stiffen his torso or thrust his head forward when a goal looks imminent , he might point at the screen or shout missed opportunities are met with deep , audible sighs in hudson s world , soccer is a wild , multilayered legend with brave lads , paleface assassins , emasculations and cato'ninetails superstars sprinkle stardust men backpedal in high heels defenders disappear like the children in the blair witch project and forwards peel away from pursuers like tissue off a toilet roll he once said that lionel messi , the barcelona star who has long been a hudson favorite , plays so beautifully he could make an onion cry this is within me , he said of his unfiltered style it s a stage where i can be acrobatic yeah , i'm over the top and bombastic but it s ok it s what a guy at a football match feels his sentences if diagramed would resemble etymological helixes , with thoughts on soccer twisted with strands of pop culture , literature , math and science he cares little that some of those references are obscure , or even slightly incorrect after watching messi thread a pass through a nearly invisible opening last season , hudson posited that the argentine if they just asked him assessing gareth bale s work on the wing for real madrid , he announced , he can usually get his angles down better than archimedes , isosceles any of those greek lads what many might not know is that hudson creates all this in a closed ecosystem the sixfootbyeightfoot room where he and schoen called the madrid game holds a video monitor and the computers they consult during games and little else the bein control room is visible through a window , its staff members available through a door but on hudson s side of the glass the tv screen frames the game and that , he says , is all he needs there are no fans waving at him there are none of the production meetings or oncamera standups that he detests the trappings of broadcasting mystify him he has called a thousand or more games this way , a practice that is unusual in the united states but common in international soccer he says the method helps him forge an intimate connection with viewers all i want is the game , hudson said at his small house off a culdesac in fort lauderdale he has lived in the place for years , and it is decorated with the touch of the divorced , 58yearold former professional athlete that he is the brightest light is the glow from his 145inch projection screen television , a possession as cherished as his twoandahalffoottall lladr statue of barcelona and real madrid players leaping for a ball the game always fills you , he said of his seemingly limitless passion for it it s not just a game for me it fills my life it s not just the 90 minutes of the game throughout the week , it s the leading up to it soccer comes right at you , a tidal wave of emotion and great athletic feats it s such an instant pleasure his imagination does the rest according to his sister , pauline irving , hudson was a cheeky and excitable boy infused with his mother s sense of humor and father s love of soccer eleven years her junior , he pleaded with pauline to forgo storybooks and conjure bedtime stories for him about the pyramids and ancient rome at age 11 , he began reciting portia s speech from the merchant of venice his father , wilf , a 93yearold retired toolmaker , routinely left at the end of his night shift to sneak into a locked local park with ray to kick a ball around for an hour one evening , a friend knocked on the hudsons' door , beckoning ray to bring his ball and come out to the street where alleys served as goals we 'd had these streetlights that were lit by sewer gas and they were very faint , hudson said but they had placed these new lamps with bright bulbs and we went absolutely crazy it was like coming out at wimbledon at 7 at night it was light you could see ! while hudson s countrymen cheered england to victory at the 1966 world cup , he and his father were enchanted by the creativity and the names of the brazilian and chilean players , who played a game so at odds with the more physical british style they were like martians landing in england , he said of men like garrincha , the dribbling master from brazil whose name hudson pronounces like a deity s playing in the newcastle streets turned into a profession hudson signed with newcastle united in 1974 but left on loan three years later the fort lauderdale strikers of the north american soccer league spring break was abloom when he arrived in florida i was a 21yearold , redblooded , blond lad with an accent and these girls would just melt in your arms , he said it was astonishing he returned to newcastle for a final season before forcing the transfer to fort lauderdale now , in sunny florida , which he has never left , he studied the game alongside masters he admired , teammates like george best , gerd m ller and te filo cubillas his openness made him a gift to the news media the reporters came to him , said ron newman , who coached the strikers for three seasons i'm not sure everyone could understand him , but what came out was honest hudson eventually became a coach , taking jobs in major league soccer but showing little allegiance to the hardcharging , mudcovered game he grew up with in newcastle he s an englishman who did n't want us to play like the english , said jim rooney , who played for hudson in miami his mantra was to have flair , to be south american hudson s halftime orations were so impassioned , rooney said , that you did n't want to be too close to him because he spit so much he had no plan to become a broadcaster , but a former player and coach with his verbal flair is a valuable commodity after dc united fired him in 2004 , he joined goltv , another network based in south florida it paid him largely as a freelancer until bein armed with the rights to spain s la liga , italy s serie a and france s ligue 1 , and financed by a branch of qatar s sovereign wealth fund hired him last year his style is not the sober british soundtrack of most televised soccer in the united states but something more akin to the passionate south americans he hears on spanishlanguage tv reluctant to travel much , he has turned down offers from mls teams who have tried to hire him and he said that if bein asked him to tone down his style to drop the references to barbra streisand s nose and cindy crawford s mole he would quit he has no sense of career , said joe mcginniss , the writer , who is a friend of hudson s caa has been trying for a year and a half to sign him and told him , we 'll make you this or that , ' but he s happy the way he is he does n't want a yacht or belong to a country club he likes his simple life and , apparently , he does not believe he would fit in with major networks that carry soccer , like espn , fox and nbc each has many more united states subscribers than bein , a network less than two years old that reaches about 22 million homes they 're too snow white for me , hudson said they love that solid image and that refined style so , hudson is the scruffy face of bein , appearing on a weekly studio show and delivering ray hudson raw commentaries on its website in addition to calling games a commentary last month sounded like a blend of the unhinged newsman howard beale of network and the scottish comedian billy connolly before portugal swept sweden out of the world cup in a twogame playoff , hudson lamented a matchup that ensured that one of the game s top stars , portugal s ronaldo or the swedish striker zlatan ibrahimovic , would not play in the brazil tournament next year i curse the fates that conspire to deny us these gargantuan talents in rio , he proclaimed in typically italicized speech damn you , capricious winds of fate ! damn you all to hell ! indignation , even rendered in a mockserious way , is not hudson s default emotion he is more likely to be so awestruck by events on the field that he rises to farcical fancy whaaaaaaaaaaa ! he shouted as a goal by bale put real madrid up , 30 , over almer a after schoen wrapped up the details , hudson eagerly channeled the falsetto vaudevillian tiny tim and gradeschool science to praise the assist isco tiptoes through the tulips , he said of the bandylegged spanish midfielder , skips the light fantastic , drawing defenders to him like a magnet takes on iron filings magisterial \? of course
detroit a drastic reversal of fortune in the western conference semifinals has left the chicago blackhawks discouraged and on the verge of elimination the blackhawks began the season on a recordsetting tear , earning at least a point in 24 straight games , and went on to win the presidents' trophy for the league s best record but the detroit red wings , who slid into the playoffs as the west s no 7 seed , lead the teams' secondround series , three games to one the blackhawks have lost three straight , their longest slide of the season game 5 is in chicago on saturday we 're all frustrated , chicago forward patrick sharp said it s not about one guy we 're a whole team in here sharp added there s no use hanging our heads our backs are against the wall we have to play our best game in chicago there s no other options we can dig in here the red wings' confidence has been growing in the playoffs , while the blackhawks appear to be coming apart five blackhawks shots have hit goal posts in the last two games , and nothing seems to be clicking still , the red wings are not taking anything for granted they 're going to play even more desperate on saturday night , said detroit goalie jimmy howard , who recorded his first shutout of the 2013 playoffs with a 20 win in game 4 on thursday we 're going to have to match it we ca n't rest on our laurels here sharp , the blackhawks' top playoff scorer with six goals , has no goals and one assist during chicago s threegame skid other key components of chicago s offense , wing marian hossa and the captain jonathan toews , have no points during the streak howard s strong goaltending and the red wings' defense are among the main reasons for the blackhawks' slump another sign of trouble for chicago is that the usually calm toews has had emotional outbursts he displayed a critical lack of poise during the second period of game 4 , taking three consecutive penalties in 5 minutes 34 seconds toews strongly objected to the calls , screaming at the officials as he skated to the penalty box he also sniped at the red wings between plays in the second period , toews spent 6 04 on the ice and 6 minutes stewing in the box his second penalty , for high sticking , led to the gamewinning goal by jakub kindl it was the first powerplay goal the blackhawks had allowed in nearly a month , ending their postseason streak of killing 30 consecutive penalties toews , known as a smart and offensively gifted player , has no goals during the playoffs i'm not going to say anything about the officiating , toews said after game 4 obviously , i disagree with the calls it s in the heat of the moment they see what they see he added eventually , something s got to give we 're too good a team we 've got too much talent for as hard as we 're working , something s got to go our way the red wings , particularly the captain henrik zetterberg , have been agitating toews with physical play we 'd like to keep him in the box , defenseman jonathan ericsson said of toews s penalties he s not as good for them in the box howard added that zetterberg s defense had caused much of toews s frustration he s all over him out there , howard said he s really taking away his time and space out there and not really letting him generate much when z s out there and he s working as hard as he s working , it sends a message to the rest of the team that they have to do their part red wings coach mike babcock tried to put his team s playoff success in perspective , conceding that he had felt doubts about how detroit would fare asked whether he was surprised to have a 31 series lead , babcock said if you 'd asked me two months ago , i would be shocked we started playing better and better once we got through the anaheim series , you go in thinking you have an opportunity we 're competing at a high , high level there s a lot to be said for effort and battling

fort meade , md a military judge sentenced pfc bradley manning on wednesday to 35 years in prison for providing more than 700 , 000 government files to wikileaks , a gigantic leak that lifted the veil on american military and diplomatic activities around the world the sentence is the longest ever handed down in a case involving a leak of united states government information for the purpose of having the information reported to the public private manning , 25 , will be eligible for parole in about seven years , his lawyer said in a twominute hearing on wednesday morning , the judge , col denise r lind of the army , also said that private manning would be dishonorably discharged and reduced in rank from private first class to private , the lowest rank in the military she said he would forfeit his pay , but she did not impose a fine before the sentencing , private manning sat leaning forward with his hands folded , whispering to his lawyer , david coombs his aunt and two cousins sat quietly behind him as colonel lind read the sentence , private manning stood , showing no expression he did not make a statement the materials that private manning gave to wikileaks included a video taken during in baghdad in 2007 in which civilians were killed , including two journalists he also gave wikileaks some 250 , 000 diplomatic cables , dossiers of detainees being imprisoned without trial at guant namo bay , cuba , and hundreds of thousands of incident reports from the wars in iraq and afghanistan immediately after the judge left , military guards flanked private manning and hustled him out the front of the courtroom as a halfdozen supporters in the back of the courtroom called out words of encouragement we 'll keep fighting for you , bradley , one shouted another said , you are a hero mr coombs later told reporters that he would apply for a presidential pardon next week and read a statement from private manning that he said would be included in his request i only wanted to help people , private manning s statement said , adding , if you deny my request for a pardon , i will serve my time knowing that sometimes you have to pay a heavy price to live in a free society a white house spokesman said a request would be considered like any other application mr coombs also said that he had wept after they left the courtroom and that private manning told him , it s ok private manning downloaded the materials from a classified computer network to which he had access as a lowlevel army intelligence analyst while deployed in iraq in 2010 the documents he gave to wikileaks set off a scramble inside the government as officials sought to minimize any harm , including protecting foreigners identified in some documents as having helped american diplomats or the military no evidence emerged that anyone was killed because of the leaks among other things , the files also exposed under the watch of american forces and showed that were most likely significantly higher than official estimates it s outrageous , one supporter who had been in the courtroom , laura watkins , 63 , of alexandria , va , said of the sentence what i 've seen is a travesty of justice the judge s decision to impose a 35year sentence roughly split the difference between what the prosecution had requested 60 years and the 20 years that private manning had exposed himself to before the trial began when he pleaded guilty to a lesser version of the charges he was facing under the military system , convicts sentenced to more than three decades in prison are eligible for parole after 10 years , and private manning is receiving 1 , 294 days credit a little more than three years for time in custody and for a 112day period in which the judge ruled he was mistreated during pretrial confinement he is expected to serve his time at the army prison at fort leavenworth , kan there have been only a handful of previous convictions in cases involving leak accusations , none resulting in a comparably severe sentence in 1985 , for example , a former navy intelligence officer , was sentenced to two years for giving classified satellite surveillance photographs to jane s defense weekly , making him the first government employee imprisoned for giving classified information to the press in 2001 , president bill clinton pardoned him as part of a surge in leakrelated prosecutions under the obama administration , shamai leibowitz , a former federal bureau of investigation linguist , was sentenced to 20 months thomas drake , a former national security agency official , was sentenced to a year of probation and community service and , a former central intelligence agency official , received a 30month sentence steven aftergood , a government secrecy specialist with the federation of american scientists , said private manning s 35year sentence reflected how much his case involving leaks of entire archives , not singular documents or discrete pieces of information differed from what had come before it it reflects the gravity of the case and the government s perception of the damage that was done , mr aftergood said among other things , it is also the most voluminous leak ever , and also the broadest in scope including diplomatic , military and other records so it was a qualitatively new kind of leak , and the government responded aggressively colonel lind could have sentenced private manning to up to 90 years she of most of the charges against him , including six counts of violating the espionage act , but acquitted him of the most serious charge , aiding the enemy , which had never before been filed in a leak case private manning s sentence must be reviewed by the socalled convening authority , a general who oversees the military district of washington and has the power to reduce the term but not add to it the case will then automatically come before the army court of criminal appeals in seeking a 60year sentence , prosecutors argued that private manning had betrayed the trust of the government and said they hoped a severe punishment would discourage future leaks they also had asked the judge to impose a fine of 100 , 000 to repay some of what was spent on efforts to mitigate damage , including identifying individuals who officials said had been put at risk by the disclosures mr coombs argued that private manning had leaked the files because he wanted to start a public debate and bring about change , portraying his client as a wellintentioned , if na ve , whistleblower but mr coombs , seeking leniency , also argued that his client was confused at the time by stresses , including a crisis over his gender identity while in a combat zone he elicited testimony showing that the military played down serious and recurring signs that private manning s mental health was deteriorating , allowing him to maintain his access to classified information
i met nirmal several years ago in new york i had become increasingly interested in the lives of undocumented laborers in the city , and therefore had started talking with taxi drivers , kebab sellers , and restaurant workers i was looking for answers to two questions , the first of which was what might happen if illegal immigrants from south asia should ever want to retire in the united states \? this is a relatively new issue , as the vast majority of south asian immigrants to the states arrived after 1970 my parents , educated professionals who came to new york in 1979 , are south asianamericans who can leverage their hyphens into a comfortable retirement escaping to india for the cold winter months and spending summer in the united states with their children and grandchildren precisely because of their class and professional background , immigrants like my parents can afford to look forward to retiring but what of other , less celebrated , but equally crucial south asian immigrants those who come to the united states to man our 711s and wash our plates \? their lives are spent doing the jobs american citizens refuse to do , but they have no savings , no retirement plan , no assurance that they ll even be able to eat the day they stop working what happens as they age in this lonely and brutal existence \? secondly , i wondered what continued to pull so many undocumented south asians to the united states , despite the fact that their lives in places like new york were seemingly miserable backbreaking work , 14hour workdays , difficult living situations why was the us still called the sunehra desh the golden country by so many of the people to whom i spoke \? nirmal was one of the friends that i made while exploring these ideas we met while he was the head chef at a mediocre indian restaurant in queens both of us spoke broken hindi , my native tongue being bengali and his being nepali , but we managed to communicate over time , nirmal told me his story he was from a lower middleclass family in kathmandu , married off as soon as he was 20 but a year or so into his marriage , things began to look bleak he could not find employment , and there was a baby on the way and then , a miracle the tourist visa to the united states for which he had applied months earlier came through a plane ticket bought a journey taken a life ended a life begun fourteen years passed nirmal s daughter , whom he has never met , is now a teenager with the money that he faithfully sends to his wife every week via western union , she has been able to purchase a flat in a posh part of town she sends their daughter to a relatively expensive school , where the girl is learning to speak english nirmal listed the luxuries his family has been able to afford on his meager salary as if he were reading a list of groceries that s when i realized that these things are not tangible to nirmal because he has never seen them what , i asked him , made him take such a substantial percentage of his paycheck each week and send it to two women he doesn t even know very well \? what else am i here for \? was his response nirmal lives in a hovel in queens , jammed into a twobedroom apartment with three other men his hours are so long that by midnight his feet are sore , his back is killing him all this for about 500 a week , a small part of which he keeps for his daily expenses but what is the option \? there is nothing for me back in nepal , he said there are no job opportunities there better to suffer here and let my child live in peace maybe because of me , she will have a better life these motivations are not so different from those of my own parents , who came to america following prestigious job opportunities and with the desire to send their children to the best universities but the similarities end there among other privileges , my parents can hop on flights and cross borders at will a luxury i inherited even more irrevocably by being born in america nirmal cannot leave the boundaries of the united states if he ever wants to go to nepal both nirmal and i were highly aware of this divide as we spoke , and we were careful never to mention it , until the day i told him that i was thinking of going to nepal i brought it up gingerly , wondering how he might react he asked me only this why \? how could i tell him that meeting him had left me with even more questions than i had before \? i once heard nirmal talking to his wife on the phone the way he reassured her that everything was fine , the way he evaded questions about himself it made me wonder , why was nirmal so hesitant to let his family know about his life here \? after all , if he told them the truth , then the answer to the retirement question would be rather simple nirmal would work in the united states as long as his body allowed him to , and then he would deport himself back to nepal to retire in a life of semiluxury but this was not an option the day i mentioned this plan to nirmal , he laughed at me a deep , sarcastic laugh that made me feel the depth of my own na vet he did not explain himself , but i understood that day that going home would be considered a failure on his part this was when i started thinking about a trip to nepal if nirmal was lying to his family about how wonderful his life was , how many like him were doing the same \? how many families in nepal still believe that if they are able to send their sons to america , all their problems will be solved \? i also wanted to know what nirmal s family thought might happen when he was too old to work anymore to answer these questions , i knew i had to go and meet them myself i told nirmal none of this i said that i was going for some work , and would love to meet up with his family while i was there before i left , nirmal handed me a new ipad it must have cost him everything he had please , he asked , give this to my daughter she has a computer but the picture quality is so bad , i m never able to properly skype with her maybe with this , i ll be able to see her face suddenly , my trip felt wrong i felt like handing him back the ipad , along with my tickets and my passport you should be the one going to see them , i wanted to say instead i slid the ipad into my bag nirmal s entire extended family came to greet me in kathmandu and his wife invited me to her house for dinner they hugged me and wept , saying they couldn t believe that a friend of nirmal s was sitting in their living room i realized that this might as well have been nirmal s welcome home party it felt perverse that for them , it was my arrival that was tantamount to his homecoming i found that the questions i had been examining had led me to yet another what did it mean for me as an american to be the gobetween for nirmal and his family \? it felt senseless that by sheer accident of birth , i was able to eat his wife s chicken curry , and i was able to hug his daughter i gave her the ipad and explained its use exceedingly shy , she took it and hid behind her mother what is she going to do with this \? nirmal s wife asked while laughing out loud she s perfectly capable of skyping with her father on the computer she just doesn t ever want to speak to a strange man she doesn t know ! stunned , i realized that of course nirmal had been wrong about the computer of course he had been spared being told that his daughter didn t want to speak to him but those weren t the only lies being tossed about rapidly , i was filling in pieces of the puzzle when i asked them about nirmal s retirement , his wife looked at me as though i were an idiot hasn t nirmal told you about the court case \? i looked at her blankly you see , nirmal being in america has been wonderful for us but how long can a family remain apart \? this is why nirmal has been fighting the court case see , in america , they don t put such an emphasis on family he has been explaining to them that in nepal , the family unit is very strong , and he needs his family with him any day now , he will convince them , and we will go to america to be with him we will settle our daughter down there , and we will come back and live in nepal and visit her often in america i sat in silence for a moment , at last comprehending why nirmal had never explained to his wife that his retirement would inevitably mean his own deportation , and had instead been fanning the flames of this hideous lie who could bear to shatter such a mammoth and intricate deception \? who could bear to rob a woman of this kind faith \? and who could bear to live in a world in which the simple truth is , i was poor then , and i m still poor now \? i finally understood nirmal s deepthroated laughter the day i had asked him about the end of his own career the sound had borne the weight of this doubleedged sword the knowledge that he carried versus the myth he perpetuated i understood too that nirmal would never leave the united states as long as he can prolong this fantasy , because his final homecoming will , in the end , be marked not by a joyous reunion , but rather by the bitter disappointment of a life sacrificed maybe most importantly , i understood that i too would have to tell nirmal my own lies about how my trip to his hometown had gone but perhaps sometimes it is the glossy coating of fiction that keeps the walls of our various realities from crumbling piyali bhattacharya is a freelance journalist currently based in new delhi she is working on her first novel
readers suggest changes to how medicare reimburses for care  as a practicing physician with a long history of caring for medicare patients and working to improve the medicare program , i think your sept 1 editorial rightly suggests that physicians are not turning away medicare patients or leaving medicare because of stingy payments i totally agree physicians are committed to caring for medicare patients despite persistent reimbursement shortfalls because we care about patients and their access to needed medical care however , there is a need to replace permanently the current flawed medicare physician payment system the current formula was enacted by the balanced budget act of 1997 it determines annual medicare physician payment updates by generating a target for medicare physician spending based on changes in annual economic growth using a formula known as the sustainable growth rate , or sgr because health expenditures continue to exceed targeted levels , the sgr formula would trigger automatic fee reductions currently amounting to almost a 25 percent payment cut to medicare physician payments on jan 1 , 2014 , if nothing is done over the past decade , congress has time and time again acted temporarily to avert these drastic payment reductions , but the physician payment fix has become yet another political football being tossed around in congress causing unnecessary angst to dedicated physicians and their patients the flawed sgr payment formula must be replaced by payment mechanisms that support quality of care through a shared responsibility between patients and clinicians physicians really , all health care providers need to be rewarded for highquality care that maximizes patient health while curbing growth in spending now is the time for congress to act greg forzley livonia , mich , sept 9 , 2013  dr forzley s letter continues a long tradition of physicians suggesting that medicare payments are stingy and result in reimbursement shortfalls for doctors while medicare is not our nation s best payer medicare pays physicians , on average , 81 percent of what commercial insurance pays it is far from the worst , with medicaid and many managed care contracts reimbursing doctors at lower rates a recent physician survey revealed that specialists like me enjoy an average annual income of about 396 , 000 primary care doctors are relatively underreimbursed , but still average approximately 220 , 000 in yearly compensation thus , doctors in wellrun practices continue to make enviable wages by caring for medicare patients i agree with dr forzley that the sgr formula should be reworked to reward quality rather than quantity of care , but i also contend that shared sacrifice will be required by nearly everyone in health care , including most physicians , in order to make medicare sustainable for the future james rickert bloomington , ill , sept 11 , 2013  my large , physicianowned group practice was forced to restrict new medicare patients out of pure survival years ago it seems that medicare is determined to make sure that only hospitalemployed doctors can see medicare patients , as they get paid far more for the same routine office visits what nonhospital employed doctors get barely covers our overhead nick benton corvallis , ore , sept 11 , 2013  as retired seniors on a fixed income seeking continuity of care from medicareaccepting physicians , my wife and i have been priced out by two \( going on three \) physicians from the clinic we have been using for many years they have given us excellent service , but all are turning to boutique care that we cannot afford they complain about medicare payment delays the boutique plan requires patients to pay as much as several thousand dollars more per year to get the kind of care we thought all physicians promise when they take the hippocratic oath what s a medicare patient to do \? rod lopezfabrega norwalk , conn , sept 11 , 2013  while i see only a few medicareinsured patients , it is clear to me that the problem of controlling costs without distorting clinical standards is at the center of protecting medicare s solvency feeforservice is seen to promote excessive care while linking payment to outcome makes sense , it could easily make doctors reluctant to accept severely ill patients or those with complex conditions systems with healthmaintenanceorganizationstyle salaried doctors can compromise the sanctity of individual treatment decisions and give incentives for less active care financial incentives cannot create sound medical practice nor medicare solvency good care depends on doctors practicing with ethical and clinical priorities bad care increases costs and suffering if your doctor is primarily thinking of money , something is wrong sara hartley oakland , calif , sept 11 , 2013  i am in complete agreement with dr forzley congress must find a permanent , valuebased solution to physician payments but given congress s propensity to neutralize any medicare spending increase and this fix will be a big one the solution cannot come from further reducing hospital payments under the affordable care act , hospitals in the united states have agreed to take a cut of 155 billion in federal funds over the next decade , not including annual reductions in payments hospitals should not be further affected by modifications in physician payment paul j connor iii greenport , ny , sept 11 , 2013  it is high time that congress permanently fixed the medicare physician payment formula the annual angst that attends to this issue discredits medicare in the eyes of physicians and demoralizes doctors and patients alike want to know where to get the money to pay for it \? require medicare to negotiate what it pays for prescription drugs judith stein executive director center for medicare advocacy willimantic , conn , sept 11 , 2013  until doctors are reimbursed at market rates , there will be cost shifting to the rest of us , contributing to the upward spiral in health care costs the physician payment fix , which restores draconian cuts , only brings reimbursements back to abysmal levels and where does money for the fix come from \? is it taken from other programs \? or is it borrowed , or just printed \? none of these solutions are good ones significant tax increases , and not just on the rich , are needed to correct this badly underfunded program alexander goldstein brooklyn , sept 11 , 2013  the responses confirm my assertion that , as a group , physicians want to ensure the accessibility and sustainability of highquality care the respondents physicians , administrators and patients seek greater clinical excellence , improved individual outcomes and affordable payment mechanisms that can sustain these improvements congress must commit to a revised reimbursement model as dr hartley states , physicians must focus on giving the best possible care to patients but they must still run viable practices , repay significant educational debt and keep pace with medical innovations and improvements dr rickert notes that physicians , especially surgeons and other specialists , are comparatively bigger earners , and that a shared sacrifice is needed does sharing mean acrosstheboard cuts \? if so , what about family physicians who spend more time listening to patients and coordinating care among various specialists \? traditionally there is little reimbursement for these activities since the current payment model rewards procedures rather than consultative conversations , i contend that sharing is better achieved through a fair reimbursement model that permits all physicians to have viable practices there is no question that the sanctity of the doctorpatient relationship must be preserved what mr lopezfabrega and his wife have experienced is very unfortunate as health care evolves , patients and ethics must be a physician s highest priorities true reimbursement reform would provide the means for physicians to improve models of care , end the threat of cuts that could be debilitating to a small practice and allow all doctors to leverage their commitment to healing for the benefit of their communities greg forzley livonia , mich , sept 13 , 2013
one by one , quietly , briskly fled the scene of their latest calamity , a 20point dismemberment by the smarter , sharper , more purposeful miami heat on wednesday night only four players stayed to explain the loss three spoke in near monotones , disappointed but virtually emotionless the fourth spoke in bursts of righteous anger gerald wallace , a nononsense defensive demon , the one nicknamed crash , pounced on his team s frailties the way he pounces on a stray ball wallace said that the nets do n't defend , that they do n't help each other out , that they keep making the same mistakes over and over he pointed with alarm to their last three losses , all by double digits he said the nets did not just lose , but also got their backsides kicked he used stronger language every player has his own way of processing disappointment most of wallace s teammates probably care just as deeply , even if they spoke in more measured tones \( or not at all \) yet their responses highlighted a defining , troubling trait of this nets team it lacks any tangible passion or , for that matter , any tangible personality the nets are built around three suitably talented players deron williams , joe johnson and brook lopez each of them hardworking , productive and worthy of praise all three have been named allstars , and they are good enough to carry the nets into the playoffs but none of them are compelling figures , or galvanizing forces if you had to pick one adjective to define all three stars , it might be steady williams is a sharp scorer and playmaker , one of the league s best , but there is no particular ferocity or forcefulness to his game johnson is a versatile scorer , with some occasional flash , but he does not command the spotlight the way that , say , carmelo anthony does lopez is the nba s top scoring center , but no one will soon confuse him with shaquille o'neal , or even dwight howard the nets are competent , not dominant on most nights , the players do their jobs well enough they have earned their 2719 record , and their place in the upper tier of the eastern conference yet they do n't walk or talk with the bravado of a contender these nets \( for better or worse \) are not chestthumpers or trash talkers they do not sneer or scowl or preen or throw halfcourt lobs they do n't unleash primal screams after big dunks no net ever flaps his arms wildly , palms up , in the fourth quarter , in that universal sign for more noise , please the nets probably have fewer technical fouls and flagrant fouls than any decent team in the league off the court , they are no different williams speaks eloquently and methodically , but without any real fervor johnson is the definition of evenkeeled lopez just sounds happy to be here jerry stackhouse has an abundance of intelligence and personality , but at 38 he no longer plays enough to make a consistent impact when the situation demands a brutally candid assessment , it is usually wallace and reggie evans two southernborn hustle players who bring down the verbal hammer generally , the nets just go about their business , smiling when they win and frowning when they lose , rarely seeming particularly moved in any direction theirs is a locker room with no discernible pulse , no dominant personality and no transcendent player that does not mean they cannot be successful , but it does raise questions about their championship aspirations the great teams are easily defined the miami heat are powered by the passion of lebron james and dwyane wade the dallas mavericks were all about dirk nowitzki s brilliant offense and jason kidd s brilliant playmaking the boston celtics had paul pierce s machismo , kevin garnett s glower and ray allen s pretty jumper kobe bryant has enough fire and fury to power two teams at once , while balancing a stack of plates on his head who defines the nets \? who is their driving force , their conscience , their soul \? four months after this reconstructed team held its first practice , those answers remain unclear it seems noteworthy that , in this era of nba superteams \( and superteaminspired angst \) , no one seemed too bothered by the nets' 330 million summer shopping spree the celtics shook up the league when they united pierce , garnett and allen in 2007 james provoked a national outcry when he chose to join wade and chris bosh in miami in 2010 anthony s move from denver to new york \( to join amar'e stoudemire on the knicks \) in 2011 stoked concerns about the concentration of talent in the big markets but williams , johnson and lopez generated a national shrug the nets are indisputably talented , but they do not inspire fear or dread maybe it all means nothing even in a superstardriven league , a team can occasionally break through without a certified hall of famer until they won the 2004 title , the detroit pistons were considered merely a team of goodbutnotgreat players they became the classic betterthanthesumofitsparts team , albeit with supreme defense can these nets , if properly motivated and unified of purpose , reach such heights as currently constructed \? their 716 record against winning teams \( and 03 mark against the heat \) suggests no their february schedule , which includes eight games against winning teams , should be revealing perhaps the nets who are , after all , still developing chemistry after a radical roster overhaul will find a way to maximize every skill and fuse them all into something better or maybe they just need to get a little mad now and then
coming off their second nba championship in franchise history , the miami heat seemed to have difficulty gaining momentum in the first three months of the 201213 season at the end of january , they had a 2913 record , a great start for most teams , but a disappointing effort for a team with its talent and expectations after starting february with a loss to the indiana pacers , the heat , who will visit the knicks on sunday afternoon , steamrollered the rest of their opponents , winning 12 straight games by an average margin of 1275 points the stretch featured a streak of seven consecutive wins by 10 or more points , including a 22point win at home over the los angeles clippers and a 10point win at the oklahoma city thunder those teams have the third and fourthbest records in the league the heat s run has not been sparked by defense miami has dropped from fourth in points allowed per possession last season to 11th this season but by a remarkably efficient offense miami s shooters were red hot in february , hitting a leaguebest 521 percent of their shots from the field , including 410 percent from 3point range effective field goal percentage is an adjusted shooting percentage that takes into account the extra point provided by the 3point shot miami s effective field goal percentage for the month was 571 percent , the best mark since the phoenix suns had an effective field percentage of 574 percent in march 2008 the heat have been lighting it up from the floor the entire season , leading the league with an effective field goal percentage of 549 percent miami is on a pace to post the fourthbest team effective field goal percentage in nba history , and it is within range of the record of 5515 percent set by the 200607 phoenix suns as is usual with the heat , the roots of their success can be traced to their irrepressible superstar , lebron james james had a phenomenal february , averaging 297 points per game on 641 percent shooting from the floor while chipping in with 75 rebounds and 78 assists per game since the 198586 season , there have been 13 cases in which a player has averaged at least 29 points , 7 rebounds and 7 assists a game in a single month james has done it seven times , with larry bird \( twice \) , michael jordan \( twice \) , david robinson and kobe bryant being the others but none of those players came close to james s shooting efficiency in games in february his effective field goal percentage was a sizzling 684 percent that was by far the best effective field goal percentage in the group above , easily eclipsing the 585 percent bird posted in march 1987 after entering february with a gameandahalf lead in the eastern conference , the heat exit the month with a sixgame lead and are oddson favorites to successfully defend their championship if the heat do win it all in june , they may look back on february as the month that sparked their run
istanbul the kurdistan workers' party , the main kurdish rebel group in , said thursday that it would withdraw all of its forces from the country by may 8 as part of a peace agreement to end a 30year conflict with the turkish state speaking at a rare news conference at the group s base in the qandil mountains of neighboring iraq , murat karayilan , the commander of the group , known as the pkk , called on the turkish army not to launch attacks during the rebels' gradual withdrawal into northern iraq any such confrontation will end the pkk s ceasefire , he said mr karayilan , in a statement read in turkish and summarized in english , outlined the process by which the pkk expected the government to meet its end of the bargain , by giving the kurds further democratic rights under a new constitution and releasing kurdish prisoners , including the pkk s highly influential primary founder , abdullah ocalan however , he refused demands by the turkish government that rebels disarm before leaving the country , and said his militants would carry weapons strictly for selfdefense he also suggested that foreign observers monitor the withdrawal for any misconduct on either side , reported ntv , a private tv network many analysts agree that despite the pkk s announcement , the peace process is fragile and still at risk of disruption by opposing groups inside the pkk and turkish nationalist circles , mr karayilan himself was defiant , emphasizing his rebels' eagerness to fight three female kurdish political activists were a few weeks after talks started in january , an attack many analysts said was aimed at intimidating the negotiating parties over the decades , a military solution had eluded the government despite the military might of turkey , with the secondlargest army in the nato alliance , and early this year , the ruling justice and development party decided to cash in on its popularity to force a political resolution it is highly hopeful that the will of the pkk , the will of the government and the will of the people join for the first time for a common cause , to end a 30yearold conflict , numan kurtulmus , deputy chairman of the party , said on ntv the first step has been made , so we hope the process would be finalized without any acts of provocation , he said many analysts agree that the government s success in resolving the conflict will win the already popular prime minister , , even greater acclaim , which could then allow him to replace turkey s parliamentary system with a strongpresident system of some kind after the government made mr ocalan , the sole political authority of the pkk , a party to the talks , he communicated with his rebels from a fortresslike prison on an island in western turkey in march ,  his message was largely welcomed by turkey s nearly 15 million kurds , who were long denied their ethnic rights and had been subject to severe human rights violations turkey has improved kurdish rights to some degree as part of a membership requirement for the european union , which it is trying to join although the government agreed to other changes in exchange for the pkk s calling off the struggle , it is unclear whether it can deliver on its promises for major legislative changes like a new constitution , for example , the government needs the backing of the main opposition parties , none of which fully supports the peace process staunchly nationalist lawmakers claim that talks will ultimately lead to the destruction of turkey s territorial unity at a time when its middle eastern neighbors are engaged in sectarian and ethnic conflicts , as in syria kurds are spread over iraq , syria , iran and turkey , and kurdish nationalists have long aspired to establish a new country called kurdistan an aspiration that the pkk , which is listed as a terror group by turkey , the european union and the united states , said it dropped in exchange for some form of autonomy and democratic rights within turkey the moment that weapons stop being used as a political tool , the kurdish issue gets freed from the stigma of terror , muhsin kizilkaya , a kurdish intellectual , said in a telephone interview from now on , democratic and legislative demands of kurds can no longer be rejected , as they were seen as a compromise to terror , so today is the real beginning of the kurdish conflict in a political framework
it is a system filled with cash and craziness , a meat market of sorts where contracts can be meaningless , prices vary wildly , middlemen work as many angles as possible and the superstar either has all the power or none of it , depending on one s perspective this is the absolute absurdity of the european soccer transfer structure \( as one team executive described it \) , and so while 12 01 am on july 1 was treated with a certain breathlessness in the united states because it marked the opening of the nba s freeagency period , the reality is that none of the major north american sports leagues truly approach the outlandish offseason of global soccer after all , with players constantly crossing international borders , any sort of overarching regulation is virtually impossible salary caps \? nonexistent loyalty \? hard to come by team payrolls \? often astronomical \( despite recent attempts at financial stability \) and , at the least , impossible to actually calculate because there are no requirements that contract figures be disclosed publicly in addition , money is not the only accepted currency in the past , players have been dealt for a box of team warmups or , in a particularly memorable transaction , about 30 pounds of meat you 're dealing with multiple countries , languages and time zones , said lyle yorks , an agent who represents a number of top players globally just trying to synchronize all that is nuts , but somehow you have to find a way to make it work in europe , most top leagues finish their seasons in may , and the transfer market is open in the summer in britain , for example , it runs from july 1 through aug 31 \( and then again in january \) during the open period , teams can shop for players , with agents often serving as matchmakers theoretically , any player can be acquired even if a player is under contract with one team , another team can purchase negotiating rights to that player for an agreedupon price , at which point the second team has the ability to sign the player to a new deal yorks recalled the intensity \( and insanity \) of last august , when one of his clients , the united states captain clint dempsey , moved from fulham to tottenham hotspur of england s premier league on the final day that the market was open yorks , who is based in the united states but lives in europe during the transferheavy month of august , said he was talking with arsenal and liverpool , in addition to tottenham , as the 11 pm local time deadline approached he and dempsey had also rejected an inquiry from aston villa the night before tottenham and fulham agreed at like 9 45 pm we rushed over and did a deal with the club after that and faxed in the paperwork at 10 59 and 30 seconds , said yorks yorks added that he had had numerous other close calls , including the time he had a player sign off on a contract while sitting in the back seat of a car on the way to the club s offices and the day he closed a deal while riding on the eurostar train from paris to london \( we got it done just before the train went into the chunnel \) yorks laughed this is the kind of thing that happens all the time over here , he said the circumstances surrounding dempsey s move were typical technically , he had another year remaining on his contract with fulham , but both sides knew dempsey had interest in moving to a bigger club rather than keep dempsey and lose him a year later with no compensation , fulham opted to trade him but could only do so to a club where dempsey would agree to sign a new contract such is the pushpull nature of influence in the transfer system in professional sports in the united states , teams , much of the time , can simply trade a player and his contract to whomever they like not so in soccer for example , aston villa reportedly offered the largest transfer fee for dempsey \( said to be 7 million or about 10 million \) and fulham accepted , but dempsey did not want to play for aston villa , so the deal was scuttled ultimately , fulham agreed with tottenham on a fee believed to be 6 million , and dempsey happily signed a new contract with the north london club this summer , yorks is working to find a new home for another american forward , , who scored 31 goals last season for the dutch club az yorks said he was negotiating with two premier league clubs \( one of which is believed to be sunderland \) , as well as teams in italy and germany earnie stewart , the director of football at az , said making the right decision on player moves was a delicate balancing we would like to keep jozy , but we also know that everyone has a price , and there may come a time when , from a business standpoint , you have to do something , he said it s something you learn over the years , how to feel when the time is right and if your scouting is good , any time you lose a player you have a no 2 option already in place one of dempsey s tottenham teammates , the star midfielder gareth bale , has been the focus of transfer talk in recent weeks tottenham manager andres villasboas had stated repeatedly that he wanted to keep bale , the top player in the premier league last season but those assertions did not keep powerful real madrid from swooping in anyway and trying to determine if it could pry him away with a lavish offer that bale still had three more years left on his spurs contract did not seem to matter it would be virtually unthinkable in the united states for a team to feel that it had no choice but to give up a star player still signed for three more seasons , but in soccer , it is different as it turned out , tottenham made it clear that it would not be pressured or tempted or seduced by any amount of money to surrender bale , at least for now , and he will stay at tottenham for the 201314 season of course , that will not keep real madrid from trying again next summer , perhaps with bale lobbying to leave at that point and perhaps with madrid being willing to fork over more than the record 80 million \( more than the 120 million \) that it paid manchester united for cristiano ronaldo in 2009 it only takes one buyer , said jerome de bontin , who spent seven years as an executive with monaco in the french league and is now the general manager of major league soccer s red bulls it is not as if there is an auction there is just one sporting director and one head coach and one owner who may believe that a certain player is going to help them win de bontin added i came from the financial world , and it is the opposite of that there is no transparency , no regulation in many ways , it is a totally irrational market longtime soccer fans know it was not always this way until 18 years ago , there were rules that allowed clubs to keep a player from leaving for a team in a different country even at the end of a player s contract , as well as quotas in several countries that restricted how many players from other nations were allowed on a given team in 1995 , however , the european court of justice ruled on a case brought by , a player for a belgian team who sued on grounds of restraint of trade after his team would not grant him a transfer the court s ruling , which abolished quotas on europeans and allowed players at the end of their contracts the right to leave without club consent , essentially opened the transfer market within europe that was the landmark case , laurent dubois , a professor at duke and politics , said in an interview the system as we know it now began with bosman from that point , teams had an incentive to deal players before their contracts expired or risk losing them for nothing given that possibility , cash is generally king bigmoney clubs like manchester united and barcelona \( which recently paid 57 million euros , about 74 million , to santos for the right to sign the brazilian wunderkind neymar \) can poach young talent as they see fit and the nouveau riche , like monaco , which is now backed by a russian billionaire , can leap to the upper echelon with a summer like the one the french league team is currently enjoying \( it has already spent about 120 million euros , or 155 million , to sign three top players \) smaller clubs can cash in by developing youngsters and then trading them \( though the odds of pulling off a superstar sale are always long \) , and dubois pointed out that despite the big splash of the topend transactions , the true foundation of the transfer system lies in the reality that most players are essentially owned by a club from a young age without a college system like the one in the united states , talented young players enter a club s academy as teenagers , or even at a younger age , and are trained and educated at some point in their late teens , they are either promoted to the club s top teams , released or dealt , if there is an interested buyer it s sort of like if duke sold players directly to the los angeles lakers , dubois said critics of the system point to the utter lack of transparency as well as the rampant opportunities for corruption and backroom bartering , but fans' fascination with the transfer system is immense countless web sites track transfer market rumors , and there is constant debate over players' hypothetical value some of the prices have become quite high , said stewart , but i think it is like houses for a while , houses went up and up and up now they have come down at some point , the same thing will have to happen in football of course , not all transfers are of the seven or eightfigure variety ian wright , an english striker , was sent from in 1985 for a set of free weights , and zat knight , a defender , went from in 1999 for 30 warmup suits neither of those transactions compares to the 2006 transfer of marius cioara , who was dealt from arad , , to regal horia , a team two divisions lower the price agreed upon was 15 kilograms \( roughly 33 pounds \) of sausage and other meat , but cioara left his new club with buyer s remorse , retiring a day after the transfer was processed in what is surely one of the more bizarre moments in transfer history , cioara s decision forced officials with regal horia to try and recoup their losses specifically , the meat by pleading with arad for repayment their requests were denied we are upset because we lost twice , a team official was quoted as saying by a romanian news agency firstly , because we lost a good player , and secondly , because we lost our team s food for a whole week
it s inevitable that we 'll have to get to a definition of ratchet , so let s dispense with it quickly to act ratchet is to act foolish , or trashy , to behave in a way that makes others shield their eyes it is the opposite of decorous there are plenty of places one can act ratchet in the club , in the bedroom but it s always about behavior that s dubious at best , that makes people point fingers in slackjawed astonishment and discomfort ratchet is exactly where ty dolla sign lives , and happily at that \( there is ratchet music , too , the dominant sound of los angeles hiphop that s also a place he lives more on that later \) on his fantastic new mixtape beach house 2 available for download at and is a song called ratchet in my benz , a filthy number about cycles of deception and mistrust , a love song for these dubious times he opens it creepily avert your eyes it s ratchet everywhere , especially , by the time the chorus comes around , in ty dolla sign s back seat ratchet in my benz is a lewd song , but also a lustrously beautiful one , full of dreamscape synthesizers and slowrolling drums , like a sunrise on a robotoccupied planet ty dolla sign is a deadpan singer , barely impressed by the feats of seduction that make up the whole of his interest set , but via vocal effects he sounds both heroic and sensual this is a trick he pulls off steadily through this often mesmerizing mixtape , one of the most arresting and alluringsounding releases of the year the lyrics are spiteful and raw , and sometimes downright unpleasant they 're also almost comically simple , emphasizing plain rhyme schemes and repetition but ty dolla sign s imagination is in the arrangements he does a good deal of the production himself which are lush and erotic he favors slow , thick beats that sound like caresses , sometimes with a motor gunning underneath , as on i bet , and sometimes , as on get it how i live and float , preferring unhurried bliss on 1st night , a brief flash of vocals explode in a zappesque digital spray \( ty dolla sign s father was a member of the funk band lakeside \) throughout , there are echoes of 1970s pornfunk and 1980s quiet storm rb , and there s also a surprising amount of violin on the album a cheap play for seriousness , but also effective presumably contributed by peter lee johnson , a violinist who has a series of hiphop and rb covers on youtube and a producer who worked on some songs here what ty dolla sign happily exploits is the increasingly thin line between hiphop and rb that s been blurred over the years by artists like tpain , r kelly and drake he s not an ostentatious singer often his lyrics sound like recitations , probably read off a smartphone notepad but he s got calm swagger with his singleminded commitment to singing about ratchet love , he s like thedream without the emotional baggage or the conscience as a songwriter thedream has written convincing songs for female singers , and for himself , as well as moving songs about vulnerability and heartbreak , but ty dolla sign is n't concerned with anything outside the reach of his own ego girl , i never made you any promises never said that we would be monogamous , he sings on these hoes on 1st night , he s a smooth abettor girl , be yourself ai n't nothing wrong with being ratchet only float approaches something like tenderness , but most of that comes courtesy of guest rapper iamsu , who sounds like a teenager bumbling through love for the first time mostly , ty dolla sign brings his guests into his frame of mind the sinewy rb singer trey songz sounds especially eager to get ratchet on 4 a young \( remix \) , and on one unprintably titled song , the los angeles rapper jay 305 sounds like a hyper , addled too short wiz khalifa , whose style is so lethargic it approaches existential sadness , appears here on two tracks ty dolla sign , who s been signed to atlantic records for some time , recently was brought under wiz khalifa s taylor gang imprint , which feels like a needless enforced cosign ty dolla sign is already well beyond the minor leagues that was true on my cabana , his breakout hit last year , even though it was more numbing than most of whoop ! , his excellent 2012 mixtape with the rapper joe moses , which was far more intriguing that mixtape was produced by dj mustard , the auteur of ratchet music it s the sound of tyga s rack city , and any number of strip club anthems icy , pulverizing , and with a hard swing in many ways , dj mustard s production is antithetical to ty dolla sign s relaxed cool , though the two have been working together for years on beach house 2 , dj mustard produced one of the standout songs , paranoid , about navigating two women in a club \( paranoid also appears on ketchup , the strong recent mixtape by dj mustard \) even over dj mustard s brittle metallic thump , ty dolla sign sounds as genteel as early new edition , though his subject matter is far sweatier for dj mustard , ratchet is just a sound for ty dolla sign , it s more than that it s a way of life
boston the returned to playing the brand of baseball they cherish clean and crisp , coolheaded and clutch and it still was not working still they trailed by a run in the seventh inning , thanks to a goahead home run by the irksome slugger david ortiz , sinking toward a twogamestonone deficit in the world series so they took a chance a double steal , with one out , putting two runners in scoring position and pressuring the red sox' defense and in a redemptive twist , boston proceeded to throw away its lead thursday , one night after the cardinals' defensive miscues were the focus in game 1 the result was a 42 victory for st louis at fenway park , evening this world series at one game apiece and affirming that , yes , the cardinals can loosen up in the spotlight and , yes , the red sox can be beaten on this stage it had not happened since october 1986 , game 7 against the mets a streak of nine consecutive boston victories in the world series but st louis had seen and heard just about enough of all that the guys stayed aggressive , cardinals manager mike matheny said that s the difference between yesterday and today you saw the aggressiveness offensively it was to be expected that the cardinals , considered among the soundest teams in baseball with 97 regularseason wins , would regroup after wednesday s defensive collapse three errors that ushered in three unearned runs during the cardinals' unsightly 81 loss matheny called it a wakeup call and said his players were embarrassed by their lackluster series debut for good measure , he replaced the struggling shortstop pete kozma , who committed two errors , and center fielder shane robinson , who bobbled a ball , in the cardinals' lineup the result was a nearflawless defensive effort , and a plucky offensive performance that did not wilt after the homer by ortiz in the sixth tarnished another sensational michael wacha performance in the seventh , the cardinals put two runners aboard with one out against boston reliever craig breslow , with kozma pinchrunning for david freese at second base on a 22 pitch to daniel descalso , kozma broke for third \( with jon jay trailing him to second \) and both players reached without a throw after boston catcher jarrod saltalamacchia bobbled the pitch jay said the steal call was not something issued from the dugout kozma read the situation on his own , and jay alertly followed it s one of those situations where i know he might take a chance and go for it , jay said after descalso walked , matt carpenter hit a fly ball deep enough to left field to score kozma on a sacrifice fly , as the throw from jonny gomes skittered a bit up the firstbase line but after backing up the throw , breslow tried to nab jay , who was advancing to third his throw sailed into the photographers' pen along the leftfield line , allowing jay to jog in with the goahead run while descalso moved to third carlos beltran , back in the lineup after a bruised rib knocked him out of game 1 , drove in the third run in the inning with a single to right it was the second time in the game that st louis held a lead noteworthy , considering that in 2004 , the cardinals trailed boston in every inning of the fourgame sweep that ended the red sox' 86year title drought the cardinals did not have wacha then he was 13 years old but the rookie righthander continued his dominating postseason run on thursday , limiting the red sox to two hits in his first five innings only one player on the red sox had faced wacha before , and that was will middlebrooks , in high school in texarkana , tex at one point they were teammates on an american legion squad whatever scouting report middlebrooks could have provided from those memories served little use on thursday wacha , now 22 , with his own deep and dark playoff beard , seemed as comfortable as he might have looked on those playing fields of east texas his fastball seemed to explode off the top of his 6foot6 frame , mixed with a changeup that died off his fingertips the potent boston offense that bombarded st louis for eight runs on wednesday was muzzled early wacha , only the 11th player age 22 or younger to start a world series game , struggled with his command at times , and the red sox' patience soon became a factor boston s hitters drew four walks , including dustin pedroia with one out in the sixth the next batter , ortiz , worked the count full before homering over the green monster in left , on a changeup , wacha s 103rd pitch i made a mistake , wacha said , and he made me pay that snapped a 20inning scoreless streak for wacha , a postseason record for a rookie , dating to the solo homer he surrendered to pittsburgh s pedro alvarez in the eighth inning of game 4 of the national league division series it also halted wacha s bid to match jon lester s shutdown performance the night before , a start that drew additional scrutiny thursday after speculation flickered on social media outlets that lester had doctored his pitches the hubbub began when a cardinals minor leaguer posted a screen shot on his twitter account that showed what appeared to be a greenish substance inside lester s glove red sox manager john farrell wound up addressing the matter along with lester , who said the discoloration was caused by resin , which helps pitchers maintain their grip on a ball matheny said the cardinals never instigated the matter or questioned anything about lester s glove or uniform we do n't deny that some things have been acknowledged , matheny said before the game and if that s what he claims , then that s what it is that s all there is to it and right now , it s pretty much a dead issue the matter receded quickly once the game a tense and taut affair throughout got under way the red sox threatened a final time in the eighth with jacoby ellsbury on first , the cardinals left in the righthander carlos martinez to pitch to ortiz , who singled to center the next batter , mike

after four seasons as a solid contributor for north dakota s basketball team , patrick mitchell graduated last year with one professional option a contract with a lowlevel club in portugal between waiting for other offers and lifting weights , the 6foot8 , 220pound mitchell spent last winter commuting to the prairie meadows casino in iowa , a 20minute drive from his hometown , des moines , before he received a lifechanging message an invitation to attend a combine in los angeles being held by the  australian rules football , or footy , is perhaps the continent s most popular sport an inaugural combine in 2012 ultimately led to eric wallace , a chiseled forward who suited up for ohio state , depaul and seattle , signing with the north melbourne kangaroos impressed by tapes that showcased mitchell s athleticism and versatility , the afl invited him to los angeles in april i was n't sure where my sports career was going , but i was n't ready to give up yet , said mitchell , who averaged 104 points and 44 rebounds as a senior in early august , after returning from a threeweek tryout in sydney , mitchell signed a twoyear deal with the sydney swans , one of australian rules football s more successful clubs along with wallace and shae mcnamara , another former ncaa division i basketball player , mitchell is the third americanborn athlete to join the league as an international rookie , further fueling the belief of afl officials that americans are so driven that they will compete even without a clear understanding of a game the afl seeks out basketball forwards and centers the scarcity of ruckmen the sport s tallest players \( 67 is usually the base height \) , who are responsible for beginning possessions , hauling in kicks \( known as marks \) and tapping airborne balls to teammates , has forced the league to expand recruiting efforts paul roos , a standout player who is now a coach in the swans' organization , was an early advocate of branching into the united states married to an american , roos has watched enough college basketball to believe the players' skills were a good fit because their heights and weights remain relatively unchanged after reaching their early 20s , it is easier to project their development , he said the combine s goal is to persuade americans with a murky basketball future that there is an alternative to overseas play or the nba s development league the afl is committed to the los angeles tryout through 2017 , boosted by the progress of wallace and mike pyke , a canadian rugby player who joined the swans five years ago and has become a celebrated ruck mike was the first from a completely different sport , said kevin sheehan , the afl s national and international talent manager , who has attended both combines people laughed at him for a few years , but after watching his progression , any coach now realizes they have to look at elite talent from other sports height is not the only qualification a finetuned skill set aids the transition college basketball players are drilled on proper boxingout technique and how to keep their body between an opponent and the ball that training helps when the footy is in the air and multiple pairs of hands are reaching for a mark the players have also honed their handeye coordination through countless entry feeds to the post a lot of your skill comes from how good your hands are and if they are soft enough , wallace said not only does a basketball player have to know what is happening to his side and behind him , but he also has to dribble a ball , two relatable aspects for every afl player basketball and footy are such 360degree games , while american football is always right in front of the player , said mick ablett , the league s academies development manager these basketball players are phenomenal athletes who are perfect to play our game founded more than a century ago , the afl endured growing pains until the late 1980s , with players often working second jobs to make ends meet but its 18 teams draw roughly 32 , 000 spectators a game , and the average salary is 300 , 000 each match features 22 players per team 18 on the field and reserves and the absence of an offside penalty allows players to roam the field , bouncing an ovalshaped ball every 50 feet and trying to score either 1 or 6point goals players typically run 11 miles during the threehour game the game is essentially , can you outlast your opponent \? said wallace , who now plays for north melbourne s minor league affiliate in ballarat most teams travel to utah or colorado after the season to train in highaltitude climates and improve their aerobic fitness recent expansion has strained australia s supply of able bodies and its established pipelines , which extend to the south pacific and to ireland , where a similar game , gaelic football , is a national sport since none of the afl franchises are privately owned , the league s rule book was modified in 2012 to encourage clubs to branch out of their recruiting comfort zones without incurring financial hits , allowing teams to sign three additional international , nonirish rookies who would be listed outside the salary cap the pipeline s key is indisputably jonathan givony , the founder of draftexpress , a college basketball scouting and statistics web site he first considers whether the player has a viable option of a pro basketball career we do n't want to invite someone who is filling a bit of time before a european offers comes in , ablett said givony watches video and analyzes various statistics to unearth potential rucks i check stats like offensive rebounds , blocks and steals , he said those are indicators of athleticism , and after i adjust for pace and per 40 minutes , i have narrowed down the field significantly wallace says fans are excited to see the beginnings of footy s international future , and the absence of a language barrier has helped the basketball players adjust quickly it s not basketball , but we are playing in a secure situation , as opposed to going to europe , where you might not get paid or be miserable because there is nothing to do or no one to talk to , said mark cisco , who traveled to sydney with mitchell and plans to return in october for the australianbased combine in hopes of signing a contract the payoff further complements the change mitchell s contract is worth around 150 , 000 , whereas nba development league players earn 25 , 000 , and the pay in europe varies substantially the salary also eases the burden of abandoning the sport that essentially anchored their lives for more than a decade i have n't lost my skills yet , though they are starting to taper out , wallace said it is the price that he , mitchell and others are willing to pay to be the first american to play in an afl match
three miles down a gravel road near rentiesville , okla , sits a portable building that , for now , serves as the headquarters for the honey springs battlefield state historic site here , on july 17 , 1863 , one of the civil war s most unique , consequential and forgotten battles took place the battle of honey springs was one of the few engagements in which the majority of the combatants were nonwhite , and it played an outsize role in the future of the indian territory , long after the war ended when the civil war broke out , most american indians on the frontier understandably wanted no part of it they were far from the action , and many had recently been forcibly removed to presentday kansas and oklahoma and yet , many indians were eventually pulled into the white man s war unlike the indians who were herded into presentday kansas from northern states , the five civilized tribes of indian territory creek , cherokee , choctaw , chickasaw and seminole were southern in their outlook and politics across five southern states , they intermarried with whites , built houses in town and owned plantations with slaves none of this protected them from envious neighbors who , as the interior south was settled in the early 19th century , demanded that authorities seize their sovereign lands by the early 1820s the great father , as they called the american presidents , was summoning chiefs to washington to sign landcession treaties these agreements became wedges that violently split each of the five tribal nations among the creeks \( now known as the muscogee nation \) , the opposition was led by opothle yahola \( also known as opothleyahola \) a wealthy landowner , christian convert and freemason , he had gone to washington but had refused to sign anything back in alabama , where he was head of the upper creek council , yahola denounced william mcintosh , a lower creek who had signed the treaty i have told you your fate if you sign that paper , he warned mcintosh in a council meeting beware on may 1 , 1825 , a band of upper creeks raided mcintosh s compound and assassinated him by 1826 the lower creeks had fled to the new indian territory eleven years later , with his options exhausted , yahola led 8 , 000 upper creeks out of alabama and along the trail of tears prosperity would return out west yahola even bought a few slaves but the two sides of the creek nation never reconciled in mid1861 , when lower creeks signed a treaty with the confederacy , the upper creeks demurred opothle yahola s heart was sad at all the war talk , one upper creek recalled years later whether from sadness or bitter memories of his forced removal , the old chief visited homes throughout indian territory , urging people to remain neutral but the lead southern recruiter , albert pike , was more effective he shrewdly sold the alliance as a chance for the five tribal nations to regain their sovereign status he even promised that the confederacy would resume the annuities that the united states government had stopped paying at the start of the war pike also recruited young warriors into indian regiments , assuring them they would never have to fight outside the territory in this he would soon be overruled by his superiors , who needed the indians to augment confederate forces at the battle of pea ridge , ark , in march 1862 the growing confederate tide meant that tribal members who wanted nothing to do with the rebellion found themselves and their families threatened many began gathering at yahola s plantation in late 1861 , a confederate party rode there to demand the chief sign a treaty or suffer the consequences instead , yahola fled the territory along with 9 , 000 indians , mostly creeks and seminoles and their black slaves with winter approaching , they struck out for fort row in kansas , some 250 miles north , where northern officials had promised the refugees safety , support and supplies confederate indians gave chase the wily chief s evasive maneuvers allowed the loyalists to avoid the brunt of two attacks but they were caught and badly beaten at chustenahlah , in presentday northeastern oklahoma , on dec 26 , 1862 dropping their supplies , the loyal indians fled with only the clothes on their backs by the time the survivors straggled into fort row weeks later to find few of the provisions that had been promised them , about 2 , 000 indians had been killed in the fighting along the way or died of starvation and disease but the warriors were now itching to fight at leroy , kan , that summer , about 1 , 000 refugees from yahola s band signed up for the new indian home guard being put together by kansas senator james h lane , who was always looking for bodies to throw at the enemy lane had already organized , over the objections of union army leadership , the first kansas volunteer regiment \( colored \) , made up mostly of emancipated africanamerican slaves from missouri and arkansas they were joined by the indians black slaves , who had gained their freedom on crossing into kansas in october the first kansas saw action before any other black regiment in the war , as lane sent them to chase bushwhackers out of an enclave in bates county , mo meanwhile , the prosouthern indian regiments led by gen stand watie , a mixedblood cherokee , and gen douglas hancock cooper were proving useful to the confederacy cooper , a mississippi native and veteran of the mexican war , was a commissioned colonel of the choctaw and chickasaw nations before the war watie , a skilled horseman , worked well with the white guerrillas who assumed a larger role in the confederate military now that the regular army was largely gone from the region after the battle of pea ridge gave the union army control over missouri , the war leadership in richmond had ordered most western regiments east to slow the momentum of ulysses s grant along the mississippi river whether this abandonment of the transmississippi was inevitable or a big blunder , it put in play the territory that had acted as a buffer for texas and extended the southern empire to the border of kansas , the most aggressively antislavery state in the union , with more men per capita enlisted in the federal army than any other state by june 1863 , kansas had a general who was ready to occupy this former confederate stronghold gen james g blunt , physician by training and a staunch ally of james lane , was the new commander of the army of the frontier he welcomed these newly formed black and indian regiments , which now included companies from the cherokee nation that had become disillusioned with the confederacy that spring the union army had retaken fort gibson , but for weeks cooper s forces had been harassing its supply lines , putting the fort under a virtual siege soon after taking command blunt learned that cooper had asked for 3 , 000 more men from arkansas , presumably to help take back the fort before the reinforcements could get there , the union commander made his move the first kansas , now fighting side by side with white units , helped repel watie as he attacked their supply train at cabin creek on july 1 and 2 they arrived at fort gibson , where blunt joined them a few days later the combined forces left the fort at 11 pm on july 16 and covered the 25mile distance to honey springs , a point near the confederate line , in just eight hours at honey springs , blunt wrote afterward , his force strength was less than 3 , 000 men , mostly indians and negroes he marched them south in tight formation , giving the rebels the illusion of facing an army that was larger than it really was cooper s 6 , 000man confederate force included two regiments each of cherokees and creeks , a mixed regiment of chickasaws and choctaws , two texas cavalry units and a squad of texas partisan rangers , a division the army had created to deputize guerrillas the federals fanned out on the prairie , with the first kansas in central position at 10 am the fighting commenced with a barrage of artillery fire many of the indian combatants had never seen heavy artillery at work before one reported afterward his horror at seeing a cannonball tear open the innards of a soldier standing next to him the south may have held the numerical advantage , but the north s superior weaponry 12 cannons to just 4 pieces of confederate light artillery , new springfield rifles versus the usual hodgepodge of outdated guns and squirrel rifles soon directed the outcome making things worse for the rebels , their lowerquality gunpowder often failed to fire because it was wet from an earlymorning rain the pivotal moment occurred when the men of the first kansas were ordered to advance on the texans before then while the black soldiers engaged in a firefight , part of the indian home guard lost its way in the massive plume of smoke and drifted into the line of fire when their commander yelled at them to get back in formation , the texans assumed the whole union line was being ordered to retreat , and with a rebel yell charged forward the first kansas , which had held their ground , calmly fired away at nearly point blank range panic ensued , and those texans who were not mowed down by the gunfire took off running cooper could not close the gap left by the fleeing texans and ordered a general retreat , which turned into a rout the confederate loss was 181 killed , wounded and captured , to just 77 for the federals the loyalists could now return home but the great chief would not join them the second trail of tears was too much for opothle yahola he had expired under miserable conditions at fort row , kan , a few months before honey springs follow

shoehorned into half the museum of modern art s design department , designing modern women 18901990 is a confusing exhibition but an excellent conversation starter organized by juliet kinchin , curator , and luke baker , curatorial assistant in the department of architecture and design , the show presents design objects by more than 60 women , many of whom collaborated with male partners some , like and , are well known to design aficionados but most will be unfamiliar to a general audience , and there are none whose influence and fame rival that of any number of wellknown male designers , from josef hoffmann and gerrit rietveld to frank lloyd wright and frank gehry if the exhibition were intended not to celebrate female designers but to lament how sexism kept them down , you would n't have to change a thing confusion begins with the exhibition s first object a tall , wooden side chair designed by from 1897 why begin with a man s work \? labelreading viewers will learn that from early in his career , mackintosh collaborated with his wife , , an acclaimed artist during her lifetime though not well remembered today two lithographs attributed to both represent imagined interiors for a palatial home to be called house of an art lover the label notes , mackintosh was at pains to acknowledge his wife as more than a muse , allegedly declaring margaret has genius i have only talent' when you consider how many objects on display are identified as collaborations between men and women charles and ray eames , and robert venturi and denise scott brown , to mention two teams fascinating questions arise are women naturally prone to collaborate , or have they tended to partner up to get ahead in a maledominated profession that has a limited view of their creative capabilities \? the exhibition seems to waffle on this issue , but a label quotes s recollection of her first meeting with the architect le corbusier in 1927 from her 1998 autobiography , une vie de cr ation what do you want \? ' he asked , his eyes hooded by his glasses to work with you' he glanced quickly through my drawings we do n't embroider cushions here , ' he replied , and showed me the door not long after that , however , he hired her to work in his furniture department , and , in 1928 , she designed three chairs , including the chromed tube and padded red leather displayed here but that chair is attributed not only to perriand but also to le corbusier and his partner and cousin pierre jeanneret this is puzzling were all three directly involved in designing the chair \? or are the men s names included because perriand worked for them \? that s something you 'd want sorted out by an exhibition that means to bring female designers out from the shadows of their betterknown male counterparts another project that le corbusier assigned to perriand is the exhibition s biggest and most complex a , a modernist residential building in marseille , france , completed in 1952 recently acquired and restored by , this kitchen appears cramped by today s standards , like a ship s galley hanging on hooks , by the way , are examples of metal designed in 1958 by , later to become the influential architecture critic , and her husband , the eminent industrial designer , for the four seasons restaurant on the threshold of an age of explosive consumerism , the efficient and hygienic kitchen was a major concern for mid20thcentury designers , and it was conceived to be the natural province of women so it probably was no accident that the task of designing kitchens for the unit d'habitation fell to perriand this was in keeping with a broader trend in the design profession women entering the field were regularly shunted into supposedly genderappropriate disciplines that is reflected in this exhibition , where almost everything is for domestic consumption , including dinnerware , ceramic vases , ashtrays , fabrics and toys if there have been important female designers of tools , automobiles and skyscrapers , that sort of work remains unrecognized here that may be partly because the period covered by the show ends in 1990 since then , women have advanced in maledominated fields it also may reflect the underrepresentation of women in moma s collection in light of the mostly domestic sorts of work in this show , the intended ambiguity of its title comes to the fore it s not only about female designers it s also about how women have been , in some sense , designed by modern design , according to conventional notions of what women naturally are like to underline this point , there are numerous posters representing women , many by men a turnofthe20thcentury set includes alphonse mucha s art nouveau advertisement for sarah bernhardt in medea from later decades , there is a selection of vibrant psychedelic rock posters from the 1960s by bonnie maclean among pieces from the punk era is a poster reproducing robert mapplethorpe s photograph of patti smith , posed like a raffish female sinatra in a white shirt , with a sport coat slung over one shoulder , which graced the cover of her debut album , this graphic imagery is part of what makes the exhibition confusing and , at the same time , thoughtprovoking it represents the opposite of the woman as domestic engineer and selfeffacing collaborator she is a wild , free spirit , a fantasy of undesigned woman yet she is manifestly a product of collective social design of movies , fashion and visual art of all kinds who of us , male or female , is not in some measure a product of design \? that s the big question , which a tobehopedfor expanded and updated version of this exhibition would thoroughly investigate
in the 51 years that the and the have shared new york , although hardly equally , more than 100 players have worn the uniforms of both teams and that figure does n't include casey stengel , who managed both clubs still , s decision to take his bat and glove from one side of the robert f kennedy bridge to the other is unusual in one respect few who played for both new york teams went directly from one team to the other and of those who did , virtually none were frontline players in their prime , as granderson probably still is one exception might be robin ventura , who was traded from the mets to the yankees after the 2001 season and then hit 247 in 2002 with 27 home runs and 93 runs batted in but he turned 35 that summer and was not really the standout player he had been what about david cone \? he starred for the mets and then the yankees , with whom he won four world series rings , but he made stops with other teams in between al leiter \? he started his career with the yankees , and later was far more formidable with the mets , but , like cone , he played elsewhere on his way from one new york team to the other here is a look at some notable yankees who eventually ended up with the mets , for better or worse , often the latter now it s granderson s turn good luck , curtis he was the mets' first manager , in 1962 saddled with one of the worst teams in baseball history , he did what came naturally to him he played it for laughs with the yankees , of course , he won five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953 and then added two more later on with the mets \? ah , forget it he started his major league career with the yankees but made a name for himself marvelous marv , in fact only when he became an original met in 1962 a first baseman , he hit 244 in 116 games with 16 home runs that season , which was n't all that bad still , he managed to become the symbol of that historically hapless team , the player who , as the story goes , failed to touch either first or second base as he legged out a triple he was a hall of fame catcher for the yankees and a manager for both teams far less remembered is that he actually came out of retirement in 1965 to play four games for the mets just as he was turning 40 he got two hits in nine atbats , thought better of the whole thing and put away his mask and chest protector for good baseball s career stolen base leader , he starred for the yankees in the second half of the 1980s and then , a decade later , ended up on the mets at age 40 he proceeded to have an excellent 1999 season 121 games , 315 average , 37 steals and helped the mets make it to the national league championship series but by 2001 , he had worn out his welcome and was gone he won two rings with the yankees as a classy second baseman and later finished his career on a bad 1992 mets team in 2005 , he became the mets' manager in 2006 , he nearly took them to the world series in june 2008 , he was fired in the middle of the night , new york time he came out of cuba with his high leg kick and won championships with the yankees in his first three seasons in the major leagues in 2006 , the man known as el duque joined the mets in june and pitched well but he was now a met , so naturally he injured his leg right before the postseason he said he was confident he could get back on the mound if the mets made it to the world series , but they fell one game short instead , st louis advanced to play detroit the tigers' center fielder \? curtis granderson

kabul , afghanistan more than half of the afghan presidential hopefuls had their hopes dashed on tuesday when the country s election commission declared that their candidacies did not meet documentary or citizenship requirements the announced that it had ruled out 16 candidates , leaving 10 including all the major contenders remaining in the campaign for the presidency in april they either did n't meet the conditions set for citizenship , or their supporter list did n't meet our conditions or there were problems in their documents , said the head of the commission , ahmad yousuf nuristani most of the excluded candidates were secondtier power players , like the former commerce minister , who in all likelihood stood little chance of winning still , at least a few had recently resigned from their governmental posts for the express purpose of running as for the more wellknown challengers , all supposedly met the criteria despite lastminute whispers that the perceived frontrunner , former foreign minister zalmay rassoul , would be knocked from the roster it is unclear exactly how these candidates met the criteria for running while the others did not , and the independent election commission did not elaborate the presidential election has become a central focus for the international community , which is placing a great deal of pressure on afghanistan s government to stick to the april timeline while few expect the process to be perfect , electing a new president to replace the twoterm hamid karzai has become a crucial benchmark of progress it is also seen as a foundation for a future afghanistan as the western presence begins to fade as such , international scrutiny of the electoral process , and especially the election commission , is likely to remain close several members of the commission have ties to the presidential palace and mr karzai , initially prompting concerns about its neutrality although some afghan officials still consider mr rassoul to be mr karzai s preferred candidate to succeed him , that assessment is increasingly coming into question amid rumors that the relationship has been souring otherwise , none of the remaining candidates have emerged as clear frontrunners for now , the candidates have one more official hurdle to cross before they are formally placed on the ballot the elections complaints commission that body is tasked with reviewing any evidence submitted against the presidential hopefuls that could disqualify them , including human rights abuses or war crimes still , the complaints commission is unlikely to produce the sort of culling that tuesday provided while more than a few of the candidates have questionable records from the past 30 years of war and political maneuvering , none have ever been convicted on such serious charges
on the day president obama signed the affordable care act into law , an exuberant vice president biden famously pronounced the reform a big something deal except that he did n't use the word something and he was right in fact , i 'd suggest using this phrase to describe the obama administration as a whole fdr had his new deal well , mr obama has his big deal he has n't delivered everything his supporters wanted , and at times the survival of his achievements seemed very much in doubt but if progressives look at where we are as the second term begins , they 'll find grounds for a lot of \( qualified \) satisfaction consider , in particular , three areas health care , inequality and financial reform health reform is , as mr biden suggested , the centerpiece of the big deal progressives have been trying to get some form of universal health insurance since the days of harry truman they 've finally succeeded true , this was n't the health reform many were looking for rather than simply providing health insurance to everyone by extending medicare to cover the whole population , we 've constructed a rube goldberg device of regulations and subsidies that will cost more than singlepayer and have many more cracks for people to fall through but this was what was possible given the political reality the power of the insurance industry , the general reluctance of voters with good insurance to accept change and experience with romneycare in massachusetts hey , this is a great age for irony shows that such a system is indeed workable , and it can provide americans with a huge improvement in medical and financial security what about inequality \? on that front , sad to say , the big deal falls very far short of the new deal like fdr , mr obama took office in a nation marked by huge disparities in income and wealth but where the new deal had a revolutionary impact , empowering workers and creating a middleclass society that lasted for 40 years , the big deal has been limited to equalizing policies at the margin that said , to the bottom half of the income distribution , paid for largely through new taxes targeted on the top 1 percent , and the fiscal cliff deal further raises taxes on the affluent over all , 1percenters will see their around 6 percent for the top tenth of a percent , the hit rises to around 9 percent this will reverse only a fraction of the huge upward redistribution that has taken place since 1980 , but it s not trivial finally , there s financial reform the doddfrank reform bill is often disparaged as toothless , and it s certainly not the kind of dramatic regime change one might have hoped for after runaway bankers brought the world economy to its knees still , if plutocratic rage is any indication , the reform is n't as toothless as all that and where its mouth is for example , hedge funds strongly favored mr obama in 2008 but in 2012 they gave threequarters of their money to republicans \( and lost \) all in all , then , the big deal has been , well , a pretty big deal but will its achievements last \? mr obama overcame the biggest threat to his legacy simply by winning reelection but george w bush also won reelection , a victory widely heralded as signaling the coming of a permanent conservative majority so will mr obama s moment of glory prove equally fleeting \? i do n't think so for one thing , the big deal s main policy initiatives are already law this is a contrast with mr bush , who did n't try to privatize social security until his second term and it turned out that a khaki election won by posing as the nation s defender against terrorists did n't give him a mandate to dismantle a highly popular program and there s another contrast the big deal agenda is , in fact , fairly popular and will become more popular once obamacare goes into effect and people see both its real benefits and the fact that it wo n't send grandma to the death panels finally , progressives have the demographic and cultural wind at their backs rightwingers flourished for decades by exploiting racial and social divisions but that strategy has now turned against them as we become an increasingly diverse , socially liberal nation now , none of what i 've just said should be taken as grounds for progressive complacency the plutocrats may have lost a round , but their wealth and the influence it gives them in a moneydriven political system remain meanwhile , the deficit scolds \( largely financed by those same plutocrats \) are still trying to bully mr obama into slashing social programs so the story is far from over still , maybe progressives an everworried group might want to take a brief break from anxiety and savor their real , if limited , victories
washington since 1978 , a secret court in washington has approved national security eavesdropping on american soil operations that for decades had been conducted based on presidential authority alone now , in response to broad dissatisfaction with the hidden bureaucracy directing lethal drone strikes , there is an interest in applying the model of the court created by congress so that surveillance had to be justified to a federal judge to the targeted killing of suspected terrorists , or at least of american suspects we 've gone from people scoffing at this to it becoming a fit subject for polite conversation , said robert m chesney , a law professor at the university of texas he said court approval for adding names to a counterterrorism kill list at least for american citizens abroad is no longer beyond the realm of political possibility a drone court would face constitutional , political and practical obstacles , and might well prove unworkable , according to several legal scholars and terrorism experts but with the war in afghanistan winding down , al qaeda fragmenting into hardtoread offshoots and the 2001 terrorist attacks receding into the past , they said , it is time to consider how to forge a new , trustworthy and transparent system to govern lethal counterterrorism operations people in washington need to wake up and realize the legal foundations are crumbling by the day , mr chesney said that realization seemed evident at thursday s as cia director , which became a raucous forum for complaints about the expansion of counterterrorist strikes and the procedures for deciding who should die senator ron wyden , democrat of oregon , was one of those who complained that he could not get the administration to even list the countries where lethal strikes had been carried out among republicans , senator saxby chambliss of georgia said he thought that killing had become a dubious substitute for capture a program that began in the shadows was dragged for the first time into the spotlight of congressional debate today , with al qaeda s core in pakistan hugely diminished and osama bin laden dead , the terrorist threat is far more diffuse than it was a decade ago most dronefired missiles now kill not highlevel terrorists plotting to attack the united states , but a mixed bag of midlevel militants and foot soldiers whose focus is often more on the pakistani or yemeni authorities than on the united states and since a september 2011 drone strike deliberately killed an american citizen , anwar alawlaki , who had joined al qaeda in yemen , the legal and moral rationale for such strikes has been hotly debated even if they are glad mr awlaki is dead , many americans are uneasy that a president can use secret evidence to label a citizen a terrorist and order his execution without a trial or judge s ruling hence the idea of court oversight for targeted killing , which on thursday , unexpectedly , got serious discussion from senators and mr brennan first , senator dianne feinstein , democrat of california , who is chairwoman of the senate intelligence committee , said she would review proposals for establishing such a court her remark got a strong second from senator angus king of maine , an independent having the executive being the prosecutor , the judge , the jury and the executioner all in one is very contrary to the traditions and the laws of this country , he said mr brennan then made a striking disclosure the obama administration had held internal talks on the feasibility of such a court i think it s certainly worthy of discussion , mr brennan said what s that appropriate balance between the executive , legislative and judicial branch responsibilities in this area \? an administration official who spoke of the white house deliberations on the condition of anonymity said had asked his security and legal advisers a year ago to see how you could have an independent review of planned strikes that includes possible judicial review people on the national security staff and the legal side took a hard look at it , and the discussions are still going on , the official said there are a lot of complexities you 'd need legislation and probably a new judicial body the fisa court was created by congress in 1978 after revelations of widespread eavesdropping on americans by the national security agency and the federal bureau of investigation convinced congress that the executive branch had proved incapable of properly policing itself eleven judges from around the country sit on the court , but one is on duty at a time , hearing cases in a special highsecurity courtroom added to washington s federal courthouse in 2009 in 2011 , according to the most recent statistics , the court approved 1 , 745 orders for electronic surveillance or physical searches , rejecting none outright but altering 30 a drone court would have the same appeal , bringing in an independent arbiter but it is likely there would be serious limitations to its jurisdiction most experts say judges do not have the alacrity or expertise to rule on a frantic call from the cia every time a terrorism suspect is in its sights a better approach would be to have the court rule on whether the government had enough evidence against a suspect to place him on the kill list but if the court s jurisdiction extended to every foreign terrorism suspect , even some proponents believe , it might infringe on the president s constitutional role as commander in chief senator king , for instance , said he thought the court would pass constitutional muster only if it were limited to cases involving american citizens with such limits , however , a drone court would not address many of the most pressing concerns , including decisions on which foreign militants should be targeted how to avoid civilian deaths and how to provide more public information about strike rules and procedures in terms of the politics and the optics , are n't you in the same position that you are now \? said william c banks , a national security law expert at syracuse university it s still secret the target would n't be represented it s a mechanism that would n't satisfy critics or advance the due process cause much indeed , hina shamsi , director of the american civil liberties union s national security project , said that a drone court would be a step backward , and that extradition and criminal prosecution of suspected terrorists was a better answer i strongly agree that judicial review is crucial , she said but judicial review in a new secret court is both unnecessary and unamerican nor are judges clamoring to take up the challenge at an american bar association meeting in november , a retired fisa judge , james robertson , rejected the idea that judges should approve death warrants my answer is , that s not the business of judges , mr robertson said , to decide without an adversary party to sign a death warrant for somebody
foxborough , mass when they were little , the harbaugh brothers fought so heatedly that john , the older one , once recalled his mother wailing you 're brothers ! you 're not supposed to act like this ! john and jim , the younger one , have they are the first brothers to be nfl head coaches last season they said they each sent game film to their adored father , jack , a former college coach who inspired their careers and this season each made risky decisions to enliven their offenses on sunday , the brothers , separated in age by 15 months , grew that much closer , leading their teams , john s and jim s , to conference championship victories on the road that set up a family feud twist on the , to be played in new orleans in two weeks the harbowl i do n't know if we had a dream this big , john harbaugh said we had a few dreams we had a few fights we had a few arguments we will try to stay out of that business we 'll let the two teams duke it out as much as possible the ravens' 2813 victory over heavily favored new england was their first win in three afc championship game appearances in the last five years , and it returned them to the super bowl for the first time since the 2000 season , when they trounced the giants for the franchise s only title baltimore linebacker ray lewis was at the height of his career then , the defensive player of the year and the unquestioned leader of a defensedominated team that dragged the offense to the championship several weeks ago , lewis after he tore his triceps early in the season , the ravens kept him off the injured reserve list in hopes he could return for the playoffs a deep playoff run seemed unlikely , though the team lost four of the last five games in the regular season , and john harbaugh even made the drastic decision to change offensive coordinators in december , a move that mirrored jim s decision to make the inexperienced colin kaepernick his starting quarterback after alex smith was injured the ravens' offense has played nearly perfectly in three playoff victories quarterback joe flacco has thrown eight touchdown passes and no interceptions so lewis s career will end on a fitting stage for one of history s greatest defensive players , one who has watched the transformation of the ravens from a team that struggled to score touchdowns during its first championship run to one that outdueled the nfl s best offense sunday last week , lewis , in a passingthetorch moment , said that flacco had grown up after he had beaten peyton manning and the denver broncos in a doubleovertime divisionalround upset this time , flacco outshone , who was hoping to become the first quarterback to reach six super bowls brady and the have won three of them , but none since the 2004 season they lost their last two to the giants , and now , with the rise of the ravens , the patriots' dominance over the afc has succumbed to a new challenger it was the first time in 68 games that brady started that the patriots lost at home after leading at halftime flacco led three sustained scoring drives including one of 90 yards and another of 87 yards with a mixture of nohuddle passing and timely runs by ray rice , undoubtedly aided by the early departure of patriots cornerback aqib talib , who injured a thigh and did not return but in a nod to the glorious defensive past , it was a tip of a fourthquarter brady pass by ravens defensive end pernell mcphee launching the ball into the air before it descended into the hands of linebacker dannell ellerbe that effectively ended the patriots' season baltimore led by 15 points at that point , but new england had been driving into ravens territory brady looked stunned as he walked off the field , and that was to be expected for most of his career , those were the kinds of mistakes that the patriots usually forced on their opponents instead , their offense sputtered throughout the game , with dropped passes , bad throws and stalled drives new england was shut out in the second half by , and lost three turnovers to , a ravens defense that for much of the season had looked to be in decline it was the first time since week 2 of the 2009 season that the patriots were held to fewer than two touchdowns shut them out in the second half ! ravens linebacker terrell suggs screamed as he came off the field tell them to have fun at the pro bowl then suggs called the patriots arrogant and cursed them on paper , new england owned the first half , rolling up 47 plays to baltimore s 27 but thanks to a bit of botched clock management at the end of the first half brady scrambled with seconds ticking away and then waited too long to take a timeout the patriots had to settle for a field goal that gave them a 6point lead at halftime in the third quarter , the ravens went on a drive that lasted almost four minutes , stretched 87 yards and included no third downs baltimore specialized in a deepstrike offense this season , but this was the kind of clockchewing drive it needed to give the tired defense a rest and to keep brady off the field by the time brady got the ball back , the patriots were trailing a short flacco pass to dennis pitta on the right side of the end zone did the job and they did not score again , the ravens' defense taking over , same as it ever was he s one of the elite quarterbacks , patriots safety steve gregory said of flacco i know he gets a lot of flak for maybe possibly not being that type of guy , but , you know , he is new england s final gasp , long after the stands had emptied , ended with a brady pass s being intercepted in the end zone with about a minute to play brady trudged off the field , and with patriots fans having fled to their cars , the seats closest to the field were left to the thousands of purpleclad ravens fans who had made the trip ravens players sprinted onto the field , jubilantly flacco walked along the side of the gillette stadium field , greeting fans brady was long gone into the locker room the patriots' dynasty of the last decade seemed , at that moment , to be in decline perhaps it will rise again next season but the harbaugh brothers , their fights long behind them , might be about to begin one of their own
moscow georgian police have arrested four men who took part in a on a gay rights demonstration in tbilisi that injured dozens , the georgian interior ministry announced tuesday the police said the men , the first to be arrested in the violence on friday , face up to 90 days in prison for hooliganism and disobeying police orders the powerful georgian orthodox church helped to organize the rally and video showed several priests participating in the street fighting georgia s prime minister , bidzina ivanishvili , has called for prosecutions following the violence , but the case is expected to upset his relations with the church ilia ii , the georgian orthodox patriarch , distanced the church from attacks on gay rights demonstrators in a statement on friday police released names and of the arrested men , who were brought to a tbilisi police station in street clothing none was identified as a member of the clergy
gov chris christie of new jersey has scheduled an oct 16 special election to replace frank r lautenberg , the democratic senator who died on monday mr christie will appoint a replacement for mr lautenberg in the interim , but he has yet to announce his pick his choice of timing for the special election , however , may indicate that he expects the republican candidates to be weak the timing is unusual in that new jersey will hold its gubernatorial election , in which mr christie will be on the ballot , just three weeks later on nov 5 under state law , mr christie could have arranged for the senate election to be held on the same day \( he could also perhaps have delayed it until november 2014 , although that would have relied on a more controversial interpretation of the state s statutes \) one theory is that mr christie is concerned about anything that might interfere with his chances of reelection or suppress his margin of victory if so , however , the timing of the special election would qualify as exceptionally risk averse , especially for a politician who has a reputation for taking chances mr christie has an overwhelming lead in polls against the likely democratic nominee , state senator barbara buono , and he remains extremely popular in new jersey there is always a chance that news or political events could intervene between now and november to harm his standing , but his losing the race would be one of the greatest political collapses in recent memory mr christie might also be interested in helping republican candidates for the state legislature democrats control both the senate and the assembly , but all seats will be up on the nov 5 ballot with a popular republican governor heading the ticket and no interference from the united states senate race , the gop might have a better chance of winning one or both chambers of course , mr christie could also have used his coattails to help his party s united states senate nominee his move might suggest that his ambitions remain mainly in new jersey , and less on the national stage then again , being reelected and having a more successful second term with less democratic opposition in the state legislature could also leave him in a stronger position were he to run for president in 2016 the implicit thread between all these hypotheses is that mr christie seems to view the senate contest as a liability as i wrote on monday , a strong gop nominee could potentially make the race competitive , although the republican would probably remain an underdog but with a lackluster candidate in a blueleaning state , the republicans would be all but conceding the race to mayor cory booker of newark , the most likely democratic nominee , who has strong favorability ratings in the state and is expected to build a robust and expensive campaign operation while some national republicans are annoyed with mr christie s decision , they may not be privy to all the information he had about which republican candidates might have been interested in mr lautenberg s seat it s plausible that mr christie could have helped a reasonably good gop nominee to a narrow victory but if none were interested in the race , it may have been a lost cause it may be reasonable to infer , then , that mr christie evaluated the republican field and did not like what he saw and that mr booker is poised to win the senate seat with relative ease
moscow edward j snowden , the fugitive intelligence analyst , settled into a secluded , uncertain selfexile here on friday amid signs that the united states and russia might try to contain the diplomatic fallout over russia s decision to grant him temporary asylum the american ambassador here , michael a mcfaul , met friday with one of president s senior aides to discuss the new status of mr snowden , but also a range of other international issues , including cuts in nuclear stockpiles , missile defense and the conflict in syria the american embassy announced the ambassador s meeting with the aide , yuri v ushakov , in a posting on its in russian , but embassy officials declined to elaborate on the discussions mr ushakov previously said mr snowden s case was not important enough to derail russia s overall relationship with the united states , and the inclusion of other topics suggested that the administration was trying to gauge whether cooperation was still possible in advance of planned meetings between mr obama and mr putin in september on thursday , after mr snowden of an airport transit zone where he had remained for five weeks after arriving in moscow from hong kong on june 23 , the white house protested and questioned the utility of the planned summit meeting between the two leaders in moscow the white house stopped short of announcing that mr obama would cancel it a senior russian lawmaker , igor n morozov , said friday that he could not rule out the possibility mr snowden might leave russian territory before the end of the month , resolving at least in part the latest irritant in relations this temporary decision leaves the russian side a certain space for maneuvering , including the possibility to organize the movement of snowden to another country , mr morozov , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the upper house of parliament , told the interfax news agency the russian side is interested in snowden leaving our territory , and this whole story is not a reason for worsening relations with the united states by friday evening , the kremlin had made no official statement about mr snowden s fate , though mr putin had ample opportunity to make remarks as he fielded questions from supporters attending an annual youth camp at seliger lake northwest of moscow none of the questioners in what is typically a scripted encounter with the public broached the controversy , nor did mr putin raise it mr snowden s whereabouts also remained a mystery the russian lawyer who handled mr snowden s appeal for temporary asylum , anatoly g kucherena , said mr snowden had found a place to live but declined to say where , or even to specify whether it was in moscow he said mr snowden continued to mull his next steps , understanding that his situation remained far from settled legally as you know , he is receiving threats from the united states government every day , mr kucherena said the situation is heating up mr snowden had previously indicated that he hoped to receive political asylum in latin america , possibly bolivia , ecuador or venezuela an official at the venezuelan embassy said officials there had had no contact with mr snowden since his release officials at the embassies of bolivia and ecuador declined to comment mr kucherena added that mr snowden had agreed informally to the condition that mr putin set for staying in russia , though he had made no written statement to that effect if he wants to stay here , mr putin said in july , there is one condition he must stop his work aimed at inflicting damage on our american partners , strange as it sounds from my lips
what we see today with is really pilobolus lite after all , this company , which tips acrobatics over into various aspects of dance , poetry and drama , was founded in 1971 , and all companies evolve what was and is pilobolism \? on monday evening , watching program b of this company s current fourweek season , i noted that one of the features that made it phenomenal in the 1970s was its often undifferentiated presentation of gender take , for example , molly s not dead \( 1978 \) like most pieces in the troupe s repertory , this features two women and four men when the six break up into couples , there s no difference between a malefemale couple and a malemale one or , when the dancers enter in trios , one in which one man carries two other men is presented as essentially the same as one in which a man carries two women today that would raise few eyebrows anywhere but i remember how a number of choreographers bill t jones , mark morris and others worked in the 1980s to establish this kind of sexual parity in modern dance in ballet , it is still the exception rather than the norm in the '70s , pilobolus made it seem idyllic molly s not dead , choreographed by five members of the original troupe robby barnett , alison chase , moses pendleton , michael tracy and jonathan wolken also features the dream logic that made the best pilobolus pieces so transporting nonetheless , this is n't and was n't ever one of those best works it s one of those cutely clowning numbers that support the contention of some people that the company has been pilobolus lite all along program b s other four items are all from this century ren e jaworski is their common denominator symbiosis \( 2001 \) was choreographed by mr tracy in collaboration with otis cook and ms jaworski when she was in her second year with the troupe now she is one of its associate artistic directors and is named as a cocreator of all three of the other works skyscrapers \( its other cocreators were trish sie , paula salhany and the original dancers \) and azimuth \( made by ms jaworski , mr tracy and michael moschen with the pilobolus dancers of the time \) were new last year licks , created by ms sie and ms jaworski in collaboration with six performers , was new in june and is having its new york premiere performances these pieces are all light and all harmless i also find them all disappointing , but that s because each offers glimpses of how it could have been developed into something more intensely poetic the title of licks presumably refers to its use of rope i'm sorry that this encourages the six performers to make mockfierce , openmouthed faces at the audience as they lash the air or the floor one is benjamin coalter , the company s newest and often its freshest member elsewhere here , although he s named as one of the dancers who helped choreograph the piece , his manner is as stale as everyone else s what are we to make of a work that , in its second month of life , suggests that its original cast is already bored with it \? the ropes here are used with characteristic pilobolan ambiguity they 're lassos or they 're cordons or they 're vertical lines that s an admirable compositional method there are brief sequences of wit and imagination here but the music pop technorock by nortec collective presents bostich fussible is , as usual with pilobolus , merely aural wallpaper used for tempo and atmosphere the whole piece stays pop , callow too much of the pilobolus repertory is cotton candy skyscrapers is named after its music , written by damian kulash and performed by ok go it s paced like a pop video one couple succeeds another in vaguely ballroomtango style the emphasis is on changes of costume and scenery the dance potential of each situation seems to interest nobody much in azimuth , the gimmicks are colored balls and metallic hoops and arcs the six dancers handle them and one another in a fluent sequence at times we see patterns , shapes and phrases all interconnecting with poetic intensity , but those moments soon evaporate a problem here is that the piece tries for a beauty of phrasing that the current pilobolus dancers do n't really have when a performer simply runs around the space , there s none of the fluid grace that you might have with a paul taylor or mark morris dancer the symbiosis duet shows some of the charm of pilobolan gymnastics the woman \( eriko jimbo \) scampers over the man \( on monday , shawn fitzgerald ahern \) or rolls up him as if gravity and physics were no issue but mr ahern s physicality is the coarsest in the current troupe he has strength and control without refinement ms jimbo , expert in execution , turns everything into pat , cute slickness
landon donovan s selfimposed exile from soccer has often been described as unprecedented or unusual , but this is hardly true there is a rich and compelling history of surprising celebrity sabbaticals , with a wide variety of outcomes some stars return from their time off to tremendous success \( bob dylan , the director \) others return to find that it might have been better if they had stayed away \( the actor arnold schwarzenegger , the comedian dave chappelle \) still others , of course , do not really come back at all \( j d salinger \) in all likelihood , donovan s return will fall somewhere in the middle , not rising as high as michael jordan s blistering resurgence nor falling as low as bjorn borg s disaster the common thread through nearly all of these unexpected breaks , including donovan s , is the public divide on whether the sabbatical is necessary , appropriate and worthwhile certainly that schism exists here as the united states national soccer team gathers in colorado this week for the first of two critical world cup qualifying matches , not all of the attention is on friday s game with costa rica or tuesday s at mexico instead , much of the focus is on donovan , a player who is not even there has not played in a match , taken part in a practice or done any significant soccer activity since december , save for what looked to be an enjoyable pickup game with children on a  to some , that departure feels like an abandonment , of both the united states team and the , donovan s major league soccer club , which has begun its season without him to others , it is a reasonable and necessary break for a player who was a part of the first fulltime residential academy for american players in 1999 and has essentially helped the sport grow in this country ever since , in the process becoming the national team s career leading scorer whatever the spin , the reality is this donovan , 31 , was determined to step back he began seriously entertaining the notion of a break from soccer early in 2012 , and galaxy coach bruce arena said his initial conversations with donovan in may or june led him to wonder if donovan would remain with the team for the entire season he was really searching then , arena said i thought he might go but he got through the year and , at that point , it was clear he was spent todd dunivant , a teammate of donovan s with the galaxy , said donovan s fatigue was obvious if he did n't take the break , it would have been unhealthy , dunivant said it was n't just that his legs were tired it was everything after the season ended with donovan helping to lead the arena hoped donovan would reconsider but at dinner in january at mangiamo , an italian restaurant in manhattan beach , calif , donovan and his agent , richard motzkin , told arena that an extended break was necessary arena , who is a former national team coach and has known donovan since he was a teenager , did not hide his feelings i told him it was a bad plan , arena said in a recent interview i thought it was a bad idea these are the challenges that professional athletes have none of us get any breaks coaches do n't get any so i told him that i respected his decision , but that s how i felt nonetheless , donovan , who declined a request to be interviewed for this article , slipped away from the public eye after that dinner , allowing himself what motzkin described as a decompression in addition to the physical and mental pressures of soccer , donovan also divorced his wife , bianca , in 2010 with soccer temporarily out of the picture , donovan did things that he had n't been able to do for the past 15 years , motzkin said he reconnected with family he went to maui for dunivant s bachelor party he attended the weddings of several friends he spoke to students at the university of southern california he took part in , after the shootings at sandy hook elementary school he also walked his dogs , often , on the strand in manhattan beach , simply enjoying the freedom that comes with not having another game or another practice or another tactical session in front of him on one of those walks he saw alexi lalas , a former defender for the united states national team , who also lives in the beach area and who also took a break from the sport when he was 30 lalas could sympathize looking back at his decision , he said he took a year off because i was fried if i was going to be any use to anyone , i needed to do it , he added he said he spent his time away driving across the country and , most important , chasing a girl , which , he added , was great because she s now my wife and we have two kids given his own experiences , lalas was of two minds on donovan s break , he said on one hand , he empathized , noting that donovan was one of the first young players to come through and skip out on the college experience completely that makes a difference on the other hand , though , lalas noted that donovan s absence from the national team could not come at a worse time with a new coach in jurgen klinsmann , a lot of injuries and a difficult qualifying schedule , i cannot think of a time when more is unsettled and undecided when it comes to the personnel and how the team wants to play landon is a part of that lalas added his teammates there can still be his friend they know him so well but from a soccer perspective , they can also say he let us down there s no question it does creep into the way you view him klinsmann has been reticent to elaborate on his thoughts on donovan s situation as expected , he maintains that donovan will be considered for the team if and when he returns to top playing form but until then , he said monday , donovan is not part of the plans because simply he is not playing and not training asked if he would ever consider a personal appeal for donovan to come back earlier , klinsmann said no donovan initially planned to extend his break until the middle of 2013 after discussions with arena and motzkin , among others , though , he revised his schedule barring a lastminute change , he is expected to make his first public appearance with the galaxy early next week at the white house , when the team meets president obama he will then train with the galaxy in the washington area the next day will he be ready for the galaxy s concacaf champions league semifinal in early april \? will klinsmann call him in for the three \? to those close to donovan , specific issues like those are less important than the larger concern of whether the time away makes an impact on his mental state donovan s fierce introspection , which can be a burden , is well known lalas , who played with donovan and later was his general manager in los angeles and san jose , said donovan s cerebral nature was a part of his talent but lalas also conceded , there is an element , when it comes to landon , where you just want to slap him in the face and say , hey , snap out of it arena , too , praised donovan s sense of responsibility , but added he s constantly searching for utopia and we all know you ca n't find that motzkin said donovan has every intention of earning his way back to the national team , and he reiterated that donovan , despite being the face of american soccer for years , does not expect special treatment like everyone who takes a sabbatical , donovan will surely face fallout from teammates and others affected by his absence , but all the years and effort he has given the national team should help smooth his return kyle martino , a former teammate who is now an analyst for nbc sports , recalled the 2003 confederations cup in france , when a bomb threat forced the united states team to stay locked in its hotel donovan , martino said , worked with the hotel staff and somehow arranged for the team to occupy a series of connecting rooms he then opened all of the connecting doors and organized an xbox video game tournament was the game of choice which turned the mood from us psyching ourselves out because of the scare to just relaxing , martino said that was what he did , he s an optimist and a pragmatist , martino added to be honest , i think he did life a little bit in reverse he had n't switched off since he was 16 , where most other guys did n't start that life until their mid20s so now he needed this in many ways , donovan s professional happiness may have come during his two loan spells in england s premier league , where he played with everton in 2010 and 2012 tim cahill , a teammate at everton who now plays with the red bulls in mls , said he recalled donovan being free as a bird in england and reveling in a situation that allowed him not to be the captain , not to be the team s best player and not to be the perpetual focus one night , at the behest of cahill and phil neville , donovan and edson buddle , another american who was training with everton , even broke into song for their everton teammates at a restaurant i just remember his smile , cahill said he was happy whatever happens with this break , i hope he finds that happiness again dunivant , who has spoken with donovan frequently , believes donovan has done just that i 've never seen him happier , he said he s in a better place , there s no doubt he s relaxed what that means from a soccer sensibility , of course , remains to be seen when jordan returned to basketball from his baseball break in 1995 , it was as if he had never left ten years later , though , when the nfl running back ricky williams returned from his walkabout in 2005 , his career was never quite the same i'm the first to say that when i first heard about it , my thought was n't , yes , that s a wonderful idea , arena said but i have made peace with it , and in this case , with this player , it makes sense do i think , ultimately , that it will help landon \? arena added yes , i do he paused at least i certainly hope so
beware of conservatives bearing gifts ever since last week s frustrating supreme court argument in the defense of marriage act case , i ve been wondering whether the attack on doma will turn out to be a constitutional trojan horse it may bring victory the demise of a spiteful federal statute , enacted by an opportunistic congress and signed into law 17 years ago by a cowardly bill clinton but at what price \? you might have thought the case , united states v windsor , was about equality marriage equality , in the graceful current locution the two lower federal courts that ruled in this case on its way to the supreme court held that the constitution s equal protection guarantee required the federal government to treat married couples , samesex and oppositesex , equally for purposes of the more than 1 , 000 provisions of federal law that relate to marital status i thought that s what the case was about , too but what reverberated from the bench was the discordant music of federalism the federalism that almost sank the affordable care act the federalism that seems about to put a stake through the heart of the voting rights act the revival of the mid1990s federalism revolution that had seemed , until recently , to have run its course at the supreme court with the departure of two of its most energetic guardians of states rights , justice sandra day o connor and the late chief justice william h rehnquist i m hardly the only one to have heard this music some other progressives have sounded downright relieved at the prospect that if there aren t enough votes on the court to strike doma down on equality grounds , at least the law might fall to the argument that defining marriage is the states business , into which the federal government has no business intruding in the new republic , jeffrey rosen criticized roberta a kaplan , the lawyer for the plaintiff , edith windsor , and more mildly , solicitor general donald b verrilli jr , for not embracing the federalism alternative served up to them by chief justice john g roberts jr but as these two lawyers clearly recognized , striking down doma on federalism grounds is a truly bad idea , and the campaign for marriage equality would be worse off for it to explain the argument is to reveal its dangers a ruling that left the states to their own devices when it comes to marriage would take the equal protection guarantee out of the picture it would , of course , provide the full benefits of marriage to those living in states that chose to recognize samesex marriage but it would snatch away the promise for those living elsewhere , particularly if the decision was based not only on the asserted absence of federal authority but on exaggerated notions of state sovereignty anchored in the tea party s favorite constitutional amendment , the 10th \( the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people \) just such a vigorous constitutionally based states rights argument was put forward in a brief filed in the case last month by a halfdozen law professors under the title , brief of federalism scholars one of the group , prof randy barnett of the georgetown university law center , is justly regarded as the intellectual father of the commerce clause attack on the affordable care act doma falls outside congress s powers because marriage is not commercial activity , the brief declares it argues further that by limiting federal recognition to marriages between men and women , the law undermines the states sovereign authority to define , regulate and support family relationships there is much that s questionable about this assertion of implicitly boundless state authority over family affairs a famous pair of supreme court decisions from the 1920s armed parents with rights under the due process clause to educate their children as they see fit , in resistance to state laws pierce v society of sisters gave parents the right to choose private or religious schools despite an oregon law that required public school education for all meyer v nebraska struck down a state law that barred the teaching of modern foreign language \( the law s postworld war i target was german \) nor is this ancient history in 2000 , the court struck down a state law in washington that gave grandparents the right to visit their grandchildren over the parents objection justice o connor wrote the court s opinion , troxel v granville , which was joined by chief justice rehnquist and of course the most famous federal intervention of all was loving v virginia , the 1967 decision \( shockingly recent \) that overturned the laws of virginia and 15 other states prohibiting marriage between people of different races virginia maintained that its law did not amount to racial discrimination because the prohibition ran equally in both directions just as blacks couldn t marry whites , whites couldn t marry blacks either consequently , the state argued , the case came down to a simple matter of federalism but chief justice earl warren s unanimous opinion didn t buy it marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man , the court said the freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men the right , in other words , belonged to the individuals involved , not to the state the federalism attack on doma picked up steam in the days before the march 27 argument professor michael mcconnell of stanford law school , a leading constitutional scholar and social conservative , wrote in the wall street journal that if the court both avoided the merits in the california proposition 8 case \( as appears likely \) while striking down doma on federalism grounds , the combined effect would be to reaffirm america s democratic , decentralized decisionmaking process without imposing an answer one way or the other to the samesex marriage question the headline on george will s preargument washington post column proclaimed doma is an abuse of federalism mr will , whose enthusiasms in the realm of legal affairs often mirror those of his friend , justice antonin scalia , relied heavily in his column on the federalism scholars brief i hate to sound cynical , but where have these people been for the past 17 years \? where were they when edith windsor got a federal estate tax bill of more than 300 , 000 , a tax she wouldn t have had to pay had doma not barred the internal revenue service from recognizing a spousal exemption based on her new yorkrecognized marriage to her partner of more than 40 years \? can it be that the conservative legal world is afraid that it can t hold justice anthony m kennedy to an antimarriage position and so is trying to cut its losses by persuading him that if he takes the federalism route , he can have samesex marriage \( in the nine states that already have it \) and states rights too \? perhaps none of this should be surprising federalism tends to emerge from under the rocks in times of constitutional ferment , when the status quo is cracking and needs some propping up last month , the legal world celebrated the 50th anniversary of gideon v wainwright , the decision that gave indigent criminal defendants the right to a lawyer at my friend gloria phares s law firm in manhattan , the lawyers listened to the audio of the gideon argument and were struck by the court s attention to florida s argument that the principle of federalism shielded it from having to comply with the sixth amendment s guarantee of the right to counsel during the argument on jan 15 , 1963 , a florida assistant attorney general , bruce r jacob , told the justices that imposition of an inflexible rule in this area would be an unwarranted intrusion into historic rights of the states to determine their own rules of criminal procedure he went on by imposing an inflexible rule in all criminal cases , we feel that this court would be intruding into a field that has been historically reserved for the states substitute marriage for criminal procedure and you timetravel into last week s argument but you will listen in vain for the voice of justice william o douglas , who brushed away concerns about what he dismissively called this federalism to ask has any member of this court come out and said in so many terms it s the constitutional right of a state to provide a system whereby people get unfair trials \? the answer , of course , was no the vote in gideon was 9 to 0 last week , solicitor general verrilli , pressed repeatedly to say something nice about federalism , refused to play the game the case , he insisted , was about discrimination lawyers rarely get the chance to speak to the court in paragraphs when mr verrilli got that chance , he took it , telling the justices i think it s time for the court to recognize that this discrimination , excluding lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from federal benefits , cannot be reconciled with our fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law this is discrimination in its most very basic aspect it was as eloquent a statement of principle as the court hears these days will it translate into at least five votes \? i d like to think so
thomas m messer , whose leadership of the over more than a quartercentury established its place among the world s great museums of modern art , died on wednesday at his home in manhattan he was 93 his death was confirmed by a family spokesman , adam lehner mr messer became director of the museum in 1961 , just two years after it moved into its on fifth avenue with a spiralramp gallery , designed by frank lloyd wright he retired in 1988 , as the guggenheim foundation , of which he had been director since 1980 , was celebrating 50 years of supporting modern art during his tenure one of the longest of a director of any major american art museum the guggenheim deepened its collection , expanded its exhibitions program , vastly improved its publications and took its first step toward becoming a global institution perhaps mr messer s most significant contributions were the acquisition of two magnificent private collections in 1963 , justin k thannhauser , the son of a german art dealer , presented a , dozens of impressionist , post impressionist and early modern works including more than 30 by picasso to the guggenheim as a permanent loan that act immediately gave breadth to the museum s collection , whose core has always had a 20thcentury focus \( when mr thannhauser died in 1976 , those paintings became part of the guggenheim s holdings \) in 1969 , after years of ardent encouragement from mr messer , peggy guggenheim agreed to exhibit a selection of cubist , surrealist and abstract expressionist works from her private collection at the museum that bears her family name evidently no mean feat of suasion , as the independentminded ms guggenheim spent much of her adulthood estranged from her family and was known not to admire the museum building \( it looked like a huge garage , she wrote in her autobiography \) the exhibition was a success , and ms guggenheim , who died in 1979 , finally donated the whole of her collection , along with the , her former home on the grand canal in venice , to the guggenheim foundation , which now operates it as a museum known as the peggy guggenheim collection the gift not only strengthened the foundation s holdings substantially it includes picasso , braque , kandinsky , de chirico , ernst and pollock but it also gave the guggenheim its first foothold internationally the museum has since opened the guggenheim museum bilbao and the deutsche guggenheim berlin \( a 15year partnership with deutsche bank to present exhibitions that concluded this year \) , and is planning a guggenheim abu dhabi it was due to tom s charm , grace , diplomacy and and this is a point that none of us should ever forget his love of great art that peggy gave her collection and palazzo to the guggenheim and not to the tate , peter lawsonjohnston , who was the guggenheim s president during mr messer s directorship , said at a celebration of mr messer s 90th birthday in 2010 he added here we are , three decades later , with guggenheims in bilbao , berlin , venice , and soon to be abu dhabi the foundation for all this was laid by tom messer and i can tell you , he laid that foundation under budget thomas maria messer was born in bratislava , in what was then czechoslovakia and is now slovakia , on feb 9 , 1920 his father was an art historian and a professor of german his mother came from a family of musicians though he himself had an artistic bent , he was sent to study chemistry , first in prague and then in the united states , at thiel college in pennsylvania , though his travels abroad began inauspiciously he left home on sept 2 , 1939 , for england , whence he would cross the atlantic the next day england declared itself at war with germany , and within hours the athenia , the ship on which mr messer was traveling , was torpedoed and sunk he was rescued and subsequently made it to the united states on a different ship he eventually left thiel and chemistry to study modern languages at boston university , graduating in 1942 afterward he joined the army , serving in europe as an interrogator for military intelligence after the war he remained in europe , and formally studied art for the first time at the sorbonne when he returned to the united states he became director of a small museum in roswell , nm , and earned a master s degree in art history from harvard before landing at the guggenheim , he was director of the institute of contemporary art in boston mr messer leaves no immediate survivors his wife , the former remedios garcia villa , died in 2002 when mr messer arrived at the guggenheim , he had to establish wright s building as an appealing space for exhibiting art a vexation he was widely given credit for solving for an early exhibition of sculpture , he discovered that the curling snail shape of the gallery could make vertical pieces appear atilt , so he had plinths built to combat what the new york times described as an optical illusion created by surroundings where every line or plane either slants or curves and may devilishly do both at once lisa dennison , who was at the guggenheim from 1978 to 2007 as a curator and later as the director , said mr messer showed the possibilities of using the frank lloyd wright space and the rotunda in remarkable ways she cited a 1978 mark rothko show , that showed the museum itself could look exquisitely beautiful , and a subsequent show featuring work by joseph beuys , the german sculptor and installation artist , who took the place over and used it as a venue for almost a sitespecific exhibition mr messer cultivated a strong roster of curators , opening up opportunities for women , and gave them unusual flexibility , especially in the realm of contemporary american art at the same time , as a european he championed european artists , among them dubuffet and beuys he brought an oldworld charm and values to an american institution , said ms dennison , now chairwoman of sotheby s north and south america he created this incredible dialogue between postwar american and european art unlike his successor , thomas krens , mr messer was not an especially controversial director , and not a devotee of the blockbuster school of exhibiting there were , of course , controversies , including a 1971 group exhibition in which the french artist daniel buren hung a 66foot banner that divided the museum , obscuring pieces by other artists , who raised loud objections mr messer had the banner removed the night before the opening the same year , objecting to a work that exposed new york slumlords because the museum was not a proper place for social and political activism , mr messer canceled a show by hans haacke shortly before it was to open , leading to accusations of censorship appreciative of the business side of things , mr messer was a team player , mr lawsonjohnston said in a telephone interview on wednesday i remember one day he took me out to have lunch with dubuffet , and in the cab he said to me , you know , peter , dubuffet loves capitalism'
boston i was in the middle of having chinese food with my wife and friends yesterday afternoon when we heard the dull and deathly reverb the water in our plastic cups rippled we looked at one another , and someone made a joke about that famous scene in jurassic park we tried to drown the moment in humor but then a rush of humanity descended upon us in the prudential center on boylston street , right across from where the second bomb blast had just occurred , near the marathon s finish line people gushed across the hallway like fish in white water rapids it was a blur of bright clothes and shiny sneakers , everyone dressed up for patriot s day weekend on what was moments ago a beautiful spring day instantly , images of the shootings in aurora , colo , newtown , conn , and tucson came to mind i felt my thoughts reduced to singular flashes my life , all of it , was the first my wife , sitting across me , was the second i yelled out to her to run , and we did , not knowing what had happened , only that it had to be something terrible we ran out of the food court and onto the terrace overlooking boylston street we could see people fleeing from the finish line even as , in the distance , other weary marathoners kept running unknowingly toward the devastation what was left of the food court was a land frozen in an innocent time , forks still stuck in halfeaten pieces of steak , belongings littered unattended i felt fear beyond words this was not my first experience with terror , having grown up in pakistan but for some reason , i did n't think back to those experiences looking onto to the smoked , chaotic boylston street , i forgot about cowering in my childhood bedroom as bombs and gunfire rained over the army headquarters in rawalpindi , close to our house my mind did not go back to when i stood on the roof of my dormitory in karachi as the streets were overrun with burning buses and angry protesters after the assassination of benazir bhutto none of the unfortunate experiences of growing up in the midst of thousands of victims of terror , personally knowing some of them , helped me in that moment nothing made it any easier perhaps , if i had been thinking more clearly and had n't had my wife with me , i might have gone down to try to help the wounded but at that moment all i could think about was getting us out of there we lost our friends , then found them again our cellphones were n't working and then , as we worked our way through the dazed throngs in back bay , i realized that not only was i a victim of terror , but i was also a potential suspect as a 20something pakistani male with dark stubble \( an ode more to my hectic schedule as a resident in the intensivecare unit than to any aesthetic or ideology \) , would i not fit the bill \? i know i look like hollywood s favorite postcoldwar movie villain i 've had plenty of experience getting intimately frisked at airports was it advisable to go back to pick up my friend s camera that he had forgotten in his child s stroller in the mall \? i remember feeling grateful that i was n't wearing a backpack , which i imagined might look suspicious my mind wandered to when i would be working in the intensive care unit the next day , possibly taking care of victims of the blast what would i tell them when they asked where i was from \( a question i am often posed \) \? would n't it be easier to just tell people i was from india or bangladesh \? as i walked down commonwealth avenue , i started receiving calls from family back home they informed me about what was unfolding on television screens across the world i was acutely conscious of what i spoke over the phone , feeling that someone was breathing over my shoulder , listening to every word i said careful to avoid urdu , speaking exclusively in english , i relayed that i was safe , and all that i had seen i continued to na vely cling to the hope that it was a gas explosion , a subway accident , anything other than what it increasingly seemed to be an act of brutality targeted at the highest density of both people and cameras the next step was to hope that the perpetrator was not a lunatic who would become the new face of a billion people not a murderer who would further fan the flames of islamophobia not an animal who would obstruct the ability of thousands of students to complete their educations in the united states not an extremist who would maim and hurt the very people who were still recovering from the pain of sept 11 president obama and gov deval l patrick have shown great restraint in their words and have been careful not to accuse an entire people for what one madman may have done but others might not be so kind
from the beginning , it seemed this season would be defined by age its benefits , its limitations and its consequences , with the precise weight of each effect to be determined by the 82game schedule the verdict remains murky at this late stage of the season , but for the moment , the knicks are quite grateful for the 30somethings in their midst , the healthy ones at least \( age 35 \) continued his new york revival saturday night , his boundless energy propelling the knicks to of the that doubled as a gift to on his 40th birthday looking more like a spry 25yearold , martin leapt and dunked and gestured and soaked in the adulation at madison square garden , making his value felt with every point \( 18 \) , rebound \( 7 \) and blocked shot \( 2 \) , and every celebratory howl the knicks might never get kurt thomas \( age 40 \) and rasheed wallace \( 38 \) back , but for now , they are being sustained by martin , their sixtholdest player and the latest to join the rotation all i 've ever known the young man to be is someone that plays with high energy , coach mike woodson said and sometimes , that rubs off our defense has really picked up since he s come over and we 've started to give him minutes woodson added , i'm just glad he s in a knick uniform carmelo anthony led the knicks with 28 points , and j r smith had 25 off the bench , but it was martin who , for the second straight night , provided the raw fuel the knicks needed to get through the game they seized control for good late in the first half , during martin s most energetic sequence he began with a putback dunk , which he punctuated with fullbody convulsions and hoots toward the fans along the baseline then came another powerful dunk , on a lob from kidd then a powerful swat of john lucas s jump shot finally , martin converted a reverse layup while drawing a foul , which came with more headbobbing and hooting toward the crowd , which hooted with him for martin , who had been out of the league for eight months when the knicks signed him , every moment is worth celebrating i'm playing for now and i'm playing for beyond now as well , he said i just do n't want this to be it if it s going to be here next year , which i would love for it to be , i just want people to know that i still can play the game of basketball i was n't the no 1 pick for nothing with backtoback victories over the raptors , the knicks \( 4226 \) have their first fourgame winning streak since early february the momentum is well timed the knicks head to boston on tuesday , then come home to play memphis the next night guys seem like they 're starting to find their groove right now , individually and as a team , anthony said we feel like we starting to get our confidence back , slowly but surely the raptors arrived without rudy gay , their leading scorer , who injured his back in friday s game and did not make the trip they instead leaned on kyle lowry \( 14 points \) , demar derozan \( 17 \) and alan anderson \( 14 \) the rout had added benefits for the knicks anthony , who played 43 minutes friday , was needed for only 30 and got the fourth quarter off kidd played only 23 minutes but he stayed in long enough to make a bit of history with a 3pointer early in the fourth quarter that shot made kidd the oldest player to make 100 3pointers in a season the previous recordholder was reggie miller , who hit 134 3pointers in 20034 , at age 38 before tipoff , the rookie chris copeland took the microphone and led the crowd in singing happy birthday to kidd , who simply smiled i was very surprised that the garden sang me happy birthday , with chris copeland as the soloist , kidd said anthony was matched up against landry fields , his former teammate , for much of the night , and he seemed to relish the chance to punish him at both ends he bullied fields in the post , drained turnaround jumpers over him and generally treated him with practiced disdain the matchup became heated in the third quarter when fields , dribbling the ball across midcourt , drove a shoulder into anthony s abdomen anthony winced and howled in anger , looking for a foul when none was called , anthony turned and shoved fields with two hands , drawing a flagrant foul1 it was just a reaction , anthony said it still hurts rebounds tyson chandler may return for tuesday s game in boston chandler has missed six straight games , the last five with a bulging disk in his neck kenyon martin , who has been starting at center , will probably return to a bench role when chandler returns , mike woodson said saturday woodson wants to keep carmelo anthony at power forward , with martin as his primary backup
quirks of the game is a regular feature on the times sports blogs the head snaps , the arms flail , the leg shoots out and then , more often than not , the whistle blows flopping in recent years , the nba has endured a plague of flagrant histrionics , a practice that grew so insidious , particularly in the playoffs , that the league stepped in this season with an antiflopping rule last year there seemed to be an increase in embellishment in the postseason , said stu jackson , the nba s executive vice president for operations the rule decreed that the call would not be made by referees on the court but by the league after reviewing game film a first violation would bring a warning subsequent infractions would yield a series of escalating fines starting at 5 , 000 , possibly culminating in the player s suspension this was ignored for far too long , said jeff van gundy , an espn analyst and former knicks coach , who is among the most vocal critics of player flopping and the league s inaction the players were engaging in deception , and with so many camera angles it made the officials look bad to the fans the tactic has a rich , albeit disreputable history that seems to trace its modern roots to bill laimbeer and his 1980s detroit pistons teammates some blamed the influx of european players in the decades since , pointing to childhoods of playing soccer , which has an even deeper tradition of melodramatics but others pointed out that certain top universities , like duke , seem to teach deception as a core curriculum course many players immediately cried foul about the flopping rule , while pundits and analysts said that it lacked teeth and that players would not be deterred without technical fouls or steeper fines van gundy was skeptical that the league s penalties would be sufficient he had argued that the flopper should not benefit from a foul call even if there was contact the league didn t agree with me on that , van gundy said steve javie , now an espn analyst after a quartercentury as an nba referee , said he believed it would be a mistake for referees to try to make those calls or to assess technical fouls , especially since such calls could change the outcome of the game video replay is necessary to catch the true culprits but heading into allstar weekend , the rule has proved strict enough to cut down noticeably on the overacting it s a good rule , jackson said , adding that the warnings issued early in the season showed the players that the nba was taking this seriously there was an uproar initially but you re not noticing as much flopping , said the former nba champion steve kerr , who will be calling the allstar game on tnt with marv albert and reggie miller even van gundy has been won over by the results give the league credit it may be imperfect but it was important that they take the first step , he said , adding , but i also applaud the players for cooperating \( the players association did file a complaint , saying it wasn t consulted on the implementation \) there have been transgressors , of course there are guys who just can t help themselves it s in their dna , javie said , but maybe when they re fined for a second or third time they ll stop the first fine for overacting , appropriately enough , occurred in los angeles , though it was a member of the nets reggie evans who was busted in a game against the lakers the nets lead the nba in flopping violations evans and gerald wallace are two of only four players to be fined so far , and cj watson has also been warned the pace of violations has slowed , which suggests to kerr and javie that players realize the rule is going to be enforced it has been effective , javie said i ve seen some guys react to minimal contact and start falling , and then it clicks in and they stop themselves one big question remains will everything change in the postseason \? when the rule was announced , the clippers blake griffin opposed it but also said , if it s game 7 of the nba finals and a guy has a chance to make a play , he s going to be like , well , do i want this 10 , 000 or do i want a championship \? that point is especially valid , van gundy said , because in recent years the biggest stars none of whom have been charged with flopping yet have been among the most frequent offenders , with lebron james earning particular notoriety in october , when the new rules were posted on nbacom , it ended with this line the league said it will announce a separate set of flopping penalties for the playoffs at a later date but jackson said that s not the plan he thinks the current rule , plus the notion of being shamed in the national spotlight , should suffice there s a certain amount of attention in the postseason and most players don t want to be labeled a flopper , so that should be enough of a deterrent , he said , promising that if playoff problems persist , the league will respond van gundy added as long as the league stays vigilant it ll work out perhaps the only thing worse than postseason flopping is pulling that trick in a pickup game anyone who does that , van gundy said , should be summarily dismissed , forever since this season may mark the beginning of the end of flopping , it s only fitting to celebrate this allstar weekend with an alltime flopping team the list of candidates is endless , as are the examples just google rudy gonzalez and invisible elbows to see one brilliant performance but there s little question about who tops the ballot vlade divac would be the captain , javie said kerr went even further you have to call the team the vlade divac allstars , he said vlade was worse than bill laimbeer kerr also said danilo gallinari of denver deserves to be on the team for some of his antics , while javie cited vince carter , derek fisher and dikembe mutombo he said he wasn t surprised that jj barea or evans were among the first players fined evans can run through a brick wall , but when anybody touches him he falls down some players are more subtle and get away with more , like manu ginobili , who kerr said is very crafty and is so tricky anyway with his body s motions the sneakiest , though , is likely the retired reggie miller , who van gundy said was the first superstar to engage in deception miller s specialty , kerr said , was not a fake charge but an offensive move he d tangle his arms with yours and then flail his arms , kerr said , adding that drazen petrovic also excelled at this move and reggie would only do it when you were in the penalty so the next thing you know they re shooting two free throws and you re yelling at the ref reggie used to fool us all the time , javie said you d watch the game film after and think , oh , not next time but he still did it
my sunday column argues that the great rand paul filibuster represented an important step in the kentucky senator s quest to widen the republican conversation on national security beyond the strength good , appeasement bad rhetoric that the party had fallen back on \( though not as completely as some republicans would like \) in the aftermath of the bush presidency the most persuasive counterpoint to my interpretation is that the right s rally around paul s dronesonamericansoil stand is sui generis , with no wider implications for the gop foreign policy debates many of the republican party s hawks have always been skeptical of drone warfare \( preferring boots on the ground , more prisonertaking , etc \) , and the fact that paul was making a reductio ad hellfirum argument about drones taking down latterday jane fondas made it that much easier for them to leap on the partisan bandwagon and standwithrand this is dave weigel s point , explaining why so many normally interventionist republicans were willing to take sides with paul against john mccain , and it s correct as far as it goes but given how republican foreign debates have proceeded in the recent past , i still tend to think the legitimization of rand paul as a rightwing folk hero has implications that extend beyond the narrow hypothetical where he chose to plant his filibuster flag that s because , as i ve argued before , the relative sterility of the foreign policy conversation on the right doesn t reflect a deep conservative uniformity on national security questions rather , it mostly reflects the fact that the potential standardbearers for a less interventionist worldview have been relatively easy for hawks to delegitimize as cranks , israelhaters , rinos , etc and so the fact that a lot of the support for paul from his fellow republicans is opportunistic and confined to a narrow policy hypothetical matters less than the fact that the support exists at all that a politician who has consistently advocated a more militarilyrestrained foreign policy is suddenly being supported , elevated , and extolled at the expense of his more interventionist critics within the party none of this means that the entire party is about to tilt dramatically toward realism but legitimizing , as real conservatives \( tm \) , politicians who advocate restraint is a necessary precondition to broader policy change opportunism follows influence , and creates it and right now paul has more influence within his party than every other realist , paleoconservative and libertarian republican of the last decade put together
miami it is not an issue that should keep him , or anyone , up much later than an nba finals game ends , but someday is going to be remembered as the greatest power forward in league history or one of its most distinguished centers perhaps it will be both , depending on the eye of the beholder or neither , for the millions who watched the valiant duncan come so close to a fifth championship , only to have the lose a 5point lead in the final minute of regulation and lose game 6 to lebron james and the heat , 103100 , in overtime tuesday night at american airlines arena duncan finished with 30 points all in the first three quarters and 17 rebounds in what looked like a vintage performance from one of his generation s very best players , who ca n't be categorically fit into any assigned place it s a big mistake to try to put tim duncan into a position , said bill walton , who , when fully healthy early in his career , was as complete a conventional center as the game has seen he s not a forward , not a center , he s a basketball player he s like larry bird or michael jordan or magic johnson , walton continued they play the position that their team needs them to play or the game dictates they play they define their eras by their ability to do whatever it takes not one ever to be accused of understatement , walton may have been the first to include duncan in such exalted company of doitall superstars many would consider that a reach but whatever we called him , duncan , for 16 years , has been the face of the franchise with the best winning percentage in any of the major north american professional sports for years there have been questions about duncan s true position , many of them technical , for the purpose of allstar ballot listings , and some of them broader and addressing his eventual legacy back in south florida with the san antonio spurs , it s safe to say that duncan would not have object to being called a point guard if that would have assured him the fifth ring of his 16season professional career the same number as magic , and one fewer than jordan but if the decision of spurs coach gregg popovich to start a small lineup in game 5 and again in game 6 achieved anything beyond rousing manu ginobili from a serieslong slumber , it confirmed that duncan , at his core , is a center he was the guy towering over the rest of the spurs' starters , none of whom stood taller than 6foot7 , or 4 inches shorter than duncan at 37 , duncan has remained the spurs' hub at both ends of the floor , although tony parker has undeniably become the engine of the offense duncan s ability to set the high screen and handle and shoot the ball away from the basket has formed the basis of the case for him as a forward but even when he teamed with david robinson for his first six years in san antonio , duncan had the more potent post game of a traditional center , while both were forces to fear in the lane on defense after robinson retired in 2003 , duncan was paired with a variety of interior \( and inferior \) players nominally referred to as the center this season , again listed as a forward on the spurs' roster , he started alongside the rugged but limited 611 tiago splitter until game 5 of course , eras change , styles evolve the influence of players imported from europe and the greater reliance on the 3point shot have opened up the game and unclogged the lane in some respects , basketball analysts reacted to the indiana pacers' 72 roy hibbert and his impressive post play as if he had been teleported from games played 30 years ago meanwhile , the pacers were eliminated in the eastern conference finals by miami , which considers chris bosh , with his facethebasket , perimetershooting skills , to be its center playing in three decades , duncan has been a major force in the paint , if not to the extent of shaquille o'neal he has also been an effective jumpshooter , if not in the class of dirk nowitzki but put it all together , while making the indisputable argument that no star in duncan s generation has been a better overall teammate , and what you have is a player who has soared above the sum of his hybrid parts it has long been speculated that the spurs began listing duncan as a forward to avoid having him compete with o'neal and later yao ming , who benefited from the powerful chinese voting bloc , for the starting position on the western conference allstar team maybe there has also been some consideration of posterity it would no doubt be easier to sell duncan over karl malone than bill russell , wilt chamberlain and kareem abduljabbar for now , walton said i can guarantee you that all he s thinking about is getting that title and this is the hardest , against lebron james and the defending champions , on the road duncan found out just how hard on tuesday night after coming so heartbreakingly close game 7 , thursday night
ardmore , pa s sunday at the 113th began with fans singing happy birthday to him as he appeared on the practice range at 2 20 pm almost exactly five hours later , the fans in the grandstand behind the 18th green cheered , chanted and stomped their feet as mickelson walked toward them in mickelson s cavalcade of disappointment at the open , he often approaches a closing scene like this with a lead no one has finished second in the event as often as mickelson he has had the lead at the open with three holes left and lost once , he had the lead with two holes remaining and lost and most famously , he had a onestroke lead with one hole to play in 2006 he lost but this time , mickelson trailed justin rose by a stroke as he walked to his ball at the last hole , and perhaps the crowd grasped the juxtaposition , seizing upon the notion of a miracle turnaround had mickelson not already holed a shot from 75 yards for eagle on the 10th hole \? this time , he needed to chip his ball up a steep hill and run it across the green for a birdie that would force a playoff after a succession of devastating , unpredictable defeats dating to 1999 , was n't mickelson due for something wholly unforeseen that left him smiling instead of stunned \? mickelson s chip shot at the 18th roared toward the hole as every person in the grandstand stood mickelson ran after the shot , chugging up the hill to watch the ball track across the green but the line was imperfect the ball missed by a few feet there would be no miracle shot to save the birthday boy from a record sixth secondplace finish fifteen minutes later , a composed but disenchanted mickelson spoke frankly and expressively , hiding none of his discontent when he was asked if he did not find a measure of accomplishment in playing well enough to have contended to the last moments of six united states opens , he shook his head sorrowfully if i have a win to match that , then yes , he said but not now and if i never get a victory here , then every time i think of the us open i will think of heartbreak and mickelson conceded that this defeat might be the hardest one to take of his six near misses at 43 , this one is probably the toughest , he said this very well could have been my best chance while it was easy to focus on the theater and drama of mickelson s lastchance birdie attempt at the 18th hole , he squandered his entirely legitimate opportunity to win hours earlier the hard facts are that he began the day with a onestroke lead and responded with a fouroverpar 74 in a final round that had far too many needless mistakes it was a typically quirky last day at the open for mickelson a birdie , an eagle , three bogeys and two double bogeys worse , he had 36 putts , a number that would trouble even a 15handicapper mickelson s round began with uneventful pars but turned dramatically with a double bogey on the par3 third hole he followed that with a second double bogey just two holes later , butchering no 5 with a threeputt those were two shots i should never have let go , said mickelson , well aware that simple bogeys on both holes were likely to have produced a monday 18hole playoff but mickelson s mistakes blended with the tenor of the day , which was full of blunders luke donald , who started just off the lead , conked a volunteer with a drive steve stricker hit one of the worst shots of the championship , a dead right shank that scooted across ardmore avenue until it was sitting beneath someone s car jason dufner was having a spectacular round until he launched a drive into one of the yards across from the 15th hole frustration burst out everywhere rory mcilroy leaned hard on his wedge after a poor approach shot , pressing down on it until it bent but after an unsightly 39 on the front nine , mickelson suddenly appeared blessed after driving into the heavy rough on the par4 10th hole , he lofted a shot onto the green that rolled unswervingly into the hole his eyes wide , mickelson jumped in place and raised both arms the same goofy maneuver he performed when he won his first major , the 2004 masters he was back in the lead but success in these situations is often fleeting for the man they call phil the thrill at the 121yard 13th , the shortest hole at the merion golf club , a straightforward wedge aimed at a ball sitting on a tee produced a ungainly shot that was long and to the right it led to bogey it would not have been so bad if mickelson had not hit another poor wedge to bogey the 15th hole just two bad shots at the wrong time that really cost me , mickelson said as an afternoon sun ducked behind a line of clouds that eventually brought rain , the oncecrowded leader board had been whittled to mickelson , rose and hunter mahan it was two guys eager to win a first major championship and one desperate to win his first open mahan fell out of contention quickly , his last gasp a bogey at 17 mickelson fought back but could only muster pars at the 16th and 17th , his balky putter letting him down with some steely resolve , rose made consecutive pars at the long and treacherous 17th and 18th to post a fourround score of oneoverpar 281 it was left to mickelson to birdie the 18th , a hole that had yielded no birdies all day his drive at the 18th tee was crooked , but it stayed up in the rough he hit a righttoleft approach shot that landed well short of the green , but it did leave one implausible chance the fans rose to greet him at the 18th green they believed what better way for a longrunning runnerup to finally break through \? the ball did not find the hole there was no mickelson magic in the approaching dusk at merion the fans sat down phil mickelson was second at the united states open again
recent debates over who is most qualified to serve as the next chairman of the federal reserve have focused on more than just the candidates theorydriven economic expertise they have touched on matters of personality and character as well this is as it should be given the nature of economies , and our ability to understand them , the task of the fed s next leader will be more a matter of craft and wisdom than of science when we put a satellite in orbit around mars , we have the scientific knowledge that guarantees accuracy and precision in the prediction of its orbit achieving a comparable level of certainty about the outcomes of an economy is far dicier the fact that the discipline of economics hasn t helped us improve our predictive abilities suggests it is still far from being a science , and may never be still , the misperceptions persist a student who graduates with a degree in economics leaves college with a bachelor of science , but possesses nothing so firm as the student of the real world processes of chemistry or even agriculture before the 1970s , the discussion of how to make economics a science was left mostly to economists but like war , which is too important to be left to the generals , economics was too important to be left to the nobelwinning members of the university of chicago faculty over time , the question of why economics has not \( yet \) qualified as a science has become an obsession among theorists , including philosophers of science like us it s easy to understand why economics might be mistaken for science it uses quantitative expression in mathematics and the succinct statement of its theories in axioms and derived theorems , so economics looks a lot like the models of science we are familiar with from physics its approach to economic outcomes determined from the choices of a large number of atomic individuals recalls the way atomic theory explains chemical reactions economics employs partial differential equations like those in a blackscholes account of derivatives markets , equations that look remarkably like ones familiar from physics the trouble with economics is that it lacks the most important of science s characteristics a record of improvement in predictive range and accuracy this is what makes economics a subject of special interest among philosophers of science none of our models of science really fit economics at all the irony is that for a long time economists announced a semiofficial allegiance to karl popper s demand for falsifiability as the litmus test for science , and adopted milton friedman s thesis that the only thing that mattered in science was predictive power mr friedman was reacting to a criticism made by marxist economists and historical economists that mathematical economics was useless because it made so many idealized assumptions about economic processes perfect rationality , infinite divisibility of commodities , constant returns to scale , complete information , no price setting mr friedman argued that false assumptions didn t matter any more in economics than they did in physics like the ideal gas , frictionless plane and center of gravity in physics , idealizations in economics are both harmless and necessary they are indispensable calculating devices and approximations that enable the economist to make predictions about markets , industries and economies the way they enable physicists to predict eclipses and tides , or prevent bridge collapses and power failures but economics has never been able to show the record of improvement in predictive successes that physical science has shown through its use of harmless idealizations in fact , when it comes to economic theory s track record , there isn t much predictive success to speak of at all moreover , many economists don t seem troubled when they make predictions that go wrong readers of paul krugman and other likeminded commentators are familiar with their repeated complaints about the refusal of economists to revise their theories in the face of recalcitrant facts philosophers of science are puzzled by the same question what is economics up to if it isn t interested enough in predictive success to adjust its theories the way a science does when its predictions go wrong \? unlike the physical world , the domain of economics includes a wide range of social constructions institutions like markets and objects like currency and stock shares that even when idealized don t behave uniformly they are made up of unrecognized but artificial conventions that people persistently change and even destroy in ways that no social scientist can really anticipate we can exploit gravity , but we can t change it or destroy it no one can say the same for the socially constructed causes and effects of our choices that economics deals with another factor economics has never been able to tame is science itself these are the drivers of economic growth , the creative destruction of capitalism but no one can predict the direction of scientific discovery and its technological application that was popper s key insight philosophers and historians of science like thomas s kuhn have helped us see why scientific paradigm shifts seem to come almost out of nowhere as the rate of acceleration of innovation increases , the prospects of an economic theory that tames the economy s most powerful forces must diminish and with it , any hope of improvements in prediction declines as well so if predictive power is not in the cards for economics , what is it good for \? social and political philosophers have helped us answer this question , and so understand what economics is really all about since hobbes , philosophers have been concerned about the design and management of institutions that will protect us from the knave within us all , those parts of our selves tempted to opportunism , free riding and generally avoiding the costs of civil life while securing its benefits hobbes and , later , hume along with modern philosophers like john rawls and robert nozick recognized that an economic approach had much to contribute to the design and creative management of such institutions fixing bad economic and political institutions \( concentrations of power , collusions and monopolies \) , improving good ones \( like the fed s openmarket operations \) , designing new ones \( like electromagnetic bandwidth auctions \) , in the private and public sectors , are all attainable tasks of economic theory which brings us back to the fed an effective chair of the central bank will be one who understands that economics is not yet a science and may never be at this point it is a craft , to be executed with wisdom , not algorithms , in the design and management of institutions what made ben s bernanke , the current chairman , successful was his willingness to use methods like quantitative easing , buying bonds to lower longterm interest rates that demanded a feeling for the economy , one that mere rationalexpectations macroeconomics would have denied him for the foreseeable future economic theory should be understood more on the model of music theory than newtonian theory the fed chairman must , like a first violinist tuning the orchestra , have the rare ear to finetune complexity \( probably a keynesian ability to finetune at that \) like musicians , economists expertise is still a matter of craft they must avoid the hubris of thinking their theory is perfectly suited to the task , while employing it wisely enough to produce some harmony amid the cacophony alex rosenberg is the r taylor cole professor of philosophy and chair of the philosophy department at duke university he is the author of economics mathematical politics or science of diminishing returns , most recently , the atheist s guide to reality tyler curtain is a philosopher of science and an associate professor of english and comparative literature the university of north carolina at chapel hill he was recently named the 2013 recipient of the robert frost distinguished chair of literature at the bread loaf school of english , middlebury college , vt
arn tellem , the vice chairman of the wasserman media group and an agent to nba players , is urging them to fire billy hunter , the longtime executive director of the players union sent to wasserman clients on monday night , a copy of which was obtained by the new york times dear name withheld , by now i m sure you have heard that the law firm of paul weiss was hired by the nbpa s executive committee to conduct an independent investigation into the business practices of billy hunter and the union this month the results of that probe were released the audit was quite thorough and the firm s conclusions about mr hunter s financial indiscretions and fiduciary breaches are alarming , if not downright shocking in fact , cbs sports has called the 469page report a magnum opus of malfeasance as your agent and advisor , i feel obligated to give you my take on the situation if i had committed any of mr hunter s transgressions , you would have rightly fired me and hired someone else to protect your interests regardless of how you feel toward mr hunter personally , these findings leave no doubt that he put his personal gain above those of the players sadly , the report concludes that mr hunter s lapses in judgment have clearly caused financial and professional harm to every nba player some lowlights from the report mr hunter abused his position by hiring family members and by conducting business with friends and family that enriched his cronies at the expense of the players in one instance , he tried to invest several million dollars of union funds into a failing new jersey bank with business ties to his son without ever disclosing the family connection to the executive committee or player representatives mr hunter spent more than 300 , 000 in union funds exploring a series of illconsidered investments , including an energy drink company , real estate projects and a mixed martial arts fighting league in japan mr hunter improperly lavished more than 100 , 000 in union funds on gifts for outgoing union presidents and executive committee members mr hunter billed players 13 million for unused vacation time without adequate documentation or oversight in 2010 mr hunter rammed through the nbpa executive committee a fiveyear contract extension for himself reportedly worth as much as 18 million in violation of the union s constitution and bylaws , the extension was never approved by the player reps , a fact that mr hunter was aware of and chose to ignore to suppress challenges to his authority , mr hunter routinely intimidated players and union staff he also stopped players from speaking freely about his conflicts of interest mr hunter told investigators that his son s firm , prim capital , had no written contract with the nbpa yet a potentially fraudulent contract guaranteeing an annual 600 , 000 payment to prim capital turned up last week the hunter record and the nbpa s performance the investigators concluded that mr hunter s ethical improprieties and lack of transparency raised serious questions about whether he should be allowed to stay in office the report went so far as to say that players now have the right to cancel his contract outright without any further obligation in response to this scathing inquiry , mr hunter released a statement saying he was pleased that no evidence of criminal wrongdoing was found , and that he intends to remain head of the union that s how low mr hunter has set the bar for himself moreover , he s not out of the woods yet mr hunter is reportedly the target of a joint criminal investigation by the us attorney s office and the department of labor on top of that , the office of the new york attorney general recently launched a separate probe regarding the administration of the nbpa s charitable foundation and the use of its funds equally reprehensible was the way mr hunter took credit for the financial success of the game and its players the truth is that during his tenure the entertainment that the players create has become increasingly valuable for the nba , its corporate partners and tv networks while the players share of revenue has decreased on his watch from more than 60 to 50 percent of all the major sports , the nba has the smallest rosters and the greatest number of superstars revenue from national , regional and local tv rights soared over the last decade , but players received none of it mr hunter let the owners pocket the additional income and gave back the players hardwon rights the league now has a hard cap and limits on individual salaries contracts are shorter than ever in fact , they are shortest in all of sports and yet , unlike other major pro sports leagues , the costs of player development and scouting are negligible mr hunter has coasted on a wave while exploiting your hardearned successes for the benefit of himself , his relatives and his business associates before the latest round of labor negotiations , i aired my misgivings about the nbpa s negotiating strategy my intent was to prompt a real discussion within the union about its goals and mission instead , i got an indignant phone call from the nbpa s former general counsel , who ignored my points and accused me of seeking mr hunter s job at the time , i chose to continue to support the nbpa and mr hunter , given that we needed a unified front during the lockout but after reading the new report on mr hunter and his reign of error , it would be unthinkable for me to support or back him throughout the last lockout , mr hunter was tactically , strategically and logistically unprepared for the collective bargaining negotiation the nba outmaneuvered mr hunter from the getgo , and the players weren t properly primed for a lockout or the potential for lost games and income mr hunter s entire strategy if it can even be called that was to file an unfair labor practice charge with the national labor relations board , which was costly , illconceived and had absolutely no effect on the eventual outcome during the nfl lockout of 2011 , team owners tried the very same ploy they waited more than six months for a legal judgment from the nlrb that never came the report found that even the union s labor counsel , jeffrey kessler opposed the nlrb claim it s a strategy that mr hunter knew wouldn t work and yet he continued to pay the law firm that employed his daughter to pursue it over the course of the recent nba negotiation , mr hunter acted like the hunted from the opening tipoff , he played defense his chief objective seemed to be minimizing the players inevitable losses and ensuring his own survival he never enunciated his objectives , never enumerated his priorities the players were seldom informed of the state of the talks with management or told what the union was proposing mr hunter was equally tightlipped with player agents after a few meetings with a group of agents that repped nearly half of the players , he severed direct communications with them the real reason mr hunter never seriously considered decertification is that he was more concerned with saving his job and salary than in making the best deal for the players in fact , mr hunter was the only union leader to continue to take his full salary during a recent lockout no other major sport has such limits on the length of contracts or the amount by which contracts can increase annually as nbpa vice president mo evans told a gathering of player agents during last season s lockout david stern has outsmarted us the truth is that mr stern outsmarted mr hunter the union is so out of its league that nbpa associate general counsel ron klempner recently said the collective bargaining process has pretty much run its course and that the players are pretty much better off on their own \( without a union \) player choices , decisions and consequences i recognize that , ultimately , mr hunter s fate is a matter for the players to decide i also recognize my duty to look out for my clients hunter is betting that the players historically passive will let him slide i hope you don t clearly , hunter has violated your trust you need a strong union to represent you , to protect your rights and to prepare for the next round of labor negotiations in five years i urge you to ask your player representatives to instruct mr hunter not to attend the players meeting during the allstar game so that he cannot continue to intimidate and manipulate in fact , no union employee should be allowed to attend the event this would ensure that the independent law firm can present its findings directly to the players and answer their questions players should meet the investigators with no outsiders present otherwise , players could be pressured while discussing and making recommendations about mr hunter s future i implore you to hold mr hunter accountable for his egregious behavior the union belongs to the players mr hunter works for you , though he clearly doesn t realize it if you don t act now , mr hunter s treachery will stand and the players ability to point their union in the right direction will be delayed and compromised to your continued detriment nba players deserve better representation from the union they fund i implore you and your fellow players to take control of your union and your future it s time for mr hunter to go as always , please call , text , or email me or anyone here at wasserman if you have any questions or comments sincerely , arn tellem vice chairman
washington after republicans lost the presidential election and seats in both the house and the senate last year , many in the party offered a stern admonishment if we want to broaden our appeal , steer clear of divisive social and cultural issues yet after the highprofile murder trial of an abortion doctor in philadelphia this spring , many republicans in washington and in state capitals across the country seem eager to reopen the emotional fight over a woman s right to end a pregnancy their efforts will move to the forefront on tuesday when house republicans plan to bring to the floor a measure that would prohibit the procedure after 22 weeks of pregnancy the most restrictive abortion bill to come to a vote in either chamber in a decade the bill stands no chance of becoming law , with democrats in control of the senate and the white house republican leaders acknowledge that its purpose is to satisfy vocal elements of their base who have renewed a push for greater restrictions on reproductive rights , even if those issues harmed the party s reputation with women in 2012 but beyond washington , advocates on both sides of the issue say the chance to limit abortion in the near future is very real republicandominated state legislatures in south carolina and wisconsin are weighing bans similar to the one the house will vote on , which would impose the 22week limit based on the scientifically disputed theory that fetuses at that stage of development can feel pain the measures stand a reasonable chance of passing in both states as well as in texas , where last week gov rick perry to the legislature s agenda conservatives for a vote by next week already this year , and have passed even more restrictive bans in attempts to directly challenge supreme court precedent much of the movement in recent weeks can be linked to the outcry over the case of dr kermit gosnell , the philadelphia physician who was for cutting the spines of babies after botched abortions his case , coming on top of successful efforts to curtail reproductive rights in several states over the last three years , has reinvigorated the antiabortion movement to a degree not seen in years , advocates on both sides of the issue said these laws are flying through , said elizabeth nash , a policy analyst for the , a research group that supports access to abortions the attention has really been at the state level around abortion issues now what you also see at the federal level is very disturbing , and it shows that abortion opponents are very emboldened douglas johnson , legislative director for the , called the house bill the most significant legislation on abortion at the federal level since 2003 , when congress passed a ban on a type of lateterm procedure that opponents call partialbirth abortion on the eve of the house vote , the obama administration released a statement late monday opposing the bill , saying it shows contempt for women s health and rights aware of the risks inherent in abortion politics , republican leaders have moved to insulate themselves from democrats' criticism that they are opening a new front in the war on women representative marsha blackburn , republican of tennessee , will manage the debate on the bill when it reaches the house floor , a role that would customarily go to the sponsor , representative  and in , house leaders slipped in a provision that would allow for a limited exception in cases of rape or incest , but only if the woman had reported the crime still , the reemergence of abortion as a driving issue among the conservative base has left some moderate republicans baffled i think it s a stupid idea to bring this up , said of pennsylvania the economy is on everybody s minds we 're seeing stagnant job numbers confidence in the institution , in government , is eroding and now we 're going to have a debate on rape and abortion mr dent said the party risked opening itself up to another akin eruption , a reference to in a senate race after saying women s bodies could block a pregnancy after a legitimate rape indeed , republicans had an unpleasant reminder last week of how perilous the politics of reproductive rights can be when mr franks defended his bill s lack of an exception for rape by saying this occurred at a meeting of the house judiciary committee , which democrats noted with some satisfaction contained not a single woman on the republican side but most of the republican rank and file and their leaders in congress are solidly behind the bill , arguing that voters back home are clamoring to see something done after the gosnell case we 're hearing from a lot of people who are appalled , ms blackburn said , pointing to of the public opposes legal secondtrimester abortions they feel like this is an appropriate step in this discussion unlike other major policy questions that democrats and republicans are fighting over this year , like samesex marriage and background checks for gun buyers , democrats do not find themselves with either overwhelming public opinion on their side or a favorable shift in sentiment house republicans reject the notion that they are ignoring the lessons of 2012 by not focusing on a message of growth and opportunity , as the party s recommended while we continue to be focused on that , speaker john a boehner said in defense , there are other important issues that we have to deal with and after the kermit gosnell case and the publicity that it received , i think the legislation is appropriate one thing is certain the bill is a violation of supreme court precedent the court has ruled that women have a right to an abortion until the fetus could live outside the womb , generally starting around 24 weeks of pregnancy the bill before the house , called the paincapable unborn child protection act , would ban abortions at 20 weeks after fertilization in the most common way of measuring pregnancies , that is equal to 22 weeks , because pregnancies are typically dated from the first day of a woman s last menstrual period similar laws that banned abortions at or near 22 weeks have been enacted in 11 states since 2010 in georgia , idaho and arizona , which enacted an 18week postfertilization ban , courts have blocked them these measures are very different from previous attempts to limit abortion because they are based on an argument that is rooted in the belief , held by a minority in the medical community , that fetuses begin to feel pain around 20 weeks most scientists , however , believe that the nervous system is not developed enough to register pain until later in pregnancy the first law of this kind passed in nebraska in 2010 and after the republican wave of victories in elections that year , more states began passing them in 2011 , 92 laws limiting the procedure went into effect the previous record had been fewer than 40 last year there were 43 ,  the house has taken up abortion regulations in the last few years , but none have been as expansive or restrictive since congress passed the partial birth abortion ban act in 2003 and there are signs that the antiabortion push will continue last month , the house judiciary committee and the house energy and commerce committee sent separate queries to all 50 states about abortion practices and the enforcement of current laws we look at these projects somewhat longterm , said mr johnson of the national right to life committee
vatican city negotiations over the s adherence to international banking standards were reaching a delicate point during a lunch , a european official later recalled , discussion turned to the need for more openness from an institution steeped in centuries of secrecy a vatican representative at the meal , annoyed by the requests for more information , shouted , how can you ask us such questions \? the clash came amid mounting pressure on the vatican to clean up its bank for decades the subject of dark intrigue and linked to one mysterious death as part of a push by the to apply common rules to all the countries and microstates like vatican city and monaco that use the euro those pressures continued until the very last days of s papacy and remain a critical issue for the cardinals now meeting to elect a new pope as the conclave begins tuesday , the specter of financial scandal presents a special challenge for benedict s successor , who must modernize the roman catholic church s finances or risk the vatican s access to the global banking system , undermining its moral authority and its financial stability ahead of the conclave , the cardinals were briefed on the vatican s finances and have been debating whether a member of the vatican hierarchy or an outsider would be better at imposing order after a papacy bedeviled by crises of governance the battle lines are hazy , but the fight over the vatican s finances pits different factions inside the vatican against one another , some seeking greater transparency and others who want to preserve the institution s tradition of secrecy founded in 1942 and housed in a small round tower at the foot of the apostolic palace , the vatican bank generally does not give loans but manages deposits and patrimony for religious institutions , clerics and diplomats accredited to the vatican , who are among the only depositors allowed to hold accounts there during the cold war , the bank was widely seen as a back channel to transfer money to the eastern bloc to help end communism , and today the vatican uses the bank to help it operate in sensitive areas like cuba and china , vatican experts say but largely because of the vatican s reluctance to reveal its account holders to outside authorities and especially to subject itself to scrutiny of past transactions suspicion has swirled for years about whether some of its accounts had ties to organized crime or italian political slush funds in 2011 , the only time for which figures have been made available , it had 20 , 772 clients , 68 percent of them members of the clergy , and 82 billion in assets under its management the bank has said it has around 33 , 000 accounts in recent years , italian prosecutors have become more aggressive in investigating whether accounts held there by clerics might in fact be fronts for other interests last july , the italian authorities arrested a priest on charges that he allowed a lawyer to use his vatican bank account to commit insurance fraud officials at the european union in brussels and agencies that monitor financial institutions say the vatican has made significant strides in meeting norms against moneylaundering , but that it still has some way to go some in the vatican are eager for change , but you should not underestimate the resistance on issues of transparency from traditionbound forces , the european official said under benedict , the vatican bank pledged to join the socalled white list of countries that meet international banking standards in one of his final acts as pope , benedict , ernst von freyberg , as the bank s new president the appointment loosened the historic grip on vatican finances by a small and tightknit group of italian insiders , some of whom had fiercely resisted efforts to come under outside scrutiny they were protective of the bank as an essentially italian institution , which critics said was perilously close to the country s scandalprone political and financial establishment last may , the vatican bank ousted its president , ettore gotti tedeschi , a wellconnected italian banker , in a rare boardroom coup , accusing him in a public statement of incompetence mr gotti tedeschi had come under intense scrutiny in 2010 , when magistrates in rome from two external accounts used by the vatican bank and placed him and the bank s director general , paolo cipriani , under investigation in a case related to money laundering both denied the allegations the money was later restored to the vatican bank , known as the institute for works of religion , after the vatican created its own financial intelligence authority with a papal edict issued by benedict in december 2010 to meet european antimoneylaundering directives the continuing rome investigation is the first into the bank since the early 1980s , when italy s banco ambrosiano , in which the vatican had investments , collapsed after the disappearance of 13 billion in loans to companies in latin america its chairman was found dead in 1982 , hanging from blackfriars bridge in london the vatican bank denied wrongdoing but paid 250 million to banco ambrosiano s creditors in recent years , the vatican has made progress but continues to lag in meeting international banking standards last july , by moneyval , a monitoring agency under the council of europe , said that in the two years since it was created , the vatican s new financial intelligence authority had flagged only two suspicious transactions last october , the vatican appointed a new head of the authority , ren bruelhart , a 40yearold swiss lawyer who had helped take liechtenstein , famous for its banking secrecy , off the black list of countries that do not comply with banking standards mr bruelhart s appointment , like that of mr von freyberg , raised hopes of those seeking greater transparency and to open up a traditionbound financial apparatus long dominated by italians further outside pressure on the vatican to mend its secretive ways has come from the european commission , the brusselsbased executive arm of the 27nation european union , and from rule changes brought about by the introduction of the euro in 1999 in december 2000 , the vatican signed a monetary agreement in order to use the euro in its tiny territory and to issue coins bearing the marking citt del vaticano as well as commemorative coins , which it sells at considerable markup to tourists and others but the agreement , to the dismay of officials in brussels , included none of the commitments made by most other eurousing countries to combat money laundering the european commission demanded that the accord be revised eventually , the vatican signed a new deal with brussels in december 2009 , which included an unprecedented restriction on the vatican s autonomy a commitment to accept the jurisdiction of the luxembourgbased european union court of justice in settling disputes over the monetary deal with europe this was a big novelty , a historic step , the european official said for the first time in history the vatican recognized a superior authority that is not god last june , mr cipriani , the bank s director general , told reporters on a rare tour of the vatican bank that it had originally signed on to moneylaundering standards monitored by moneyval in order to continue issuing euro coins we could n't print coins with the holy father s image , that s why we 're working on all this , he said , standing beneath a frescoed ceiling depicting mother church and answering questions submitted in advance bank managers in dark suits stood silently on the sidelines the vatican was fully committed to the line of transparency , he said , adding , we need to take away the veil , the shadow that had fallen over the bank but the shadow grew longer on jan 1 , the bank of italy , which has placed the vatican bank under intense scrutiny , blocked deutsche bank italy from operating financial services at the vatican , including the use of credit cards at its museums , after the vatican failed to meet a dec 31 compliance deadline the vatican last month , the vatican announced that it had found a consortium in switzerland , which does not belong to the european union , as a replacement the fact that the vatican chose a swiss firm to manage financial services inside the vatican is n't a good , transparent sign , said carlo marroni , a vatican expert with the italian business daily il sole 24 ore but he said there had been some change in the past they were certainly considered a fiscal paradise , mr marroni said today , they have improved , but are still in a gray zone they did a bit more than the minimum , but it s still insufficient , he said they took only the steps that they could n't not take
i was an ordinary computer programmer i wrote code that ran at the levels between flashy human interfaces and the deep cores of operating systems , like the role of altos in a chorus , who provide the structure without your taking much notice of their melodic lines i made realistic schedules and met my deadlines those were decent accomplishments but none of it qualified me as extraordinary in the great programmer scheme of things what seems to have distinguished me is the fact that i was a woman programmer the questions i am often asked about my career tend to concentrate not on how one learns to code but how a woman does let me separate the two words and begin with what it means to become a programmer the first requirement for programming is a passion for the work , a deep need to probe the mysterious space between human thoughts and what a machine can understand between human desires and how machines might satisfy them the second requirement is a high tolerance for failure programming is the art of algorithm design and the craft of debugging errant code in the words of the great john backus , inventor of the fortran programming language you need the willingness to fail all the time you have to generate many ideas and then you have to work very hard only to discover that they do n't work and you keep doing that over and over until you find one that does work now to the woman question i broke into the ranks of computing in the early 1980s , when women were just starting to poke their shoulder pads through crowds of men there was no legal protection against hostile environments for women i endured a client a sweaty man with pendulous earlobes who stroked my back as i worked to fix his system at any moment i expected him to snap my bra i considered installing a small software bomb but understood , right then , what was more important to me than revenge the desire to create good systems i had a boss who said flatly , i hate to hire all you girls but you 're too damned smart by all he meant three but , at the time , it was rare to find even one woman in a wellplaced technical position at a meeting , he kept interrupting me to say , gee , you sure have pretty hair by then i realized he was teaching me a great deal about computing it would be a complicated professional relationship , in which his occasional need for male dominance would surface so , on that day of my pretty hair , i leaned to one side and said , i'm just going to let that nonsense fly over my shoulder the meeting went on we discussed the principles of relational databases , which later led me to explore deeper reaches of programming , closer to operating systems and networks , where i would find my real passion for the work my leaning to one side , not confronting him , letting him be the flawed man he was , changed the direction of my technical life over the 20 years that followed , i found that being a woman put me at one remove from the general society of programmers i resented that distance , but i liked to think that it was in some way fortunate that my standing back gave me a clearer view of our profession and its effects on society at large according to the , women comprise 294 percent of people working in computer and software , a subcategory of commercial equipment since this broad \( and vague \) designation might include everyone from system designers to office assistants , it tells us nothing about the participation of women at the deeper technical and theoretical levels by deeper i mean computer science , hardware and software engineering , the creation of operating systems and deep algorithms in short , the levels at which the future of technology is being defined i touched those fundamental levels as a software engineer but never plumbed their depths yet i could see that , at the deeper reaches , it was as if some plague had specialized in the killing of females i looked around and wondered , where are all the other women \? we women found ourselves nearly alone , outsiders in a culture that was sometimes boyishly puerile , sometimes rigorously hierarchical , occasionally friendly and welcoming this strange illness meanwhile left the female survivors with an odd glow that made them too visible , scrutinized too closely , held to higher standards it placed upon them the terrible burden of being not only good but the best women today face a new , more virile and virulent sexism the definition of success has somehow become running your own startup and venture capitalists decide who will get funding , who will get a chance for that success venture capitalists are all but explicit in their search they want a couple of guys who can write an app over a weekend if hired by startups , younger women find themselves sorely underrepresented one woman told me that in her growing , 24person company there were four women , which is considered a good ratio and , as always , our ranks thin at the deeper technical levels we get stalled at marketing and customer support , writing scripts for web pages yet coding , looking into the algorithmic depths , getting close to the machine , is the driver of technology and technology , in turn , is driving fundamental changes in personal , social and political life the question is how we react to this great prejudice against women the rule of law and social activism certainly are crucial but no matter how strong the social structure , there is always that cheekslapped moment when you are alone with the antiwoman prejudice the joke , the leer , the disregard , the invisibility , the inescapable fact that the moment you walk through the door you are seen as lesser , no matter what your credentials i have no guidance for women who want to rise through the ranks into technical management i have led a peripatetic life , moving on when a project was done or the next thing intrigued me and i am not advising younger women \( or any woman \) to tough it out you can lash back , which i have done too often and which has rarely served me well you can quit and look for other jobs , which is sometimes a very good idea but the prejudice will follow you what will save you is tacking into the love of the work , into the desire that brought you there in the first place this creates a suspension of time , opens a spacious room of your own in which you can walk around and consider your response staring prejudice in the face imposes a cruel discipline to structure your anger , to achieve a certain dignity , an angry dignity
late in 1862 , readers of the confederacy s most prestigious literary magazine , the southern literary messenger , found a ninepage account of the history of racial strife that had plunged the nation into civil war disunion had been inevitable , according to the author , in a country where a supposedly superior race had joined with one it considered inferior , and with whom coexistence on terms of political equality was impossible never capable , in their best days , of selfgovernment , the writer mused over that allegedly lesser race , it is frightful to think of the doom awaiting them at the end of this war the racial imbalance that had undermined the republic had nothing to do with the institution of slavery , however the anonymous writer for the messenger was not rehearsing common arguments concerning allegedly impermeable biological boundaries separating whites from blacks rather , the racial differences that had driven the war were those distinguishing white inhabitants of the northern and southern united states according to the writer in the messenger , whites of the north were simply not of the same race as whites of the south , and it was this biological difference and all the differences in temperament and capability that came with it that had propelled sectional dissolution since the founding of the nation such arguments alleging a racial distinction between northerners and southerners were voiced in other outlets both before and after the article in the messenger it was one way in which southerners explained secession between june 1860 and august 1863 , a number of prominent southern magazines ran articles by a series of writers similarly describing the political divisions of north and south as the product of a more profound biological antagonism , what one writer , william archer cocke , described as the radical and irreconcilable difference dividing north from south another anonymous writer in the messenger argued , also in 1863 , that the race which colonized the blooming south varied very distinctly from that which fixed its home in the bleak regions destined for yankee expansion indeed , such attempts to root northerners , particularly those from the northeast , and southerners in antagonistic bloodlines went back at least as far as 1837 , when another anonymous writer in the messenger wrote , we , too , of the south , and especially we of virginia , are descendants , for the most part , of the old cavaliers the enemies and persecutors of those old puritans and entertain , perhaps , unwittingly something of an hereditary and historical antipathy against the children , for the fathers sake for most southern proponents , the argument went something like this in 1066 , william the conqueror subdued the saxons a barbarous , uncivilized race not only providing england with cultural refinement but also imposing upon the island a class of gentry who were genetically equipped to rule the enduring features of the subdued saxon race which because of medieval sociopolitical reality did not tend to intermarry with their norman overseers were a resentment of just authority , a tendency toward fanaticism and a reflexive valorization of liberty for its own sake the puritan settlers of massachusetts were the descendants of those vanquished saxons , separatist fanatics who burned witches until deciding to dump tea into boston harbor instead the alabama novelist william falconer , writing in 1860 , characterized new englanders as having been historically unable to govern themselves latterday puritans born of saxon stock , they exhibit those severe traits of fanaticism which had ever marked their history , he wrote , squabbling , fighting , singing psalms , burning witches , and talking about liberty until george iii lost the brightest jewel of his colonial diadem the colonies of the south , on the other hand \( jamestown , but also later colonies in the carolinas \) , were established by members of elizabeth s and james s courts , descendants of the norman conquerors , the ruling class of england though the federal union that followed the revolution sufficed , for a time , to assuage the centuriesold enmity between representatives of these bloodlines , the writer for that 1863 issue of the southern literary messenger insisted that none of the circumstances which blended the interests of both people none of the alliances and intimate associations of society itself have availed to obliterate any of the decided marks of this innate , fixed , enduring difference so in essence , the enduring conflict of the norman and saxon races had been transported across the atlantic , where it would bear the bitter fruit of sectional division hence the author of an 1861 essay in de bow s review entitled the conflict of the northern and southern races cited an original antagonism existing between the north and the south , as a necessary sequence of their radical difference in race , ever active and growing , and which has resulted in the complete disruption of every tie which has bound them together northerners spun their own renditions of the argument yes , in 1066 the norman conquest divided britain racially descendants of saxon serfs and norman conquerors eventually emigrated , respectively , to massachusetts and virginia but northeastern racial theorists argued that the true cause of the sectional conflict southern slavery was itself the outgrowth of that english racial conflict , because the normans had been congenital tyrants that the descendants of an imperious race who had imposed serfdom upon their saxon underlings would push the union toward secession over an insistence upon holding slaves was unsurprising , given what one writer , h d kitchell , had called , in 1850 , the norman pride , his scorn of labor , his high blood , despotic temper , and aristocratic temper much like his southern counterparts , kitchell explained that northerners and southerners were not of the same race this insistence upon a racial incompatibility between northerners and southerners was hardly some obscure line of thinking resonating across mainstream antebellum culture , it provided for many an account of why the union had failed , or would in his 1852 address at the opening of the athenaeum in richmond , va , the rev john robertson spoke of the piratical saxons as mere barbarians whose ignorance had made the norman conquest all but inevitable and ralph waldo emerson , in his 1854 travelogue english traits , described the normans as greedy and ferocious dragoons , sons of greedy and ferocious pirates who took every thing they could carry , who burned , harried , tortured , and killed , until everything english was brought to the verge of ruin for that matter , in 1843 emerson had described a new england race whose anglosaxon bloodline conditioned the more ideal character prevalent in the new england states after 1863 after gettysburg turned the tide of the war , but , more importantly , after lincoln defined the conflict as a contest over human rights such racialist accounts of the civil war more or less dissipated to a vague mythology of southern cavaliers and new england puritans but we might recognize in its essential logic a certain tendency to transform political conflicts into matters of biological hostility it is by such a logic that struggles in places such as iraq or bosnia have sometimes appeared to american onlookers as if rooted in ageold antagonisms , after all by a similar way of thinking , sectional disputes over the fugitive slave law , the kansasnebraska act and the dred scott decision once appeared to many americans as a merely topical pretenses , under the cover of which latterday normans and saxons exercised their congenital antipathies , ancient conflicts carried over the atlantic follow disunion at or join us  sources the philosophy of secession , the southern literary messenger ,

new orleans there is a man living here named michael he is in his 30s , went to high school in the uptown area and enjoys watching his two children run around and play he is , in his own words , a regular , boring family guy he has also had a bookmaker since he was 14 michael is not alone while new orleans is known to many for its food or its booze or its jazz or its mood , there is a deep history of underground bookies and bettors in this city s underbelly , and the business of betting continues to thrive after all , this is a city that lived through an era when everyone including , allegedly , lee harvey oswald s family in the 1940s seemed to either make bets or take bets , or was related to someone who did one or the other even now , michael said , finding a bookie in town to place a bet on sunday s might be only as difficult as locating a tavern that has been in business for a few decades just go to a place that has one of those signs that says , established in 1954 , ' or something like that , said michael , who did not give his last name because of the illegal nature of sports betting in louisiana if a bar has been around awhile , it s a lock that the owner either takes bets or can point you to someone who does harry , a local bettor in his 60s , was even more blunt if the government wanted to round them up , they could fill the superdome with bookmakers this weekend , he said given the city s history , the prevalence of bettors and bookies is not surprising frank clancy , the sheriff of jefferson parish from 1928 to 1956 , was known as king clancy , largely because , for a price , he allowed gambling houses to operate with impunity for much of his tenure gambling s been in our bloodstream since they pulled the place out of the mud , really , said lawrence n powell , a local historian and a professor at tulane people have bet on everything here , including elections it s part of the culture michael was introduced to betting on sports the way many here are , through what is known simply as the card every monday during football season , bookies give their customers a card that is white , long and thin the shape of a pamphlet , say , or a flier that might get stuck under your windshield the card is printed on heavy stock paper and has the following weekend s nfl and top college games on it , with point spreads and over under totals running down to the bottom bettors circle the teams or totals they like and then flip the card over and write on the bottom how much they are wagering they also print their initials as identification michael said he first saw one at church , when he was 11 or 12 he was sitting next to his grandfather in one of the pews just before the sermon began , his grandfather pulled him close i know church is going to bore you for the next 45 minutes , his grandfather said as he slipped him a card , so take a look at this , make your three plays , and we 'll talk about it on the way home within a few years , michael and his brother were making bets through their own bookie in recent years , the card has remained a staple mostly for the older generation of bettors those in their 20s , 30s and 40s have instead lived through a boomerang in betting culture , as the rise of internet sites initially decreased traditional bookiebettor wagering before it returned , in a throwback of sorts , after a 2007 police clampdown on the city s dominant online betting site , known as the tiny tuna that crackdown destroyed the web site , which , according to a new orleans timespicayune report , featured a cartoonishly grufflooking yellowfin tuna wearing a newsboy cap and smoking a cigar while holding a football and a sports flag the tiny tuna allowed bettors to set up an account , log in at any time and place their bets without having to make a phone call or drive to a bar \( the exchange of money won or owed was still handled in person \) i had an account with them everyone i know did , michael said it was just too easy not to you could wake up early on a saturday , go make your bets online and be a familyman dad the rest of the day it was simple when the local operators of the site were arrested , however , it rocked the betting community and increased the wariness of both bettors and bookies suddenly , it was not so easy for a bettor to make a large wager without a longstanding relationship with his or her bookie in the aftermath , michael dabbled with using a group he referred to as the downtown network , a highly professional outfit that had none of the charm often associated with the neighborhood bookie each bettor was known by a number , michael said , and phone calls to place bets were done with an efficient code that did not allow for any small talk a typical exchange in which michael wanted to bet 1 , 000 on the jets and 400 on the giants might sound like this this is account 1280 you 've got my balance \? good morning , 1280 your balance is 3 , 000 ok , give me 10 coins on team 23 , 4 coins on team 28 yes sir , 1280 ten coins on team 23 , four coins on team 28 confirmed the intensity of that operation soon led michael back to the more easygoing neighborhood bookie , but betting on credit as most frequent bettors do was not as easy as it had once been michael said any bettor who wanted to wager more than 3 , 000 on the super bowl would have a difficult time finding a bookie to take the bet without a longstanding relationship or the ability to put the money down upfront the industry s long , local history includes ornate but illegal casinos like the beverly in jefferson parish , which opened in the 1940s and welcomed customers wearing coats and ties french quarter operations like the famous keno and sportsbetting parlor at felix s oyster house on iberville street , which was said to be run by sam saia , an associate of the local mafia boss carlos marcello pinball machines , which were used in saloons and helped draw even more gamblinginclined bettors and the explosion of sports betting in the past two decades as technology made keeping up with outoftown games and teams easier there are still a few idiosyncrasies of betting in new orleans those who use the cards must get all of the games they circle correct in order to win and do not get odds nearly as favorable as they would on a standard parlay in las vegas most bookies here charge a slightly higher price to bet the over as opposed to the under point spreads on saints and louisiana state games are also always skewed higher since those teams draw so much support still , most bettors see it as a small price to pay in order to as the betting parlance goes get down on the games they want if you grow up here , by the time you 're 20 , 21 years old , you 're tired of all the things that everyone comes to new orleans to do , michael said you 've been to the quarter 400 times so you want something else and for a lot of people , betting is that something else

mel gibson film , we were soldiers \) the entire division was on high alert , and my unit was patrolling highway 19 westsouthwest of pleiku when the photo was taken , i had not bathed in a couple of weeks , and christmas was just around the corner i returned to the states in august 1966 , finished my enlistment with the 82nd airborne division at ft bragg , nc , in january 1968 , and returned to college at the university of oklahoma that spring submitted by david m behrman , houston zelvin don lowman of all the photos dad sent home from world war ii this is one of our favorites in his

love , zel at the bottom with the middle completely cut out later , dad did not want to talk about the war and was happy to leave it behind and begin life again when it was over we kids grew up

ace with several migs to his credit he later was commandant of the air force academy i have had the honor of strapping him in and working on his bird much time has passed and my pride of service shines on i am in the front row , the third from the right showing off my new stripes submitted by george a spisak , corning , n y jennifer jean harris on this veterans day , i am writing to honor marine capt jennifer jean harris , a helicopter pilot assigned to the renowned purple foxes squadron , based at camp pendleton , calif but before she was a superb aviator , a role model and a leader of her crew as pilotincommand \( pic \) of a ch46 sea knight transport helicopter , jen was a 17yearold plebe at the united states naval academy , starting off her life , and luckily , i became her sponsor being a sponsor at the academy meant that i offered midshipmen a place to rest and relax in jen s case , i became her friend and support we enjoyed a casual yet close relationship that allowed for advice and fun , such as joining my family at various holiday events , shopping for lingerie her way of feeling feminine beneath the dour uniforms and even cooking together jen became part of our lives and our family became part of hers as jen lived just one town away from where my own daughter was born , north of boston , as they were both in the class of 2000 and participated in the same sport dinghy sailing they also became close of all my memories of jen s four years at the academy , one of the most poignant was when she and my daughter went to the ring dance , that special evening late in the school year when second class midshipmen receive their class rings and dip them into the water of the seven seas , becoming first classmen and beginning their journey into active duty and adventure read more her aunt linda and other friends joined me as we rated the dresses , pronouncing hilarious and rather catty critiques of the other young ladies some who looked like miss alabama while others remarking on others who had clearly not looked in the mirror before coming to the ball but our girls looked stunning and for jen , it was particularly memorable because female mids were supposed to change back into their uniforms only wearing their dresses for a short time well jen , with a stellar record , was having none of that and joined a mid revolt , deciding it was worth the demerits to stay in their beautiful gowns in her lovely pale pink dress , with an equally lovely bouquet and a fellow mid as her escort , miss independence led her female classmates as many stayed in their dresses throughout the evening i still don t know if jen even received any demerits i fondly remember that evening , with our girls looking beautiful , even with a bit of rain i remember it as if it was yesterday jennifer went on to graduate a year later , on a brilliant , clear morning and joined the marines , went to flight school , earned her wings of gold and became a marine helicopter pilot excelling in flying as she did in everything jen occasionally dropped by , sent me cards during her training and eventually became pic of a ch46 , flying missions in iraq jen loved being a member of the marine family and loved flying with her comrades , her flight crew when jen was at the end of her third tour , looking at her final mission in iraq before returning home to see her parents and reunite with the marine officer who waited for her in washington , it felt as she would be safe from the harm of war but , like so many stories posted here , there would be no happy ending on 7 february , 2007 , captain harris was set to fly for the last time , commanding a night flight however , jen wanted her final flight to be a casevac \( casualty evacuation \) mission , so she begged to be switched to a daytime flight according to her family , this speaks volumes about her night flying was considered safer as the crews routinely flew supplies , troops and staff casevacs were mostly daytime jen also handpicked her last flight crew they all loved working together she was joined by four other marines and two navy corpsmen , all of whom delighted in flying with her the consummate professional with a heart of gold several aircraft had been shot down in the weeks before that flight and unfortunately , jen s aircraft would join those statistics oddly , i had a feeling of dread as soon as i heard what type of aircraft had been in the wellpublicized incident and two days later , when my phone rang midday , showing a florida number that belonged to one of jen s classmates , i just knew like all funerals , capt harris s was brutally sad but in this case , it was a tragedy of immense proportions , as are all that honor those who give their lives for their country now , our hearts were broken the incident and the service became a national news story an aircraft flyby on the coldest new england winter day ever , the governor arriving with modesty and a lack of pomp , the cardinal of boston at the wake and marines , of all ages , and classmates from all over the world joining jen s family and friends to say goodbye many walking from the church to the cemetery as the icy wind whipped off the ocean but for now , i try to remember that lovely late may afternoon in 1999 , when all things were possible for these bright , smiling young people who had yet to experience 9 11 , the war on terror and the new normal i remember captain harris insisting that she would stay in her gown , breaking the rules but , like everything that jen did , doing it with class , skill , style and with a very big heart as a purple fox , jen certainly made her fellow squadron members , and those who came before her , immensely proud when i was her sponsor , she was a joy to have in our family , if only for a brief time now marine capt jennifer harris , appropriately given the call sign dove , is with the angels , maybe wearing the lovely dress , but certainly , if ordered , changing back into her marine uniform but we all know that in either , she is watching over her fellow members of the military and those who miss her so very much , every day submitted by

of 18 , it was my good fortune to be chosen to attend army flight school this photo was taken on august 13 , 1973 , at ft wolters , tex , after i had just soloed only the birth of my children produced

take a picture of each guy with the pepsi bottle in front of them , send the picture home and say , see mom , i m the only one not drinking i just had a pepsi he was 19 or 20 years old in this picture he was assigned to the uss parks in the pacific he s now 89 years old and lives in chesapeake , va , and has lots of stories ! i don t know the names and stories of the other sailors , but my father probably does submitted by ann marie romanczyk , new york james h pearson my grandfather , james pearson , had been dead nine years when i was born in 1938 i never knew much about him although his presence had always been felt in our home my grandmother , who lived with us in lowell , mass , and who had separated from him years before he died , would sometimes make reference to him , never positively , in hushed tones and comments that were always beyond the understanding of a child after my mother and father passed away , i decided to find out more about james pearson he had served in the spanishamerican war and had been born in lowell , so that is where i began i discovered he had spent most of his life working in lowell s cotton mills , those spiritdraining human entombments that fostered the industrial revolution in 1898 , he joined the military to fight in the spanishamerican war he served in the sixth massachusetts infantry , company g , and was stationed at camp alger in virginia i discovered i could enlist the services of the united states office of veterans affairs to help me locate this information as well as his death certificate , so i did and there it was the last line of the simple 3by5 card from the veteran s home in virginia where he died read cause of deathacute alcoholism it became clear why the women in the family never really spoke of him the 19th and 20th centuries were not opaque times in terms of discussing alcoholics , particularly one s father or husband but it was very clear that after he returned from that war , whether it was his deadening mill work , the war experiences in the philippines , or perhaps a genetic marker , my grandfather became a heavy drinker there are several 20thcentury historians who have written about the spanishamerican war as america s first vietnam america s list of vietnams is long , they continue to grow in number and i often wonder if we shall ever see the end of them service members served and then were forgotten , warehoused in an institution without support or help but there was one person in our family who demonstrated the love and respect for james pearson that , i think , escaped him in his lifetime every memorial day and every veteran s day , my mother would make the trip to her father s grave and bring me with her she would place a handpicked bouquet of flowers on his grave , next to the american flag that veterans groups place there every year we would kneel and say a few prayers every veterans day , i think of my grandfather i never knew and i fervently wish and hope

was our turn to take a ride on the freedom bird , which would deliver us home to our loved ones in the real world we were all young and innocent i was 22 when i landed in country we coped with boredom

best on nov 11 , nine years ago , i was a boot lance corporal on my first deployment i was in the fight of my life as i bounded and fought from house to house , but i was willing to die for those around me to keep them alive thankfully , my number wasn t called , but over the years i d wished it had been now , at 28 years old , forgetting the faces of the fallen is impossible now , at 28 years old , i can still hear the radios chattering as they were killed learning how to cherish the lives my fellow marines lived has been a daily challenge , but it is something i have learned to do with time through therapy , i have learned to appreciate what they taught me about life , brotherhood and myself i have learned to live again after their deaths november for me is a month that forever changed my life it is full of days , hours , minutes and seconds that now , i would never want to change without a doubt , i will cherish those memories no matter how painful until my number is called

with men who wouldn t live to see the end of our deployment from afar , i watched helplessly as my marriage crumbled back home i said goodbye forever to a faith that had sustained me for a lifetime i

tex raymond g spruce my father , raymond g spruce , from milford , me , was graduated from maine maritime academy , class of 1943 , and served on the uss tabitha brown and the uss celeno he continued to serve in the navy reserves for many years as a little girl , i remember how impressed i was when he dressed up in his naval uniform to go to those meetings on the 40th anniversary of iwo jima , my father began to talk about his wartime experience to me that conversation has continued for decades now this poem encapsulates just a few of his stories why daddy never took me to watch fireworks these are things my father learned in the war that the number six train goes to the bronx that there was a girl in a boat on long island sound who brought magazines to sailors her little part for the war that a body turned to jelly by a bomb is held together by its clothes that he hoped to emigrate to new zealand with his bride that a seasoned sailor hit the deck at the sound of gunfire even on new year s eve in casablanca that a naval officer was no match for a town clerk who wouldn t issue a marriage license without a mother s signature and , in a place called anzio , he learned that he would never watch fireworks again one of the most poignant things my father ever said to me was , when i was a little boy , the very old men in the parades were the veterans of the civil war now i m one of those old men i know how numbered my days with my father are , and i am so grateful that i have been able to hear his stories submitted by marcella spruce , portsmouth , nh ralph zabitz my dad , ralph zabitz , was a red , white and blue proud army world war ii veteran growing up he told elaborate stories of his time in north africa , italy and sicily never about the battles or hardships of war but mischievous adventures of the filthy five zabe , drabe , hank , yank and tronck a jew , a pole , a greek , an italian and i don t know what the other was they were thrown together by chance and attached at the hip together they stole a jeep , made fun of but still ate krations , and made a peach pie somewhere in italy these stories entertained and fascinated my sister and me over and over again throughout our childhood i even have a scarf made out of a parachute that supposedly made the landing at normandy , i can t authenticate it , but i d like to believe it s true this was the equivalent of dad s junior year abroad , however , it lasted four years ! i know war is hell , but for ralph it was probably the best time of his life he was very proud to have been part of the greatest generation , as coined by tom brokaw as ralph aged and became more infirm , he never left the house without wearing his ww ii veterans cap he actually had two ! he would always take time to tell a story to anyone who thanked him for his service our trip to dc for his 85th birthday to visit the ww ii war memorial was a gift on many levels ! for us , we honored his service and the man he was for dad , he was the reason the memorial existed he smiled the entire weekend a proud vet , indeed ! when dad passed last april at age 92 , he was buried with military honors and one of his ww ii vet caps the second cap and folded flag have a place of honor in my sister and mom s home i regret that he never got back to italy his service gave him an affinity for all things italian and love for

1966 outside hoi vuc viet nam with delta company first battalion first marines sergeant brown was killed within the first month he joined our platoon like so many replacements , fresh from the states , he didn t have time to hone survival skills his mistake was opening a gate while a group of villagers watched they knew what was coming i heard the muffled explosion , saw his canteen arching 50 feet over my head my squad covered 30 or so villagers who d witnessed the explosion while second and third squads spread out gathering the body parts that would eventually be wept over in the states our weapons were leveled on women , babies on laps , trembling old people and children if an infant had reached for a breast , if someone coughed or moved a sheet of death instantly would have moved over them it was a frozen moment in time , one of impending death no longer americans , no longer marines but young , hard eyed killing machines we wanted revenge , we wanted it now we didn t care who , we didn t care how honor and duty lay on the ground like the parts and pieces of sergeant brown lives hung in balance i don t know how long when words left my mouth that said to stand down i m writing this for veterans day a day quite possibly some in iraq or afghanistan will not see the end of they will be survived by combatants who on veterans days in the future will not be thinking of rows of white stones , concerts , speeches and flags at half mast but of men and women looking for body parts and the terrified eyes of simple people caught in war and the feeling of fingers resting

mileage off of those flowers our godmother hung around his neck cracking wise about him getting lei d right off the plane helped to cut some of the jitteriness that still crept in even though this was his third homecoming in only twice as many years my family knows now to thoroughly enjoy the relief it brings to see with our own eyes that he s home in one piece and that the warm smile , easy humor and ability to make almost anyone feel comfortable around him are still his most distinguishing characteristics it s never been a surprise to us how he s excelled as a leader but we , like him , have also learned to live with the constant of uncertainty in his life , the shifting of locations and circumstances for reasons that are sometimes clearcut but are just as often arbitrary , the knowledge that so much that is precious exists in spheres beyond our control danny s technically the baby of the family , but he s taught us all a lot in the eight years since he enlisted in the army not least is the value of taking in stride some of the best and the worst that life has to offer for his example in this , among so many other things , i m grateful submitted by emily sogn , brooklyn , ny joe ted miller my dad , joe ted miller , was typical of many young gi s in the european theater in the closing months of world war ii he had been trained as a radio operator at camp blanding in florida and camp van dorn in mississippi he landed in marseille , france , early december in 1944 , weeks after his 19th birthday with the 254th battalion of the third infantry division , he participated in the fight for the colmar pocket and was with one of the first units to break through the siegfried line he was a lowpointer at the end of the war and was stationed in paris and versailles for many months before shipping home he was awarded a bronze star , but like most soldiers thought more about his buddies and just getting through it all than about bravery and big ideals dad was not typical of most gi s , though , in one way early on in his time at camp blanding , he wrote to his parents in urbana , ill like you suggested , mom , i ve decided to keep a diary but in a different way i ll write you a letter each night , if possible , and then you can save the letters that is , if you want to do so and over the next 25 months , he kept that promise and 318 letters survive to this day starting with induction at camp sheridan and ending with an excited missive break out the flags and pepsicola , mom your son is coming home the letters are sometimes handwritten , sometimes typed often on letterhead made for him by his printer father and full of mundane details of army life , descriptions of training and troop movement , gripes about and appreciation for officers , occasional homesickness and philosophical musings his first christmas in europe , in the bitter cold of the alsace lorraine region of france , he wrote from camp oberhoffen \( ever hope \) i ve been doing some thinking , and come to the conclusion that i m pretty lucky in some ways there are a lot of men lying in foxholes who would love to be sitting by this little stove as i am doing now , typing by the light of a portable generator i had plenty of food , i have a nice soft straw mattress to retire to , and i am in no immediate danger from here we can hear guns rolling all the time from the front , but none of it reaches us dad died in 2006 , and my sisters and i feel pretty lucky in some ways , too he was never one to talk about his experiences in the war he wanted to put that behind him and move on with his career as a newspaperman but his letters remain to introduce us to that teenager we never knew , to chronicle his experiences , and to show us the ways in which the war shaped the man he became submitted by kathy miller , phoenix matthew swartz this is about seeing my husband , lieutenant matthew swartz , after he returned from his first deployment we are currently stationed at naf atsugi in japan and he is on his second deployment there is nothing quite like seeing someone for the first time after months of being apart i have tried to write what it was like the anticipation , the butterflies , the nerves , the excitement but words don t do it justice if i had to choose one emotion that stuck out from the rest , it would be pride i was so proud of matt seeing him in his uniform coming home from serving our country , proud of myself for making it through this first deployment , proud of all of our family that has served in the military and have been through these homecomings time after time , proud to be standing among the families spouses , children , parents , siblings who have sacrificed time and moments with their loved ones , and i was proud to be an american \( i know , i know cue lee greenwood \) standing there among all of these young men and women that chose a life in the military i hope that i never forget that moment and the sense of pride that came along with it as far as deployment goes , this was the first of many there are plenty of moments that we will not be able to share together , but there are many that we will and that is what we chose to focus on we have become stronger because of this deployment we have a better appreciation for each other and our time together it is funny the things you miss walking our dog together , making dinners , pizza and wine nights , sunday tea this week we will fill our time with these everyday routines these things that we so often take for granted we will be together again ! submitted by

around 400 bc , socrates was brought to trial on charges of corrupting the youth of athens and impiety presumably , however , people believed then as we do now , that socrates real crime was being too clever and , not insignificantly , a royal pain to those in power or , as plato put it , a gadfly just as a gadfly is an insect that could sting a horse and prod it into action , so too could socrates sting the state he challenged the moral values of his contemporaries and refused to go along with unjust demands of tyrants , often obstructing their plans when he could socrates thought his service to athens should have earned him free dinners for life he was given a cup of hemlock instead we have had gadflies among us ever since , but one contemporary breed in particular has come in for a rough time of late the hacktivist while none have yet been forced to drink hemlock , the state has come down on them with remarkable force this is in large measure evidence of how poignant , and troubling , their message has been hacktivists , roughly speaking , are individuals who redeploy and repurpose technology for social causes in this sense they are different from gardenvariety hackers out to enrich only themselves people like steve jobs , steve wozniak and bill gates began their careers as hackers they repurposed technology , but without any particular political agenda in the case of mr jobs and mr wozniak , they built and sold blue boxes , devices that allowed users to defraud the phone company today , of course , these people are establishment heroes , and the contrast between their almost exalted state and the scorn being heaped upon hacktivists is instructive for some reason , it seems that the government considers hackers who are out to line their pockets less of a threat than those who are trying to make a political point consider the case of andrew auernheimer , better known as weev when weev discovered in 2010 that att had left private information about its customers vulnerable on the internet , he and a colleague wrote a script to access it technically , he did not hack anything he merely executed a simple version of what google web crawlers do every second of every day sequentially walk through public urls and extract the content when he got the information \( the email addresses of 114 , 000 ipad users , including mayor michael bloomberg and rahm emanuel , then the white house chief of staff \) , weev did not try to profit from it he notified the blog gawker of the security hole for this service weev might have asked for free dinners for life , but instead he was recently sentenced to 41 months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of more than 73 , 000 in damages to att to cover the cost of notifying its customers of its own security failure when the federal judge susan wigenton sentenced weev on march 18 , she described him with prose that could have been lifted from the prosecutor meletus in plato s apology you consider yourself a hero of sorts , she said , and noted that weev s special skills in computer coding called for a more draconian sentence i was reminded of a line from an essay written in 1986 by a hacker called the mentor my crime is that of outsmarting you , something that you will never forgive me for when offered the chance to speak , weev , like socrates , did not back down i don t come here today to ask for forgiveness i m here to tell this court , if it has any foresight at all , that it should be thinking about what it can do to make amends to me for the harm and the violence that has been inflicted upon my life he then went on to heap scorn upon the law being used to put him away the computer fraud and abuse act , the same law that prosecutors used to go after the 26yearold internet activist aaron swartz , who committed suicide in january the law , as interpreted by the prosecutors , makes it a felony to use a computer system for unintended applications , or even violate a termsofservice agreement that would theoretically make a felon out of anyone who lied about their age or weight on matchcom the case of weev is not an isolated one barrett brown , a journalist who had achieved some level of notoriety as the the former unofficial notspokesman for anonymous , the hacktivist group , now sits in federal custody in texas mr brown came under the scrutiny of the authorities when he began poring over documents that had been released in the hack of two private security companies , hbgary federal and stratfor mr brown did not take part in the hacks , but he did become obsessed with the contents that emerged from them in particular the extracted documents showed that private security contractors were being hired by the united states government to develop strategies for undermining protesters and journalists , including glenn greenwald , a columnist for salon since the cache was enormous , mr brown thought he might crowdsource the effort and copied and pasted the url from an anonymous chat server to a web site called project pm , which was under his control just to be clear , what mr brown did was repost the url from a web site that was publicly available on the internet because stratfor had not encrypted the credit card information of its clients , the information in the cache included credit card numbers and validation numbers mr brown didn t extract the numbers or highlight them he merely offered a link to the database for this he was charged on 12 counts , all of which pertained to credit card fraud the charges against him add up to about 100 years in federal prison it was virtually impossible , mr greenwald , wrote recently in the guardian , his new employer , to conclude that the obscenely excessive prosecution he now faces is unrelated to that journalism and his related activism other hacktivists have felt the force of the united states government in recent months , and all reflect an alarming contrast between the severity of the punishment and the flimsiness of the actual charges the case of aaron swartz has been well documented jeremy hammond , who reportedly played a direct role in the stratfor and hbgary hacks , has been in jail for more than a year awaiting trial mercedes haefer , a journalism student at the university of nevada , las vegas , faces charges for hosting an internet relay chat channel where an anonymous denial of service attack was planned most recently , matthew keys , a 26yearold socialmedia editor at reuters , who allegedly assisted hackers associated with anonymous \( who reportedly then made a prank change to a los angeles times headline \) , was indicted on federal charges that could result in more than 750 , 000 in fines and prison time , inciting a new outcry against the law and its overly harsh enforcement the list goes on in a world in which nearly everyone is technically a felon , we rely on the good judgment of prosecutors to decide who should be targets and how hard the law should come down on them we have thus entered a legal reality not so different from that faced by socrates when the thirty tyrants ruled athens , and it is a dangerous one when everyone is guilty of something , those most harshly prosecuted tend to be the ones that are challenging the established order , poking fun at the authorities , speaking truth to power in other words , the gadflies of our society peter ludlow is professor of philosophy at northwestern university his most recent book is
west , tex five days after an explosion at a fertilizer plant leveled a wide swath of this town , gov rick perry tried to woo illinois business officials by trumpeting his state s low taxes and limited regulations asked about the disaster , mr perry responded that more government intervention and increased spending on safety inspections would not have prevented what has become one of the nation s worst industrial accidents in decades through their elected officials , he said , texans clearly send the message of their comfort with the amount of oversight this antipathy toward regulations is shared by many residents here politicians and economists credit the stance with helping attract jobs and investment to texas , which has one of the fastestgrowing economies in the country , and with winning the state a yearafteryear ranking as the nation s most business friendly even in west , last month s devastating blast did little to shake local skepticism of government

always prided itself on its freemarket posture it is the only state that does not require companies to contribute to workers' compensation coverage it boasts the largest city in the country , houston , with no zoning laws it does not have a state fire code , and it prohibits smaller counties from having such codes some texas counties even cite the lack of local fire codes as a reason for companies to move there but texas has also had the nation s highest number of workplace fatalities more than 400 annually for much of the past decade fires and explosions at texas' more than 1 , 300 chemical and industrial plants have cost as much in property damage as those in all the other states combined for the five years ending in may 2012 compared with illinois , which has the nation s secondlargest number of highrisk sites , more than 950 , but tighter fire and safety rules , texas had more than three times the number of accidents , four times the number of injuries and deaths , and 300 times the property damage costs as federal investigators sift through the rubble at the west fertilizer company plant seeking clues about the april 17 blast that killed at least 14 people and injured roughly 200 others , some here argue that texas' culture itself contributed to the calamity the wild west approach to protecting public health and safety is what you get when you give companies too much economic freedom and not enough responsibility and accountability , said thomas o mcgarity , a professor at the university of texas at austin school of law and an expert on regulation since the accident , some state lawmakers began calling for increased workplace safety inspections to be paid for by businesses fire officials are pressing for stricter zoning rules to keep residences farther away from dangerous industrial sites but those efforts face strong resistance chuck devore , the vice president of policy at the texas public policy foundation , a conservative study group , said that the wrong response to the explosion would be for the state to hire more battalions of government regulators who are deployed into industry and presume to know more about running the factory than the people who own the factory and work there every day this antiregulatory zeal is an outgrowth of a broader texas ideology that government should get out of people s lives , a deeply held belief throughout the state that touches many aspects of life here , including its gun culture , its republicandominated legislature and its cowboy past and present texas is one of only four states with legislatures that meet as infrequently as possible , once every two years , as required by the state s 137yearold constitution from the freewheeling days of independent oilmen known as wildcatters to the 2012 presidential race , in which president obama lost texas by nearly 13 million votes , the state s probusiness , limitedgovernment mantra has been a vital part of its identity that is particularly true in the countryside in rural texas , said stephen t hendrick , the engineer for mclennan county , where the explosion occurred , no one votes for regulations texas is dotted by more than 700 depots like the one near west many store ammonium nitrate , the fertilizer that exploded near west , which is spread on the soil to supply the nitrogen that crops need consisting of white pebbles that resemble coarse table salt , the chemical can explode when heated in the wrong hands , it can be deadly about two tons was used in the bomb that destroyed the federal building in oklahoma city in 1995 fertilizer accidents are rare across the nation texas was , however , the site of the deadliest industrial accident in united states history in april 1947 , when in an explosion on a ship carrying ammonium nitrate it is impossible to know whether tougher regulations would have prevented the disaster near west , especially since investigators remain unsure what sparked the fire that caused the fertilizer to explode mclennan is among the counties without a fire code but federal officials and fire safety experts contend that fire codes and other requirements would probably have made a difference a fire code would have required frequent inspections by fire marshals who might have prohibited the plant s owner from storing the fertilizer just hundreds of feet from a school , a hospital , a railroad and other public buildings , they say a fire code also would probably have mandated sprinklers and forbidden the storage of ammonium nitrate near combustible materials \( investigators say the fertilizer was stored in a largely wooden building near piles of seed , one possible factor in the fire \) it s tough to overstate the importance fire codes would have made , said scott harris , a former emergency management coordinator in texas for the environmental protection agency , who is now with ul workplace health and safety , a safety science company texas just has n't wrapped its brain around this fact yet in chemical fires , firefighters often bear a heavy toll ten of the at least 14 people who died in west were firefighters , and two more were residents helping fight the flames this week , officials from the state firefighters' association said the 50foottall memorial to volunteers killed in the line of duty , on the capitol grounds in austin , had no room left for new names , not even those from west state senator rodney ellis , a houston democrat , said enough was enough we can dance around it all we want to , said mr ellis , who has called for more frequent inspections of plants like the one near west but the laissezfaire attitude about government oversight and government regulation has to have some impact on safety measures the night of the accident , mr muska , 55 , was not just serving as west s mayor he was also among the firefighters on the scene and he became one of his town s victims the home where he lived with his wife and 14yearold daughter was ruined five of his friends , fellow members of the west volunteer fire department , were killed the blast , 20 minutes after a fire broke out at the fertilizer depot , was so powerful that it registered as a 21magnitude earthquake , decimating the 11building , 10acre plant on the edge of town it left a crater 93 feet wide and sent a gray mushroom cloud into the sky that reminded many residents of the images they had seen of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 many families in west population 2 , 800 share the bonds of czech heritage , including mr muska the best western is known as the czech inn regular travelers on the interstate make a habit of stopping in west for gas and a box of kolaches at a bakery , the czech stop like other communities in central texas , west is home to cattle ranchers and farmers , welders and deer hunters its hills and wide open spaces are so green it is easy to forget that other parts of the state remain in a drought , and the roads on the outskirts of town are so tranquil it is hard to remember that dallas is just an hour north the fertilizer warehouse opened in 1962 to supply local corn and cotton farmers , changing ownership and names several times over the decades it was built far from west s downtown , but the town expanded in recent years toward the fertilizer depot before long , a middle school , a nursing home and an apartment complex were just blocks away residents , including mr muska , never viewed the plant as a potential tinderbox capable of obliterating half their town to many , it was a respected employer and , as some local and state leaders put it , a good corporate citizen with fewer than 10 employees , the depot was owned by donald r adair , 83 , a lifelong resident and active member of the west church of christ it was a friendly convenience , said ronnie gerik , a farmer who bought fertilizer , fuel and tools once a week from the depot it meant you did n't have to drive 20 minutes to hillsboro or waco to get what you needed west fertilizer fell under the purview of at least seven state or federal regulatory agencies , each with its own objectives none had primary responsibility for ensuring the safety of the hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate stored there or that of the workers or residents nearby zak covar , the executive director of the state environmental regulatory agency , has said his office is not responsible for tracking ammonium nitrate he pointed to the office of the texas state chemist tim herrman , the state chemist , said his agency monitors whether fertilizers are labeled correctly and not their safety it s fair to say we are not firesafety experts , he said in austin , two hours south of west , a handful of lawmakers say the time may be right to push , incrementally , for change walter t price iv , a republican state representative from amarillo , sponsored a bill to give smaller rural counties the option to impose fire codes though it is a straightforward bill , mr price said , he has already heard complaints from business owners that such requirements could be financially burdensome state senator brian birdwell , a republican whose district includes west , declined to say whether he would back the bill mr perry , who toured the blast site and met with town leaders and emergency responders , is similarly noncommittal asked whether the governor would support mr price s proposal , a spokeswoman , lucy nashed , said that the governor would review any bill that made it to his desk , but that the investigation into the blast was continuing this week , mr perry s press office announced that texas had been ranked for the ninth year in a row as the country s most probusiness state , according to a survey by the magazine chief executive texas accounted for nearly a third of all private sector jobs created over the last decade , according to federal labor data and under mr perry , it has given businesses more tax breaks and incentives than any other state , roughly 19 billion a year keith r phillips , senior economist of the federal reserve bank of dallas , agreed that texas' formula helps generate jobs and draw businesses , though factors like the state s oil economy and its low cost of living play a role , too growth is going to occur where businesses can maximize profits and where workers and retirees want to live , he said paul burka , senior executive editor at texas monthly , said he did not imagine that the west disaster would lead to much in the way of change tragedies rarely do , he said we 're not going to spend our money telling businesses what we should do with their premises , said mr burka , who grew up near texas city , the site of the 1947 explosion indeed , days after the accident near west , state lawmakers killed a proposal to provide 60 million in training and resources for volunteer firefighters and a lobbyist for state firefighters , who backed mr price s effort , said the bill had little chance of passing because of resistance from the real estate industry businesses can come down here and do pretty much what they want to , mr burka said that is the texas way
new orleans neither quarterback in xlvii will win any mr universe competition baltimore s joe flacco boasts the muscle tone of an insurance salesman san francisco s colin kaepernick looks more like a surfer both are tall and gangly and somewhat awkward , built more like cyclists than football players yet these quarterbacks also possess two of the strongest arms in the nfl , two milliondollar limbs that draw hyperbolic comparisons to cannons and shotguns and catapults , basically anything that shoots objects really far or really fast the matchup of two physically unimposing players who are also so physically gifted underscores important matters in regard to throwing mechanics and the term arm strength the latter is something of a misnomer arm strength has little to do with the size of a quarterback s biceps or the actual strength of the arm the former involves the entire body and starts not with the arm but with the feet case in point flacco case in point , part 2 kaepernick look at someone like john elway , like brett favre , said jim miller , a retired quarterback and an analyst for siriusxm nfl radio they could do physically what other players could not do both colin and joe flacco are like that growing up , kaepernick played baseball naturally , he pitched his fastball reached 94 miles per hour , and he threw two nohitters in high school the chicago cubs drafted him despite his greater interest in football , which seemed misguided way back then kaepernick received one offer of an ncaa division i football scholarship , from nevada he blew away the wolf pack coaches in only one regard arm strength that s the one thing that stood out , said chris ault , his college coach he had a gun his passes actually whistled kaepernick s throwing motion , though , left much to be desired he delivered passes sidearm , without an arc early in his career , kaepernick threw often while rolling right , because he could easily launch the ball deep and back across the field one of his darts left an imprint of laces on a receiver another hit a tight end in the face mask from more than 50 yards away the 49ers tell similar stories of an arm they have come to fear in practice and revere in games receiver michael crabtree said players would rotate back in line during passing drills to avoid kaepernick s turn to throw tight end vernon davis described kaepernick as a freak , adding , he 'll take your fingers off if you do n't watch it davis also said that sometimes , he needed to chase kaepernick from the weight room flacco s arm strength is less obvious but no less potent he also played some baseball he once fired a 40yard out route against miami that traveled no more than six feet off the ground , toward a receiver near the sideline , according to gil brandt , a longtime nfl personnel evaluator and a siriusxm analyst flacco s 70yard touchdown pass to receiver jacoby jones this postseason traveled beyond where denver s secondary believed flacco could heave it safety rahim moore fell as the ball sailed over his head despite flacco s and kaepernick s ability to throw far and fast , however , brandt and others argued that arm strength on its own garnered too much attention when brandt worked for the cowboys , they used a radar gun on potential prospects one player , whose name he could not recall , registered throws at 60 mph phil simms clocked in at 49 guess how that turned out brandt was more interested in quarterbacks who threw accurate passes , who had strong work ethics , who did not linger on mistakes he ranked arm strength as the eighth or ninthmost fundamental attribute in a quarterback for every riflearmed elway , there was a joe montana , king of the soft touch brandt said rudy bukich was the hardest thrower he ever saw bukich played 14 seasons in the 1950s and '60s , but he threw more interceptions than touchdowns arm strength is not as important as you 're often led to believe , brandt said it helps , though just ask warren moon he ranked arm strength , after accuracy and the ability to make every throw , third among his most important attributes he could zing passes accurately more than 50 yards this helped carry him into the pro football hall of fame moon knew his arm strength came from his throwing motion , not his figurative guns that is why he read books by nolan ryan and orel hershiser , why he studied roger clemens s training methods the throwing motion , moon said , was like a concert , with so many disparate parts in harmony dr glenn fleisig , the research director at the american sports medicine institute , a biomechanics research laboratory , has studied and analyzed such matters , mostly in regard to pitchers but also for quarterbacks in one study , fleisig s team looked at both throwing motions to determine whether it was helpful for high school and college athletes to pitch and play quarterback at the same time they also studied texas rangers pitchers , who threw footballs to warm up the researchers found the throwing motions largely similar quarterbacks held the ball closer to their heads , stood more upright , took shorter strides the researchers studied what they called optimal football mechanics , throws made during dropbacks , not off balance or on the run they found that both pitchers and quarterbacks planted their feet , rotated their hips and upper trunks , and flipped their shoulders forward , creating a whiplike motion it s the full body , not just the arm , fleisig said it s a kinetic chain , a series of coordinated events the arm is actually the last part of that chain fleisig s team found that throwing a football was less stressful than throwing a baseball , that it was less harmful to the arm still , the research did not support the idea that athletes would benefit from throwing baseballs and footballs during the same season it did , however , reinforce the notion that a quarterback s ability to throw far or fast should be defined as arm power , not arm strength strength refers more to force power is force multiplied by velocity this is high school physics , translated into the nfl quarterbacks need power , which is different than strength , fleisig said in my business , we see thousands of throwing athletes without their shirts on they do n't look like muscleheads they do n't have strength , necessarily but they have power if arm power is not the most important trait in a quarterback , it still factors greatly into how teams design their offenses a strongerarmed passer allows coordinators more options they can use more of the field the passer s throws are faster but flatter , and they are often harder to haul in this is evident in the modern nfl , which features more downfield passing than when the short passes of the west coast offense , all that precision and timing , ruled last season , three quarterbacks threw for more than 5 , 000 yards none did so in 1990 or in 2000 five quarterbacks tossed more than 30 touchdown passes last season in 1990 , that number was two in 2000 , three baltimore in particular is indicative of this trend the like to run and run and run and then let flacco strike deep he might attempt this six times a game , or eight , or four but because of the potential for a passinterference call , which moon noted was far higher than in his day , and because of the payoff from a long complete pass , such attempts carry a great reward a weakerarmed quarterback is more limited so is that quarterback s offense as receivers become taller , stronger and faster , as more athletes play quarterback , as fewer teams run the ball as often , as the rules change to favor the offense , the ability to throw deep , moon said , becomes even more important perhaps the country will see that in the super bowl , when flacco and kaepernick , two skinny , unimposing men , launch passes in high arcs , or whiz bullets between defenders strong arms , those two not arm strength
kapalua , hawaii scanning the sumptuous breakfast buffet , the golfer charlie beljan looked like any other hotel guest in his shorts , flipflops and tshirt with a hang loose decal the hand with the pinkie and thumb raised , and the three middle fingers curled in a signal that everything is all right belied beljan s lowgrade unease he held his breath as he passed the table with the plates of deli meats and smoked salmon , and ignored the tray of fluffy scrambled eggs he paused at the omelet bar only long enough to spoon grated cheese and diced red peppers over his mound of hash browns , which he had carefully arranged on his plate so they did not touch the fresh pineapple chunks that he would sprinkle pepper on before eating as beljan tucked into his meal at a table with an unobstructed view of swaying palms and the shimmering pacific ocean , he recalled when he first realized he was considered quirky a seventhgrade classmate described him to a girl as the infamous charlie beljan so this goes back a long time ago , said beljan , who is 28 starting the pga tour season surrounded by surf , sand and some of the game s brightest stars in the tournament of champions this weekend is a dream come true for beljan , one of nine firsttime winners on the tour last year three other tour rookies won in 2012 , but none in more memorable fashion than beljan beljan s secondround 64 in the seasonending tournament at walt disney world in november was riveting , an unscripted medical drama that played out on camera with paramedics shadowing him in a cart , beljan staggered between shots and sometimes had to sit down on the fairways because of symptoms he associated with a heart attack after signing for one of his lowest scores of the year , beljan left the course in an ambulance , suffering from what turned out to be a panic attack by hanging on to win the tournament , beljan to the perpetually anxious , someone who shed light on a disorder that feeds off darkness in the two months since , beljan has taken a lunch in hollywood to discuss a possible film based on his life and started on a low daily dosage of the antidepressant during breakfast , he whipped out his smartphone and called up a photograph of a 45foot motor home he recently bought for tournament travel he cannot wait to take his home on the road , creating a nest that insulates him from the maze of scans and restaurant meals while making it easier to entertain his friends , many of whom are flummoxed by the turn beljan s life has taken they wonder , how in the world did beljan , whose carefree spirit makes him a people magnet , become the public face of anxiety \? i think that moving forward the issue of anxiety will fade out and people will start to get back to associating me with a funliving , freespirited guy , beljan said he added but , hey , if they want to associate me with the anxiety , i'm ok with that there could be worse things that people could associate me with and i still think it s pretty neat that i brought the issue that affects millions daily to the public eye he also hopes to be associated with winning golf tournaments before gaining his 2012 pga tour privileges at qualifying school , beljan won the 2002 united states junior amateur , was a secondteam allamerica at new mexico and won eight times on the gateway tour , a developmental pro circuit he finished last season in driving distance behind bubba watson with a 3116yard average he and aspires to win an event before april so he can compete in the masters glen millican , who coached beljan at new mexico , said the first time he saw beljan swing a club at a junior tournament , his contact was so pure that millican remarked to an assistant , that guy s ball makes a different sound than most professionals' balls do he also recalled beljan s burning desire to succeed , which drove him to work hard in the classroom and on the golf course , motivated him to put in extra hours in the gym and once prompted him to lead his teammates in a long run as penance for a poor tournament effort that the other golfers were willing to follow him the extra mile is a testament to the power of beljan s personality his ability to connect with people is what millican remembers above all else at a team gathering at millican s home in the fall of 2006 , beljan , then a senior , asked millican s 5yearold daughter , ryley , about halloween , and they talked about going trickortreating together the conversation was not forgotten on halloween he showed up to accompany ryley on her candycollecting spree to me , that s what charlie s about , millican said in a telephone interview he s just a genuine , caring , sociable person the disconnect between beljan s sunny exterior and stormy interior does not surprise the author daniel smith , who wrote a memoir , detailing his anxiety disorder in a telephone interview , smith described himself as similarly goofy and gregarious and said , you can come across as very selfassured , very confident , very strong and be riddled with anxiety beljan s quirky diet also makes sense to smith , his food choices a neurotic stew aimed at maintaining order in his world beljan will eat pasta as long as it does not have tomato sauce and pizza even though it does he cannot touch cooked turkey , cannot stand the smell of canned tuna and will not eat a hamburger but will eat a steak as long as it is a filet he loves cheesecake but will not look at eggs on wednesday he went to a fivecourse luau and ate nothing his favorite meal , which he indulges in four or five times a week , is a footlong spicy italian sandwich from subway on honeyoat bread , modified for his tastes \( pepperoni but no salami , and no mayonnaise \) in one of his first meals with his future inlaws , they insisted that he taste the tortilla soup beljan generally steers clear of any kind of soup , but he wanted to make a good impression , so he tried to try it my hand was shaking so much that by the time the spoon got to my mouth there was no soup left on it , he said because foraging for food can be exhausting when one s tastes are so narrow , beljan sometimes would not bother eating he skipped meals and never packed food in his bag during rounds the day of his panic attack on the golf course , he had not had a meal in nearly 20 hours he has vowed to rectify this behavior by carrying bananas and peanut butter sandwiches this season in september beljan s wife , merisa , gave birth to their son , graham the stress of caring for an infant , and the jolt it sent through beljan s ordered universe , sent his anxiety into overdrive i was handed this baby and it was like , now what do i do \? beljan said , adding , there s no more downtime to relax beljan used to unwind by riding motorcycles a sign hangs in his garage that reads , you never see a motorcycle outside a therapist s office since the baby s arrival , beljan has not had the time or , frankly , the nerve now that he is a parent , he is mindful that he needs to be more responsible merisa beljan , who has worked as an emergency medical technician , said her husband s public panic attack did not concern her as much as his honesty in discussing it she did not understand why he volunteered that he had experienced another panic attack on an airplane in august my first reaction was , why are you talking about this \? she said , adding , you just never know what people s response is going to be are they going to think you 're crazy \? beljan does not care what anybody thinks besides , he quickly discovered he was not alone according to the anxiety and depression association of america , anxiety disorders affect 40 million adults age 18 and older in the united states on wednesday , watson , the reigning masters champion who is also in this week s 30man field , said he had gone to the hospital three times with panic attacks , mostly recently two years ago during a practice round tuesday , beljan s drive at no 14 on the plantation course got caught in the tradewinds and caromed off a house that was way right of the fairway beljan thought his ball might have broken a window , and his stress level rose when the owner appeared at the back of the green with his hands on his hips beljan began thinking of an apology in his head , but when he approached the homeowner , they ended up exchanging pleasantries by the time beljan made his way to the 15th tee , his anxiety had lifted , and he had made a new friend
in the year since an upandcoming youngster crushed her chance to win her favorite grand slam event , li na has accomplished something remarkable she seems to have gotten younger li could not do anything about her age after feeling it acutely when the british teenager laura robson ran her off the court at the united states open last year but at 31 , she could do something about her game so she and her new coach , carlos rodriguez , embarked on an , and added some new twists to her old style this year s open granted li the perfect opportunity to test her progress , especially on friday , in another thirdround match against robson , 19 , who is playing with the same aggressive , goforbroke attitude that spelled so much trouble for li last year li , seeded fifth and looking more confident with every match , was primed for the challenge she broke robson s serve in the first game , showed off her own improved serve and displayed a willingness to rush the net and put as much pressure on her opponent as possible the result was a 62 , 75 victory , pushing li through to the fourth round and demonstrating how far she has come in a year s time when asked why she put herself through such a big change when her ranking was still high , li said that reaching the top level was worth the risk after you change , maybe you lose everything you have before , but on the other hand , maybe you can be better , she said because i know if i did n't change , maybe i can stay like top 20 , but i really want to push to another high level on friday , li shared the women s stage with sloane stephens , another player trying to push to a new level but stephens s open matches come with an added complication she is known as the next american it girl , a 20yearold with the talent and game many believe will have her winning championships soon none of that seemed to bother her friday as she powered past another young american player , jamie hampton , in their thirdround match on arthur ashe stadium for stephens , who made her first waves this year after beating serena williams in the australian open quarterfinals , hampton was little more than a speed bump in a 61 , 63 victory stephens , who also defeated hampton in the first round at wimbledon , seemed unfazed by the big crowd and the big stage it was a departure from her firstround match , when she dropped a set after a brief fit of nerves this year has been a learning process for me , she said i 've gone through so much and learned so much and improved so much i 've just been working so hard , and it s paying off if the match seemed like an american event stephens is the secondhighestranked american woman at no 15 , and hampton , at no 23 , is third it paled in comparison to what loomed in the next round a match against williams on sunday stephens said of the possibility of playing williams as i always say , i think it will be epic i'm really looking forward to it williams later made the matchup a reality starting just before midnight , williams met yaroslava shvedova , who gave her some trouble at wimbledon earlier this summer but williams had no problem on the hardcourt at ashe stadium , showing off her arsenal of shots including some nifty volley work at the net to win , 63 , 61 li s success has already made her a sporting pioneer in china her 2011 french open title was not only the first grand slam singles victory by a chinese woman but also the first by any player from asia but she has always wanted to do better here , in a city where so many chinese fans want to see her break down barriers li seems to have honed a game that can now match up against those of the best hardcourt players next is a matchup with no 9 jelena jankovic of serbia , who beat the qualifier kurumi nara of japan , 64 , 76 \( 5 \) , on friday afternoon li said she was not evaluating her chances to win yet it is still far away to win the tournament , she said now is just beginning the second week , so still a lot of matches i have to improve myself among the other contenders , thirdseeded agnieszka radwanska of poland advanced friday with a 64 , 76 \( 1 \) victory over no 32 anastasia pavlyuchenkova of russia the twist that li brings to the competition is her rejuvenated game she was frustrated with her results last year and decided to sideline her coach and husband , jiang shan , in favor of rodriguez , who used to coach the former no 1 player justine henin the similarities between li and henin are many , starting with their reliance on speed and footwork rodriguez has worked with li on her speed to get her to the net and dictate points from there against robson , li went to the net nine times and won all nine points i think he would say , yes , that is good , but i think he would say i can come even more into the net , li said her newandimproved serve produced 11 aces , including one on match point on a second serve she was serving really well , and i thought she was returning really deep , robson said you know , there was n't a lot i could do in some points a year ago it was li who left the court with that feeling now , she is the one feeling young and fit i am still young , she said i can do even more hard work
mother s day has almost arrived , and as i struggle to come up with gift ideas , my thoughts turn toward the many holidays and family events i missed due to training , field operations and deployments my four years in the marines corps included two combat tours in afghanistan that included trials and tribulations that i will remember for the rest of my days but i have come to realize that , compared to my wife , i had the easier job i spent my entire enlistment training daily in the hopes that i would go to combat and be able to contribute in the war but even with the countless days in the field , on the range and in war itself , i believe none of it was as hard as what my wife went through giving birth to our first child just two days before i deployed in 2008 or being eight months pregnant with our second child while i was leaving for my second deployment to afghanistan in 2009 , when all we could hope for was that we would see each other again twice i walked away from my family believing the weight of the world was on my shoulders , but the reality was that my wife , christy , was the one who had to keep things from falling apart i remember coming home after my first deployment in october 2008 i was ready to start being a dad , but i had no idea of where to start and it showed consistently during my time at war , i had matured , but so had my wife only more so she was so far beyond the meager parenting skills i had acquired from multiple books during my sevenmonth deployment , she had dealt with colic for two weeks , waiting three months for my first phone call , moving from tennessee to north carolina , and unpacking a storage unit and building a new home for our family in between she was writing letters , taking pictures , and making and sending packages to me through it all , the consistent gaps in communication and the constant fear for my safety brought her many sleeplessness nights the first time i spent alone with my daughter was eight months after she was born , and i remember how unprepared i felt and how worried christy was i finally persuaded her to leave the house for just an hour or two and take a break it seems strange that i would even need to convince my wife that i was capable of babysitting our child but that was the reality of our lives she briefed me on everything from how to use baby wipes to what rice cereal to feed our daughter we thought none of this would even be necessary since christy was leaving during afternoon nap time it should have been smooth sailing but about 30 minutes into my twohour first adventure in babysitting , our daughter , alyssa , woke up i was panicked and tried everything from bottles to new diapers , but nothing seemed to work i debated whether to call christy i soon realized that my daughter just wanted to be held while i was standing soon she fell back to sleep , just before mommy came home as i recounted my victory to christy , it dawned on me that this had been her life every day for the past seven months , and that she had had no training , nothing close to what i had endured to prepare me for my mission i gained a new respect for her and all the other spouses , mothers , brothers , sisters and caregivers that are anchors to the world back home this situation would play out again when i returned from marja , afghanistan , in july 2010 though i had missed the birth of our second daughter , i was better prepared for what a 7monthold is capable of our most trying time was to come in the days ahead , after we moved back to tennessee in december 2010 the next year , while we were living with my motherinlaw , i began college and made the dean s list my first semester but i was still dealing with the harsh realities of life after the marines corps the corps had given me countless opportunities and a strong sense of pride , helping me become a man but as i interviewed for jobs in tennessee , it seemed to me that some potential employers did not know what to think about my military experience my applications were rejected , one after another i was demoralized christy could see the turmoil inside me as i retracted from people , bitter and resentful throughout my enlistment , she had not only maintained the family but had also been an anchor for me , consistently putting her needs after ours and now she did it again the last interview i had was for a position at a local children s hospital and i was unsure of what i would do if it , too , fell through as i came into the house , prepared to tell christy that it felt like another lost opportunity , she embraced me and said something i have never forgotten we have been through much worse then this , she told me i know you can do it i got the job three weeks later but to this day , i am still trying to impress my wife zachary edward bell served with the first battalion , sixth marines , from 2007 to 2011 as a rifleman , deploying twice to helmand province , afghanistan he lives in

they were about to view today , the piece is widely considered one of the french artist s masterpieces the parisian production was actually the second for coucou bazar , which had its premiere at the solomon r guggenheim museum in new york a few months earlier dubuffet had been relatively forgiving toward the new york dancers , choreographer and director with whom he had entrusted his animated painting , a vision of how 20 clunky , puzzlelike characters would move hypnotically to a cacophony of electronic sounds they shifted so slowly through the mobile landscape of red , white and blue stage panels that it was often impossible to tell the costumed actors from the set in paris , however , dubuffet felt that the show had not advanced enough and that the director was taking too many liberties dubuffet was an artist who liked to control many things , even if he did n't feel up to the task of being both director , choreographer and composer , said sophie duplaix , head curator of contemporary art at the center georges pompidou here she added he had different expectations and blamed the director but he did n't stop the show from going on , every day for a whole month forty years after those first shows , coucou bazar is being revived at the mus e des arts d coratifs in paris on thursday , and will be shown until dec 1 , albeit in a pareddown format curated by ms duplaix dubuffet s sculpture welcome parade will also be exhibited opposite the grand palais to mark the beginning of the fiac art fair nineteen of the 20 original coucou bazar costumes have been painstakingly restored at the dubuffet foundation for the occasion , though only two will be worn by dancers those two characters , named neanter and le patibulaire , will move through the exhibition that retraces the story of coucou bazar and dubuffet s iconic hourloupe cycle , mingling with the other costumes \( worn by mannequins \) on the restored stage scenery called practicables thanks to detailed production notes that the artist left behind a film of the third coucou bazar performance , which finally satisfied dubuffet when it was staged in turin in 1978 , will be shown in a room dedicated to that staging the director must contend with being at the mercy of a story that is beyond him , said sophie webel , head of the dubuffet foundation in p rignysuryerres , france , which was established by the artist in 1973 and today guards some 1 , 500 of his works , including the elements of coucou bazar we 're lucky to have the footage of the turin staging , which had dubuffet s full support , she added so we could either recreate turin or reimagine something close to that we try to respect the spirit of the artist s work but we will never know if we are exact there were early thoughts of restaging coucou bazar in full , but there were too many obstacles , ms webel said the props are fragile and considered works of art , valued and insured for considerable amounts after almost 40 years , the costumes had aged and become worn down and unstable the materials , mainly epoxy resin , latex , varnish and wood , would most likely not be considered safe for a contemporary theater stage we would have had to produce doubles of all the practicables' and the costumes , an entire second set , ms webel said in the end , one costume was deemed too frail for the new exhibition over nearly three months last summer , those working on costume restoration took apart some of the copies of eight of the costumes that dubuffet had created , using some parts to fix the originals at the arts d coratifs , one room will recreate the staging area dubuffet organized in his vast workspace in a former munitions factory in vincennes , a suburb of paris it gives a view of how each costume was built piecemeal onto the dancer , a bit like cartoonish body armor the costumes are cumbersome , weighing up to about 10 kilograms each , or 22 pounds , with the one for the character le patibulaire among the heaviest as the weight can make the dancers tilt and jerk , risking injury , the restorers paid particular attention to the insides of several costumes the costumes are deliberately constricting , they impede the movements so as to effectively frame them , ms duplaix said you ca n't help thinking about the first steps on the moon , which at the time was still quite fresh in people s minds dubuffet s numerous scribbled instructions provide insight into his idea of creating a continuum of the world , bridging the gap between things seen and ignored he questioned how people separate objects from their background , and suggested that they had lost the habit of noticing the space in between with coucou , he aimed to bridge painting , sculpture and theater , adopting some of the playwright and director antonin artaud s ideas while producing something entirely different from artaud s plays the penchant for careful precision movement , and perhaps the masks of balinese theater , found an echo in dubuffet s esthetic , but coucou bazar was infinitely more measured and goodnatured than the disturbing bodily psychosis executed in artaud s theater of cruelty still , dubuffet would not feel a stranger to artaud s famous line that where others present their works , i claim to do no more than show my mind his notes are like little manifestos , ms duplaix said a swarming musical tapestry of crackling and quirky chirps adds to the disorientating effect of coucou bazar the new york and paris performances of 1973 were scored by ilhan mimaroglu , a turkishborn composer who had also produced records for the jazz legend charles mingus in the early 1970s having been inspired to return to music himself , dubuffet used his own recordings in turin those experiments , with improvised or modified instruments and tape recorders , will be heard at the arts d coratifs dubuffet s idea was that you should lose your bearings and find yourself before this nascent world of the animated painting , ms duplaix said i 've heard that the original performances required some audience stamina , ms webel said they were 50 to 55 minutes long , and somewhat deranging you were looking at a stage where things happened or did n't happen , and always slowly you expected a narrative , and there was none but it was all intended that way coucou bazar was unique in its day , but performance art has since gained wide acceptance he was ahead of his time , in terms of his scenography , ms webel said thirty years ago , it might have shocked some people today , spectators are more used to seeing such things my show will no doubt be blamed for being out of category , dubuffet said in 1973 , while preparing coucou bazar for the grand palais its status is evidently ambiguous , he continued , painting is its only source it is like a painting that would cease to be merely a picture to look at , but would gain a real existence and welcome you within itself
washington the s last thursday , barring patents on human genes , was a wise and balanced decision that clears away a major barrier to innovation in the areas of biotechnology , drug development and medical diagnostics but the decision is just a first step toward finding the right balance between protecting legitimate intellectual property and securing an open future for personalized medicine in association for molecular pathology v myriad genetics , the court ruled that a naturally occurring segment of dna genetic material that has been isolated from human chromosomes cannot be patented because it is simply a product of nature for policy wonks , the case was a davidandgoliath fight , one of the most important patent cases in a decade , with an outcome sure to affect the , no matter how it was decided but while the supreme court s ruling has been welcomed enthusiastically by many , the myriad case has been only a modest victory for the advocates of geneticdata sharing indeed , none of the underlying tensions have truly been resolved we still need to find a way for the biotech industry to keep a competitive advantage without endangering the welfare of patients and slowing medication innovation in reality , gene patents were only one part of the problem a more vexing , and still pressing , issue is how companies withhold genetic data as a trade secret the company at the heart of the case , myriad genetics , was awarded two patents in the late 1990s for the human genes brca1 and brca2 and offered an exclusive test to detect inherited mutations in them certain variations in a copy of either one can markedly increase a person s risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers since then , nearly one million patients have taken the myriad test and have had their genetic data compiled in the company s that , in turn , has helped provide the company with an when it comes to interpreting patients' test results while myriad has published some research based on its findings and says it plans to progressively release more , for the most part it has designated its trove of patient data as confidential business information a  myriad was able to isolate the brca genes in the first place largely because it had access to governmentfinanced public databases but fairness aside , there are significant public health consequences when any one company gets to wall off such important human biological data from its competitors and , ultimately , from the public that information , stripped of any patientidentifying data , could be a boon to researchers as they try to design optimal treatments for breast and patients , based on the individual genetic signatures of their tumors such a trove could help scientists better understand the cancer process itself it seems crazy to keep that potentially lifesaving knowledge away from the broad cancer research community even before last week s supreme court decision , the importance of generelated trade secrets , compared with that of outright patents , was clear myriad had already announced that it would begin , this fall , to replace its brca test with one that examines multiple genes implicated in hereditary cancers most of which were outside the scope of its gene patents before thursday s ruling the new test , likewise , is expected to use complex proprietary algorithms , developed from its prodigious patient data , and therefore be largely protected from competition if anything , the court s decision may prompt biotech companies to rely even more heavily on that strategy than they do now an unintended consequence that could stall research in many critical areas those with established beachheads on a generelated disease or condition will be able to deter competition , much as they did before last thursday s genepatent ruling in the end , it will be patients and the public who pay we should n't wait as long to fix this problem as the supreme court waited to remedy its that enabled the patenting of human genes until now as a first step , the united states food and drug administration should immediately investigate the impact of tradesecret protection on innovation in personalized medical treatments the fda could also mandate public disclosure as a condition of market approval for genetic testing insurers too have some leverage they could refuse reimbursements unless clinical data is shared for interpretation but perhaps an even more effective remedy would be for scientific researchers themselves to get genetic information out into the public domain before any one company can call it a secret ad hoc efforts in this regard , including that by the at harvard medical school , have already put an impressive amount of genetic and molecular information into openaccess databases but to make sure no company gets an exclusive hold on human genetic data , we need a datadisclosure effort that reaches critical mass on june 5 , a consortium of 69 organizations in 13 countries made a great stride toward this end , agreeing to facilitate the sharing of dna sequences and clinical information but the effort still needs financing for researchers to work together on technical standards for sharing and interpreting genetic data an annual public investment of just 1 million would be a start research funders like the national institutes of health could induce more institutions to join by asking grantees to abide by standards set by the consortium this would help keep openaccess efforts viable and help make sure no one company is able to keep an essential diagnostic test or treatment out of the public s reach
s o paulo , brazil it has long been a source of unparalleled pride , a common bond uniting a disparate nation , something brazilians could always point to even in times of economic ruin or authoritarian rule that made them the best in the world but these days , , the most successful nation in world cup history , home to legends like pel and ronaldo , is finding little comfort in the beautiful game in the most unexpected of ways , brazil s obsession with soccer has become a potent symbol of what ails the country ever since huge protests began sweeping across brazil this week , demonstrators have taken to the streets by the hundreds of thousands to vent their rage at political leaders of every stripe , at the reign of corruption , at the sorry state of public services the protests have grown so large and disruptive that on friday , brazil s president , dilma rousseff , put forth measures to address some of the grievances but pointing to the billions of dollars spent on stadiums at the expense of basic needs , a growing number of protesters are around the globe to do what would once have seemed unthinkable to boycott the 2014 world cup in brazil in a sign of how thoroughly the country has been turned upside down , even some of the nation s revered soccer heroes have become targets of rage for distancing themselves from the popular uprising pel and ronaldo are making money off the cup with their advertising contracts , but what about the rest of the nation \? asked one protester , gabriela costa , 24 , a university student protesters lambasted both men after pel , whose full name is , called on brazilians to forget the protests and a video circulated on social media showing ronaldo , whose name is ronaldo lu s naz rio de lima , now a television commentator and sports marketing strategist , contending that world cups are accomplished with stadiums , not hospitals with hordes of protesters rallying outside soccer matches , clashing with the police and setting vehicles on fire , fifa , soccer s international governing body , took pains to reassure the world on friday that it had full trust in brazil s ability to provide security and had not considered canceling either the 2014 world cup or the confederations cup , a major international tournament currently taking place in brazil but the fact that soccer officials even had to address the issue was a major embarrassment to brazilian officials , who had fought so hard to land international events like the world cup and the in order to showcase what a stable , democratic power their nation had become now instead of being the culmination of brazil s rise , the events and the enormous expense of hosting them have become a rallying cry for the protesters to show how out of step their government s priorities are with what the people want and need while the government says it is spending more than 13 billion to prepare for the world cup , including related construction projects , most of the stadiums are over budget , according to official findings i love soccer , said arnaldo da silva , 29 , a supervisor at a telecommunications company supervisor , who celebrated back in 2007 when brazil landed the world cup but was also among the protesters in the streets this week , denouncing spending on stadiums when the infrastructure around those structures , like sidewalks , is crumbling it s as if we 're divided between our heart and our head as far back as the 1930s , fans here swelled with pride over the feats of players like le nidas da silva , a striker known as the black diamond who stunned european opponents with remarkably creative plays some brazilian players like s crates , the harddrinking doctor who was captain of brazil s 1982 world cup team , transcended the sport by taking part in the prodemocracy movement against brazil s military dictatorship but while pel has been faulted publicly before for his stance on various issues and for his initial failure to acknowledge an outofwedlock daughter , the level of criticism against him and other soccer figures has changed now brazil s star players , even those speaking favorably of the current wave of protests , are suddenly finding themselves under scrutiny in new ways brazil , wake up , a teacher is worth more than neymar ! thousands of protesters shouted at outside the new stadium built in fortaleza in northeast brazil , referring to the wealth of neymar da silva santos jr , the 21yearold star who recently joined barcelona , the spanish soccer club on the field , the national team finds itself in the doldrums , dropping to a historical low of no 22 in the fifa rankings and at the brazilian football confederation , which oversees the sport in the country , the longtime president , ricardo teixeira , resigned last year he cited health reasons , but he had faced allegations of corruption meanwhile , his successor , jos mar a mar n , 80 , has come under fire over his support for brazil s military dictatorship and being shown on video slipping a medal from a youth tournament into his pocket later , he said the medal was given to him brazil was coming into the preparations for the world cup with a swagger from its growing economic clout , said alex bellos , a briton who has written widely on brazilian soccer but there s the sense now that the sport is beset by various problems , even before the protests erupted in its bid to win the 2007 , rio de janeiro promised it would build a new highway , a monorail and miles of new subway lines , but none of those projects came to fruition the games themselves were over budget , and a number of the venues were so poorly constructed that they are either being knocked down or rebuilt for the olympics the engenh o stadium , built for track and field and then used by botafogo , a rio soccer club , was to be the main venue for the 2016 olympics but that is now in doubt after technicians ruled the roof could collapse in windy weather and ordered it closed i think brazilians are feeling insulted to see that there was political will and large investments to construct big , fifaquality soccer fields , said antonio carlos costa , 51 , a presbyterian pastor and leader of rio de paz , a group that combats social inequalities in brazil and when these stadiums went up , the people saw that there was not the same political will to use public funds to build the same standard of schools , hospitals , and public security outside the s o paulo construction site of a stadium being built for a local team , corinthians , which will also be used for the world cup , ana paula pereira , 36 , a fan and bar owner , was torn by the turn the protests had taken she supported the demands of the demonstrators on the streets but did not think that it made sense to target her beloved team there has to be the world cup , but there also have to be hospitals , she said
washington the on tuesday that federal courts should not automatically suspend postconviction challenges from death row inmates who are mentally incompetent to help their lawyers the decision left open the possibility that such suspensions may sometimes be warranted , but it said that they should not be indefinite where there is no reasonable hope of competence , justice wrote for the court , a stay is inappropriate the supreme court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to put mentally incompetent defendants on trial because they cannot understand the proceedings against them or assist their lawyers the court carrying out a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane tuesday s decision in a pair of cases ryan v gonzales , no 10930 , and tibbals v carter , no 11218 concerned challenges brought after trial and before execution one involved ernest valencia gonzales , who was convicted of stabbing an arizona couple in front of their 7yearold son , killing the father the other concerned sean carter , an ohio man convicted of raping his adoptive grandmother and stabbing her to death by the time the federal courts considered the two men s challenges to their state court convictions , there was substantial evidence that they were mentally incompetent relying on different federal statutes , the appeals courts in the two cases said that the challenges must await their return to mental competence when the cases were , justice said he was concerned that the rulings were a ploy that will permit stays in virtually every capital case because a lot of district judges and a lot of court of appeals judges do n't like the death penalty and will go to some length to prevent the imposition of that sentence in tuesday s decision , justice thomas wrote that postconviction challenges are typically based on the court record , meaning that the inmate would have nothing to add even if he were able to work with his lawyers counsel can generally provide effective representation to a habeas petitioner regardless of the petitioner s competence , justice thomas wrote , adding that attorneys are quite capable of reviewing the statecourt record , identifying legal errors and marshaling relevant arguments , even without their clients' assistance the appeals courts had relied on a curious order from the supreme court in 1967 in , in which the court held without action a request for review from a mentally incompetent death row inmate the court finally in 1995 after his death in prison justice thomas said that procedure set no precedent and that a 1996 federal law in any event altered the legal landscape lawyers for the two inmates did not try very hard to persuade the justices that the appeals courts the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , in san francisco , in and the sixth circuit , in cincinnati , in were correct in interpreting federal statutes to require automatic stays gonzales barely defends the ninth circuit s interpretation , justice thomas wrote he added that we would address carter s arguments in defense of the sixth circuit s decision , but there are none the inmates instead argued that federal trial judges should have discretion to enter stays , and the supreme court agreed we do not presume that district courts need unsolicited advice from us on how to manage their dockets , justice thomas wrote for purposes of resolving these cases , it is unnecessary to determine the precise contours of the district court s discretion to issue stays
lake buena vista , fla for nine years they were nextdoor neighbors on the same stretch of real estate five years on the left side of the infield at the old yankee stadium , four at the new and started 1 , 048 games together at shortstop and third base , the highest total for any teammates at those two positions since bill russell and ron cey started 1 , 249 for the los angeles dodgers from 1972 to 1982 , according to the elias sports bureau but beginning last season , when injuries limited jeter and rodriguez to seven starts together in the field , their reliable side of the infield began to crack and crumble , ushering in a period of doubt and transition whether they will ever play next to each other again remains unclear , and if they do , it will not be for much longer it s difficult , hal steinbrenner , the ' managing general partner , said regarding the uncertain status of both jeter and rodriguez with the 2014 season approaching obviously , it s difficult what makes it especially challenging for the yankees is that they do not know if jeter and rodriguez will be able to play in 120 games at their usual positions next season , or 50 games , or none at all rodriguez is facing the threat of a record 211game suspension in connection with major league baseball s investigation of the biogenesis antiaging clinic , which is suspected of distributing performanceenhancing drugs he is appealing the ban , but the educated guess is that it will be at least partly upheld and that rodriguez , 38 and playing with two surgically repaired hips , could miss much or all of 2014 but the yankees will not know for certain until january , when the arbitrator in the case is likely to rule so for now , the yankees are not sure if they will need a new everyday third baseman , and if they do , how much money they will save by not having to pay rodriguez some or all of his 25 million salary next year jeter is coming off a serious ankle injury that limited him to 17 games in 2013 , and he will be attempting to reestablish himself as an everyday player at 39 and 40 \( his birthday is june 26 \) while occupying the most demanding position on the field other than catcher no matter how confident people are that jeter is the person to pull it off , the yankees will not have much of an inkling of whether he can do it until exhibition games begin in florida nobody is going to work harder than him to get back we know that , steinbrenner said but we wo n't know until spring training there is expert defensive help behind jeter in brendan ryan , but he does not hit much if jeter cannot consistently stay on the field anymore , the yankees will probably have to find another option not currently on the roster all of this leaves general manager in a bind , complicated by the fact that robinson cano has left to join the seattle mariners , leaving cashman unclear as to who his second baseman is should cashman pursue frontline players who will play the bulk of the innings at third and short in anticipation that rodriguez , jeter or both will not be available to , or should he just get backups to fill in \? i do n't know who s playing second , cashman acknowledged i still do n't know who s playing third yet there s going to be a question mark at shortstop , even though we know who the player is but sooner or later , and maybe in a matter of days , cashman will come up with a solution at second base he has to , since there is longer an incumbent shortstop and third base , however , are uncertain jeter is an immensely proud veteran , the team captain , and not likely to welcome being nudged aside at short rodriguez is a walking mystery , a riddle in pinstripes john hart , a former general manager for cleveland and texas and now an analyst on mlb tv , said that cashman was confronted with an unusual challenge and that the only similar situation hart could recall involved who else \? rodriguez in the winter between the 2003 and 2004 seasons , the rangers were trying to unload rodriguez , who was then still playing under his original 10year , 250 million contract the money owed rodriguez made it almost impossible to make a trade first , hart tried sending him to boston when that did not work , hart finally shipped him to the yankees , but not until feb 16 , just as spring training was beginning brian cashman is juggling a lot of balls right now , and it s a very uncomfortable situation , hart said there s no closure yet with alex , and how do you know what you 're getting with derek \? another former general manager , steve phillips , who was with the mets when rodriguez joined the yankees , had a simple solution for cashman sign juan uribe , he said the 34yearold uribe can play short , third and second , which would be the perfect fit but would most likely cost too much money for a yankee team trying to keep its 2014 payroll under the 189 million luxury tax threshold the yankees have also offered a threeyear deal worth roughly 24 million to omar infante to play second base , but he is said to be seeking a fouryear deal , and may get it with kansas city the 31yearold infante has mostly played second in his 12year career , but has also played 225 games at short and 107 at third his versatility might ease cashman s agita the yankees also talked about a trade for brandon phillips , cincinnati s standout second baseman , but would not deal brett gardner straight up for him because phillips is owed 50 million too much for the yankees over the next four seasons according to a person who spoke directly to cashman during the justconcluded winter meetings , the uncertain landscape at short and third is leading him toward adding one or more backup players , like eric chavez and michael young \( the player hart switched to short when he traded rodriguez \) , both of whom could play third base , or mark reynolds , who can play third and first but those players are not solutions at shortstop cashman has already signed a multitask player , kelly johnson , who can play second base or third so maybe he will be asked to do both it s a really tough situation , said jim bowden , another former general manager i 've never seen anything like it , and i would n't know where to even start to address it
london a week before he is to be sworn in as pakistan s prime minister for the third time , nawaz sharif has secured one form of power , yet now faces a fierce battle to find another electricity shortages , bad for years , have reached crisis proportions lights go out for at least 10 hours a day in major cities , and up to 22 hours a day in rural areas as the summer heat pressed in suddenly last week touching 118 degrees fahrenheit in the eastern city of lahore pakistanis again took to the streets to protest the chaotic state of the country s power delivery system doctors and nurses , complaining about lacking clean water and having to cancel operations , blocked traffic or pelted electricity company officials with stones students cannot study for exams , morgues struggle with decomposing bodies , and even the rich complain that their expensive backup generators are straining badly or , in some cases , blowing up from overuse in a bid to quell discontent , pakistan s interim government , which is running the country until mr sharif takes over , has ordered civil servants to switch off their airconditioners and reasoning that sandals were more appropriate in such hot conditions everyone is affected , said iqbal jamil , a heatflustered resident of landhi , a neighborhood in karachi the crisis is the product of multiple factors , from decrepit power plants to crumbling transmission lines to decadesold policy mistakes one reason , however , stands above the others most pakistanis will not pay their bills the system is paralyzed by 5 billion in circular debt basically , a long chain of unpaid bills that cuts across society , from government departments to wealthy politicians to slum dwellers at its worst , this leaves power providers with no funds to pay for fuel , so their plants slow or shut down entirely as a political issue , electricity has galvanized the pakistani public more so , even , than islamist militancy mr sharif swept to victory in the may 11 election in part on the appeal of slogans promising to deliver a shining pakistan and to end the darkness analysts say the question is whether mr sharif has the political backbone to make the tough decisions needed to change the system , particularly as some of his own supporters , along with other rich and powerful pakistanis , are among the bill defaulters who need to start paying their fair share this is not like finding a cure for cancer people know what needs to be done , said robert m hathaway , director of the asia program at the woodrow wilson international center in washington , dc , who has written a book on pakistan s electricity crisis the problem is implementation , and finding the political will the crisis has hit hardest in mr sharif s home province , punjab in kharian , a punjabi town along the historic grand trunk road , malik mazhar iqbal awan , a businessman , fanned himself with a newspaper as beads of sweat rolled down his forehead mr awan owns a small marble factory in the yard outside , a handful of workers sat quietly beside a cutting machine , waiting for the power to return just four years ago , mr awan said , he employed 25 people now he has just six i ca n't pay their salaries , he said , wiping away dust that had blown in through an open window how can i if we can only work a few hours every day \? mr awan said he had voted for mr sharif , a former steel baron , because he was 110 percent sure the candidate could turn the electricity situation around he s an industrialist , he said he thinks differently than the others although easing the 5 billion circular debt is the principal problem , experts say money is only part of the solution deeprooted structural issues , exacerbated by political interference and systemic graft , lie at the heart of pakistan s power crisis electricity theft , by rich and poor , is common slum dwellers steal power through illegal connections powerful politicians and government departments simply refuse to pay their bills electricity officials and the police , fearing retribution , dare not cut them off corruption is notorious in the private power sector , where political supporters win lucrative contracts , often at inflated costs or without even producing a megawatt of power in 2011 the auditor general noted that the government had committed to 17 billion in such contracts , yet added just 62 megawatts to the national power grid one prominent candidate in this election raja pervez ashraf , the country s last prime minister has been closely identified with the power crisis after he lost his parliamentary seat in a crushing defeat , officials with the national anticorruption body stepped in , summoning mr ashraf last week to answer accusations that he had taken kickbacks worth tens of millions of dollars from foreign companies on power projects even those supposed to be enforcing the law are breaking it at one police station in sindh province , officers erected an illegal power connection for their airconditioners in other areas , electricity company officials are afraid to disconnect defaulters for fear of attack about 20 percent of the electricity supply disappears across the country , and up to 33 percent in the worstaffected district , as a result of dilapidated transmission lines or outright theft , said fariel salahuddin , a power sector consultant the fastest way to improve things is to start collecting bills and come down hard on theft , she said that s easier said than done , though the crisis is exacting an economic toll equivalent to at least 4 percent of the country s gross domestic product , according to economists greater than the estimated economic cost of the taliban insurgency at the same time , government policy is a shambles decisionmaking is centered in the notoriously corrupt energy ministry no major new power plant has been built for decades , and the existing ones are falling into disrepair as a result , pakistan relies heavily on expensive furnace oil imports there is complete disarray between all entities involved , said a report on the power crisis that was commissioned by the national planning commission last march in the short term , mr sharif will seek to salve his power woes by trying to find foreign cash or fuel to get dormant power stations back on line his officials have suggested that saudi arabia , a country that mr sharif enjoys close relations with , on favorable terms but oil and money can provide only temporary relief , and mr sharif may also seek other foreign assistance to tackle the structural problems some in the face of opposition from the united states last week premier , li keqiang , to provide pakistan with help in building a civilian nuclear power plant that was widely seen as an indirect rebuff to the united states , which offered similar help to pakistan s rival , india , in 2006 a source of enduring resentment in pakistan similarly , president asif ali zardari signed a deal with iran last year to run a gas pipeline across the border to pakistan but the project would run afoul of united nations sanctions on iran penalties that were championed by washington the united states , for its part , has spent 225 million since 2009 in refurbishing pakistan s decrepit hydroelectric power plants , adding 900 megawatts to the national grid american officials are also working with the government to improve revenue collection but largescale infrastructure projects , like new hydroelectric dams , take years to come to fruition and international donors are reluctant to commit further funds without signs of strong reform from pakistan s political leadership pakistan s leaders know they are running out of time other countries also face crippling electricity shortages , of course , in parts of the middle east or subsaharan africa but none of those nations possess nuclear weapons , or such a rapidly growing population as pakistan , estimated at 180 million people population growth alone is adding 1 , 000 megawatts per year to the country s electricity needs , said mr hathaway of the wilson center we americans also like to defer tough decisions , he said , referring to contentious and expensive reforms in education and social welfare but pakistanis are approaching a point where they no longer have that luxury

when i was in middle school , i read margaret mitchell s epic romance , gone with the wind not once not twice but continuously each time i finished the novel , i began again , flipping open the brokenspined paperback so many times the book split in half , yielding two portable sections of text i preferred a break of at least several hours between readings , but sometimes compulsion forced me to begin again only moments after finishing it i told myself that i could resist , that i d read some other book , some real book , that i could read on the couch in front of family members without raising eyebrows for my parents , it was the repetitive reading of a single text that seemed deranged , and for my brothers it was reading such an enormous tome in the first place , but my own sense of shame arose from my deep ambivalence about the novel itself even then , i knew that reading gone with the wind was not transformative that its portrayal of romantic love as the only prize worth having was wrong that the book presented a distorted view of womanhood my obsession was based purely on titillation , the excitement of following the fatally flawed scarlett o hara through her breathless , wartorn , starvationmarked pursuit of love gone with the wind was my twilight series at the same time , the book was also a repository for all my adolescent loathing , of both self and others the beginning section represented everything i hated about middle school scarlett was the perfect standin for my arch enemy , a girl who resembled her in each particular greeneyed , brunette and brutal the first line of the novel dazzled me with its concise encapsulation of a distinct feminine mystery scarlett o hara was not beautiful , but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the tarleton twins were how could this be \? this was the central question of middle school how could the most vital fact of female existence were you a beautiful girl or not \? be surpassed by mere will \? scarlett o hara controlled male perception she created her own reality she was a genius she was also a slave owner when scarlett returns home after the war , she is aghast that any of the family s slaves had run off , and the reader , who wants scarlett to survive so she can get on with the essential work of pursuing ashley wilkes and succumbing to rhett butler , is forced into the uncomfortable moral position of empathizing with her in other words , the end of human bondage in america is a subordinate concern to whether or not scarlett is able to use her charms to get the man she wants \( despite the frustrating fact that you know from the moment you are introduced to the principal characters that rhett is the right man for scarlett and ashley is utterly wrong ! why then read on \? why then the obsession \? \) because , in the world of gone with the wind , romantic thinking trumps everything , including war , civility , morality , starvation and childbirth the book amazed me with the grandeur of its delusion it also made me guilty , perhaps above all because reading gone with the wind made me feel that a part of myself might be like scarlett , that i , too , might be capable of caring about the wrong things in life , so long as i was loved by a man i finally put aside gone with the wind once i entered high school , and discovered goodbye , columbus , slaughterhouse five and the dizzying complications of actual teenage boys years later , when one of my brothers bought me a commemorative edition of the novel , i sulkily stashed it in a dark corner how , i wondered , could anyone who knew me well think that i d wish to be reminded , would treasure , an artifact of such a shameful episode in my literary explorations \? and so i forgot about gone with the wind until recently , when i was talking with a friend about our daughters \( now in middle school themselves \) , and their fascination with impossibly lengthy , endlessly repetitive supernatural romances i casually mentioned my romantic epic of choice , and it occurred to me that gone with the wind was in fact the ultimate young adult novel the choice between two starkly different lovers \( one gentlemanly , one roguish \) appears , for the very young , to be a choice between two utterly distinct potential identities , two possible roads through life i realized then that i was , for the first time , outside that romantic paradigm i am getting a divorce , and so i am now on my own path , rewriting my life s narrative to include that most modern of twists interruption in my darker moments , it feels as though time itself has stopped having been married for nearly 18 years , i find it hard to imagine exactly how one day unfolds into the next outside the dynamics of coupledom i can t help but be reminded of the one part in gone with the wind that i routinely used to skim the postwar section , in which scarlett is married to the pathetic frank , whom she stole from her own sister this is the one loveless section in the book , when scarlett cares more about food , shelter and money than she does about either rhett or ashley it is the one moment when real life appears as more than a set piece for the conjured world of love it is scarlett s reality test the suspension of the girldream of romance as the core of one s being but perhaps thankfully this section doesn t last in the end , it does not matter that scarlett s true love scorns her , so long as the reader knows that love exists and that scarlett will continue to pursue it talking about the book with my friend over lunch , i felt no rekindled desire to read it but i did feel a fondness for the girl who had done so those many times over an admiration for the adolescent voraciousness that compelled me to search again and again in the same place for resolution to a story i knew had none i realize now that this youthful tenacity might be a source of strength i need again to draw on although i am a mother and a mature , single woman , newly awakened to the perils of love and the demands of reality , i can t deny in myself a scarlettish sensibility , the drive to believe that there is in the idea of tomorrow another story line worthy of pursuit , something dazzling to ponder , if never quite possess this almost redeems the book for me today it is a romance grounded in absence and error its end is a beginning , not of an idealized life , but of pursuit and desire it is a thousandandsomepage proof of the human need to seek love it is the young adult novel i am now too experienced and humbled to scorn claire needell is an english teacher at a public middle school in manhattan and the author of the forthcoming collection of short stories for young adults nothing real
for viktor frankl , the holocaust survivor who wrote the bestselling book man s search for meaning , the call to answer life s ultimate question came early when he was a high school student , one of his science teachers declared to the class , life is nothing more than a combustion process , a process of oxidation but frankl would have none of it sir , if this is so , he cried , jumping out of his chair , then what can be the meaning of life \? the teenage frankl made this statement nearly a hundred years ago but he had more in common with today s young people than we might assume today s young adults born after 1980 , known as generation y or the millennial generation , are the most educated generation in american history and , like the baby boomers , one of the largest yet since the great recession of 2008 , they have been having a hard time they are facing one of the worst job markets in decades they are in debt many of them are unemployed the income gap between old and young americans is widening to give you a sense of their lot , when you search are millennials in google , the search options that come up include are millennials selfish , are millennials lazy , and are millennials narcissistic do we have a lost generation on our hands \? in our classes , among our peers , and through our research , we are seeing that millennials are not so much a lost generation as a generation in flux chastened by these tough economic times , today s young adults have been forced to rethink success so that it s less about material prosperity and more about something else and what is that something else \? many researchers believe that millennials are focusing more on happiness than prior generations , and that the younger ones in that age cohort are doing so even more than the older ones who did not take the brunt of the recession rather than chasing the money , they appear to want a career that makes them happy a job that combines the perks of google with the flexibility of a startup but a closer look at the data paints a slightly different picture millennials appear to be more interested in living lives defined by meaning than by what some would call happiness they report being less focused on financial success than they are on making a difference a 2011 report commissioned by the career advisory board and conducted by harris interactive , found that the no 1 factor that young adults ages 21 to 31 wanted in a successful career was a sense of meaning though their managers , according to the study , continue to think that millennials are primarily motivated by money , nearly threequarters of the young adults surveyed said that meaningful work was among the three most important factors defining career success meaning , of course , is a mercurial concept but it s one that social scientists have made real progress understanding and measuring in recent years social psychologists define meaning as a cognitive and emotional assessment of the degree to which we feel our lives have purpose , value and impact in our joint research , we are looking closely at what the building blocks of a meaningful life are although meaning is subjective signifying different things to different people a defining feature is connection to something bigger than the self people who lead meaningful lives feel connected to others , to work , to a life purpose , and to the world itself there is no one meaning of life , but rather , many sources of meaning that we all experience day to day , moment to moment , in the form of these connections it s also important to understand what meaning is not having a sense of meaning is not the same as feeling happy in a new longitudinal study done by one of us , jennifer l aaker , with roy f baumeister , kathleen d vohs and emily n garbinsky , 397 americans were followed over a monthlong period and asked the degree to which they considered their lives to be meaningful and happy , as well as beliefs and values they held , and what type of choices they had made in their lives it turns out that people can reliably assess the extent to which their lives have meaning , much in the same way that people can assess their degree of life satisfaction or happiness although a meaningful life and a happy life overlap in certain ways , they are ultimately quite different those who reported having a meaningful life saw themselves as more otheroriented by being , more specifically , a giver people who said that doing things for others was important to them reported having more meaning in their lives this was in stark contrast to those who reported having a happy life happiness was associated with being more selforiented by being a taker people felt happy , in a superficial sense , when they got what they wanted , and not necessarily when they put others first , which can be stressful and requires sacrificing what you want for what others want having children , for instance , is associated with high meaning but lower happiness when individuals adopt what we call a meaning mindset that is , they seek connections , give to others , and orient themselves to a larger purpose clear benefits can result , including improved psychological wellbeing , more creativity , and enhanced work performance workers who find their jobs meaningful are more engaged and less likely to leave their current positions further , this mindset affects what types of careers millennials search for today s young adults are hoping to go into careers that make an enduring impact on others last spring , when the national society of high school scholars , a global honor society for high school students , asked more than 9 , 000 top students and recent graduates what they wanted to do with their lives , they found that these recessionera millennials favored careers in health care and government of the top 25 companies they wanted to pursue out of a list of more than 200 , eight were in health care or at hospitals while six were in government or the military st jude children s research hospital came in as the no 1 place these millennials wanted to work the focus on helping others is what millennials are responding to , james w lewis , the chief executive of the honor society , told forbes some studies have suggested that millennials are narcissistic and flaky in their professional and personal lives , and are more selfish than prior generations but new data suggests that these negative trends are starting to reverse in a study published this summer in the journal social psychological and personality science , the researchers heejung park , jean m twenge and patricia m greenfield looked at surveys that have , each year since the 1970s , tracked the attitudes of hundreds of thousands of 12th graders although concern for others had been decreasing among high school seniors and certain markers of materialism like valuing expensive products such as cars had been increasing for nearly four decades , these trends began to reverse after 2008 whereas older millennials showed a concern for meaning , the younger millennials who came of age during the great recession started reporting more concern for others and less interest in material goods this data reflects a broader pattern between 1976 and 2010 , high school seniors expressed more concern for others during times of economic hardship , and less concern for others during times of economic prosperity during times of hardship , young people more frequently look outward to others and the world at large of course , nobody likes living through tough economic times and the millennials have been dealt a tough hand but at the same time , there are certain benefits to economic deprivation millennials have been forced to reconsider what a successful life constitutes by focusing on making a positive difference in the lives of others , rather than on more materialistic markers of success , they are setting themselves up for the meaningful life they yearn to have the very thing that frankl realized makes life worth living
cairo one washed towels in a barbershop the other sold fast food some nights , they would grab the microphones at outdoor weddings and try out raps they had written , only to earn a hail of stones now they are among the fastestrising stars in , the arab world s most populous nation and its largest music market under the names okka and ortega , they play sprawling shows in egypt and abroad in just a few years , these and other young musicians have created a new genre of youthdriven , socially conscious music and forced it on the egyptian soundscape their music predated the political revolution in february 2011 , and most of the musicians did not join the uprising in tahrir square but the turmoil since has left egypt s huge youth population searching for voices that address issues they care about half of egypt s 85 million people are under 25 , and many found what they were looking for in the raucous , defiant new music known as mahraganat , arabic for festivals the songs' addictive beats helped , too we made music that would make people dance but would also talk about their worries , said alaa aldin abdelrahman , 23 , better known as alaa 50 cent that way everyone would listen and hear what was on their minds the music is a rowdy blend of traditional egyptian wedding music , american hiphop and whatever else its creators can download for free online the singing is fast , often improvised and heavily doctored with autotune the songs have racked up millions of views on and have won their creators international shows and appearances in arab films and television commercials in cairo , their sound is everywhere , blasting from taxis , rocking boats on the nile and jangling from cellphones the music s swift rise from the alleys of neglected cairo neighborhoods to car stereos and highclass weddings and even television commercials reflects the profound shifts in egyptian society since the revolution more people are looking for open discussion of social issues and willing to reach across class lines to find it like the revolution , the music came from young people who looked at their lives and did not see much to look forward to so they made noise , spread their ideas through social media and were surprised by the results mr abdelrahman and his partner , the singer sadat abdelaziz , 26 , grew up in the cairo neighborhood of medinat alsalam , a poor , drugridden district of rundown apartment buildings the pair have always had two musical goals , they said , to talk about life in their neighborhood and to make people dance i could sing at a street party , dancing , but touch on the situation that i am in and that we all feel , mr abdelaziz said on a recent evening , standing in the trashstrewn , unpaved lane leading to his apartment , his long braids tied behind his head in 2008 , the pair teamed up with a shy young man named amr muhammad , who had a knack for manipulating sound with pirated software now a soughtafter sound guru known as amr haha , he is widely credited as one of the prime creators of the mahraganat sound the group s early songs dealt with hashish , sex , friendship and deception , not politics that changed when the antimubarak uprising erupted in january 2011 , and mr abdelaziz sang a song called  the people and the government , the machine guns and clubs egypt rose up , and even those who did n't steal dove into it i 'll talk about those standing , the survivors and the dead i 'll talk about the church , the mosque and the brotherhood young revolutionaries , seeking a soundtrack to their movement , sought them out they were soon invited to perform abroad and at fancier egyptian locations they have since tackled other social issues , often with a healthy dose of mischief when sexual harassment and abuse became an issue at street protests , they addressed the subject , perhaps not as women s groups would have liked , with a song called  and as egypt s economy slowed , they subverted the famous protest chant the people want the fall of the regime with a more worldly demand \( five egyptian pounds is about 70 cents \) the rise of a musical style considered the domain of the poor has surprised many , including mr abdelaziz s neighbors , though they understand the appeal people found something new in the music , said ayman abu bilal , 41 , a butcher who watched mr abdelaziz grow up you do n't understand threefourths of the lyrics , but then you hear a something good and realize the whole song relates to you arab popular music has long been dominated by beautiful stars who croon about love and heartbreak and market themselves with music videos shot in luxurious settings that many egyptians will never visit mina girgis , an egyptian ethnomusicologist , said that left a wide opening after the revolution for music more in touch with its audience i'm not going to listen to cheesy pop songs when people are dying , but i will listen to songs about social problems , he said so there was a void and people were looking for a sound that echoed what they were living groups in other genres , like folk and rock , have also addressed social issues , but lack the mass appeal of mahraganat some critics find the rise of mahraganat indicative of a societal decline since the revolution may god end my life , said hilmy bakr , a prominent member of the musicians' syndicate , raising his voice until his face turned red how do people know the society is crumbling \? when these songs become best sellers of the new stars , none have risen higher and infuriated mr bakr more than okka and ortega the pair , whose real names are muhammad salah and ahmed mustafa , started out as rappers , writing rhymes about their neighborhood and paying by the hour to record on computers in internet cafes they made their first mahraganat song as a joke and were surprised when it spread soon after , a cart blasting the song passed them on the street , and they chased down the driver to tell him it was theirs he thought they were joking , they said they bought a computer for 400 so they could record at home , and they put their names in their so no other singers could steal it two more of their songs went viral , so they hired a manager , stopped doing street weddings and started singing for commercials so far , they have recorded songs for an egyptian , a frozen food line called and an egyptian version of viagra , known as the golden box while early on they flaunted their underclass credentials , they have since changed on a recent night in their modest studio , they bragged of things to come an album and music video on june 1 , trips to the united states and elsewhere later this year , and a commercial for hair gel we need to take this music to the whole world and tell those who used to insult us that we are not doing something stupid , mr mustafa said i want to walk down the red carpet , mr salah said , strutting across the room and waving to an imaginary crowd i'm okka !
